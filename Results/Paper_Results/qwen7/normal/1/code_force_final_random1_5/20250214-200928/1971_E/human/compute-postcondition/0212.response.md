Output State: **`i` is 1, `l` is 2, `m` is 0, we continue the loop.**

The `continue` statement causes the flow of execution to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move directly to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by the `continue` statement, their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
