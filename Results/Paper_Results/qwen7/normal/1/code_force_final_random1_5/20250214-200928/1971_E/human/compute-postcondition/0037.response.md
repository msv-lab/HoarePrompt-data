Output State: **`q` is equal to `len(a)`, `m` is 0, `i` is 1, `s` is the index of the leftmost occurrence of `ql` in sorted list `a`.**

Explanation: The code `s = bisect_left(a, ql)` uses the `bisect_left` function from the `bisect` module to find the insertion point for `ql` in the sorted list `a`. This insertion point is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to `ql`. The value of `s` is assigned the result of this operation. The other variables (`q`, `m`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
