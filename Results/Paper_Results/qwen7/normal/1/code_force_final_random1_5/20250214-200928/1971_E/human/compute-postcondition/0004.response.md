Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `k`, and `q` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers obtained from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code creates a new list `b` that starts with 0 and is filled with integers obtained from the input, which are then converted to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `q`, `a`, and the original input for `b` remain unchanged.
