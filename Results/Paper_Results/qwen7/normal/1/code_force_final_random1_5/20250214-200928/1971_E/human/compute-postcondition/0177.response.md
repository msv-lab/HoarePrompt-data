Output State: **`i` is 2; `v` contains the values of `ad[2] / bd[2]` and `ad[1] / bd[1]`**.

Explanation: Initially, `i` is 1. The code `v.append(ad[i] / bd[i])` appends the value of `ad[i] / bd[i]` to the list `v`. Since `i` is 1 at this point, `v` will contain the value of `ad[1] / bd[1]`. After appending, `i` is incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2. At this point, `v` will contain the values of `ad[2] / bd[2]` and `ad[1] / bd[1]`.
