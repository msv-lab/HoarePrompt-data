You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Timur is in a car traveling on the number line from point 0 to point n . The
car starts moving from point 0 at minute 0 .

There are k+1 signs on the line at points 0, a_1, a_2, \dots, a_k , and Timur
knows that the car will arrive there at minutes 0, b_1, b_2, \dots, b_k ,
respectively. The sequences a and b are strictly increasing with a_k = n .

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/eaf3bfb8e7a8fa4f5e8673f9a02116761cb86c93.png)

Between any two adjacent signs, the car travels with a constant speed. Timur
has q queries: each query will be an integer d , and Timur wants you to output
how many minutes it takes the car to reach point d , rounded down to the
nearest integer.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , k , and q , (k
\leq n \leq 10^9 ; 1 \leq k, q \leq 10^5 ) — the final destination, the number
of points Timur knows the time for, and the number of queries respectively.

The second line of each test case contains k integers a_i (1 \leq a_i \leq n ;
a_i < a_{i+1} for every 1 \leq i \leq k-1 ; a_k = n ).

The third line of each test case contains k integers b_i (1 \leq b_i \leq 10^9
; b_i < b_{i+1} for every 1 \leq i \leq k-1 ).

Each of the following q lines contains a single integer d (0 \leq d \leq n ) —
the distance that Timur asks the minutes passed for.

The sum of k over all test cases doesn't exceed 10^5 , and the sum of q over
all test cases doesn't exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each query, output a single integer — the number of minutes passed until
the car reaches the point d , rounded down.

Note

For the first test case, the car goes from point 0 to point 10 in 10 minutes,
so the speed is 1 unit per minute and:

  * At point 0 , the time will be 0 minutes. 
  * At point 6 , the time will be 6 minutes. 
  * At point 7 , the time will be 7 minutes. 

For the second test case, between points 0 and 4 , the car travels at a speed
of 1 unit per minute and between 4 and 10 with a speed of 2 units per minute
and:

  * At point 6 , the time will be 5 minutes. 
  * At point 4 , the time will be 4 minutes. 
  * At point 2 , the time will be 2 minutes. 
  * At point 7 , the time will be 5.5 minutes, so the answer is 5 . 

For the fourth test case, the car travels with 1.2 units per minute, so the
answers to the queries are:

  * At point 2 , the time will be 1.66\dots minutes, so the answer is 1 . 
  * At point 6 , the time will be 5 minutes. 
  * At point 5 , the time will be 4.16\dots minutes, so the answer is 4 .

    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, the following conditions will be true:
    #
    #- The variable `l` will be set to `q - 1`.
    #- The variable `i` will remain 1 throughout the loop.
    #- The variable `m` will contain the final cumulative sum after processing all inputs. This sum starts with `b[s - 1]` and adds the scaled values from `bd[s]` for each iteration, calculated as `bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s]`.
    #- The list `v` will be a list of length `len(a)` where the first element is `0` and the rest are the results of dividing corresponding elements of `ad` by `bd`.
    #- The variable `t` will be unchanged, representing the number of test cases.
    #- The lists `a` and `b` will retain their original values after processing all queries.
    #- The variable `ad` and `bd` will contain the differences between consecutive elements of `a` and `b`, respectively, up to the last valid index.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, `l` will be `q-1`, `i` will stay as 1, `m` will hold the final calculated value after processing all inputs, `v` will contain the ratios of differences, and `a`, `b`, `ad`, and `bd` will keep their processed values but will not change further within the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the query point `d` falls exactly between two known points `a_i` and `a_{i+1}`. Specifically, the program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the position `s` where `d` would fit in the sorted list `a`, but it does not correctly calculate the time for points that fall exactly between `a[s-1]` and `a[s]`. This can lead to incorrect results because the speed between these points is not accounted for properly.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
10 1 1
10
10
5
```
The program should output `5` because the car travels at a constant speed of 1 unit per minute. However, the current implementation might output `4` or another incorrect value because it does not correctly interpolate the time for points between known speeds.

To fix this, the program needs to handle the interpolation between known speeds more accurately.
