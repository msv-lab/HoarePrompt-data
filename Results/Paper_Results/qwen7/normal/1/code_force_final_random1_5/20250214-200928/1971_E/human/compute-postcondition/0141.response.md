Postcondition: `l` is within the range `[1, a[s - 1] - 1)`, `m` is 0, `i` is 1, `ql` is an input integer, `s` is the index where the new value of `ql` would be inserted to keep the list `a` sorted, and if `a[s] == ql`, the value of `m` remains 0, `i` remains 1, and `ql` is equal to `a[s]`. If `a[s] != ql`, the conditions remain as initially described.
