Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `l` is 2.
   - `m` is defined as `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s]`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The statement to be executed is `print(int(m), end=' ')`.

To determine what will be printed, we need to understand the expression for `m`:
- `b[s - 1]`: This is the element at index `s - 1` in the list `b`.
- `bd[s]`: This is the element at index `s` in the list `bd`.
- `ql`: This is a variable whose value is not explicitly given.
- `a[s - 1]`: This is the element at index `s - 1` in the list `a`.
- `ad[s]`: This is the element at index `s` in the list `ad`.

Since the values of `b`, `bd`, `a`, `ad`, and `ql` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `m`. However, we know that `m` is an expression involving these variables.

Therefore, the print statement will output the integer value of `m` followed by a space.

Output: **int(b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s])**
