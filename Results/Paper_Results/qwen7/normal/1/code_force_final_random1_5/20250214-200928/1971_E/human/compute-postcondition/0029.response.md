Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `v` is a list with three elements.
   - The first two elements of `v` are the results of `ad[1] / bd[1]` and `ad[2] / bd[2]`.
   - The third element of `v` is `ad[2] / bd[2]`.

2. **Loop Head Analysis:**
   - The loop is defined as `for i in range(1, len(a)):`.
   - This means the loop starts from `i = 1` and goes up to `len(a) - 1`.

3. **Current Iteration End State:**
   - Since the loop starts from `i = 1`, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would be `2` (since it increments by 1 each time).

4. **Next Iteration Start State:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to `3`.
   - Therefore, `i` will be `3` at the start of the next iteration.

5. **Adjusting States:**
   - The only variable in the loop head that changes with each iteration is `i`.
   - There are no other variables mentioned in the loop head that change or are relevant to the loop condition.

6. **Final State for Next Iteration:**
   - At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `3`.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`v` is a list with three elements, the first two elements are the results of `ad[1] / bd[1]` and `ad[2] / bd[2]`, and the third element is `ad[2] / bd[2]`, `i` is 3**
