Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n`, `k`, `q` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `ad` is a list containing `len(a) - 1` elements where each element is calculated as `a[i] - a[i - 1]` for \(i\) from 1 to `len(a) - 1`, `bd` is a list containing two elements where the first element is 0 and the second element is `b[i] - b[i - 1]`, `i` is 2, `len(a)` is greater than 1, and `len(b)` is greater than 1.**

Explanation: The code appends `b[i] - b[i - 1]` to the list `bd`. Since `bd` initially contained only one element (which was 0), after appending, `bd` now contains two elements: the first element remains 0, and the second element is `b[i] - b[i - 1]`. Additionally, since `i` was initially 1, after the append operation, `i` is incremented to 2.
