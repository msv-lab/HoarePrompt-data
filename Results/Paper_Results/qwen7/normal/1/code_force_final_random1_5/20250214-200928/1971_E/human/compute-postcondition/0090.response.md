Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, len(b)):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i`.

2. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is within the range defined by `range(1, len(b))`. This means `i` must be less than `len(b)`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `i` is 2.
   - `bd` is a list containing the value `b[1] - b[0]`.

4. **Next iteration requirements**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 from its current value of 2.
   - Therefore, `i` should be 3.
   - The variable `bd` does not change within the loop head, so it remains the same.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` needs to be adjusted to 3.
   - `bd` remains unchanged.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is 3, `bd` is a list containing the value `b[1] - b[0]`**
