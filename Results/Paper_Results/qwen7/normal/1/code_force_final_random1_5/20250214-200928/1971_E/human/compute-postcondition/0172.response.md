Output State: **`v` contains the value of `ad[i] / bd[i]`, `ad` and `bd` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code appends the result of dividing `ad[i]` by `bd[i]` to the list `v`. However, the initial values of `ad` and `bd` are not specified, so they remain unchanged. The list `v` now includes the new calculated value.
