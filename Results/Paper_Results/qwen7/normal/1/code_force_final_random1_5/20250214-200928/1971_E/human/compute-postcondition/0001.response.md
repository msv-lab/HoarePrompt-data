Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable here is `t`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is an integer and its range is given as \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the loop will definitely execute because `t` cannot be 0 or negative.

3. **Adjust the state**: The initial state is that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0, which is already satisfied by the given range.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the state of `t` to ensure the loop can execute.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
