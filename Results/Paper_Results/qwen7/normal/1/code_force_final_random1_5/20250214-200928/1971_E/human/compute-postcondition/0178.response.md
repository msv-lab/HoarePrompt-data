Output State: **`v` contains the values of `ad[i] / bd[i]` for every `i` from 1 to `len(a) - 1`, and `ad` and `bd` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = len(a) - 1`. For each iteration, the value of `ad[i] / bd[i]` is appended to the list `v`. Since the loop runs for every valid index `i` (from 1 to `len(a) - 1`), `v` will contain one element for each such `i`. The variables `ad` and `bd` remain unchanged as per the problem statement.
