Output State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n`, `k`, and `q` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `ad` is a list containing `len(a) - 1` elements where each element is calculated as `a[i] - a[i - 1]` for \(i\) from 1 to `len(a) - 1`, `bd` is a list containing only one element which is 0, `i` is `len(a)`, `len(a)` is greater than 1.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `ad` will contain the differences between consecutive elements of the list `a`, starting from the second element of `a`. The length of `ad` will be one less than the length of `a`. The variable `i` will be equal to the length of `a`, and all other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `q`, `b`, `bd`) will remain in their initial states.
