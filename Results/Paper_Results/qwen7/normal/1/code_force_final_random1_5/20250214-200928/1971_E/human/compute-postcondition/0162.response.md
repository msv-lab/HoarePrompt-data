Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `range(1, len(b))`.

2. **Determine the initial value of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` set to 1 (since the range starts from 1).

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(b)`.

4. **Identify the variables that need adjustment**: The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `i`. The other variables (`bd`, `v`, `t`, `n`, `k`, and `q`) are not mentioned in the loop head and therefore do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

5. **Adjust the state**: Since the loop starts with `i` set to 1, and the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(b)`, the initial state of `i` should be 1, and `len(b)` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute.

6. **Consider the final state of `ad`**: After the loop completes, `ad` will contain the differences between consecutive elements of `a`, starting from the second element. However, this information is not needed to determine the initial state for the loop to execute.

Given the above steps, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

State: **`i` is 1, `len(b)` must be greater than 1**
