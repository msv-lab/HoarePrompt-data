Output State: **`i` is within the range [1, len(a)), `bd` contains the differences between each consecutive pair of elements in `b`, starting from the second element of `b`, and `v` is a list containing two elements: 0 and ad[i] / bd[i]**.

Explanation: The code `v.append(ad[i] / bd[i])` appends the value of `ad[i] / bd[i]` to the list `v`. Initially, `v` contains a single element, which is 0. After executing the code, `v` now contains two elements: the original 0 and the new value `ad[i] / bd[i]`. The variables `i`, `bd`, and `ad` remain unchanged from their initial states.
