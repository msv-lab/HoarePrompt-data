Output State: **`l` is a value within the range [0, `ql`), `m` is 0, `i` is 1, `ql` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `ql = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `ql`. The value of `l` is now within the range `[0, ql)`, while `m` remains 0 and `i` remains 1. The value of `ql` is specifically the integer input provided by the user.
