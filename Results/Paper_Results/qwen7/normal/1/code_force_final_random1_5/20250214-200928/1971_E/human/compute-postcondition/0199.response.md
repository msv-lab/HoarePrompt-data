Output State: **`i` is 1, `l` is 1, `m` is 0, we continue the loop.**

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to the variables `i`, `l`, or `m`, their values remain the same. The only effect is that the loop will continue to the next iteration.
