Output State: **`ad` has had its last element appended with the value `a[i] - a[i - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` to the list `ad`. Since the initial values of `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` are not specified, the output state only indicates that the difference has been appended to the list `ad`.
