Postcondition: `l` is within the range `[0, int(input()) - a[s - 1] - 1)`, `m` is 0, `i` is 2, `ql` is decreased by `a[s - 1]` and is now `int(input())`, `s` is the index where the new value of `ql` would be inserted to keep the list `a` sorted, and `s` is assigned the value of the bisect_left(a, ql). If `a[s] == ql`, the condition holds as is; otherwise, the condition also holds as there is no else part changing the state.
