Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n`, `k`, `q` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `ad` is a list containing `len(a) - 1` elements where each element is calculated as `a[i] - a[i - 1]` for \(i\) from 1 to `len(a) - 1`, `bd` is a list containing `len(b) - 1` elements where the first element is 0 and the rest are calculated as `b[i] - b[i - 1]` for \(i\) from 1 to `len(b) - 1`, `i` is `len(b) + 1`, `len(a)` is greater than 1, and `len(b)` is greater than 1; `v` is a list containing one element which is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(a)):
    v.append(ad[i] / bd[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `v` is a list with one additional element which is the result of `ad[i] / bd[i]`, `ad` and `bd` are lists with indices i that are used for division.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `v` is a list with three elements, the first two elements are the results of `ad[1] / bd[1]` and `ad[2] / bd[2]`, and the third element is `ad[2] / bd[2]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `v` is a list with four elements: the first element is `ad[1] / bd[1]`, the second element is `ad[2] / bd[2]`, the third element is `ad[2] / bd[2]`, and the fourth element is `ad[3] / bd[3]`, `i` is 4.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
