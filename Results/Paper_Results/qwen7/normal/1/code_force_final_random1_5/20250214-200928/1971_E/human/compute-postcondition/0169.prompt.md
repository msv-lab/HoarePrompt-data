Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `ad` is a list containing the differences between consecutive elements of `a`, starting from the second element to the end. The values of `i`, `bd`, `v`, `t`, `n`, `k`, and `q` remain unchanged from their initial or previous states.

In more detail, after the loop completes all its iterations, `ad` will contain the sequence of differences between each pair of consecutive elements in `a`, starting from the second element. Specifically, `ad[0]` will be `a[1] - a[0]`, `ad[1]` will be `a[2] - a[1]`, and so on until the last element which will be `a[len(a) - 1] - a[len(a) - 2]`. The values of `i`, `bd`, `v`, `t`, `n`, `k`, and `q` will retain their values from after the third iteration, as they are not modified within the loop.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(b)):
    bd.append(b[i] - b[i - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 2; `bd` is a list with one element equal to `b[1] - b[0]`; `len(b)` must be greater than 1

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 3; `bd` is a list with two elements, where the first element is `b[1] - b[0]` and the second element is `b[3] - b[2]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 4; `bd` is a list with three elements, where the first element is `b[1] - b[0]`, the second element is `b[3] - b[2]`, and the third element is `b[4] - b[3]`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
