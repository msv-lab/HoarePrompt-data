Output State: **`i` is 2, `bd` is a list containing the value `b[1] - b[0]`.**

Explanation: The code `bd.append(b[i] - b[i - 1])` appends the difference between `b[i]` and `b[i - 1]` to the list `bd`. Given that `i` is initially 1, `i - 1` is 0, so `bd` now contains the value `b[1] - b[0]`. Also, since `i` was incremented (implied by the context of the loop), its new value is 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
