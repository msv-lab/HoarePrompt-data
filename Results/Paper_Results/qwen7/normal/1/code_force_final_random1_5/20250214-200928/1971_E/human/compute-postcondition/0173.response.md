Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, len(a)):`. The variables involved in this loop head are `i`.

2. **Understand the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `v` contains the value of `ad[i] / bd[i]`.
   - `ad` and `bd` remain unchanged.

3. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: The loop will continue if `i` is within the range specified by `range(1, len(a))`. This means `i` must be less than `len(a)`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was one less than its value for the next iteration. Therefore, if `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then for the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`.

5. **Calculate the new value of `v`**: For the next iteration, `v` will now contain the value of `ad[i+1] / bd[i+1]`.

Given these steps, let's formulate the new state:

- `v` will now contain the value of `ad[i+1] / bd[i+1]`.
- `ad` and `bd` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `v` contains the value of `ad[i+1] / bd[i+1]`, `ad` and `bd` remain unchanged.**
