Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n`, `k`, `q` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `ad` is a list containing `len(a) - 1` elements where each element is calculated as `a[i] - a[i - 1]` for \(i\) from 1 to `len(a) - 1`, `bd` is a list containing `len(b) - 1` elements where the first element is 0 and the rest are calculated as `b[i] - b[i - 1]` for \(i\) from 1 to `len(b) - 1`, `i` is `len(b)`, `len(a)` is greater than 1, and `len(b)` is greater than 1.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the range `1` to `len(b) - 1`. This means it will run exactly `len(b) - 1` times.
- After the loop completes, the value of `i` will be `len(b)`.
- The list `bd` will have `len(b) - 1` elements, with the first element being `0` and the rest being the differences between consecutive elements of `b`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `q`, `a`, `ad`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
