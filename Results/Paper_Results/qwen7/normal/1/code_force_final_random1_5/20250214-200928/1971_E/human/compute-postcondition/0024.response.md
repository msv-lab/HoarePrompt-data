Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n`, `k`, `q` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `ad` is a list containing `len(a) - 1` elements where each element is calculated as `a[i] - a[i - 1]` for \(i\) from 1 to `len(a) - 1`, `bd` is a list containing `len(b) - 1` elements where the first element is 0 and the rest are calculated as `b[i] - b[i - 1]` for \(i\) from 1 to `len(b) - 1`, `i` is `len(b) + 1`, `len(a)` is greater than 1, and `len(b)` is greater than 1; `v` is a list containing one element which is 0.**

Explanation: The line `v = [0]` initializes the list `v` with a single element, which is 0. This does not affect any of the other variables listed in the initial state. Therefore, all the other variables retain their initial conditions, and the length of `b` is incremented by 1, making `i` equal to `len(b) + 1`.
