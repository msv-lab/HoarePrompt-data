Output State: **`m` is 0, `q` is len(a), `i` is 1, `s` is bisect_left(a, ql), `ql` is an input integer, `l` is 2 and we continue the loop.**

The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only moves the execution to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the values of `m`, `q`, `i`, `s`, `ql`, and `l` remain unchanged, and the program continues with the next iteration of the loop.
