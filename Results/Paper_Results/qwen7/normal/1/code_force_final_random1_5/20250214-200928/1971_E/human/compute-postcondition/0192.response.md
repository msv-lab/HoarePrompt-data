Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `l` is 0.
   - `m` is defined as `bd[s - 1] * (ql / ad[s - 1]) + bd[s] * (ql / ad[s])`.
   - `ql` is reduced by `a[s - 1]`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(int(m), end=' ')
   ```

To determine what will be printed, we need to understand the value of `m` based on the given formula and the reduction of `ql`.

- `m` is calculated as `bd[s - 1] * (ql / ad[s - 1]) + bd[s] * (ql / ad[s])`.
- `ql` is reduced by `a[s - 1]`, but since the exact values of `bd`, `ad`, `s`, and `a` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `m`.

Given the information, we know that `m` is a floating-point number derived from the given formula, and it will be converted to an integer before printing.

Therefore, the output will be the integer part of `m`.

Output: **int(m) (where m is calculated as bd[s - 1] * (ql / ad[s - 1]) + bd[s] * (ql / ad[s]))**
