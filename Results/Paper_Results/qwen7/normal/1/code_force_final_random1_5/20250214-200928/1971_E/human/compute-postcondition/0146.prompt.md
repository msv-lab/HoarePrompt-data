Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `i` is within the range `[len(a), len(a))`, which effectively means `i` is no longer incremented and remains at its last valid value (which is `len(a) - 1`), `bd` contains the differences between each consecutive pair of elements in `b`, starting from the second element of `b`, and `v` is a list containing `len(a)` elements: `0`, `ad[1] / bd[1]`, `ad[2] / bd[2]`, ..., `ad[len(a)-2] / bd[len(a)-2]`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will stop at the last valid index it could have been (one less than the length of `a`), `bd` will still hold the differences as calculated, and `v` will be a list of length `len(a)` where the first element is `0` and the rest are the results of dividing corresponding elements of `ad` by `bd`.
Code of the loop:
for l in range(q):
    m = 0
    i = 1
    ql = int(input())
    s = bisect_left(a, ql)
    if a[s] == ql:
        print(b[s], end=' ')
        continue
    ql -= a[s - 1]
    m += b[s - 1]
    m += bd[s] * ql / ad[s]
    print(int(m), end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `l` is a value within the range [0, `ql` - `a[s - 1)`), `m` is `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql / ad[s])`, `i` is 1, `ql` is decreased by `a[s - 1]`, `s` is the index where the new value of `ql` would be inserted to keep the list `a` sorted, and if `a[s]` is equal to the new value of `ql`, the loop or iteration continues; otherwise, the condition remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `l` is within the range `[0, int(input()) - a[s - 1] - 1)`, `m` is `b[s - 1] + (bd[s] * (int(input()) - a[s - 1]) / ad[s])`, `i` is 2, `ql` is now `int(input()) - a[s - 1]`, `s` is the index where the new value of `ql` would be inserted to keep the list `a` sorted.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `l` is within the range `[1, a[s - 1] - 1)`, `m` is `m + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`, `i` is 1, `ql` is `ql - a[s - 1]`, `s` is the index where the new value of `ql` would be inserted to keep the list `a` sorted, and if `a[s] == ql`, the value of `m` remains `m + b[s - 1]`, `i` remains 1, and `ql` is equal to `a[s]`. If `a[s] != ql`, the conditions remain as initially described.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
