Output State: **`ans` is a list containing the product of all elements in `arr`, then the product of all but the last element, and so on, ending with the product of all but the first element; `tem` is the product of all elements in `arr`, and `i` is -1.**

This means that `ans` will contain a series of intermediate products starting from the full product of the array `arr` and ending with the product of all elements except the first one, with each subsequent element being excluded in the next product calculation. `tem` will hold the final product of all elements in `arr`, and `i` will be `-1` indicating that the loop has completed and moved past the first index of the list.
