Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `i`: This variable is used as the loop counter.
   - `len(arr) - 1`: This expression determines the initial value of `i`.
   - `-1`: This is the step value, indicating that `i` decreases by 1 in each iteration.
   - `-1`: This is the stopping condition (the loop stops when `i` becomes less than this value).

2. **Determine the initial value of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` set to `len(arr) - 1`.

3. **Determine the stopping condition**: The loop stops when `i` is no longer greater than or equal to `-1`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `arr` is a list of positive integers.
   - `ans` is an empty list.
   - `tem` is 1.

Since the loop depends on the initial value of `i` and the length of `arr`, these are the key states that need to be adjusted. The other variables (`ans` and `tem`) are not directly involved in the loop's execution logic.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be set to `len(arr) - 1`.
- The length of `arr` must be at least 1 to ensure that `i` is initially a valid index.

State: **`i` is `len(arr) - 1`, `arr` is a list of positive integers that must have at least 1 element**
