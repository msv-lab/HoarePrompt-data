Output State: **`i` is 3, `ans` is 3, `t1` is `(a[i] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[i] + 2) % n` and both `t1` and `t2` are in set `st`**

Explanation: The code `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. Initially, `ans` is 2, so after executing the code, `ans` becomes 3. The values of `i`, `t1`, and `t2` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.
