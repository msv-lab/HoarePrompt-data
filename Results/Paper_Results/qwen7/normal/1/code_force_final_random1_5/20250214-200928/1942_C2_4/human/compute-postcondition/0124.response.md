Postcondition: `i` is at least 1 and less than `len(a)`, and the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is not equal to 2. If the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is even and the current value of `y` is greater than the half of the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` minus 2, then `tmp` is a list with an additional element which is the half of the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]`; `ans` is increased by `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`. Otherwise, no changes occur to `tmp` and `ans`.
