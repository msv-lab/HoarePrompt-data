Output State: **`i` is at least 1 and less than `len(a)`, and the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is not equal to 2, the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is even, and the current value of `y` is greater than the half of the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` minus 1; `tmp` is a list with an additional element which is the half of the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]`; `ans` is increased by `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `ans` by adding half of the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]`. All other conditions and the state of `tmp` remain unchanged.
