Postcondition: `a` is a list of integers, `ans` is increased by `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` if `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1])` is even and `y` is greater than the half of the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` minus 2 when the condition `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2` is true. If the condition is false, `ans` is set to 1 and the values of `a` and `y` remain unchanged.
