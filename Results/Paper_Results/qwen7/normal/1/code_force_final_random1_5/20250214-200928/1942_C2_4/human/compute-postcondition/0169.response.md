Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in val`. The only variable in the loop head is `i`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the start of the loop**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `i` is the first element of `val`.
   - `x` is greater than or equal to 3.
   - `c` is `i // 2`.
   - `y` is `-1 - (i // 2)`.
   - `sx` is `-4 + i`.

3. **Understand how the loop works**: In each iteration, `i` takes the next value from the list `val`. The loop continues as long as there are elements left in `val`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is the first element of `val` at the start of the current iteration, for the next iteration, `i` will be the second element of `val`.
   - `x`, `c`, and `y` depend on the value of `i`, so they will change based on the new value of `i`.
   - `sx` is calculated using the current value of `i`, so it will also change.

5. **State the updated values**:
   - `i` will be the second element of `val`.
   - `x` remains greater than or equal to 3.
   - `c` will be the new value of `i` (the second element of `val`) divided by 2.
   - `y` will be `-1 - (new value of i // 2)`.
   - `sx` will be `-4 + (new value of i)`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop would be:

State: **`i` is the second element of `val`, `x` is greater than or equal to 3, `c` is the new value of `i` // 2, `y` is `-1 - (new value of i // 2)`, `sx` is `-4 + (new value of i)`**
