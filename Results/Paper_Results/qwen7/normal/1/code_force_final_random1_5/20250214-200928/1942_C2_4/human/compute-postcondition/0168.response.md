Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in val`. The only variable directly involved in the loop head is `i`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `i` must be the next element in the list `val`. Since `i` was the first element of `val` at the end of the previous iteration, the next `i` will be the second element of `val`.

3. **Adjust the Other States**:
   - `x`: The value of `x` is not directly dependent on the loop variable `i`, so it remains unchanged.
   - `c`: `c` is defined as `i // 2`. Since `i` changes to the next element in `val`, `c` will change accordingly.
   - `y`: `y` is defined as `-1 - (i // 2)`. Since `i` changes, `y` will also change.
   - `sx`: `sx` is defined as `-4 + i`. Since `i` changes, `sx` will also change.

4. **Update the States**:
   - `i` will be the second element of `val`.
   - `c` will be the second element of `val` divided by 2.
   - `y` will be `-1 - (second element of val // 2)`.
   - `sx` will be `-4 + (second element of val)`.

Given these steps, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `i` is the second element of `val`, `x` is greater than or equal to 3, `c` is the second element of `val` // 2, `y` is -1 - (second element of `val` // 2), `sx` is -4 + (second element of `val`)**
