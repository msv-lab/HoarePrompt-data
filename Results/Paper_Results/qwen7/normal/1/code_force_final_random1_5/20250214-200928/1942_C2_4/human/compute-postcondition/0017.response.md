Postcondition: `i` is 1, `a` is a list of integers where the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is not equal to 2, and either the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is even, the current value of `y` is greater than the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` divided by 2 minus 2, in which case `tmp` is a list containing one element which is `(a[1] - a[0]) // 2`, and `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`; or there is no condition met, and the values of `i`, `a`, `y`, `tmp`, and `ans` remain unchanged as per the precondition.
