Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `len(a) - 1`, `tmp` will be a list containing elements that are half of the differences between consecutive elements of `a` where those differences are even and greater than 2, and `ans` will be the sum of these half differences plus the count of times the difference between consecutive elements was exactly 2.

In more detail, `tmp` will contain all the values \((a[j] - a[j-1]) // 2\) for each \(j\) from 2 to `len(a) - 1` where \(a[j] - a[j-1]\) is even and greater than 2. `ans` will be the sum of all these values plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements was exactly 2.
