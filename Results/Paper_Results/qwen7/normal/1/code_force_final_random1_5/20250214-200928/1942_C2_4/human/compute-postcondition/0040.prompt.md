Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tt` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, `ii` is 0, `n` is the first integer entered, `x` is the second integer entered, `y` is the third integer entered, `a` is a list of three integers sorted in ascending order `[min(n, x, y), middle_value(n, x, y), max(n, x, y)]`, `ans` is `x + y - 2`, `tmp` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(a)):
    if a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2:
        ans += 1
    elif (a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1:
        tmp.append((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2)
        ans += (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2
        y -= (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 1, `a` is a list of integers, `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus 1 if `a[i] - a[i - 1]` equals 2, and if `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is not equal to 2, then:
- If the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is even and the current value of `y` is greater than the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` divided by 2 minus 2, `tmp` is a list containing one element which is `(a[1] - a[0]) // 2`, and `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`.
- Otherwise, the values of `tmp` and `ans` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `ans` is either increased by 1 if `a[2] - a[1] == 2`, or set to `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2` and `tmp` is a list containing the element `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2`. Additionally, `y` is updated to `y - ((a[2] - a[1]) // 2 - 1)` if `(a[2] - a[1]) % 2 == 0` and `y > (a[2] - a[1]) // 2 - 1`. If the condition `a[2] - a[1] == 2` is not met, the values of `ans`, `tmp`, and `y` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 3, `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `ans` is increased by 1 if `a[3] - a[2] == 2`, otherwise `ans` is increased by `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2` if `(a[3] - a[2]) % 2 == 0` and `y > (a[3] - a[2]) // 2 - 1`. `tmp` is a list containing the element `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2` and an additional element if the condition is met, `y` is updated to `y - ((a[3] - a[2]) // 2 - 1)` if `(a[3] - a[2]) % 2 == 0` and `y > (a[3] - a[2]) // 2 - 1`, otherwise the values of `ans`, `tmp`, and `y` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
