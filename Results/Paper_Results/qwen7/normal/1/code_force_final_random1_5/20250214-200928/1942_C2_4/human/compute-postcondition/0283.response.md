Postcondition: **`i` is `x`, `ans` is `x`, `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`. If `gap` is greater than 1 and is an odd number, `odd` is a list containing `[gap]` and `even` is an empty list. If `gap` is even and greater than 0, `odd` is an empty list and `even` is a list containing `gap`.**
