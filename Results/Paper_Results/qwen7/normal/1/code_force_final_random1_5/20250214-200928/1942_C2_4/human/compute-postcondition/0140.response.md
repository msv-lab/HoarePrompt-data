Postcondition: `i` is 3 or 4, `tmp` is a list containing two elements, where the first element is either `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2` or `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2`, and the second element is `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`; `ans` is increased by `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`, and `y` is decreased by `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`.
