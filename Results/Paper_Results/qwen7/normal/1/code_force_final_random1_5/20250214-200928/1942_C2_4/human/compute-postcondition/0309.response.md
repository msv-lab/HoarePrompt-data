Postcondition: `odd` has at least one element, the first element of `odd` (denoted as `gap`) is either greater than `y` which is currently less than half of `gap`, in which case `ans` is increased by 2 * `y` and `y` is set to 0, or there is no other condition since there is no else part, so no additional changes occur.
