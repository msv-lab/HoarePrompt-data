Postcondition: **`a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is either 2 or remains 1, `tmp` is a list containing one element which is the integer `(a[1] - a[0]) // 2` if the condition `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1` is met, `ans` is incremented by 1 if `a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2`, and otherwise, `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus `(a[1] - a[0]) // 2`.**
