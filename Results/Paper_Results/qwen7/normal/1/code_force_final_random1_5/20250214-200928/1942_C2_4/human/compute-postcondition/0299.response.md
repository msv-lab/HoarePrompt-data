Output State: `i` is `x + len(a)`, `ans` is `x`, `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `odd` is a list containing all unique odd gaps found during the loop iterations, and `even` is a list containing all unique even gaps found during the loop iterations.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, the variable `i` will increment from `x` to `x + len(a)`, as the loop runs `len(a)` times. The variables `ans`, `t1`, and `t2` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop. The `next_elem` is defined as `a[0] + n` when `i == x - 1` and `a[i + 1]` otherwise, but since `i` reaches `x + len(a)`, `next_elem` will always refer to `a[0] + n`. The `odd` and `even` lists accumulate all unique gaps that meet their respective conditions during the loop's execution.
