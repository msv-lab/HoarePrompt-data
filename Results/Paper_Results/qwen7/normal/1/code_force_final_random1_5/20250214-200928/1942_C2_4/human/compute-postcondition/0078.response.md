Postcondition: **`a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 3, `tmp` is either `[a[1], (a[2] - a[1]) // 2]` if the condition `(a[2] - a[1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[2] - a[1]) // 2 - 1` is met, or remains unchanged, `ans` is incremented by `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2` if the condition is met, or remains unchanged, `y` is decreased by `((a[3] - a[2]) // 2 - 1)` if the condition is met, or remains unchanged.**
