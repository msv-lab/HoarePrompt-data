Output State: **`i` is 3; `tmp` is a list containing one element which is `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2`; `ans` is increased by `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2`.**

Explanation: The variable `i` remains unchanged at 3. The variable `tmp` is not affected by the given code snippet. The variable `ans` is updated by adding the value of `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`, which is equivalent to `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2`.
