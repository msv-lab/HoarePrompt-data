Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, and the current value of `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is equal to 2; `ans` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is incremented by 1, and the other variables (`a`, `i`) retain their previous states. The condition `a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2` remains unchanged.
