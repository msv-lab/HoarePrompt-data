Output State: **`i` is `x + 1`, `ans` is `x`, `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `odd` is `[gap]`, `even` is either `[gap]` or an empty list, `gap` is equal to `next_elem - a[i] - 1`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `gap` to the list `odd`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `i` and `ans` stay the same, and `odd` now includes the value of `gap`. The values of `t1`, `t2`, `next_elem`, and `gap` are also kept the same as per the initial state.
