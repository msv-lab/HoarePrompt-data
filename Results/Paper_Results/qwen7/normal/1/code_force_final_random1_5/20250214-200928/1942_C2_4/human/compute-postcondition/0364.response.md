Functionality: **The function processes input data for multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers \( n \), \( x \), and \( y \), followed by \( x \) distinct integers from 1 to \( n \). It then calculates and prints the value of \( ans \), which is determined based on specific conditions involving the input integers. Specifically, \( ans \) is incremented based on certain gaps between consecutive integers in the input list, and it is adjusted according to the value of \( y \). The function ensures that \( y \) is reduced accordingly and sets \( ans \) to the final calculated value for each test case.**
