Output State: **`i` is 2, `ans` is 1, `t1` is (a[i] + 1) % n, `t2` is (a[0] + 2) % n and is in set `st`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `t1` to `(a[i] + 1) % n`. Given that `i` is 2, `t1` becomes `(a[2] + 1) % n`. The values of `ans`, `t2`, and `st` remain unchanged from their initial states.
