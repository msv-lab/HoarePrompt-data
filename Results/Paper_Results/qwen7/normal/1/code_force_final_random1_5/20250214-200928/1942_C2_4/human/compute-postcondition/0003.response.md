Output State: **`tt` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, `ii` is 0, `n` is the first integer entered, `x` is the second integer entered, `y` is the third integer entered, `a` is a list of three integers `[n, x, y]`**.

The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in the list `a`. Since the input consists of three integers (first, second, and third), `a` will contain these three integers in the order they were entered. The other variables (`tt`, `ii`, `n`, `x`, `y`) remain unchanged.
