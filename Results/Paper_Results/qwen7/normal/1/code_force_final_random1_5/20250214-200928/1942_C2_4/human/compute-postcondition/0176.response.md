Output State: **`i` is the second element of `val`, `x` is greater than or equal to 3, `c` is `i // 2`, `y` is now `-2`, `sx` is `-2 + i + i`, the `y < c` condition is not checked since `sx` is updated.**

Explanation:
- Initially, `y` is defined as `-1 - (i // 2)`.
- After executing `y -= c`, `y` becomes `-1 - (i // 2) - (i // 2)`, which simplifies to `-2 - (i // 2)`.
- Since `c` is `i // 2`, the new value of `y` is `-2`.
