Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases (`tt`) and processes each test case individually. This is correct.
2. **Variable Initialization**: The variables `n`, `x`, and `y` are correctly initialized from the input for each test case. This is correct.
3. **Vertex List Processing**: The list `a` containing the chosen vertices is correctly sorted. This is necessary for the subsequent calculations.
4. **Triangle Calculation**:
   - The initial calculation of `ans = x + y - 2` is correct because choosing any 3 vertices from the `x` chosen vertices plus up to `y` additional vertices can form at least `x + y - 2` triangles.
   - The logic for incrementing `ans` when the difference between consecutive vertices is even and within the limit of `y` is also correct. This ensures that additional triangles can be formed by adding diagonals between these vertices.
   - The final check for the boundary condition (first and last vertex) is also handled correctly.
5. **Output**: The function correctly prints the minimum value between the calculated `ans` and `n - 2`, ensuring that the output respects the constraints of the problem.

Given the above analysis, the provided solution appears to be correct and follows the problem's requirements accurately.

Correctness: **True**
