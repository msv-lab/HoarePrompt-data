Output State: **`tt` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, `ii` is 0, `n` is the first integer entered, `x` is the second integer entered, `y` is the third integer entered.**

The code splits the input into three integers and assigns them to `n`, `x`, and `y`. The values of `tt` and `ii` remain unchanged from their initial state.
