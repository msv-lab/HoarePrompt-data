Output State: **`i` is 3; `tmp` is a list containing one element which is `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2`; `ans` is increased by `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2 - 1`; `y` is decreased by `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2 - 1**.

Explanation: Initially, `i` is 3, `tmp` is a list containing `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2`, and `ans` is increased by `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2`. The code subtracts `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1` from `y`. Since `i` is 3, `a[i]` is `a[3]` and `a[i - 1]` is `a[2]`, so the expression simplifies to `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2 - 1`. This value is subtracted from `y`. The other variables remain unchanged.
