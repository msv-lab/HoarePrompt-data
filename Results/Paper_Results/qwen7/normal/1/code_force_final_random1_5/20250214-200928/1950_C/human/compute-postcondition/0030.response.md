Output State: **`t` is the value of `int(input()) - 1`, `s` is the new input string, `h` is the first two characters of the new `s`.**

Explanation: The code `h = s[:2]` assigns the first two characters of the string `s` to the variable `h`. The values of `t` and `s` remain unchanged from their initial states.
