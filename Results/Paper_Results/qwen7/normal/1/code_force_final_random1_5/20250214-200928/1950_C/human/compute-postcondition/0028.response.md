Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for t in range(int(input())):`. The variables involved here are `t` and the value of `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t < 1440\).
   - `s` is the input string.
   - `h` is the first two characters of the new `s`.
   - If `h` is '00', no changes are made to `t` and `s`.
   - Otherwise, no changes are made to `t` and `s`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `t` is less than the value of `int(input())`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `t` is incremented by 1 at each iteration (as it is part of a range), at the end of the previous iteration, `t` would be equal to the value of `int(input()) - 1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be less than the value of `int(input())`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `t` is now one less than the value of `int(input())` from the previous iteration.

**Final State**:
- `t` is the value of `int(input()) - 1`.
- `s` remains unchanged.
- `h` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is the value of `int(input()) - 1`, `s` is the input string, `h` is the first two characters of the new `s`.**
