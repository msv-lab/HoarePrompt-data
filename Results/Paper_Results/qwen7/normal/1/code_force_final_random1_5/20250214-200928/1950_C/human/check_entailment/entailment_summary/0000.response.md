Reasoning:
1. The program correctly handles the conversion from 24-hour format to 12-hour format.
2. It properly accounts for the transition between AM and PM at 12:00.
3. The program correctly handles leading zeros for hours less than 10.
4. The program uses a list `['AM', 'PM']` to determine whether to print "AM" or "PM" based on whether the hour is 12 or greater.
5. The program correctly prints the time in the format "hh:mm AM" or "hh:mm PM".
6. The program processes each test case as specified and prints the results directly without returning any value.

Given these points, the program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description and execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
