### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case by reading the time string (`s`).
2. **Hour Conversion**:
   - For `00`, it correctly converts it to `12`.
   - For hours between `01` and `12`, it prints the hour as is.
   - For hours between `13` and `23`, it correctly converts them to the corresponding 12-hour format by subtracting `12` and adding a leading zero if necessary.
3. **AM/PM Determination**:
   - If the hour is `12` or greater, it prints `PM`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `AM`.

Given the provided example and the constraints, the program handles all possible inputs correctly according to the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program is correct based on the provided problem description and the execution states.
