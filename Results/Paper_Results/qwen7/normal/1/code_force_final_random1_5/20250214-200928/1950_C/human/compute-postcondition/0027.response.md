Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t < 1440`.
   - `s` is an input string.
   - `h` is the first two characters of the new `s`.

2. **Conditions:**
   - If `h` is '00', no changes are made to `t` and `s`.
   - Otherwise, no changes are made to `t` and `s`.

3. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(s[2:], ['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12])
   ```

Given the conditions, let's analyze what will be printed:

- `s[2:]`: This slice operation extracts the substring starting from the third character (index 2) of the string `s`.
- `['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12]`: This expression checks if the integer value of `h` (the first two characters of `s`) is greater than or equal to 12. If it is, it returns 'PM'; otherwise, it returns 'AM'.

Since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `s` or `h`, we need to consider both cases:

### Case 1: `h` is '00'
- In this case, `int(h) == 0`.
- Therefore, `int(h) >= 12` evaluates to `False`.
- So, `['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12]` will return 'AM'.
- The print statement will then output `s[2:] + 'AM'`.

### Case 2: `h` is not '00'
- In this case, `int(h)` will be a non-zero value.
- Therefore, `int(h) >= 12` will evaluate to either `True` or `False` depending on the value of `h`.
- If `int(h) >= 12` is `True`, `['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12]` will return 'PM'.
- If `int(h) >= 12` is `False`, `['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12]` will return 'AM'.
- The print statement will then output `s[2:] + 'AM'` or `s[2:] + 'PM'`.

Since the problem does not specify the exact value of `h`, we cannot determine the exact value of `s[2:]`. However, we know that the second part of the print statement will be either 'AM' or 'PM'.

### Conclusion
Given the conditions and the lack of specific values for `s` and `h`, the most precise description of the output is:

Output: **s[2:] + ['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12]**
