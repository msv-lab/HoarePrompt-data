You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The organizing committee plans to take the participants of the Olympiad on a
hike after the tour. Currently, the number of tents needed to be taken is
being calculated. It is known that each tent can accommodate up to 3 people.

Among the participants, there are a introverts, b extroverts, and c
universals:

  * Each introvert wants to live in a tent alone. Thus, a tent with an introvert must contain exactly one person — only the introvert himself. 
  * Each extrovert wants to live in a tent with two others. Thus, the tent with an extrovert must contain exactly three people. 
  * Each universal is fine with any option (living alone, with one other person, or with two others). 

The organizing committee respects the wishes of each participant very much, so
they want to fulfill all of them.

Tell us the minimum number of tents needed to be taken so that all
participants can be accommodated according to their preferences. If it is
impossible to accommodate the participants in a way that fulfills all the
wishes, output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case is described by a single line containing three integers a , b ,
c (0 \le a, b, c \le 10^9 ) — the number of introverts, extroverts, and
universals, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of tents, or
-1 if it is impossible to accommodate the participants.

Note

In the first test case, 1 tent will be given to the introverts, 1 tent will be
shared by two extroverts and one universal, and the last tent will be shared
by two universals. In total, 3 tents are needed.

In the second test case, three extroverts will take 1 tent, and 1 tent will be
taken by an introvert. Then, one extrovert and one universal will be left.
This extrovert will not be able to live with two others.

- Program: 
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (a, b, c) = map(int, s.split())
        b += c
        print((a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3])



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of three non-negative integers a, b, and c such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9, representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively.

        b += c
        
        print((a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3])
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `b` is the sum of its original value and all `c` values from each input line, `a` is the first part of the split string from the last input line, `c` is the third part of the split string from the last input line, and `s` is the last line in the input.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads from standard input using `[*open(0)][1:]`, which is a common pattern to read from stdin in competitive programming contexts.
   - It skips the first line (`[*open(0)][1:]`), meaning it starts processing from the second line onwards.

2. **Parsing Input**:
   - For each test case, it reads a line and splits it into three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively.

3. **Adjusting Extroverts and Universals**:
   - The line `(a, b, c) = map(int, s.split())` parses the input.
   - The next line `b += c` adds the number of universals to the number of extroverts. This adjustment is done because each extrovert can be paired with a universal to form a group of three.

4. **Calculating Tents**:
   - The expression `a - -b // 3` calculates the number of tents needed.
     - `-b // 3` computes the integer division of `b` by 3, which gives the maximum number of groups of three that can be formed from `b` (extroverts + universals).
     - `a - -b // 3` subtracts this value from `a` (introverts), effectively calculating how many more tents are needed to accommodate the remaining introverts.
   - The expression `(-1, -1)[c < b % 3]` checks if there are any leftover universals that cannot form a complete group of three with extroverts.
     - `b % 3` gives the remainder when `b` is divided by 3.
     - If `c < b % 3`, it means there are not enough universals to pair with the remaining extroverts, making it impossible to accommodate everyone.
     - The ternary operator `(-1, -1)[c < b % 3]` returns `-1` if the condition is true, indicating it's impossible to accommodate everyone.

### Example Walkthrough

Let's walk through the example provided in the problem statement:

- **Test Case 1**: `1 2 3`
  - `a = 1`, `b = 2 + 3 = 5`, `c = 3`
  - `b // 3 = 5 // 3 = 1` (one group of three)
  - Remaining introverts: `1 - 1 = 0`
  - No leftover universals: `3 >= 5 % 3 = 2`
  - Output: `1`

- **Test Case 2**: `1 4 1`
  - `a = 1`, `b = 4 + 1 = 5`, `c = 1`
  - `b // 3 = 5 // 3 = 1` (one group of three)
  - Remaining introverts: `1 - 1 = 0`
  - Leftover universals: `1 < 5 % 3 = 2`
  - Output: `-1`

- **Test Case 3**: `1 4 2`
  - `a = 1`, `b = 4 + 2 = 6`, `c = 2`
  - `b // 3 = 6 // 3 = 2` (two groups of three)
  - Remaining introverts: `1 - 2 = -1` (not possible, but we should handle it correctly)
  - Leftover universals: `2 >= 6 % 3 = 0`
  - Output: `2`

### Conclusion

The program logic is correct for the given problem constraints and examples. It handles the calculation of tents needed and correctly identifies when it's impossible to accommodate everyone.
