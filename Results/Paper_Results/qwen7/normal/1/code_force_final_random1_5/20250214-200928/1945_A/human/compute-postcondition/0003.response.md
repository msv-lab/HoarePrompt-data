Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `b` is the original value of `b` plus `c`.
   - `a` is the first part of the split string.
   - `c` is the third part of the split string.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print((a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3])
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**

   - The expression inside the `print` function is `(a - -b // 3, -1)`.
     - `-b // 3` means the floor division of `-b` by `3`. Since `-b` is negated, this operation depends on the value of `b`.
     - `a - -b // 3` subtracts the result of `-b // 3` from `a`.
   - The expression `[c < b % 3]` checks if `c` is less than `b % 3` and returns either `True` or `False`.
   - The `print` function then selects between `a - -b // 3` and `-1` based on the boolean value of `c < b % 3`.

4. **Possible Scenarios:**

   - If `c < b % 3` is `True`, the print statement will output `a - -b // 3`.
   - If `c < b % 3` is `False`, the print statement will output `-1`.

Given the initial state, we don't have specific values for `a`, `b`, and `c`. Therefore, we need to consider the general form of the output based on the conditions described.

Output: **(a - -b // 3) if c < b % 3 else -1**
