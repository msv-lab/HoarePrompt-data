Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers derived from splitting the string `s` by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `a, b, c = map(int, s.split())` splits the string `s` into a list of substrings using spaces as delimiters, converts each substring to an integer, and assigns these integers to `a`, `b`, and `c`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
