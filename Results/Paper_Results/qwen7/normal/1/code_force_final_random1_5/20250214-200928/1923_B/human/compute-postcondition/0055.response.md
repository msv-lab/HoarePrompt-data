To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition and the given postconditions.

### Loop Condition Analysis
The loop condition is:
```python
while rest != 0 and pos != len(sorted_indices):
```
For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions must be true:
1. `rest != 0`
2. `pos != len(sorted_indices)`

### Given Postconditions
- `rest` is now equal to `rest - 2*delta`
- `delta` remains unchanged
- `pos` is `pos + 1`
- `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is decreased by `delta`

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Condition 1: `rest != 0`**
   - The postcondition states that `rest` is now equal to `rest - 2*delta`.
   - For `rest` to be non-zero after subtracting `2*delta`, `rest` must have been greater than or equal to `2*delta` before the subtraction.
   - Therefore, `rest` must be greater than or equal to `2*delta`.

2. **Condition 2: `pos != len(sorted_indices)`**
   - The postcondition states that `pos` is `pos + 1`.
   - For `pos` to be less than `len(sorted_indices)` after incrementing, `pos` must have been less than `len(sorted_indices) - 1` before the increment.
   - Therefore, `pos` must be less than `len(sorted_indices) - 1`.

### Conclusion
To ensure the loop executes one more time, the following adjustments are necessary:
- `rest` must be greater than or equal to `2*delta`.
- `pos` must be less than `len(sorted_indices) - 1`.

### Final Answer
State: **`rest` is greater than or equal to `2*delta`, `delta` remains unchanged, `pos` is less than `len(sorted_indices) - 1`, and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is decreased by `delta`**
