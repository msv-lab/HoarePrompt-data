Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input using `map(int, input().split())`**.

In this output state, the value of `t` remains greater than 0, `n` and `k` remain as input integers, and `a` is updated to a list of integers obtained from the input string split and converted to integers. Additionally, `x` is now a list of integers obtained from the same input using `map(int, input().split())`.
