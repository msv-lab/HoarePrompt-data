To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions in the loop head:

```python
while rest != 0 and pos != len(sorted_indices):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

The loop continues as long as both conditions are true:
1. `rest != 0`
2. `pos != len(sorted_indices)`

Let's analyze each condition:

1. **Condition 1: `rest != 0`**
   - The postcondition states that `rest` is `rest - delta - delta`. This means `rest` is reduced by `2 * delta`.
   - For the loop to continue, `rest` must still be non-zero. Since `rest` was reduced by `2 * delta`, it must have been greater than or equal to `2 * delta` at the start of this iteration.

2. **Condition 2: `pos != len(sorted_indices)`**
   - The postcondition states that `pos` is equal to `pos + 2`. This means `pos` is incremented by 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `pos` must still be less than `len(sorted_indices)`. Since `pos` was incremented by 2, it must have been less than `len(sorted_indices) - 2` at the start of this iteration.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `rest` and `pos` to meet these conditions.

### Adjusted States:
- `rest` must be greater than or equal to `2 * delta`.
- `pos` must be less than `len(sorted_indices) - 2`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`rest` is greater than or equal to `2 * delta`, `distance` is increased by 2, `pos` is equal to `pos + 2`, `delta` is equal to `min(rest - delta, a[sorted_indices[pos + 1]])`, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is equal to 0, `a[sorted_indices[pos + 1]]` is decreased by `delta`, `pos` must be less than `len(sorted_indices) - 2`**
