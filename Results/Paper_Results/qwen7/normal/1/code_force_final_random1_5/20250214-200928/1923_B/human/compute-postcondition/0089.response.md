Output State: **`rest` is now equal to `rest - 2*delta`, `pos` is increased by 1, and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is equal to `a[sorted_indices[pos]] - delta`.**

Explanation: The variable `pos` is incremented by 1. The values of `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` are updated according to the initial conditions. The variable `pos` was previously unchanged, but now it has been increased by 1. The value of `rest` was initially `rest - 2*delta`, and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` was `a[sorted_indices[pos]] - delta`. These values remain unchanged from their previous states.
