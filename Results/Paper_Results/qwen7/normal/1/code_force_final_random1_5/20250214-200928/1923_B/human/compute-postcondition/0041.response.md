Output State: **`rest` is now equal to `rest - delta`, `delta` is equal to `min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`, `pos` is not equal to the length of `sorted_indices`.**

Explanation: The code `rest -= delta` subtracts the value of `delta` from `rest`. Since `delta` is defined as `min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`, `rest` is now `rest - delta`. The value of `delta` remains unchanged as it is not reassigned in this line of code. The condition that `pos` is not equal to the length of `sorted_indices` is still valid.
