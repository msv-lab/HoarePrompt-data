Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is the first integer input converted to an integer, `k` is the second integer input converted to an integer, `a` is a list of integers from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a single line of input, splits it into individual elements based on spaces, converts each element to an integer using `map(int, ...)` and then creates a list `a` from these integers. The variables `t` and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states, and `n` remains the first integer input converted to an integer.
