Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `pos != len(sorted_indices)`.
2. **Current State**: 
   - `distance` is 1.
   - `pos` is either the last index of `sorted_indices` or one less than the last index.
   - The length of `sorted_indices` is greater than 0.
   - All elements in `a[sorted_indices]` are either 0 or decreased by their respective `delta` values.
   - `rest` is 0.

3. **Determine the Next Iteration Condition**: For the loop to execute one more time, `pos` must be different from `len(sorted_indices)`. Since `pos` is either the last index or one less than the last index, and the length of `sorted_indices` is greater than 0, the only way for the loop to continue is if `pos` is not already equal to `len(sorted_indices)`.

4. **Adjust the State**: To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `pos` must not be equal to `len(sorted_indices)`. Given that `pos` is either the last index or one less than the last index, the only adjustment needed is to ensure `pos` is not equal to the last index of `sorted_indices`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `pos` should not be equal to the last index of `sorted_indices`.

**State:**
- `distance` is 1.
- `pos` is not equal to the last index of `sorted_indices`.
- The length of `sorted_indices` is greater than 0.
- All elements in `a[sorted_indices]` are either 0 or decreased by their respective `delta` values.
- `rest` is 0.

State: **`distance` is 1, `pos` is not equal to the last index of `sorted_indices`, the length of `sorted_indices` is greater than 0, all elements in `a[sorted_indices]` are either 0 or decreased by their respective `delta` values, `rest` is 0**
