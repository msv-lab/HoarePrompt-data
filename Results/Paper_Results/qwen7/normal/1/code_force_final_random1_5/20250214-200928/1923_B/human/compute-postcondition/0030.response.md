Postcondition: `distance` is 0, `pos` is either 3 or 2, the length of `sorted_indices` is greater than 0, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is decreased by `delta`, `rest` is `rest - min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`.

Explanation: 
- If `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` equals 0, then `pos` is increased by 1 (making it either 3 or 2 since it starts as either 1 or 2).
- If `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` does not equal 0, then there is no change to `pos`, and the other conditions remain as specified in the precondition.
