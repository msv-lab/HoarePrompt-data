Output State: **`rest` is equal to `rest - delta`, `distance` is increased by 2, `pos` is equal to `pos + 1`, `delta` is equal to `min(rest - delta, a[sorted_indices[pos + 1]])`, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is equal to 0, `a[sorted_indices[pos + 1]]` is decreased by `delta`, `delta` is now `min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`, `pos` is less than `len(sorted_indices) - 2`; `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is decreased by `delta`.**

Explanation: The line `pos += 1` increments the value of `pos` by 1. All other variables and their relationships remain unchanged from the initial state. Therefore, the updated state includes `pos` being incremented by 1, while the rest of the conditions and values remain as specified in the initial state.
