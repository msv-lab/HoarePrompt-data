Output State: **`rest` is equal to `rest` - `delta`, `delta` remains unchanged, `pos` is less than `len(sorted_indices) - 1`, and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is now equal to `a[sorted_indices[pos]] - min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`.**

Explanation: The code `rest -= delta` subtracts the value of `delta` from `rest`. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `pos` is still less than `len(sorted_indices) - 1`, and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is updated by subtracting `min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])` from itself, but this does not affect the relationship between `rest` and `delta`.
