Output State: **`distance` is 0, `pos` is 1, the length of `sorted_indices` is greater than 0, the absolute value of `x[sorted_indices[pos]]` is not equal to `distance`, `rest` is `rest - delta`, `delta` is `min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`**.

Explanation: The variable `rest` is decreased by the value of `delta`. The value of `delta` is defined as `min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`, so `rest` is now `rest - min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
