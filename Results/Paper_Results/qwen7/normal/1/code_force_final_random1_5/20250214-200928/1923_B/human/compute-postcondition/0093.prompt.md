Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `distance` is increased by 1, `pos` is less than the length of `sorted_indices`, `rest` is `k`.
Code of the loop:
while rest != 0 and pos != len(sorted_indices):
    delta = min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])
    rest -= delta
    a[sorted_indices[pos]] -= delta
    if a[sorted_indices[pos]] == 0:
        pos += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `rest` is `rest - delta - delta`, `distance` is increased by 2, `pos` is equal to `pos + 2`, `delta` is equal to `min(rest - delta, a[sorted_indices[pos + 1]])`, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is equal to 0, and `a[sorted_indices[pos + 1]]` is decreased by `delta`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `rest` is equal to `rest - delta`, `distance` is increased by 2, `pos` is equal to `pos + 1`, `delta` is equal to `min(rest - delta, a[sorted_indices[pos + 1]])`, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is equal to 0, `a[sorted_indices[pos + 1]]` is decreased by `delta`, `delta` is now `min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`, `pos` is less than `len(sorted_indices) - 2`; `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is decreased by `delta`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Postcondition: `rest` is now equal to `rest - 2*delta`, `pos` is either unchanged or increased by 1, and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is either equal to `a[sorted_indices[pos]] - delta` (if `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` was not zero) or remains unchanged (if `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` was zero).


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
