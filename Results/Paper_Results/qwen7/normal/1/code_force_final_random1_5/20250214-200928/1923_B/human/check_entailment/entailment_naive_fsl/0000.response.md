Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not handle the scenario where multiple monsters can be at the same distance from the player simultaneously. Hereâ€™s a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

Consider the following input:
```
3 2
1 1 1
-1 1 1
```

According to the problem description, we need to check if we can survive and kill all monsters without any of them reaching the player's position (0).

Using the provided `func_1` function, the execution would be as follows:

1. Sort the indices based on the absolute distance from the player:
   - Distance for monster at -1 is 1.
   - Distance for monster at 1 is 1.
   - Sorted indices: [0, 1].

2. Start processing the sorted indices:
   - At distance 1, both monsters are present. The function checks if the distance is already covered (`abs(x[sorted_indices[pos]]) == distance`). Since `distance` is 0 initially, this condition fails, and the function returns `False`.

However, according to the problem description, we should be able to kill both monsters in one second since we have 2 bullets and both monsters are at the same distance. The correct approach would be to handle the case where multiple monsters are at the same distance and ensure that all of them are killed before moving on to the next distance.

Therefore, the provided function does not correctly handle the scenario where multiple monsters are at the same distance, leading to incorrect results. Hence, the program is incorrect.
