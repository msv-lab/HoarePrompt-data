Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is the first integer input converted to an integer, `k` is the second integer input converted to an integer, `a` is updated to be a list of integers obtained from the new input split and converted using `map(int, input().split())`, `x` remains unchanged**.

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a new input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states.
