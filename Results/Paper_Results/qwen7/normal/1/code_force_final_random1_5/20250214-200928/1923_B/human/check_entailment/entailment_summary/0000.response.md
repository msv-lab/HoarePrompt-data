Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining whether it's possible to kill all monsters before they reach the player's starting position (point 0) by firing up to `k` bullets per second.
2. The `func_2` function correctly handles multiple test cases, reading the necessary inputs and calling `func_1` to determine the outcome for each test case.
3. The `func_1` function sorts the monsters based on their distance from the player, ensuring that the closest monsters are dealt with first. It then iteratively fires bullets to reduce the health of the monsters until either all monsters are killed or a monster reaches the player's position.
4. The execution summary of `func_1` indicates that it correctly simulates the process of firing bullets and checking if any monster reaches the player's position. The function returns `False` if a monster reaches the player's position at any point and `True` otherwise.
5. The `func_2` function correctly uses the results from `func_1` to print 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case.

Given that both functions (`func_1` and `func_2`) handle the problem as described and the execution summaries confirm the expected behavior, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
