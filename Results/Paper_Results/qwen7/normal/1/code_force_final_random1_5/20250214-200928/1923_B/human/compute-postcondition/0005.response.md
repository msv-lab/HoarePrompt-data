Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0 (though its value is not needed to determine the output).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting an input string and converting each element to an integer.
- `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input using `map(int, input().split())`.

The `print` statement checks if `func_1(a, x, k)` returns `True` or `False` and prints `'YES'` or `'NO'` accordingly. Since the function `func_1` is not defined, we cannot determine its exact behavior. However, the output will be either `'YES'` or `'NO'` depending on the result of `func_1(a, x, k)`.

Output: **'YES' if func_1(a, x, k) returns True, otherwise 'NO'**
