Output State: **`distance` is increased by 1, `pos` is less than the length of `sorted_indices`, `rest` is `k`.**

Explanation: The variable `rest` is assigned the value of `k`. No changes are made to `distance`, `pos`, or the condition related to `x[sorted_indices[pos]]`. Therefore, the conditions from the initial state remain unchanged except for the new assignment to `rest`.
