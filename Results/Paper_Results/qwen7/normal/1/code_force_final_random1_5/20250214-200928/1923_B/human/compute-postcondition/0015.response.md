Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is 1.
- `n` is the first integer input converted to an integer.
- `k` is the second integer input converted to an integer.
- `a` is a list of integers from the input split by spaces.
- `x` is a list of integers from the input split by spaces.

The `print` statement is checking the result of `func_1(a, x, k)`. Since the function `func_1` is not defined, we cannot determine its exact behavior. However, we can describe the output based on the inputs and the logic of the print statement.

The print statement will output either `'YES'` or `'NO'` depending on the result of `func_1(a, x, k)`.

Given the information, we cannot provide a more precise description of the output without knowing the definition of `func_1`.

Output: **'YES' if func_1(a, x, k) returns True else 'NO'**
