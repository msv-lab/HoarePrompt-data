Output State: **`rest` is greater than or equal to `2 * delta`, `distance` is increased by 2, `pos` is equal to `pos + 2`, `delta` is equal to `min(rest - delta, a[sorted_indices[pos + 1]])`, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is equal to 0, `a[sorted_indices[pos + 1]]` is decreased by `delta`, `delta` is now `min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`, `pos` must be less than `len(sorted_indices) - 2`**.

Explanation:
- The initial state had `rest` greater than or equal to `2 * delta`.
- `distance` was increased by 2.
- `pos` was updated to `pos + 2`.
- `delta` was updated to `min(rest - delta, a[sorted_indices[pos + 1]])`.
- `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` was set to 0.
- `a[sorted_indices[pos + 1]]` was decreased by `delta`.
- The last line updates `delta` to `min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`.

The only change in the final state is that `delta` is now reassigned to `min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`. All other conditions and values remain as they were initially, except for the changes mentioned above.
