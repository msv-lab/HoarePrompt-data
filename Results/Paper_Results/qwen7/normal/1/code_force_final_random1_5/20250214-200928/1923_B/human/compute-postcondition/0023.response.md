Postcondition: **`distance` is 0, `pos` is either 1 or 2, the length of `sorted_indices` is greater than 0, the absolute value of `x[sorted_indices[pos]]` is now equal to `x[sorted_indices[pos]] - min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`, `rest` is `rest - delta`, `delta` is `min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`.**
