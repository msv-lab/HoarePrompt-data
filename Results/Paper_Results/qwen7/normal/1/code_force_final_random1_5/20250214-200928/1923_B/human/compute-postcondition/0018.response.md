Functionality: **The function accepts parameters t (an integer representing the number of test cases), n and k (integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^9), a (a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), and x (a list of n integers where -n ≤ x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_n ≤ n and x_i ≠ 0). The function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the given conditions.**

This means the function `func_2` takes in several parameters including the number of test cases, ranges for n and k, a list of integers a, and another list of integers x with specific constraints. It then performs some operations based on these inputs and returns a result accordingly.
