Postcondition: `rest` is equal to `rest - delta`, `distance` is increased by 2, `pos` is equal to `pos + 1`, `delta` is equal to `min(rest - delta, a[sorted_indices[pos + 1]])`, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is equal to 0, `a[sorted_indices[pos + 1]]` is decreased by `delta`, `delta` is now `min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`, `pos` is less than `len(sorted_indices) - 2`; `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is decreased by `delta`.

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block. If `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` equals 0, then `pos` is incremented by 1, and the subsequent conditions are applied. If `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is not 0, the else part does not change the state, so the same conditions as the if part remain.
