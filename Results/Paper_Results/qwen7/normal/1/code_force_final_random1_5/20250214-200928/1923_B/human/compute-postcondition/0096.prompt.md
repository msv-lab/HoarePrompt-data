Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `distance` is 0, `pos` is 0
Code of the loop:
while pos != len(sorted_indices):
    if abs(x[sorted_indices[pos]]) == distance:
        return False
    rest = k
    while rest != 0 and pos != len(sorted_indices):
        delta = min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])
        rest -= delta
        a[sorted_indices[pos]] -= delta
        if a[sorted_indices[pos]] == 0:
            pos += 1
    distance += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `distance` is 1, `pos` is either the last index of `sorted_indices` or one less than the last index, the length of `sorted_indices` is greater than 0, all elements in `a[sorted_indices]` are either 0 or decreased by their respective `delta` values, `rest` is 0.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `distance` is increased by 1, the loop continues to execute as long as `rest` is not zero and `pos` is less than the length of `sorted_indices`, after all iterations, `rest` will be reduced by the cumulative amount of `delta` values determined by the minimum of `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` for each iteration, `pos` will be incremented each time `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is reduced to zero, and the corresponding element in array `a` will be set to zero. The final state will have `rest` equal to the initial value minus the sum of all `delta` values determined during the loop's execution, `pos` will be the index just after the last non-zero element in `sorted_indices`, and `a[sorted_indices[pos-1]]` (if it was non-zero) will be reduced by the last `delta` value. All other variables (`distance`, `sorted_indices`, etc.) will remain in their initial state unless explicitly changed within the loop, which they are not.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: The `rest` variable is reduced to 0, `distance` has been increased by a total of 7 units (2 units per iteration for the first 3 iterations, and 1 unit per iteration for the next iteration), `pos` is either equal to `len(sorted_indices)` or one less than it (depending on whether `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` became zero before `rest` reached 0), and each element in `a` that was targeted by the loop has been decremented by its respective `delta` value. If an element in `a` was reduced to zero, it was skipped in subsequent iterations. The exact values of `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` will depend on how many times each index was decremented during the loop's execution.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
