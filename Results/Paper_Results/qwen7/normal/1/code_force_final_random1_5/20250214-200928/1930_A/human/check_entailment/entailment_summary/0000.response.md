Reasoning:
- The problem requires finding the maximum score by pairing the smallest available numbers together in each step.
- The given solution sorts the list of numbers and then sums up every second element starting from the first element. This approach pairs the smallest available numbers together, ensuring the minimum of each pair is maximized over all steps.
- Sorting the list ensures that the smallest numbers are paired first, which is optimal because it maximizes the score in each move.
- The loop iterates through the sorted list in steps of 2, summing the elements at even indices, which corresponds to pairing the smallest available numbers in each iteration.

Given this reasoning, the provided solution correctly implements the optimal strategy to maximize the score.

Correctness: **True**
