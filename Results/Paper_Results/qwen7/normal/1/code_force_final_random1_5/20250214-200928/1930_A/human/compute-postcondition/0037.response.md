Output State: The final value of `score` will be the sum of every second element in the list `l`, starting from the first element, and `l` remains a sorted list of integers. The variable `i` will be equal to `2 * n` after the loop completes, and `n` remains the input integer.

In simpler terms, the `score` variable will hold the sum of all elements in the list `l` that are at even indices (0, 2, 4, ..., up to the largest even index less than `2 * n`). The list `l` and the variable `n` will not change.
