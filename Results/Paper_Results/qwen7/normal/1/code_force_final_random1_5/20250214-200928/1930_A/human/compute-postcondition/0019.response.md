Output State: **`score` is `l[0]`, `l` is a sorted list of integers entered by the user, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1**

Explanation: The code `score += l[i]` increments the value of `score` by the value of `l[i]`. Given that `i` is initially 0, `score` is updated to be the value of `l[0]`. After this operation, `i` is incremented by 1, making it 1. All other variables remain unchanged, including the precondition that `n` must be greater than 0 and `l` is a sorted list of integers entered by the user.
