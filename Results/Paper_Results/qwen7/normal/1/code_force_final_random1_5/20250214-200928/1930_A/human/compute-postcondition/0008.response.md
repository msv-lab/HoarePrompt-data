Output State: **`score` is increased by the value of `l[i]`, `i` is the next even number (i.e., `i + 2`), `n` must be greater than 0, and `score` is now `score + l[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `score += l[i]` increments the value of `score` by the value of `l[i]`. The value of `i` remains the next even number (i.e., `i + 2`), and the condition that `n` must be greater than 0 is still valid.
