Output State: **`score` is 0 + the value of `l[i]`, `l` is a sorted list of integers, `i` must be less than `2 * n`, `n` is an input integer**.

This means that the score has been incremented by the value of `l[i]`, where `i` is an index that must be less than `2 * n`. The list `l` remains a sorted list of integers, and `n` remains an input integer.
