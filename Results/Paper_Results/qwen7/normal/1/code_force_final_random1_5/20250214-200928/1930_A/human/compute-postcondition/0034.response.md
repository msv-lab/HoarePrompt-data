Output State: **`score` is `score` (which is 0 + the value of `l[i]`) plus the value of `l[i]`, `l` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is `i + 2` and must be less than `2 * n`, `n` is an input integer.**

In natural language: The score is updated by adding the value of `l[i]` to the current score. The list `l` remains a sorted list of integers, `i` is incremented by 2, and `i` must still be less than `2 * n`. The value of `n` remains unchanged.
