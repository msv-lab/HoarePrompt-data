Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum final score according to the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the value of `n` and the `2n` integers from the whiteboard.

2. **Sorting**: The integers are sorted in ascending order. This ensures that when we take the minimum of two consecutive elements, we are always taking the smallest available pair, which helps maximize the score.

3. **Scoring Logic**: The program iterates over the sorted list in steps of 2, starting from the first element. By doing so, it effectively sums up the smaller elements of each pair, which is equivalent to summing up the minimum of each pair of elements. This is because the list is sorted, and the first element of each pair (when taken in steps of 2) is guaranteed to be the smaller of the two elements.

4. **Output**: The final score is printed for each test case, and the program correctly outputs the maximum possible score for each test case based on the given constraints.

Given that the program correctly handles the input, sorts the list appropriately, and sums the elements as required, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
