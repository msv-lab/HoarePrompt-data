Output State: **`score` is increased by the value of `l[i]`.**

In this case, the code `score += l[i]` increments the value of `score` by the value of `l[i]`. Since the initial values of `score` and `l[i]` are not specified, we can only say that `score` has been updated to its original value plus `l[i]`. The state of `l` and any other variables remains unchanged.
