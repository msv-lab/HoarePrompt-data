Output State: **`score` is the sum of every second element in the list `l`, starting from the first element, `l` is a sorted list of integers entered by the user, and `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code takes an input from the user, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, sorts the list, and assigns it to `l`. The value of `score` remains unchanged as it was defined before the code execution. The value of `n` also remains unchanged as it was defined before the code execution. Therefore, `score` is still the sum of every second element in the original list `l`, starting from the first element, `l` is now a sorted list of integers, and `n` is an input integer.
