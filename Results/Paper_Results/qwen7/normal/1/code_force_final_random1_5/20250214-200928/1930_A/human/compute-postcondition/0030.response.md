Output State: **`score` is 0, `l` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is 2*n, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The line `score = 0` initializes the variable `score` to 0. This does not affect the values of `l`, `i`, or `n`. The initial state of `score` being the sum of every second element in the list `l`, starting from the first element, up to the 2*n-1th index if `n` is within the bounds of the list length, remains unchanged because no elements of `l` have been accessed or modified, and `score` is explicitly set to 0.
