Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `r` is `r - 1`, `n` remains greater than 0, `l` remains the same, `a` is equal to `A[l]`, `x` is `r - (l + 2)`, `b` is equal to `B[r - 1]`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `B[r - 1]` to the variable `b`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `i` is `i + 1`, `r` is `r - 1`, `n` remains greater than 0, `l` remains the same, `a` is equal to `A[l]`, `x` is `r - (l + 2)`, and `b` is now equal to `B[r - 1]`.
