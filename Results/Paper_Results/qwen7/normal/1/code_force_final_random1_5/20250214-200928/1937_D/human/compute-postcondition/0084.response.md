Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - The character at index `i` of string `s` is '>'.
   - `l` is less than `r`.
   - `b` is defined as `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`.
   - `x` is greater than or equal to 0.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1, end=' ')
   ```

From the initial state, we know:
- `i` is explicitly given as 0.
- `b` is defined as `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`. Since `i` is 0, this simplifies to `(idx_B[r - 1]) * (l + 1)`.
- `x` is greater than or equal to 0, but it is not used in the expression being printed.
- `a` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its value.

Given the expression `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1`:
- `i` is 0, so `i + 1` is 1.
- `b` is `(idx_B[r - 1]) * (l + 1)`, but since `l` is less than `r`, `l + 1` is a positive integer, and `idx_B[r - 1]` is an integer from the list `idx_B`.

Since `a` is not defined, we cannot determine its exact value, but it will be multiplied by 2. Therefore, the expression will be something like `2*a + 2*(idx_B[r - 1] * (l + 1)) + 1`.

However, without the exact value of `a`, we can only describe the components of the expression.

Output: **2*a + 2*(idx_B[r - 1] * (l + 1)) + 1**
