Output State: **`i` is `i + 1` if `i` was not 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is the value of `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `a` by adding `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l` to the current value of `a`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state. Specifically, `i` is incremented by 1 if it was not 0 initially, `n` must still be greater than 0, `r` is decreased by 1, and `a` is updated to include the new value calculated from the expression `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`.
