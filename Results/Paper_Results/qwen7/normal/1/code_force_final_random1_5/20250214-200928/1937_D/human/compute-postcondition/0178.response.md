Output State: **`i` is `i + 1` if `i` was not 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is the value of `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, `b` is the value of `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)`**.

This means that the value of `b` has been updated by subtracting `(idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)` from its previous value, which was `B[r] - B[r - l]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
