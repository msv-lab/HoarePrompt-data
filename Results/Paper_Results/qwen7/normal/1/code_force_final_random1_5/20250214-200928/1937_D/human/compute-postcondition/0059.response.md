Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is 1
   - `i` is `n - 3`
   - `idx_B` is `[i]`
   - `B` is a list containing 0 if `idx_B` was empty, otherwise `B` is `[x]` where `x` is `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `j = 0` to `j < n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 and should still be less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be 2.
   - The value of `i` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - The value of `idx_B` and `B` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`j` is 2, `i` is `n - 3`, `idx_B` is `[i]`, `B` is a list containing 0 if `idx_B` was empty, otherwise `B` is `[x]` where `x` is `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`**.
