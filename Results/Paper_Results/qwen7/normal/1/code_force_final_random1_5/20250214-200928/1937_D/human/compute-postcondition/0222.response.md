Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `i + 1`: This means `i` has been incremented by 1.
- `r` is `r - 1`: This means `r` has been decremented by 1.
- `n` remains greater than 0: The value of `n` is still greater than 0 but its exact value is not specified.
- `l` remains the same: The value of `l` has not changed.
- `a` and `b` retain their original values: The values of `a` and `b` have not changed from their initial states.

The print statement is:
```python
print(i + 1, end=' ')
```

Here, `i + 1` is evaluated. Since `i` was already `i + 1` before this line, `i + 1` would be the new value of `i`. Therefore, the expression `i + 1` evaluates to the new value of `i`.

Given the format requirement, the output should be:

Output: **new value of i**
