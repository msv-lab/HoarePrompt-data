Postcondition: `i` is either 0 or increased by 1, `n` is greater than 0, `r` is decreased by 1 at least once, `l` is 0 in the first case where `l <= r` is true, and in the second case where `l > r`, `a` is the value of `A[l - 1] + (0 - idx_A[l - 1]) * l` or `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)` if `r - l` is greater than or equal to 0, `b` is the value of `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)` or `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`, and `r` is decreased by 1.
