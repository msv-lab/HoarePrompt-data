Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variables in the given `for` loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is either 0 or increased by 1.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `r` is decreased by 1 at least once.
   - `l` is 0 if `l <= r` is true, otherwise `a` is the value of `A[l - 1] + (0 - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`.
   - `b` is the value of `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)` if `r - l` is greater than or equal to 0, and `r` is decreased by 1. If `r` becomes 0, then `r` remains 0, otherwise `a` is the value of `B[r]`, and `b` is the value of `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`.

4. **Determine the adjustments needed**:
   - Since the loop runs as long as `i < n`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be increased by 1.
   - `n` does not change within the loop, so it remains the same.
   - `r` is decreased by 1 at least once per iteration, so it will be decreased by 1 again.
   - `l`, `a`, and `b` are dependent on the values of `r` and other conditions, but they are not directly controlled by the loop itself.

5. **Final state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be increased by 1 from its current value.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `r` will be decreased by 1 from its current value.

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `i` is increased by 1, `n` is greater than 0, `r` is decreased by 1.**

To express this clearly:

**State: `i` is 1 (if previously it was 0 or increased by 1), `n` is greater than 0, `r` is decreased by 1.**
