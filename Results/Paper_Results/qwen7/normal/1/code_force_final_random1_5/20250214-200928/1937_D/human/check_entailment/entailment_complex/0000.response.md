Reasoning:
1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1` is designed to process a string `s` consisting of characters '<' and '>' to compute the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell.
2. **First Loop (`A` Calculation)**: This loop calculates the cumulative lengths of segments between '>' characters. It correctly updates `A` and `idx_A` as required.
3. **Second Loop (`B` Calculation)**: This loop calculates the cumulative lengths of segments between '<' characters, but it starts from the end of the string and works backwards. This ensures that the calculation considers the correct segments for each position.
4. **Main Loop**: This loop processes each character in `s` and uses the precomputed values in `A` and `B` to calculate the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid. The logic inside this loop correctly handles both '>' and '<' characters and updates the output accordingly.
5. **Edge Cases**: The function handles edge cases such as when there are no '>' or '<' characters, or when the pinball starts at the boundary of the grid.

Given the detailed structure and the logical flow of the function, it appears that the function correctly implements the required logic to solve the problem. The function processes the string `s` and calculates the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting cell, which matches the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
