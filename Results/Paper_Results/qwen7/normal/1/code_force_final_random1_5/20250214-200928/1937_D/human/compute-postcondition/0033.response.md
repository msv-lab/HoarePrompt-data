Output State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows: `s` is a string of length `n`, `A` is a list containing the cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '>' characters in `s`, and `idx_A` is a list containing the indices of '>' characters in `s`. Specifically, each element in `A` represents the sum of the lengths of all segments between '>' characters up to that point, and each element in `idx_A` contains the indices where '>' characters are found.

For example, if `s` is "><>>><", the final states would be:
- `A` would be `[0, 1, 3, 6, 9, 11, 15]`
- `idx_A` would be `[0, 2, 4, 5, 6]`

This means that after processing all characters in `s`, `A` captures the total length of segments between '>' characters cumulatively, and `idx_A` records the positions of all '>' characters in the string.
