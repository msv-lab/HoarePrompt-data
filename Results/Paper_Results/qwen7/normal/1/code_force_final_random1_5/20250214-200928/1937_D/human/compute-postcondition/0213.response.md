Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `r` is `r - 1`, `n` remains greater than 0, `l` remains the same, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, `b` is `b - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b` by subtracting `(idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)` from its current value. The other variables (`i`, `r`, `n`, `l`, `a`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
