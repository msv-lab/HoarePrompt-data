The function processes a string `s` consisting of characters '<' and '>' to calculate and print a series of values. For each character in `s`, if it is '>', it computes a value based on the cumulative lengths of segments between '>' characters and prints it. If the character is '<', it computes a different value based on the cumulative lengths of segments between '<' characters and also prints it. The function does not return any value but modifies the output directly through printing.
