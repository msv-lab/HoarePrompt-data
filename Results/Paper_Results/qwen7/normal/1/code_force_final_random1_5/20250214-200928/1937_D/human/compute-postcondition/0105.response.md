Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, the character at index `i` of string `s` is '>', `b` is either `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)` when `l < r` is true, or `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (0 - idx_A[l - 1]) * r` if `l - r > 0`, or `A[l - 1] + (0 - idx_A[l - 1]) * r` if `l - r <= 0`, and `l` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `l` is incremented by 1, while the other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
