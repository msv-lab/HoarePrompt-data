Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `r` is `r - 1`, `n` remains greater than 0, `l` remains the same, `a` is equal to `B[r]`, `b` retains its original value.**

Explanation: The code `a = B[r]` assigns the value of `B[r]` to the variable `a`. The other variables (`i`, `r`, `n`, `l`, and `b`) remain unchanged according to the initial state and the given code snippet.
