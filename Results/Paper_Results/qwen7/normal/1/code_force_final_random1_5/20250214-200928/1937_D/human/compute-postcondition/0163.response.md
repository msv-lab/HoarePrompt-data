Output State: **`i` is `i + 1` if `i` was not 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r, `b` is A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1]**.

Explanation: The code subtracts `A[l - r - 1]` from `b`. The values of `i`, `n`, `r`, `a`, and `b` are updated accordingly. The other conditions and values remain unchanged.
