Output State: **`i` is `i + 1` if `i` was not 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `r` is decreased by 1**.

This means that:
- If `i` was 0, it will become 1.
- If `i` was not 0, it will increase by 1.
- `n` remains greater than 0.
- `r` decreases by 1.

For example, if at the end of the previous iteration `i` was 2, `n` was 5, and `r` was 4, then after executing `r -= 1`:
- `i` will be 3.
- `n` remains 5.
- `r` will be 3.
