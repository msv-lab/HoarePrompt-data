Postcondition: `i` is incremented by 1, `r` is decremented by 1, and `n` remains greater than 0. `l` and `a` retain their original values. Depending on the value of `l` relative to `r`:
- If `l <= r`, then:
  - If `l == 0`, `a` and `b` remain unchanged.
  - If `l > 0`, `a` is updated to `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, and `b` is updated to `B[r - 1] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`.
- If `l > r`, then `a` is set to `B[r]`, and `b` is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`.
