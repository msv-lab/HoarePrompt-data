Postcondition: `i` is `i + 1` if `i` was not 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `r` is decreased by 1, and depending on whether `l` is 0 or not, either:
- If `l` is 0, then `a` is the value of `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, `b` is the value of `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`, and `a` and `b` retain their original values otherwise.
- If `l` is not 0, then `a` is the value of `B[r]`, `b` is the value of `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`, and `l - r - 1` is not greater than 0.
