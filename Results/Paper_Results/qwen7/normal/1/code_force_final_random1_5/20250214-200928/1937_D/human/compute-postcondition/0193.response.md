Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `i` is `i + 1` if `i` was not 0: This means `i` is incremented by 1 if it was not initially 0. If `i` was 0, then `i` remains 0.
   - `n` must be greater than 0: This means `n` is a positive integer.
   - `r` is decreased by 1: This means `r` is one less than its previous value.
   - `a` is the value of `B[r]`: Here, `a` is the element at index `r` in the list `B`.
   - `b` is the value of `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`: This means `b` is updated by adding `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)` to its current value.
   - `l - r - 1` is not greater than 0: This implies `l - r - 1 <= 0`, so `l` is either equal to `r + 1` or less than `r + 1`.

2. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   - The print statement is `print(a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i), end=' ')`.
   - We need to determine the values of `a`, `b`, and `n - i`.

Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, let's assume the following:
- `i` is incremented by 1 if it was not 0, so let's assume `i = 1` (the simplest non-zero case).
- `n` is a positive integer, let's assume `n = 5` (an arbitrary but positive value).
- `r` is decremented by 1, so if `r` was initially 3, now `r = 2`.
- `a` is the value of `B[r]`, so `a = B[2]`.
- `b` is updated by adding `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)` to its current value. Since `l - r - 1 <= 0`, `l` is either `r + 1` or less than `r + 1`. Let's assume `l = r + 1 = 3` and `idx_A[2]` is some value, say `idx_A[2] = 1`. Then `b` would be updated by adding `(1 - 1) * (2 + 1) = 0` to its current value, so `b` remains unchanged.

Thus, the expression `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)` simplifies to:
- `a * 2` is `2 * B[2]`.
- `b * 2` is `2 * b` (unchanged from its previous value).
- `n - i` is `5 - 1 = 4`.

Therefore, the print statement will output:
Output: **2 * B[2] + 2 * b + 4**
