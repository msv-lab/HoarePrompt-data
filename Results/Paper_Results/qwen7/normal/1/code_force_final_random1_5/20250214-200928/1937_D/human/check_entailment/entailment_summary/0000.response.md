Reasoning:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by breaking down the string into segments based on the direction of movement ('<' or '>') and calculating the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell. However, upon closer inspection, the logic in the program does not correctly simulate the movement and inversion of directions as described in the problem statement.

1. **Segment Calculation**: The program tries to calculate the time taken for a pinball to leave the grid by breaking the string into segments where the direction is consistent ('<' or '>'). This part of the logic seems to be partially correct but is not fully implemented.

2. **Time Calculation**: The program attempts to calculate the time based on the segments, but the formula used is overly complex and does not accurately reflect the movement and inversion rules. Specifically, the calculations involving `A` and `B` lists do not correctly account for the movement and inversion of directions.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when the pinball starts at the boundary cells or when the entire string is a single segment.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the rules described in the problem statement. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
