Postcondition: `i` is either 0 or increased by 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is the value of `A[l - 1] + (0 - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, and `b` is the value of `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)` if `r - l` is greater than or equal to 0, and the current value of `l` is 0 if the if condition is true, otherwise `l` remains less than or equal to `r` and `i` is increased by 1.
