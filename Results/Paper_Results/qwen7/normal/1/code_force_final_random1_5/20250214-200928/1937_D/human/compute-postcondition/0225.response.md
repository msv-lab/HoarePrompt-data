Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `r` is `r - 1`, `n` remains greater than 0, `l` remains the same, `a` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, `b` is `B[r - 1]`**.

This means that the value of `b` is updated to `B[r - 1]`. All other variables retain their previous values: `i` is `i + 1`, `r` is `r - 1`, `n` remains greater than 0, `l` remains the same, and `a` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`.
