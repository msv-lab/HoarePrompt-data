Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `r` is `r - 1`, `n` remains greater than 0, `l` remains the same, `a` is equal to `A[l]`, `x` is `r - (l + 2)`, `b` is equal to `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)` if `x >= 0`, otherwise `b` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code updates `b` to `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`. This expression replaces the previous definition of `b` only if `x >= 0`. Since `x` is defined as `r - (l + 2)`, we substitute this into the condition to determine if `b` changes. However, since the exact values of `i`, `r`, `l`, `A[l]`, `idx_B[r - 1]`, and `idx_B[x]` are not specified, we cannot simplify further. Therefore, `b` is updated to the new expression if `x >= 0`, and remains unchanged otherwise.
