Output State: **`x` is 7, `s` is a string of length `n`, `A` is a list containing `[0, 2, 4, 2, 7]`, `idx_A` is a list containing `[0, 2, 2]`, and `i` is 3.**

Explanation: The code `A.append(x)` appends the value of `x`, which is 7, to the list `A`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `A` now contains the elements `[0, 2, 4, 2, 7]`.
