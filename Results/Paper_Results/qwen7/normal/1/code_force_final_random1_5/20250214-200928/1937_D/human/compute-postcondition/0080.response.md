Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, the character at index `i` of string `s` is '>', and `l` is less than `r`; `b` is `B[r - 1] - B[x] - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)`, and `x` is greater than or equal to 0.**

Explanation: The variable `b` is updated by subtracting `(idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)` from its current value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
