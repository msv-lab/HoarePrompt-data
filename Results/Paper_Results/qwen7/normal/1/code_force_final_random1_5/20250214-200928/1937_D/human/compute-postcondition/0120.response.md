Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is the value of `A[l - 1] + (0 - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, `b` is the value of `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)`, and `r - l` is greater than or equal to 0.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b` by subtracting `(idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)` from its current value. All other variables remain unchanged. The updated value of `b` is now `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)`.
