Output State: **`j` is 2, `i` is `n - 4`, `idx_B` is `[i, n - 4]`, `B` is `[0]`**

Explanation: Initially, `j` is 2, `i` is `n - 4`, `idx_B` is `[i]`, and `B` is a list containing 0 because `idx_B` is not empty. After executing `B.append(0)`, the value of `B` changes to `[0]`. The values of `j`, `i`, and `idx_B` remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes `j` is 2, `i` is `n - 4`, `idx_B` is `[i, n - 4]`, and `B` is `[0]`.
