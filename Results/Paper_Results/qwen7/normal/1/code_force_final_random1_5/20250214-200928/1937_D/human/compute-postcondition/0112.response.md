Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 0
- `n` must be greater than 0 (though `n` itself is not needed for the print statement)
- `r` is decreased by 1 (though the exact value of `r` is not needed for the print statement)
- The current value of `l` is 0

The print statement is:
```python
print(i + 1, end=' ')
```

Here, `i` is explicitly given as 0. Therefore, `i + 1` will be `0 + 1`, which equals 1.

Output: **1**
