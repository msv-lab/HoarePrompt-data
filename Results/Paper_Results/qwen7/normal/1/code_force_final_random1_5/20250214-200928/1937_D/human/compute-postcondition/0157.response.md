Postcondition: `a` is equal to `A[l]`, `i` is `i + 1` if `i` was not 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `r` is decreased by 1, `b` is `B[r - 1] - B[x] - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)`. If `x` is greater than or equal to 0, `b` is updated to `B[r - 1] - B[x] - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)`. Since there is no else part, the value of `b` remains unchanged if `x` is less than 0.
