Output State: **`j` is 2, `i` is `n - 4`, `idx_B` is `[i]`, `B` is `[x, 2 * (n - 4)]`, where `x` is `2 * (n - 4)`**.

Explanation: The code `B.append(x)` appends the value of `x` to the list `B`. Given that `x` is `2 * (n - 4)`, the updated list `B` will have both its original element and the new appended element. The other variables (`j`, `i`, `idx_B`) remain unchanged.
