Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `r` is `r - 1`, `n` remains greater than 0, `l` remains the same, `a` is equal to `A[l]`, `x` is `r - (l + 2)`, `b` is equal to `B[r - 1] - B[x] - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b` by subtracting `(idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)` from the current value of `b`. Since `x` is defined as `r - (l + 2)`, `idx_B[x]` is `idx_B[r - (l + 2)]`, and `idx_B[r - 1]` remains unchanged, the updated value of `b` is the original value of `b` minus the specified expression. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
