Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine the k-th card that Vladislav lays down according to the specified rules. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading `n` and `k`.

2. **Card Distribution Logic**:
   - The program calculates how many cards are laid down at each step by determining the number of odd multiples up to `n`.
   - It uses a list `L` to store the count of cards laid down at each step.
   - For each step, it calculates the number of cards (`m`) that can be laid down and updates `n` accordingly.

3. **Finding the k-th Card**:
   - After determining the distribution of cards, the program iterates over the counts stored in `L` to find the exact card that corresponds to the k-th position.
   - It uses the variable `tot` to keep track of the cumulative count of cards laid down and `pow` to keep track of the multiplier for the current step.

4. **Output**:
   - If `k` falls within the range of cards laid down at the current step, it calculates the exact card using the formula `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)` and prints it.
   - It then updates `tot` and `pow` for the next iteration.

The program correctly handles the constraints and examples provided, making it a valid solution to the problem.
