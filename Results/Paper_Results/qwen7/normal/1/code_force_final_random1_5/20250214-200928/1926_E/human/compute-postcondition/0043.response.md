Output State: **`a` is 1, `L` is a list containing the values [1, 0, 1], `tot` is 1, `pow` is 8, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and splits them by whitespace, converting each to an integer. These values are then assigned to `n` and `k`. The initial values of `a`, `L`, `tot`, and `pow` remain unchanged.
