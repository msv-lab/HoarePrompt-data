Output State: **`a` is 0, `L` is a list containing the values [1, 0, 1], `tot` is 0, `pow` is multiplied by 2.**

The code `pow *= 2` multiplies the value of `pow` by 2. However, since `pow` is not defined before this line of code, it is assumed to be 1 (the default value when a variable is used without assignment). After executing the code, `pow` becomes 2. The values of `a`, `L`, and `tot` remain unchanged.
