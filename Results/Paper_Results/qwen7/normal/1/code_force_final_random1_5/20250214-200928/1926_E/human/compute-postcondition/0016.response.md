Output State: `n` is now 0, `k` is an integer equal to the second input number, `L` is a list containing 0 and `(n + 1) // 2` repeated until the total length of `L` equals the number of iterations the loop executed.

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `n` is non-zero. After each iteration, `n` is reduced by `m`, where `m` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`. This process continues until `n` becomes 0. At this point, the loop terminates. The list `L` accumulates the values of `m` from each iteration. Given that the loop executes until `n` reaches 0, and considering the provided output states after 1, 2, and 3 iterations, it's clear that once `n` is reduced to 0, no further elements are appended to `L`. Thus, the final state has `n` as 0, `k` remains unchanged, and `L` contains the sequence of `m` values generated during the loop's execution.
