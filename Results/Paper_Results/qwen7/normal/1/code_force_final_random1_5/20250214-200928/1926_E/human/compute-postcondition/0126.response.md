Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it receives test cases where each test case contains three integers: t, n, and k. For each test case, if 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4, and n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, the function processes these values and returns some output based on these constraints.**

This means the function is designed to validate and process a series of test cases, each containing t, n, and k, ensuring they meet specific criteria before performing some operation (though the exact operation is not detailed here).
