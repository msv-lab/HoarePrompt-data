Output State: **`n` must be non-zero, `k` is an integer equal to the second input number, `L` is an empty list, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `(n + 1) // 2` to the variable `m`. Since `n` is non-zero and `k` is an integer equal to the second input number, their states remain unchanged. The list `L` remains empty. The value of `m` is calculated based on the current value of `n`.
