Output State: **`a` is 1, `L` is an empty list, `tot` is 1, `pow` is 8, `n` is an input integer and `n` must be non-zero, `k` is an input integer, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`**.

The value of `m` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`, where `n` is an input integer and must be non-zero. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
