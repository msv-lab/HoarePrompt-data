Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of three integers: the number of test cases \(t\), an integer \(n\), and an integer \(k\). For each test case, it calculates and prints an integer based on the values of \(n\) and \(k\). Specifically, it constructs a list \(L\) by repeatedly dividing \(n\) by 2 and appending the result to \(L\) until \(n\) becomes 0. Then, it iterates over the list \(L\), determining the appropriate value to print based on the cumulative sum of elements in \(L\) and the value of \(k\). Finally, it returns no explicit value but outputs the calculated results for each test case.**
