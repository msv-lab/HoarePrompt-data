Output State: **`n` is now `n - (n + 1) // 2`, `k` is an integer equal to the second input number, `L` is a list containing 0 and `m`, `m` is equal to `(n + 1) // 2`.**

Explanation: The value of `n` is updated to `n - (n + 1) // 2`. Since `m` is defined as `(n + 1) // 2`, `n` is reduced by this value. The values of `k` and `L` remain unchanged from their initial state.
