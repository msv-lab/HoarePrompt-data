Output State: `a` is 1, `L` is [4, 1, 2, 1], `tot` is 1, `pow` is 8, `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer.

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `n` is non-zero. After the first three iterations, `n` becomes 0. Therefore, the loop will stop executing. The list `L` will contain the values `[4, 1, 2, 1]` because the loop appends `m` to `L` in each iteration. Since `n` is now 0, it will not change further, and the value of `k` remains as an input integer, unchanged by the loop.
