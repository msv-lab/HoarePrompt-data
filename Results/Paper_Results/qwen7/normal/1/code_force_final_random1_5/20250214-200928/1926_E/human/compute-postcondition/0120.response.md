Output State: **`a` is 2, `L` is [2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], `pow` is 4, `tot` is incremented by 10.**

Explanation: The code `tot += a` increments the value of `tot` by the value of `a`, which is 2. Since the initial value of `tot` was incremented by 8, the new value of `tot` is 8 + 2 = 10. The values of `a`, `L`, and `pow` remain unchanged.
