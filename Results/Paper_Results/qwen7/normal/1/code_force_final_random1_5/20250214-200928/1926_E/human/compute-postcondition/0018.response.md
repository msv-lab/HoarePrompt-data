Output State: **`n` is 0, `k` is an integer equal to the second input number, `L` is a list containing the values [1, 0, 1], `tot` is 0**.

Explanation: The loop runs until `n` becomes 0. Given that `n` starts at 0 and the loop condition is `n != 0`, the loop does not execute in this case. However, since the problem states that the output state after 3 iterations shows `n` is 0, we infer that the loop would have run 3 times if `n` started with a non-zero value. Each iteration reduces `n` by `m`, where `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`. Since `n` is 0, `m` would be 1 for the first two iterations (when `n` is 1 or 2), and 0 for the last iteration (when `n` is 0). The list `L` contains these values of `m` from each iteration. The variable `tot` remains unchanged at 0 since no addition or subtraction operation is performed on it in the given code snippet.
