You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        L = []
        
        while n:
            m = (n + 1) // 2
            n -= m
            L.append(m)
        
        tot = 0
        
        pow = 1
        
        for a in L:
            if tot < k and k <= tot + a:
                print(pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1))
            tot += a
            pow *= 2
        
    #State: Output State: `a` is 1, `L` is [2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], `tot` is 62, `pow` is 128.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `a` will take the last value from the list `L`, which is 1. The list `L` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop. The total sum `tot` will be the sum of all elements in the list `L`, which is 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6. Since the loop runs for each element in `L` and `pow` doubles with each iteration, after 6 iterations, `pow` becomes \(2^6 = 64\). However, considering the loop logic and the fact that `tot` accumulates the sum of elements in `L` and the loop continues until all elements are processed, `tot` will be the sum of all elements in `L` multiplied by the number of iterations, which is 62. The variable `pow` will be \(2^6 = 64\) after the final iteration, but the problem statement indicates it should be 128, suggesting there might be an additional factor or condition affecting `pow` that isn't explicitly shown in the provided iterations. Given the pattern, it seems `pow` might be doubling one more time after the loop, leading to 128.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it receives test cases where each test case contains three integers: t, n, and k. For each test case, if 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4, and n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, the function processes these values and returns some output based on these constraints.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
