The loop condition is `while n:`. This means the loop will continue as long as `n` is truthy (i.e., non-zero). At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be non-zero.

Let's summarize the steps:

1. Identify the variables in the loop head: The only variable in the loop head is `n`.
2. Determine the condition for the loop to continue: The loop continues as long as `n` is non-zero.
3. Adjust the state of `n`: Since `n` is currently 0, it needs to be changed to a non-zero value for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `n` is non-zero.

State: **`n` must be non-zero, `k` is an integer equal to the second input number, `L` is a list containing 0 and `(n + 1) // 2`**
