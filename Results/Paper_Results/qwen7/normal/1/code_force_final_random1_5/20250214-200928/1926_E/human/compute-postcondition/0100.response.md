Output State: **`a` is 1, `L` is [2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], `tot` is 0, `k` is between 8 and 12, `pow` is 32, `m` is 1, `n` is 0**

Explanation: The code sets `tot` to 0. This changes the value of `tot` from its initial value of 12 to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the updated values are as stated above.
