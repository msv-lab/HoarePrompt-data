You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n cards numbered 1, 2, \dots, n . He wants to lay them down in a
row as follows:

  * First, he lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest. 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 2 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 3 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 3 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 4 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 4 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * And so on, until all cards are laid down. 

What is the k -th card he lays down in this process? Once Vladislav puts a
card down, he cannot use that card again.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n
\leq 10^9 ) — the number of cards Vlad has, and the position of the card you
need to output.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the k -th card Vladislav lays
down.

Note

In the first seven test cases, n=7 . Vladislav lays down the cards as follows:

  * First — all the odd-numbered cards in the order 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . 
  * Next — all cards that are twice an odd number in the order 2 , 6 . 
  * Next, there are no remaining cards that are 3 times an odd number. (Vladislav has only one of each card.) 
  * Next — all cards that are 4 times an odd number, and there is only one such card: 4 . 
  * There are no more cards left, so Vladislav stops. 

Thus the order of cards is 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 2 , 6 , 4 .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        L = []
        while n:
            m = (n + 1) // 2
            n -= m
            L.append(m)
        tot = 0
        pow = 1
        for a in L:
            if tot < k and k <= tot + a:
                print(pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1))
            tot += a
            pow *= 2

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9.

    #State: Output State: `a` is 1, `L` is [2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], `tot` is 62, `pow` is 128.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `a` will take the last value from the list `L`, which is 1. The list `L` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop. The total sum `tot` will be the sum of all elements in the list `L`, which is 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6. Since the loop runs for each element in `L` and `pow` doubles with each iteration, after 6 iterations, `pow` becomes \(2^6 = 64\). However, considering the loop logic and the fact that `tot` accumulates the sum of elements in `L` and the loop continues until all elements are processed, `tot` will be the sum of all elements in `L` multiplied by the number of iterations, which is 62. The variable `pow` will be \(2^6 = 64\) after the final iteration, but the problem statement indicates it should be 128, suggesting there might be an additional factor or condition affecting `pow` that isn't explicitly shown in the provided iterations. Given the pattern, it seems `pow` might be doubling one more time after the loop, leading to 128.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.

2. **Building the List `L`:**
   - The list `L` is built to store the number of cards laid down at each step.
   - In each iteration of the `while` loop, `m` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`, which represents the number of cards laid down in the current step.
   - `n` is then updated by subtracting `m`.
   - This continues until `n` becomes zero.

3. **Calculating the k-th Card:**
   - `tot` is initialized to 0, and `pow` is set to 1.
   - The program iterates over the list `L` and checks if `k` falls within the range `[tot, tot + a]` for each element `a` in `L`.
   - If `k` is within this range, it calculates the k-th card using the formula `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)` and prints it.
   - `tot` is updated by adding `a` to it, and `pow` is doubled.

### Correctness Check

1. **Building the List `L`:**
   - The list `L` correctly stores the number of cards laid down at each step.
   - Each step corresponds to multiplying an odd number by a power of 2.

2. **Calculating the k-th Card:**
   - The logic for determining the k-th card is correct.
   - The formula `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)` correctly identifies the card based on the current step and the position `k`.

3. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `n` might be small enough to complete all steps without needing to check further.
   - It correctly identifies the position of the k-th card in the sequence.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program, we can conclude that it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. The program accurately determines the k-th card laid down by Vladislav.
