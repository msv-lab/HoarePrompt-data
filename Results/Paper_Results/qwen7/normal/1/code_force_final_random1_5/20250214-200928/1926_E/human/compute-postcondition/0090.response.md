The loop condition is `n`. Since the loop is `while n`, the loop will continue as long as `n` is truthy (non-zero). At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is 1, which is truthy. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for `n` to ensure the loop executes one more time.

No other states need to be adjusted because they are not part of the loop head conditions.

State: **`a` is 1, `L` is [2], `tot` is 12, `k` is between 8 and 12, `pow` is 32, `m` is 2, `n` is 1**
