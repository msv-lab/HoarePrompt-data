Based on the initial state provided:

- `m` must be greater than 0.
- `x` is an input integer.
- `y` is an input integer, and the current value of `y` is greater than `x`.

We need to determine the value of `d1[y] - d1[x]` where `d1` is a dictionary. However, the initial state does not provide any specific values or formulas for the keys and values of `d1`. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact numerical result of `d1[y] - d1[x]`. 

Given this, the output will be a reference to the difference between the values in the dictionary `d1` at keys `y` and `x`.

Output: **d1[y] - d1[x]**
