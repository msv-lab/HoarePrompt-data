Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `j` is equal to `m-1`, `i` is equal to `m`, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. The values of `m`, `j`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `m` must still be greater than 0, `j` is still equal to `m-1`, and `i` is still equal to `m`. The variable `n` now holds the value of the integer input provided by the user.
