Output State: **`d1[i + 2]` is assigned the value `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]`, `i` is at least 1 and less than `n`, `n` is an input integer, and `(l[i + 1] - l[i] >= l[i] - l[i - 1])`**.

This means that the value of `d1[i + 2]` is updated to be the sum of `l[i + 1] - l[i]` and `d1[i + 1]`. The conditions on `i`, `n`, and the relationship between elements in list `l` remain unchanged.
