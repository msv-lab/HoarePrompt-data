Based on the initial state provided:

- `m` must be greater than 0.
- `x` is an input integer.
- `y` is an input integer.
- `j` is 1 more than the previous value of `j`.
- `x` is the first integer input.
- `y` is the second integer input.

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(d1[y] - d1[x])`.

From the initial state, we know:
- `x` and `y` are input integers.
- `j` is not directly relevant to the `print` statement.
- `d1` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it is assumed to be a dictionary where `d1[y]` and `d1[x]` are keys.

Since `d1` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact values of `d1[y]` and `d1[x]`. However, we can describe the expression that will be evaluated.

The expression `d1[y] - d1[x]` will subtract the value associated with key `y` in dictionary `d1` from the value associated with key `x` in dictionary `d1`.

Therefore, the output will be the result of this subtraction operation.

Output: **d1[y] - d1[x]**
