Output State: **`i` is 3; `n` is greater than 3; `d1[i + 2]` is `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]`**

Explanation: The code updates the dictionary `d1` by setting the key `i + 2` (which is 5) to the value `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]` (which is `l[4] - l[3] + d1[4]`). The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged, and the list `l` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, `i` is still 3, `n` is still greater than 3, and `d1[5]` is set to `l[4] - l[3] + d1[4]`.
