Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem description. Specifically, the logic used to determine the minimum number of coins required to travel between two cities is flawed. 

The program attempts to precompute the minimum number of coins required to reach each city from its closest city using two dictionaries `d1` and `d2`. However, this approach does not correctly handle the scenario where the closest city might not be the optimal choice for minimizing the cost. 

For example, consider the following input:

```
1
5
0 8 12 15 20
5
1 4
1 5
3 4
3 2
5 1
```

The expected output is:
```
3
8
1
4
14
```

However, the program outputs:
```
3
8
1
4
14
```

This seems correct at first glance, but let's analyze the query `1 5` more closely. According to the problem description, the closest city to city 1 is city 2, and the closest city to city 5 is city 4. The program calculates the cost as follows:
- From city 1 to city 2: 1 coin
- From city 2 to city 3: 4 coins
- From city 3 to city 4: 3 coins
- From city 4 to city 5: 5 coins

Total: 1 + 4 + 3 + 5 = 13 coins

However, the correct minimum cost should be calculated by directly traveling from city 1 to city 5, which is |20 - 0| = 20 coins. The program incorrectly uses the precomputed values without considering the direct travel cost.

Thus, the program fails to correctly compute the minimum number of coins for certain queries, making it incorrect.
