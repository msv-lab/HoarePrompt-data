The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads a positive integer \( t \), an integer \( n \), a list \( a \) of \( n \) non-negative integers in strictly increasing order, an integer \( m \), and a series of pairs \( (x_i, y_i) \). It then calculates and prints the difference between certain values stored in two dictionaries, \( d1 \) and \( d2 \), based on the positions \( x_i \) and \( y_i \) in the list \( a \). The dictionaries \( d1 \) and \( d2 \) store cumulative differences derived from the list \( a \). The function does not return any value but prints the results for each query.
