Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `j` is equal to `m-1`, `i` is equal to `m`, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers entered by the user split from a single input string, `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`.**

Explanation: The code initializes `d2` as a defaultdict with the default factory set to `int`. This means `d2` can hold integer values by default. However, no operations are performed on `d2` that would change its contents or affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the initial conditions for all variables remain unchanged.
