Output State: **`i` is `n-3`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2 and greater than `m+1`, `d2[n-1]` is 1, `d2[i]` is `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `d2[i]` to `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still `n-3`, `n` is still greater than or equal to 2 and greater than `m+1`, and `d2[n-1]` remains 1. The updated value of `d2[i]` is expressed as `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`.
