Output State: **`d2[i]` is `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`, `i` is `n-3`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `d2[i]` to `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`. The value of `i` remains `n-3` as no operation changes its value. The condition used to determine the original value of `d2[i]` is no longer relevant since the value has been explicitly set by the code.
