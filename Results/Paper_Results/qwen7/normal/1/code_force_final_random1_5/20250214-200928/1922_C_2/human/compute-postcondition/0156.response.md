Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` is greater than 4, and `d1[7]` is 1 + `d1[6]`.**

Explanation: The code updates `d1[i + 2]` to `1 + d1[i + 1]`. Given that `i` is 4, `i + 2` becomes 6 and `i + 1` becomes 5. Therefore, `d1[7]` (since the index is off by one due to the initial state's condition) is set to `1 + d1[6]`. The values of `n` and the condition for `d1[5]` remain unchanged.
