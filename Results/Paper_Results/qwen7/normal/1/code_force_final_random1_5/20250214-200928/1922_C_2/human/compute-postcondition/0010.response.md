Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 3, and the difference between `l[i + 1] - l[i]` is greater than or equal to `l[i] - l[i - 1]`; `d1[i + 2]` is `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `d1[i + 2]` to be the sum of `l[i + 1] - l[i]` and `d1[i + 1]`. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
