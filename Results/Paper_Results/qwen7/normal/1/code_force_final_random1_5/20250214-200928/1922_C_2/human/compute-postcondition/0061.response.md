Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for j in range(m)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `j` and `m`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `m` must be greater than 0.
   - `j` is 1.
   - `x` is an integer from the input.
   - `y` is an integer from the input.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `j < m`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1, and `m` must be greater than 0.

4. **Calculate the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts at 1, for the loop to continue, `j` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will be 2.
   - `m` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop and must still be greater than 0.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `m` remains greater than 0.
   - `j` changes from 1 to 2.
   - `x` and `y` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`m` must be greater than 0; `j` is 2; `x` is an integer from the input; `y` is an integer from the input.**
