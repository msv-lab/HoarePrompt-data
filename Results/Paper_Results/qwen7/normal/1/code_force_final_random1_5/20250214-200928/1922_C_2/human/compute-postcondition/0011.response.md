Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` must be at least 3. If the difference between the second element and the first element of list `l` is less than the difference between the first element and the zeroth element of list `l`, then the difference between the second and the first element remains as it is. Otherwise, `d1[i + 2]` is updated to the sum of the difference between `l[i + 1]` and `l[i]` and the value of `d1[i + 1]`.
