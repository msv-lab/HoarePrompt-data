Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variables in the given `for` loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over the range from `n-2` to `1` (since the step is `-1`). This means `i` starts at `n-2` and decreases by 1 until it reaches `1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `n-2`
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 2 and greater than `m+1`
   - `d2[n-1]` is 1
   - `d2[i]` is either `1 + d2[i + 1]` if `l[i] - l[i - 1]` is less than `l[i + 1] - l[i]`, or `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]` otherwise.

4. **Determine the new value of `i` for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop decrements `i` by 1 each iteration, the new value of `i` will be `i - 1`.
   - Given that `i` was `n-2` at the end of the previous iteration, the new value of `i` will be `(n-2) - 1 = n-3`.

5. **Adjust the other variables**:
   - `n` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `d2[n-1]` remains 1 as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `d2[i]` needs to be updated based on the condition provided. However, since the condition is dependent on the values of `l[i]`, `l[i-1]`, and `l[i+1]`, and these values are not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `d2[i]` without the loop body. But we know that the loop will continue to execute as long as `n` is greater than or equal to 2 and greater than `m+1`.

6. **Final state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - `i` is now `n-3`
   - `n` must still be greater than or equal to 2 and greater than `m+1`
   - `d2[n-1]` is still 1
   - `d2[i]` is either `1 + d2[i + 1]` if `l[i] - l[i - 1]` is less than `l[i + 1] - l[i]`, or `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]` otherwise.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is `n-3`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2 and greater than `m+1`, `d2[n-1]` is 1, and `d2[i]` is either `1 + d2[i + 1]` if `l[i] - l[i - 1]` is less than `l[i + 1] - l[i]`, or `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]` otherwise.**
