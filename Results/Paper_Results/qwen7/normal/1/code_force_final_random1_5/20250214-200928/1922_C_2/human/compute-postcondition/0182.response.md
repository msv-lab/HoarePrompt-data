Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be 0, `n` must be greater than 1 and greater than `m+1`, `d2[n-1]` is 1, and for each `i` from 0 to `n-2`, `d2[i]` is determined as follows:
- If `l[i] - l[i - 1] < l[i + 1] - l[i]` (where `i + 1` is considered as `n-1` when `i` is `n-2`), then `d2[i]` is set to `1 + d2[i + 1]`.
- Otherwise, `d2[i]` is set to `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes, `i` will reach 0, `n` will be at least 2 and more than `m+1`, `d2[n-1]` will still be 1, and `d2[i]` for each `i` will be calculated based on the conditions provided within the loop, starting from the end of the list `l` and moving towards the beginning.
