Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range `1` to `n-1`. This means `i` should take values from `1` to `n-1` inclusively.

3. **Determine the initial value of `i`**: According to the given state, `i` is initially set to `m`.

4. **Determine the value of `n`**: The value of `n` is given as an input integer.

5. **Check if the loop can execute**: For the loop to execute, `i` must be within the range `1` to `n-1`. Given that `i` starts at `m` and `m > 0`, we need to ensure that `m` is such that the loop can run at least once.

6. **Adjust the state**: Since `i` starts at `m` and needs to be in the range `1` to `n-1`, `m` must be at least `1` and less than `n`. Additionally, since `i` starts at `m`, we need to ensure that `m` is at least `1` and less than `n`.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`. Specifically, `i` should be at least `1` and less than `n`.

**Final State Adjustment**:
- `i` should be at least `1` and less than `n`.
- `n` is an input integer.

So, the final state adjustment is:

**State: **`i` is at least 1 and less than `n`, `n` is an input integer**.
