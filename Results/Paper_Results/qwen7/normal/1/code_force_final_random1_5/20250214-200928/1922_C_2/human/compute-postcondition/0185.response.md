Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `j` and the value `m`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `j`**: The loop starts with `j` being 0.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `m`.

4. **Adjust the necessary states**: Since the loop will execute as long as `j < m`, we need to ensure that `j` starts at 0 and `m` is a positive integer such that the loop can run at least once.

Given the initial state:
- `m` is an input integer.
- `i` is 0.
- `n` must be greater than `m + 1`.
- `d2[n-1]` is 1.
- For each `i` from 0 to `n-2`, `d2[i]` is determined based on the condition inside the loop.

Since the loop head only involves `j` and `m`, we need to adjust these two variables.

**Step-by-step adjustment**:
- `j` should start at 0.
- `m` must be a positive integer such that `j < m` allows the loop to execute at least once.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can start and execute at least once.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`j` is 0, `m` must be a positive integer**
