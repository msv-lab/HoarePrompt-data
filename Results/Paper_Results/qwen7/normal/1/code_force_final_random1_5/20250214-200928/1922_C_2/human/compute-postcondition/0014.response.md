Output State: **`i` is 2; `n` is at least 3; `d1[i + 2]` is 1 + `d1[i + 1]`.**

Explanation: The code `d1[i + 2] = 1 + d1[i + 1]` updates the dictionary `d1` such that the key `i + 2` (which is `2 + 2` or `4`) is assigned the value `1 + d1[i + 1]` (which is `1 + d1[3]` since `i + 1` is `2 + 1` or `3`). The initial values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
