Given the initial state:
- `j` is 1
- `m` is a positive integer
- `x` and `y` are input integers obtained from the input split by space
- `d2` is a dictionary whose keys are integers and values are integers (though the specific values of `d2` are not provided)

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(d2[y] - d2[x])
```

To determine what will be printed, we need to consider the following:
- `x` and `y` are integers obtained from the input split by space. This means `x` and `y` are the first and second integers in the input respectively.
- `d2` is a dictionary, but we don't have explicit values for `d2`. Therefore, we can only describe the operation in terms of the dictionary's keys and values.

The expression `d2[y] - d2[x]` subtracts the value associated with key `y` from the value associated with key `x` in the dictionary `d2`.

Since the exact values of `d2[y]` and `d2[x]` are not provided, we can only describe the operation in terms of these values.

Output: **d2[y] - d2[x]**
