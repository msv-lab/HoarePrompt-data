Output State: **`i` is `n-4`, `d2[i]` is `1 + d2[i + 1]`, `d2[i + 1]` remains unchanged, the length of list `l` is at least `n-1`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `d2[i]` to `1 + d2[i + 1]`. Here, `i` is initially `n-4`, so `d2[i]` (which is `d2[n-4]`) is set to `1 + d2[n-3]`. The value of `d2[i + 1]` (which is `d2[n-3]`) remains unchanged. The other variables and conditions remain as per the initial state.
