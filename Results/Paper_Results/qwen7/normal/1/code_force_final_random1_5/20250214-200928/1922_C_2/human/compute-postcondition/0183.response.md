Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be 0, `n` must be greater than `m+1`, `d2[n-1]` is 1, and for each `i` from 0 to `n-2`, `d2[i]` is determined based on the condition inside the loop. Specifically, if `l[i] - l[i - 1] < l[i + 1] - l[i]` (with the understanding that `l[i-1]` is valid for `i > 0`), then `d2[i]` is set to `1 + d2[i + 1]`. Otherwise, `d2[i]` is set to `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`.

This means that after the loop completes, `d2` will be filled according to the specified conditions starting from the end of the list `l` and moving backwards to index 0.
