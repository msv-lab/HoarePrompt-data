Output State: **`i` is 3; `d1[i + 2]` is 1 + `d1[i + 1]`; `n` must be greater than 4**

Explanation: The code `d1[i + 2] = 1 + d1[i + 1]` updates the dictionary `d1` such that the key `i + 2` (which is 5 since `i` is 3) is assigned the value `1 + d1[i + 1]` (which is `1 + d1[4]`). The initial value of `i` remains unchanged at 3. The condition that `n` must be greater than 4 is still valid.
