Based on the initial state provided:

- `m` must be greater than 0.
- `j` is 2.
- `x` and `y` are integers assigned the values of the integers entered by the user.

The code snippet is:
```python
print(d2[y] - d2[x])
```

Here, `d2` is a dictionary, and `x` and `y` are keys in this dictionary. The values associated with these keys (`d2[x]` and `d2[y]`) will be subtracted, and the result will be printed.

Since the exact values of `d2[x]` and `d2[y]` are not provided, we can only describe them in terms of the keys `x` and `y`.

Output: **d2[y] - d2[x]**
