Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Game Logic**: The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, taking turns to either swap wallets or remove one coin from their own wallet. The player who cannot make a valid move loses. The key insight here is that the game state can be determined by the parity (even or odd nature) of the sum of the coins in both wallets. If the sum is even, Bob wins; if the sum is odd, Alice wins.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function correctly implements the logic described above. It checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd and returns the appropriate winner based on that condition.
   - The function `func_1(a, b)` is designed to work with any positive integers \(a\) and \(b\) within the specified range (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9).

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by calling `func_1(a, b)` for each pair of integers \(a\) and \(b\).
   - The results of each test case are stored in a list `results`, and finally, the function prints the results for each test case.
   - The function correctly handles the input and output as per the problem statement.

4. **Overall Program Correctness**:
   - The overall program structure is sound, and both functions together correctly implement the game logic and produce the expected output based on the problem description.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the game logic and produces the expected results for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
