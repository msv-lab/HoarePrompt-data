Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States:
- `t` is a positive integer.
- `results` is a list containing `t-1` elements (all of which are the value of `winner`).
- `a` is the last integer input converted to an integer.
- `b` is the last integer input converted to an integer.
- `winner` is the result of `func_1(a, b)`.
- `result` is the next element in the `results` list.

### Loop Head:
The loop is defined as:
```python
for result in results:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop variable `result` is taken from the `results` list.
- The loop will continue as long as there are more elements in the `results` list to iterate over.

### Current State at the End of Previous Iteration:
- `t` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
- `results` has one less element than before because one element was just processed.
- `a` and `b` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.
- `winner` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
- `result` is the next element in the `results` list, which means it is the last element that was in `results` before the current iteration.

### Next Iteration:
- For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more element left in the `results` list.
- Since `results` originally had `t-1` elements, after one iteration, it now has `t-2` elements.
- Therefore, for the loop to continue, `results` must have at least one more element, meaning it should have `t-2` elements.

### Updated States:
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `results` must have `t-2` elements.
- `a` and `b` remain unchanged.
- `winner` remains unchanged.
- `result` is now the next element in the updated `results` list, which is the element that was the second-to-last in the original `results` list.

### Final Answer:
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `results` is a list containing `t-2` elements, `a` is the last integer input converted to an integer, `b` is the last integer input converted to an integer, `winner` is the result of `func_1(a, b)`, `result` is the next element in the `results` list**
