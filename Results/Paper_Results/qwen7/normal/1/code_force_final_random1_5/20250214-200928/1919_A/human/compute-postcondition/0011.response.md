Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 998, `results` is a list containing two elements where the first element is the value of `winner` and the second element is also `winner`, `a` is an integer input, `b` is an integer input, `winner` is the result of `func_1(a, b)`**

Explanation: The code snippet reads two integers from the user input and assigns them to variables `a` and `b`. These values replace the placeholders for `a` and `b` in the initial state. The function `func_1(a, b)` is called with these inputs to determine the `winner`, but the exact value of `winner` is not specified in the code snippet. Therefore, the list `results` remains unchanged, and the updated values of `a` and `b` are used.
