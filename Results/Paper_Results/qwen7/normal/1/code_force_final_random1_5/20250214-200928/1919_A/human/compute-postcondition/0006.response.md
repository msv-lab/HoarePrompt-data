Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head**: The loop head is defined by the `for _ in range(t):` statement. This means the loop variable is `_` (an underscore, typically used as a throwaway variable) and the loop will iterate `t` times.

2. **Determine the variables involved in the loop head**: The only variable directly involved in the loop head is `t`. However, since `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, it does not change within the loop itself; it remains constant for each iteration.

3. **Identify the variables that might change within the loop body**: The variables `results`, `a`, `b`, and `winner` could potentially change within the loop body. However, the problem asks us to focus only on the variables in the loop head, which is just `t`.

4. **Determine the new state of `t`**: Since `t` is the number of iterations and it does not change within the loop, the value of `t` remains the same for each iteration.

5. **Adjust the states based on the loop head**: Given that `t` does not change, the only thing that changes is the iteration count. For the next iteration, `t` will be decremented by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `t` is now one less than its previous value.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 999, `results` is a list containing one element which is the value of `winner`, `a` is the first integer input converted to an integer, `b` is the second integer input converted to an integer, `winner` is the result of `func_1(a, b)`**
