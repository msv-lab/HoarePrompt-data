### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves determining the winner of a game where Alice and Bob take turns removing one coin from their wallets and optionally swapping wallets. The player who cannot make a valid move loses. Both players play optimally.

2. **Key Insight**: The key insight here is that the parity (odd or even nature) of the sum of the coins in both wallets determines the winner. If the sum of the coins in both wallets is even, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins. This is because:
   - If the sum is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves, ensuring he will be the one to remove the last coin.
   - If the sum is odd, Alice can always ensure she is the one to remove the last coin by mirroring Bob's moves.

3. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the sum of `a` and `b`. It returns 'Bob' if the sum is even and 'Alice' if the sum is odd.

4. **Function `func_2`**: This function handles the input and output for multiple test cases. It reads the number of test cases `t`, processes each test case by calling `func_1(a, b)`, and collects the results. Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

5. **Input and Output Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the values of `a` and `b` for each test case, calls `func_1` to determine the winner, and prints the results.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the problem statement and the provided examples.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
