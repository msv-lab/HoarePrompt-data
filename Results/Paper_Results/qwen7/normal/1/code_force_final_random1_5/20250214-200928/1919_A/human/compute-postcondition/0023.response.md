Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes test cases where each case includes a positive integer `t` such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, two positive integers `a` and `b` such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9. It returns different outputs based on the values of `a` and `b` for each test case.**

This means the function processes a series of test cases, each containing values for `t`, `a`, and `b`. For each test case, it evaluates `a` and `b` and returns a specific output based on their values, without accepting these parameters directly as function arguments.
