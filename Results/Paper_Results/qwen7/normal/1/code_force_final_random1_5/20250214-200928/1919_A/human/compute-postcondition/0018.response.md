Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `result in results`. The only variables involved here are `result` and `results`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in the `results` list.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer.
   - `results` is a list containing `t` elements, all of which are the value of `winner`.
   - `a` is the last integer input converted to an integer.
   - `b` is the last integer input converted to an integer.
   - `winner` is the result of `func_1(a, b)`.

4. **Determine the state adjustments**:
   - Since the loop iterates over each element in `results`, the variable `result` will take on each value from the `results` list in sequence.
   - After each iteration, `result` will be set to the next element in the `results` list.
   - The `results` list itself does not change within the loop; it is the elements being consumed one by one.

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `result` will be the next element in the `results` list.
   - `results` will have one fewer element than before, as the current element has been processed.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `result` is now the next element in the `results` list, and `results` has one fewer element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `results` is a list containing `t-1` elements (all of which are the value of `winner`), `a` is the last integer input converted to an integer, `b` is the last integer input converted to an integer, `winner` is the result of `func_1(a, b)`, `result` is the next element in the `results` list**
