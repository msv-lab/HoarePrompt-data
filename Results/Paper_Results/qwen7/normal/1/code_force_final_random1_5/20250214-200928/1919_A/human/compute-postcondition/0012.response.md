Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 998, `results` is a list containing two elements where the first element is the value of `winner` and the second element is also `winner`, `a` is an integer input, `b` is an integer input, `winner` is the result of `func_1(a, b)`**

Explanation: The code `winner = func_1(a, b)` assigns the result of the function `func_1(a, b)` to the variable `winner`. This changes the value of `winner` but does not affect the values of `t`, `results`, `a`, or `b`. The initial state of `results` is a list with two elements, both being the value of `winner` before the assignment. After the assignment, `results` remains the same list, now with `winner` being the new value of `func_1(a, b)`.
