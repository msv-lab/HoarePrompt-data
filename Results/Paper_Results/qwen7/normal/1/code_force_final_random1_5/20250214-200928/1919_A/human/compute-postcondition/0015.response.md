Output State: `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 0, `results` is a list containing `t` elements, all of which are the value of `winner`, `a` is the last integer input converted to an integer, `b` is the last integer input converted to an integer, `winner` is the result of `func_1(a, b)`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` will be reduced to 0 because it starts as a positive integer and decreases by 1 with each iteration until it reaches 0. The `results` list will contain `t` (which is now 0) elements, but since `t` is 0, the list will be empty. However, each element in the `results` list is the `winner` from the last iteration of the loop, as the `results` list is updated with the `winner` in each iteration.
