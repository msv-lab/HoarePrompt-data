Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head**: The loop head is defined by the `for _ in range(t):` statement. This means the loop variable is `_` (an underscore), and it iterates `t` times.

2. **Determine the variables in the loop head**: The only variable directly involved in the loop head is `t`. However, since `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 999, and the loop iterates `t` times, we need to consider how `t` changes or is used within the loop.

3. **Understand the loop behavior**: Since the loop variable `_` is just an index, it does not change the value of `t`. Instead, the loop will iterate `t` times, decrementing `t` each time until it reaches 0.

4. **Adjust the state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 999. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1.

5. **Final state**: After one more iteration, `t` will be `t - 1`.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 998, `results` is a list containing two elements where the first element is the value of `winner` and the second element is also `winner`, `a` is the first integer input converted to an integer, `b` is the second integer input converted to an integer, `winner` is the result of `func_1(a, b)`**
