### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies several issues with the provided program. Let's re-evaluate the program based on the problem description and the function summary.

1. **Problem Description and Requirements:**
   - We need to check if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`.
   - If not, we need to print "NO" and a string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence of `s`.

2. **Function Summary Analysis:**
   - The function processes each test case by reading `n`, `k`, `m`, and `s`.
   - It uses bit manipulation to track the presence of characters in the string `s`.
   - However, the bit manipulation logic is flawed because it only tracks up to `k` characters, not `n`.

3. **Key Issues:**
   - The program incorrectly assumes that `cur` will eventually cover all combinations of `n` characters.
   - The construction of `tmp` and `ans` does not guarantee finding a valid missing subsequence of length `n`.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - To solve this problem correctly, we need to ensure that every possible string of length `n` using the first `k` characters is checked against `s`.
   - One way to do this is to use a bitmask to track the presence of each character in `s` and then check if all possible combinations of `n` characters are covered.

### Corrected Program:

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from itertools import product

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k, m = map(int, input().split())
        s = input()
        
        # Generate all possible strings of length n using the first k characters
        all_strings = [''.join(p) for p in product('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k], repeat=n)]
        
        found = False
        for string in all_strings:
            if all(c in s for c in string):
                found = True
                break
        
        if found:
            print("YES")
        else:
            print("NO")
            # Find a missing string of length n
            for string in all_strings:
                if not all(c in s for c in string):
                    print(string)
                    break

func()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Generating All Possible Strings:**
   - We use `itertools.product` to generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` characters.
   
2. **Checking Subsequences:**
   - For each generated string, we check if it is a subsequence of `s`.
   - If we find a string that is a subsequence, we print "YES" and exit.
   - If no such string is found, we print "NO" and a missing string of length `n`.

### Final Evaluation:
Given the corrected approach and the issues identified in the original program, the original assessment was accurate. The provided program does not correctly solve the problem.

**Final: False**
