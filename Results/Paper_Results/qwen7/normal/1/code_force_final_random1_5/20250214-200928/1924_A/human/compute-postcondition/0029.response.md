Output State: **`cur` is 2 raised to the power of `cur_ss` and then 1 is added, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is either 1 or 2, `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers obtained from the input split, `s` must have at least two less characters, `cnt` is either 1 or 2, `ans` is either `ss` or `ss` + `ss`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` - 97, and `cur_ss` is updated to be `ord(ss) - ord('a')`.**

Explanation: The code updates `cur_ss` to be the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of `'a'`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
