Output State: **`cur` is 2 raised to the power of `cur_ss`, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers obtained from the input split, `s` must have at least one character, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is an empty string, `cur_ss` is the difference between the ASCII value of the first character of `s` and the ASCII value of 'a', and `(cur & 1 << cur_ss)` is equal to `cur`.**

Explanation: The value of `cur` is updated by adding `1 << cur_ss` to its current value, which means `cur` now equals `2` raised to the power of `cur_ss`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
