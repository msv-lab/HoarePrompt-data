Output State: **`cnt` is either 1 or 2, `cur` is 0, `s` is a non-empty string, `ss` is the third character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of `'a'`, and `ans` is equal to `ss` if `cur` does not equal `1 << cur_ss` and `2 * (ord(ss) - ord('a'))` otherwise.**

Explanation: The line `cur = 0` sets the variable `cur` to 0. Since `cur` was previously updated to `cur + 1 << cur_ss`, and now it is set to 0, the value of `cur` is 0. All other variables (`cnt`, `s`, `ss`, `cur_ss`, and `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
