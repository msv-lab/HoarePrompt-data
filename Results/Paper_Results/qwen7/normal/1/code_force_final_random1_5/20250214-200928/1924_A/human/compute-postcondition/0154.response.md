Output State: **`cnt` is either 0 or 1, `cur` is `1 << cur_ss` added to its previous value, `s` is a non-empty string, `ss` is the second character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of `'a'`, and `ans` is equal to `ss` if `cur` equals \(1 << k - 1\) and `ord(ss) - ord('a')` otherwise.**

Explanation:
- The code `cur += 1 << cur_ss` increments the value of `cur` by \(2^{cur_ss}\).
- The value of `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of `'a'`.
- The other variables (`cnt`, `s`, `ss`, `cur_ss`, and `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
