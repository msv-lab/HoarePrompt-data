Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires checking if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets appear as subsequences in the given string `s`.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m`, and the string `s`.
   - It uses a bitmask (`cur`) to track the presence of each of the `k` alphabets in the current substring of `s`.
   - The variable `cnt` keeps track of how many times the bitmask `cur` reaches the state where all `k` alphabets are present (`(1 << k) - 1`).
   - If `cnt` is at least `n`, it means all possible strings of length `n` can be found as subsequences in `s`, and the program prints "YES".
   - If `cnt` is less than `n`, it means not all possible strings can be found, and the program prints "NO" followed by a constructed string that shows one missing sequence.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the required subsequences are not present by constructing a string that includes the missing characters.
   - The logic for constructing the missing string seems to be correct, ensuring that the constructed string is of length `n` and includes the necessary characters.

4. **Output Validation**:
   - The output format matches the requirements: "YES" or "NO" followed by a string of length `n` if the answer is "NO".

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the solution for the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
