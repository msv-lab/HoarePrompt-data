Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `cnt` is either 0, 1, or 2.
   - `cur` is 0.
   - `k` must be at least 1.
   - `s` is a non-empty string.
   - `ans` is a concatenation of characters from `s` based on the conditions met during the loop execution.
   - `tmp` is 'a'.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `i` in `range(k)`.
   - The loop condition is: if the current value of `cur` and `1` shifted left by `i` bits results in 0, then we break out of the loop.

3. **Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable is `i`.
   - The loop variable `k` is used as the upper bound for the range function.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since the loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = k-1`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - `k` remains unchanged as it is an upper bound and not modified within the loop.
   - `cur` remains 0 unless it changes inside the loop, but since no change is mentioned, it stays 0.
   - `s`, `ans`, and `tmp` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

5. **Updated States:**
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value.
   - `k` remains the same.
   - `cur` remains 0.
   - `s` remains a non-empty string.
   - `ans` remains a concatenation of characters from `s` based on the conditions met during the loop execution.
   - `tmp` remains 'a'.

Given these points, the updated states for the start of the next iteration are:

State: **`cnt` is either 0, 1, or 2, `cur` is 0, `k` must be at least 1, `s` is a non-empty string, `ans` is a concatenation of characters from `s` based on the conditions met during the loop execution, and `tmp` is 'a'. `i` is 1 (since it was 0 previously and will be incremented).**

However, since `i` is the only variable in the loop head that changes, we can simplify this to focus on the relevant change:

State: **`i` is 1, `k` must be at least 1, `cur` is 0, `s` is a non-empty string, `ans` is a concatenation of characters from `s` based on the conditions met during the loop execution, and `tmp` is 'a'.**
