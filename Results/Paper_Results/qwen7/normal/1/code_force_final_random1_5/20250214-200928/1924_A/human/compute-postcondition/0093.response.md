Postcondition: `cur` is 0, `ans` is the current `ans` concatenated with the next character `ss`, `s` is the remaining substring of `s` after removing the first character, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of `'a'`. If `cur & 1 << cur_ss` is 0, then `cur` remains 0 and `ans` is updated by concatenating `ss` to it. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged.
