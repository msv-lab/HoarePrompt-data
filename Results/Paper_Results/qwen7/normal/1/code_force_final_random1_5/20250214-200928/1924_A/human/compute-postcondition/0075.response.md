Output State: **`cur` is 2 (0b10), `ans` is an empty string, `s` is a non-empty string, `ss` is the first character of `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of `'a'`.**

Explanation: The code `cur += 1 << cur_ss` increments `cur` by `1 << cur_ss`, which means shifting 1 left by `cur_ss` positions. Given that the initial state of `cur` is 0, and `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of `'a'`, the new value of `cur` is `2` (which is `0b10` in binary). The other variables remain unchanged.
