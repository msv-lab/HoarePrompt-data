Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `k`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < k`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `cur` is an integer.
   - `tmp` is a character.
   - If `cur & (1 << i)` equals 0, then `tmp` is set to the corresponding character ('a' to 'j') based on the value of `i`.
   - If `cur & (1 << i)` is not 0, then the value of `tmp` remains unchanged.

4. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time it runs, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - The value of `k` does not change within the loop, so `k` remains the same.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value.
   - `k` remains the same.
   - The value of `cur` and `tmp` do not change based on the loop itself; they depend on the loop body, but since no specific changes are mentioned, they remain the same.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`cur` is an integer, `tmp` is a character, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, and `k` remains the same**.

Since the exact value of `i` was not specified in the previous state, let's denote it as `i_prev` where `i_prev + 1 = i`.

So, the final state can be represented as:

State: **`cur` is an integer, `tmp` is a character, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, and `k` is the same as before**.
