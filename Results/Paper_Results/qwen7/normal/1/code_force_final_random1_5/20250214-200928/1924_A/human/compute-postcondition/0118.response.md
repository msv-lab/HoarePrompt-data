Output State: **`cur` is an integer, `tmp` is 'a' + `i` - `i_prev` - 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it breaks out of the loop or conditional block that `tmp` was being calculated within. The values of `cur`, `tmp`, and `i_prev` remain unchanged.
