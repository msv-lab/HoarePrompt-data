Postcondition: **`cur` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is either 1 or 2, `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers obtained from the input split, `s` is an empty string, `cnt` is the total number of characters in the original string `s`, `ans` is the concatenation of every second character from the original string `s` starting from the first character, and `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of each processed character minus 97. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `i` remains either 1 or 2. Otherwise, `i` becomes 3, `k` becomes greater than 3, and `ans` becomes the concatenation of every second character from the original string `s` starting from the first character, which is 'a' * (m - 1).**
