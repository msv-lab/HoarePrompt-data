Output State: **`cnt` is 0, `cur` is 0, `s` is a non-empty string, `ss` is the first character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of 'a'.**

Explanation: The code calculates the difference between the ASCII value of the first character of the string `s` (`ss`) and the ASCII value of 'a', and assigns this difference to the variable `cur_ss`. The values of `cnt` and `cur` remain unchanged.
