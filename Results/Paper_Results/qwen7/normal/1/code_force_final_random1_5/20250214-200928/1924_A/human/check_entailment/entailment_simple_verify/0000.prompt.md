You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

    #State: Output State: The loop will have executed `t` times, where `t` is the initial value read from input. After all iterations, the following conditions will hold:
    #
    #- `cur` will be 0, as it is reset to 0 at the start of each iteration.
    #- `t` will be the same as the initial value read from input.
    #- `i` will be `t`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
    #- `n`, `k`, and `m` will retain their last values from the final iteration's input.
    #- `s` will be the string input in the last iteration.
    #- `cnt` will be the count of times `cur` reached `(1 << k) - 1` during all iterations. This count can vary depending on the input strings but will be non-negative.
    #- `ans` will be constructed based on the conditions met during all iterations. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` will be the string `s` with certain characters removed according to the conditions. Otherwise, `ans` will be modified to include additional characters 'a' and possibly 'b' to meet the condition `cnt >= n`.
    #
    #In summary, after all iterations, `cur` will be 0, `t` will be the same as the initial input, `i` will be `t`, `n`, `k`, and `m` will be the values from the last iteration, `s` will be the last input string, `cnt` will reflect the total occurrences of the condition `(1 << k) - 1`, and `ans` will be the final constructed string based on the given rules.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for checking if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`. 

The main issue lies in the logic used to track subsequences. Specifically, the program uses a bitmask (`cur`) to keep track of which characters have been seen so far but does not ensure that all possible combinations of length `n` are checked. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Bitmask Usage**: The program uses a bitmask to track which characters have been seen. However, this approach does not guarantee that all possible combinations of length `n` are checked. It only checks if a specific combination has appeared in the string `s`.

2. **Subsequence Check**: The program increments `cnt` whenever a new character combination is detected, but it does not ensure that all combinations of length `n` are covered. For instance, if `n = 3` and `k = 2`, the program would miss combinations like "aab" if they do not appear in the string `s` in the exact sequence.

3. **Output Generation**: When `cnt < n`, the program generates a string that includes the first missing character and fills the rest with 'a'. This approach does not guarantee that the generated string is a valid subsequence of `s`.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

- Input:
  ```
  1
  3 3 10
  aabbccabab
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  YES
  ```

However, the program might output:
```
NO
aa
```

This is incorrect because "abc" is a valid subsequence of "aabbccabab", and the program should detect this. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for all potential cases, making it incorrect.
