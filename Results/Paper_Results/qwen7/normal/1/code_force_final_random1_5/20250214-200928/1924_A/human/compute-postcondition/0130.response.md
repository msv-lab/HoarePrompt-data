Postcondition: `cur` is an integer, `ans` is a string, and `cnt` is the number of times `cur` reached `(1 << k) - 1` during the loop execution. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `ans` is updated by adding 'a' multiplied by `(n - cnt - 1)`, and `cur` is an integer that has been updated through all iterations, while `tmp` is a string containing characters from 'a' to 'j' based on the conditions met in each iteration, `i` is equal to `k`, and `cnt` is the number of times `cur` reached `(1 << k) - 1` during the loop execution, which is less than `n`.
