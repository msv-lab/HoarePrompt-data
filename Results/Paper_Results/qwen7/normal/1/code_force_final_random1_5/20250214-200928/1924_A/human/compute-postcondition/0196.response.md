Output State: **`cnt` is either 0, 1, or 2, `cur` is 0, `k` is exactly 3, `s` is a non-empty string, `ans` is "abba" (since `ans` was "abb" and `'a' * (n - cnt - 1)` adds 'a' three times), and `tmp` is 'b'.**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is updated by appending `'a' * (n - cnt - 1)` to its current value. Given that `cnt` can be 0, 1, or 2, and `n` is `cnt + 3` (since `k` is exactly 3), `n - cnt - 1` will always be 2. Therefore, `'a' * (n - cnt - 1)` results in `'aaa'`. Since `ans` was initially "abb", appending `'aaa'` to it results in "abba". All other variables remain unchanged.
