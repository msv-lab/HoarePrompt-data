Postcondition: **`cur` is 2 raised to the power of `cur_ss`, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers obtained from the input split, `s` must have at least one character, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is an empty string, and if `(cur & 1 << cur_ss)` is equal to `cur`, then `cur` remains unchanged.**

This postcondition summarizes that if the condition `(cur & 1 << cur_ss) == cur` holds true, then `cur` remains as 2 raised to the power of `cur_ss`. All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `cnt`, and `ans`) retain their initial states as described in the precondition.
