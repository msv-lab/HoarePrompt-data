Postcondition: **`cur` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `k` must be greater than 1, `m` is an integer obtained from the input split, `s` is an empty string, `cnt` is the total number of characters in the original string `s`, `ans` is the concatenation of every second character from the original string `s` starting from the first character, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of each processed character minus 97, and `tmp` is 'c'. If `cur & 1 << i == 0`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
