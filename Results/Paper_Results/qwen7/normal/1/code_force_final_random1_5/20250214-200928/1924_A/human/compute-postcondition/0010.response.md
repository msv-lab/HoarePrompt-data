Postcondition: `cur` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers obtained from the input split, `s` must have at least one character, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is an empty string, `cur_ss` is the difference between the ASCII value of the first character of `s` and the ASCII value of 'a', and `(cur & 1 << cur_ss)` is equal to 0.
