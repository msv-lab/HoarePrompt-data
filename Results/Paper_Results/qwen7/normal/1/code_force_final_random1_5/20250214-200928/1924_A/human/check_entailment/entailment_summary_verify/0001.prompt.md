You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k, m) = map(int, input().split())
        s = input()
        cnt = 0
        cur = 0
        ans = ''
        for ss in s:
            cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
            if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
                cur += 1 << cur_ss
            if cur == (1 << k) - 1:
                cnt += 1
                cur = 0
                ans += ss
        if cnt >= n:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
            tmp = ''
            for i in range(k):
                if cur & 1 << i == 0:
                    tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)
                    break
            ans += tmp
            ans += 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)
            print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads integers \( n \), \( k \), and \( m \), and a string \( s \). It then constructs a new string \( ans \) based on the following rules: if the number of times a specific pattern (represented by `cur`) is fully formed (i.e., `cur` equals \( 2^k - 1 \)) is at least \( n \), it prints "YES" followed by the string \( s \) with the pattern removed. Otherwise, it prints "NO" followed by a modified version of \( s \) that includes additional 'a' characters to ensure the pattern count meets the requirement. The function outputs the results for all test cases.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, followed by a string `s` of length `m`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - It initializes variables `cnt` to count the number of valid subsequences found, `cur` to track the current combination of characters seen so far, and `ans` to store the last character processed.
   - It iterates through each character `ss` in the string `s`.
     - Converts the character `ss` to its corresponding integer value (`cur_ss`) by subtracting the ASCII value of `'a'`.
     - Checks if the bit corresponding to `cur_ss` is not set in `cur`. If not, it sets the bit and increments `cnt`.
     - If `cur` becomes `(1 << k) - 1`, it means all bits up to `k` are set, indicating a valid subsequence of length `k` has been found. It increments `cnt`, resets `cur`, and appends `ss` to `ans`.

3. **Checking Validity:**
   - After processing the string, it checks if `cnt` is at least `n`.
     - If yes, it prints "YES".
     - If no, it prints "NO" and constructs a string `tmp` representing a missing character.
       - It finds the first bit in `cur` that is not set and converts it back to a character.
       - Constructs a string `ans` by appending `tmp` and `a` repeated `n - cnt - 1` times.
       - Prints the constructed string `ans`.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Bit Manipulation Logic:**
   - The logic for setting and checking bits in `cur` is flawed. It should track all `n` characters, not just `k` characters.
   - The program assumes `cur` will eventually cover all combinations of `n` characters, but this is not guaranteed.

2. **Handling All Possible Strings:**
   - The program aims to find all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` characters, but the current logic does not ensure this.
   - The bit manipulation approach is not suitable for tracking all possible combinations of `n` characters.

3. **Constructing Missing Subsequences:**
   - The construction of `tmp` and `ans` assumes a specific pattern that might not always be correct. It does not guarantee finding a valid missing subsequence of length `n`.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as stated. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
