Output State: **`cnt` is either 0, 1, or 2, `cur` is 0, `k` is exactly 3, `s` is a non-empty string, `ans` is "abb", and `tmp` is 'b'.**

Explanation: The code `ans += tmp` concatenates the value of `tmp` (which is 'b') to the end of the string `ans` (which is initially "ab"). Therefore, `ans` becomes "abb". The values of `cnt`, `cur`, `k`, `s`, and `tmp` remain unchanged.
