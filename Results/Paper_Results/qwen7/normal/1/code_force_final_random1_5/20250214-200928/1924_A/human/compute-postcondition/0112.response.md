Output State: **`cur` is an integer, tmp is 'a' if i is 0, 'b' if i is 1, and so on, up to 'j' if i is 9**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `ord('a') + i` to `tmp`, which is equivalent to converting the integer `i` to its corresponding ASCII character starting from 'a'. The initial condition about `cur` (that the value of `cur` ANDed with 1 shifted left by `i` bits is equal to 0) does not affect the assignment of `tmp`. Therefore, `tmp` is updated based on the value of `i`.
