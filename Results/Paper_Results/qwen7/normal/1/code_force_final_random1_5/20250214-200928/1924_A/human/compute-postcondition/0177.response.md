Output State: **`cnt` is either 0, 1, or 2, `cur` is 0, `s` is a non-empty string, `ans` is a concatenation of characters from `s` based on the conditions met during the loop execution, `tmp` is an empty string.**

Explanation: The code initializes `tmp` as an empty string. This does not affect the values of `cnt`, `cur`, `s`, or `ans`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions with the addition of `tmp` being an empty string.
