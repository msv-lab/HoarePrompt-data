Postcondition: `cnt` is either 0 or 1, `cur` is updated to `cur + 1 << cur_ss`, `s` is a non-empty string, `ss` is the third character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of `'a'`, and `ans` is equal to `ss` if `cur` does not equal `1 << cur_ss` and `2 * (ord(ss) - ord('a'))` otherwise, if `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` becomes either 1 or 2, `cur` is reset to 0.
