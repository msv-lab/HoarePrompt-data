Postcondition: **`cur` remains unchanged, `ans` is the current `ans` concatenated with the next character `ss`, `s` is the remaining substring of `s` after removing the first character, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the new `ss` minus the ASCII value of `'a'`, and `cnt` is 1 if `cur` does not have the bit corresponding to `cur_ss` set, otherwise no change occurs to `cur` and `ans` remains as per the if part.**
