`cnt` is incremented by 1. The value of `cur` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet. The value of `cur` is \(2^k - 1\) and is also equal to 1 shifted left by `cur_ss`. The value of `s` is a non-empty string, `ss` is the first character in the string `s`, and `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of 'a'. The condition \((cur & 1 << cur_ss)\) evaluates to 0, which remains unchanged.

Output State: **`cnt` is 1, `cur` is \(2^k - 1\) and equal to 1 shifted left by `cur_ss`, `s` is a non-empty string, `ss` is the first character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of 'a', and \((cur & 1 << cur_ss)\) evaluates to 0.**
