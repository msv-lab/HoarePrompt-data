Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers obtained from the input split, `s` is the string input by the user, `cnt` is 0**.

The code initializes `cnt` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, or `s`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states, and only `cnt` is updated to 0.
