Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables: `i`.

2. **Determine the Initial Value of `i`**: The loop starts with `i = 0` and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration until `i < lk - 1`.

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i < lk - 1`. This means that the loop will run `lk - 1` times.

4. **Identify the State Adjustments Needed**: Since the loop depends on `i` and `lk`, these are the variables that need to be adjusted. We need to ensure that `i` starts at 0 and that `lk` is at least 1 (since `lk - 1` should be a non-negative number).

5. **Initial Values**:
   - `b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix.
   - `k` is the integer returned from `func_7()`.
   - `l` is the length of `b`.
   - `bk` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix.
   - `lk` is the length of `bk`.
   - `ans` is an empty list.

6. **Adjusting the States**:
   - `i` should start at 0.
   - `lk` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` starting at 0 and `lk` being at least 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `lk` must be at least 1**
