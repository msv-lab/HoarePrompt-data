You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 15 : The function processes a specified number of test cases (determined by the value of `t`). For each test case, it calls `func_14()` multiple times (the exact number determined by `func_10()`) and prints the result of each call to `func_14()` followed by a newline character. The final state of the program is that the standard output contains the results of these function calls, each on a new line.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find a sequence `a` of at most 25 non-negative integers.
   - The sequence should not have any subsequence that sums to `k`.
   - For all `1 ≤ v ≤ n` where `v ≠ k`, there must be a subsequence of `a` that sums to `v`.

2. **Program Structure**:
   - The program defines several utility functions, but these are not used in the main logic.
   - The main logic is encapsulated in `func_14()` which is called inside `func_15()`.

3. **Function `func_14()`**:
   - This function takes two arguments `n` and `k`.
   - It converts `n` and `k` to binary representations.
   - If `k == 1`, it handles a special case where `n == 2`.
   - Otherwise, it constructs a sequence `ans`:
     - If `k` is 1, it creates a sequence `[2, 3, 2^i for i in range(2, l)]`.
     - Otherwise, it creates a sequence `[2^i for i in range(lk - 1)] + [k - 1 - sum(ans), k + 1, 2 * k + 1] + [2^i for i in range(lk, l)]`.

4. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The constructed sequence ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` because the sequence includes specific values that prevent this.
   - The sequence also ensures that every value from 1 to `n` except `k` can be formed by some subsequence due to the inclusion of powers of 2 and other carefully chosen values.

5. **Output**:
   - The function returns a string representation of the sequence, which is then printed in `func_15()`.

### Verification:

- The logic in `func_14()` correctly constructs a sequence that meets the problem requirements.
- The sequence construction ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` and that every value from 1 to `n` (except `k`) can be formed by a subsequence.
- The program handles all test cases as per the examples provided.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
