Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is used in the `range()` function call. However, the actual value that the loop iterates over is determined by the result of `func_10()`. Therefore, we need to focus on the return value of `func_10()`.

2. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute if `func_10()` returns a positive integer. If `func_10()` returns 0 or a negative integer, the loop will not execute.

3. **Determine the initial state**: Since `t`, `n`, and `k` are not defined within the function, they must be passed as arguments when the function is called elsewhere. The loop will iterate based on the return value of `func_10()`, which is not directly dependent on `t`, `n`, or `k` but rather on the function itself.

4. **Adjust the state**: The only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the return value of `func_10()`. This return value should be a positive integer.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is the return value of `func_10()`.

**State:**
**`func_10()` must return a positive integer**
