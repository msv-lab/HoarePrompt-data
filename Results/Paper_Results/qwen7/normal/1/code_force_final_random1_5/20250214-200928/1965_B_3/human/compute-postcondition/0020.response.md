Output State: **`b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `k` is the integer returned from `func_7()`, `l` is the length of `b`, `bk` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `ans` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list `ans`. This does not affect the values of `b`, `k`, `l`, or `bk`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
