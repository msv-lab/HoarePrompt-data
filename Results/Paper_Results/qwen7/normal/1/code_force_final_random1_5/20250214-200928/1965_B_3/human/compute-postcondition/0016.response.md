Output State: `i` is equal to `l`; `l` is the length of `b` and must be greater than or equal to 3; `ans` is a list containing all powers of 2 starting from \(2^2\) up to \(2^{l-1}\).

Explanation: The loop continues to append \(2^i\) to `ans` as long as `i` is less than `l`. Since the loop executes until `i` reaches `l`, `i` will be equal to `l` after the loop finishes. The length of `b` (`l`) must be at least 3 based on the given conditions. The list `ans` will contain all values of \(2^i\) for each `i` from 2 up to `l-1`.
