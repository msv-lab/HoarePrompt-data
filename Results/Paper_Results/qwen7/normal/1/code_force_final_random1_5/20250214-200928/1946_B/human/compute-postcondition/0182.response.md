Output State: **`sm` is equal to `sm % (10 ** 9 + 7)`, and `sm` is greater than or equal to 0.**

Explanation: The code updates `sm` to its value modulo \(10^9 + 7\). Since `sm` was previously equal to \(2 + \text{suf}[n]\) and is greater than or equal to 0, the new value of `sm` is simply the remainder when `sm` is divided by \(10^9 + 7\). The condition that `sm` is greater than or equal to 0 remains unchanged.
