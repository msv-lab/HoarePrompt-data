Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is greater than 0
   - If `suf[2] < smin[1]`, then `smin` contains the element `suf[2]`. Otherwise, `smin` has its element at index 1 appended to itself.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop variable `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - Given that `i` is currently 1, after the increment, `i` will be 2.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than `n`.

4. **Determining the New State:**
   - Since `i` will be 2 at the start of the next iteration, we need to ensure that `i < n`.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged from the previous iteration and must still be greater than 0.
   - The values of `suf` and `smin` do not change based on the loop head alone, so they remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

5. **Final State:**
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `n` must still be greater than 0.
   - `suf` and `smin` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
**`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `suf` and `smin` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.**
