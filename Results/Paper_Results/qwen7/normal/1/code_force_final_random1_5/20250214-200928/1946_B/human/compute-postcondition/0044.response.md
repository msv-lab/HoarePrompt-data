Postcondition: `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\), `j` is 1, `b` is the list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`, `l` is the list of integers obtained from converting the input string using `map(int, input().split())`, `suf` is the list where each element is the sum of all previous elements in `l` including itself, `n` is equal to `t`, `i` is 2, `smin` is updated to include the minimum value between `suf[2]` and the last element of `smin`, `sm` is updated based on the new value of `i` (sm = suf[2] - smin[2]).
