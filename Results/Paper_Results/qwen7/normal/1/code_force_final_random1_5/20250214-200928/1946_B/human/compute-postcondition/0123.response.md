To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the conditions given:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `sm` is equal to `suf[n]`.
   - If `sm` is less than 0, then `sm` is updated to `suf[n] + (abs(suf[n] // 10) + 1) * (10)`.
   - Otherwise, `sm` is updated to `sm % (10)`.

2. **Conditions**:
   - We need to consider both cases for updating `sm`.

### Case 1: `sm < 0`
- If `sm` is less than 0, it gets updated to `suf[n] + (abs(suf[n] // 10) + 1) * (10)`.
- This means `sm` will be updated to `suf[n] + (abs(suf[n] // 10) + 1) * 10`.

### Case 2: `sm >= 0`
- If `sm` is greater than or equal to 0, it gets updated to `sm % 10`.
- This means `sm` will be updated to the last digit of `sm`.

Given these conditions, the value of `sm` after the update will depend on the value of `suf[n]` and whether `sm` was initially less than 0.

### Conclusion:
- Since the exact value of `suf[n]` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `sm` without additional information.
- However, based on the conditions, `sm` will either be `suf[n] + (abs(suf[n] // 10) + 1) * 10` if `sm` was less than 0, or `sm % 10` if `sm` was greater than or equal to 0.

Therefore, the output will be based on the updated value of `sm` according to the conditions provided.

Output: **sm (where sm is updated based on the conditions: if sm < 0, sm = suf[n] + (abs(suf[n] // 10) + 1) * 10; otherwise, sm = sm % 10)**
