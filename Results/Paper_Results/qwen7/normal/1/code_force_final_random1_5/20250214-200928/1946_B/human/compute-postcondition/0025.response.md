Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `i < n`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\)
   - `j` is 0
   - `b` is the list of strings obtained from splitting the input string
   - `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`
   - `l` is the list of integers obtained from converting the input string using `map(int, input().split())`
   - `suf` is the list where each element is the sum of all previous elements in `l` including itself
   - `n` must be at least 1
   - `i` is equal to `t`
   - `smin` is a list starting with 0 and now includes either `suf[i + 1]` (if `suf[i + 1] < smin[i]`) or an additional element which is `smin[i]` (if `suf[i + 1] >= smin[i]`)

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop condition is `i < n`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will become `t + 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `t` remains the same as it is not involved in the loop.
   - `j` remains 0 as it is not involved in the loop.
   - `b` remains the same as it is not involved in the loop.
   - `k` remains the same as it is not involved in the loop.
   - `l` remains the same as it is not involved in the loop.
   - `suf` remains the same as it is not involved in the loop.
   - `n` remains the same as it is not involved in the loop.
   - `i` becomes `t + 1`.
   - `smin` needs to be updated based on the new value of `i`.

Given the above steps, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `j` is 0, `b` is the list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`, `l` is the list of integers obtained from converting the input string using map(int, input().split()), `suf` is the list where each element is the sum of all previous elements in `l` including itself, `n` must be at least 1, `i` is equal to `t + 1`, `smin` is a list starting with 0 and now includes either `suf[i + 1]` (if `suf[i + 1] < smin[i]`) or an additional element which is `smin[i]` (if `suf[i + 1] >= smin[i]`).**
