Output State: **`sm` is updated such that if the difference between `suf[i+1]` and `smin[i+1]` is greater than the current value of `sm` or if `sm` is -111, then `sm` is set to the value of `suf[i+1] - smin[i+1]`. Otherwise, the value of `sm` remains unchanged. `i` is i + 1, `n` is the same as before.**

Explanation: The code updates `sm` to `suf[i] - smin[i]`. This means that `sm` is now set to the value of `suf[i] - smin[i]`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1 (`i = i + 1`). The value of `n` remains unchanged. The condition for updating `sm` based on the difference between `suf[i+1]` and `smin[i+1]` is still valid, but since the code does not explicitly update `sm` based on this condition, we assume that `sm` is now `suf[i] - smin[i]` unless further conditions change it.
