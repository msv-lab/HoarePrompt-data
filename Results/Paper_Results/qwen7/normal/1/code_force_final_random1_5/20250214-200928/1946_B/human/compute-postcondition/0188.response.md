Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a list of test cases, where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), two positive integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) with the constraint that the sum of n and k for all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5, and an array a of n integers (-10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). For each test case, the function returns information based on the values of t, n, k, and the array a.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing specific parameters and an array, and it processes these inputs to produce some form of output for each test case, though the exact nature of the output is not specified in the given information.
