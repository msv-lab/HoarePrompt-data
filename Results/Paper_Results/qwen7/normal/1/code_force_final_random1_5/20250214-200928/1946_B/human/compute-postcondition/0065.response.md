Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `j` is 2, `b` is updated to the list of strings obtained from the new input string, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`, `l` is the list of integers obtained from converting the input string using map(int, input().split()), `suf` is the list where each element is the sum of all previous elements in `l` including itself, `n` is equal to the first element of `b` converted to an integer, `i` is equal to `n`, `smin` is a list starting with 0 and contains up to `n` elements, where each element is the minimum value between `suf[i + 1]` and the last element of `smin` at each iteration, `sm` is the maximum value of `suf[i] - smin[i]` for all iterations from `i = 0` to `i = n`, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`.**

Explanation: The line `k = int(b[1])` assigns the integer value of the second element in the list `b` to the variable `k`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
