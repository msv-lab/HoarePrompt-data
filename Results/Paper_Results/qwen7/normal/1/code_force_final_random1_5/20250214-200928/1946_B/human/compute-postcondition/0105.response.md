Output State: **`sm` is either `suf[1] - smin[1]` or remains -111, `i` is 1, and `sm` is now `suf[1] - smin[1]`.**

Explanation: The code updates `sm` to `suf[i] - smin[i]`. Given that `i` is 1, `sm` is now `suf[1] - smin[1]`. The initial conditions that `sm` is updated to either `suf[1] - smin[1]` or remains -111 still hold true, but since the code explicitly updates `sm` to `suf[1] - smin[1]`, this is the new value of `sm`. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 1, and `n` being greater than or equal to 0 is also unaffected.
