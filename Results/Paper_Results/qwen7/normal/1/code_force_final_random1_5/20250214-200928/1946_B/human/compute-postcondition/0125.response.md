Output State: **`sm` is equal to `suf[n]`, `j` is `j + 1`, `b` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string.**

Explanation: The code `b = input().split()` takes user input, splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace, and assigns this list to the variable `b`. The values of `sm` and `j` remain unchanged from their initial state.
