Output State: **`sm` is now equal to (2 ** k - 1) * sm**.

Explanation: The initial value of `sm` was the maximum value among `suf[i] - smin[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n`. After executing the line `sm = 2 ** k * sm - sm`, the value of `sm` is updated to `(2 ** k * sm) - sm`, which simplifies to `(2 ** k - 1) * sm`. All other variables remain unchanged.
