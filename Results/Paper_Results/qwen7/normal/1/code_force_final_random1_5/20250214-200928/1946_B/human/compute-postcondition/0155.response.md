Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `smin` has its value updated by appending `smin[i]` to itself.**

Explanation: The code `smin.append(smin[i])` appends the value of `smin[i]` to the list `smin`. Since `i` is 2, `smin[i]` refers to the third element in the list `smin`. The other variables (`i`, `n`) retain their previous conditions, and the updated list `smin` now includes the new element.
