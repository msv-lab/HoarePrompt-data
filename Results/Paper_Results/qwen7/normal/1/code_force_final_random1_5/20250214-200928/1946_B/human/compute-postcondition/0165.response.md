Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n`. Therefore, at the start of each iteration, `i` will increment by 1.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `sm` is updated based on the condition: if the difference between `suf[i]` and `smin[i]` is greater than the current value of `sm` or if `sm` is -111, then `sm` is set to the value of `suf[i] - smin[i]`. Otherwise, the value of `sm` remains unchanged.
   - This means that `sm` could either be updated or remain the same depending on the values of `suf[i]` and `smin[i]`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` increments by 1 at the start of each iteration, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged because it is the upper limit of the loop.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - The value of `sm` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration unless it was updated during the loop body.
   - The value of `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - The value of `n` remains the same.

Given the above steps, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`sm` is updated such that if the difference between `suf[i+1]` and `smin[i+1]` is greater than the current value of `sm` or if `sm` is -111, then `sm` is set to the value of `suf[i+1] - smin[i+1]`. Otherwise, the value of `sm` remains unchanged. `i` is i + 1, `n` must be the same as before.**
