Output State: `suf` is a list where each element from index 1 to n-1 is the sum of its predecessor and the corresponding element in `l`. The initial value of `suf[0]` is 0, and `suf` has been updated `n` times according to the loop.

To break it down further:
- `suf` starts as `[0]`.
- For each `i` from `0` to `n-1`, the loop appends `suf[i] + l[i]` to `suf`.
- After all iterations, `suf` will contain `n` elements, where `suf[i]` (for `i` from `0` to `n-1`) represents the cumulative sum of the first `i+1` elements of `l`.

For example, if `l` is `[1, 2, 3, 4]` and `n` is `4`, then `suf` would be `[0, 1, 3, 6, 10]` after the loop completes.
