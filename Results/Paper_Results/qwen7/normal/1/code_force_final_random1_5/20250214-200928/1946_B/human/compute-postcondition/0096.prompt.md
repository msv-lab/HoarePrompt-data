Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is equal to `n`; `suf` is a list of length `n+1` where each element `suf[j]` (for `j` from `0` to `n`) is the sum of the first `j+1` elements of the list `l`; `smin` is updated to `[0]`; `sm` remains as the maximum value of `suf[i] - smin[i]` for all iterations from `i = 0` to `i = n`, and all other variables (`t`, `j`, `b`, `k`, `l`, and `n`) retain their values from the initial state or after the first 3 iterations.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if suf[i + 1] < smin[i]:
        smin.append(suf[i + 1])
    else:
        smin.append(smin[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is less than `n`, `suf` is a list of length `n+1` where each element `suf[j]` (for `j` from `0` to `n`) is the sum of the first `j+1` elements of the list `l`, `smin` is updated such that its first element is the minimum value encountered so far, `sm` remains as the maximum value of `suf[i] - smin[i]` for all iterations from `i = 0` to `i = n`, and `t`, `j`, `b`, `k`, `l`, and `n` retain their values from the initial state or after the first 3 iterations.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is incremented by 1. If `suf[i + 1]` is less than `smin[i]`, then `smin` includes the value of `suf[i + 1]`. Otherwise, `smin` is updated by appending `smin[i]` to itself. All other variables (`suf`, `smin`, `sm`, `t`, `j`, `b`, `k`, `l`, and `n`) remain the same.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `smin` and `suf` remain unchanged, `i` remains the same, and `smin` either contains the value `suf[i + 1]` or is updated by appending `smin[i]` to itself, depending on whether `suf[i + 1]` is less than `smin[i]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
