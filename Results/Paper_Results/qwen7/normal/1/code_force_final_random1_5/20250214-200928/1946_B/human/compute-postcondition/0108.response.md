Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in the given code is `i`.
2. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n + 1`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `sm` is updated to either `suf[1] - smin[1]` or remains -111.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `sm` is now `suf[1] - smin[1]`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 2.
   - The value of `sm` does not change based on the loop itself; it remains `suf[1] - smin[1]` unless explicitly updated within the loop body, but since no such update is mentioned, it stays the same.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`.

**State: **`sm` is updated to either `suf[1] - smin[1]` or remains -111, `i` is 2**
