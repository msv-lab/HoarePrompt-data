Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `j` is 0, `b` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `k` is the integer value of the second element in the list `b`, `l` is a list of integers obtained from converting the input string using `map(int, input().split())`, `suf` is an empty list**.

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list `suf`. The values of `t`, `j`, `b`, `k`, and `l` remain unchanged from their initial states.
