Output State: **`sm` is `suf[i] - smin[i]`, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than -1, and either the difference between `suf[i]` and `smin[i]` is greater than `sm` or `sm` equals -111.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `sm` to be the difference between `suf[i]` and `smin[i]`. Since `i` is initially 0, `sm` is now set to `suf[0] - smin[0]`. The conditions involving `n` and the comparison with `sm` remain unchanged.
