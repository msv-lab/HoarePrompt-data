Output State: `suf` is a list where each element from index 1 to n-1 is the sum of its predecessor and the corresponding element in `l`. The initial `suf[0]` is 0, and the loop has appended elements up to index n-1 following the rule `suf[i+1] = suf[i] + l[i]`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `suf` will contain a series of cumulative sums starting from 0, where each subsequent element is the sum of the previous element and the corresponding element from the list `l`.
