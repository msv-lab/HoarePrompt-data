Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a value greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\).
- `j` is 1.
- `b` is a list of strings obtained from splitting an input string.
- `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`.
- `l` is a list of integers obtained from converting the input string using `map(int, input().split())`.
- `suf` is a list where each element is the sum of all previous elements in `l` including itself.
- `n` is equal to `t`.
- `i` is equal to `n`.
- `smin` is a list starting with 0 and contains up to `n` elements, where each element is the minimum value between `suf[i + 1]` and the last element of `smin` at each iteration.
- `sm` is the maximum value of `suf[i] - smin[i]` for all iterations from `i = 0` to `i = n`.
- `sm` is updated to \(2^k \times sm - sm\); if `sm` is less than 0, `sm` is increased by `suf[n]` and then the absolute value of `sm` divided by \(10^9 + 7\) taking the floor value is added to `sm`; otherwise, `sm` is increased by `suf[n]` and then taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Let's break down the key steps:

1. **Initialization of `suf`:**
   - `suf` is constructed such that `suf[i]` is the sum of the first `i+1` elements of `l`.

2. **Initialization of `smin`:**
   - `smin` starts with `[0]` and is updated in each iteration to ensure that each element is the minimum value between `suf[i + 1]` and the last element of `smin`.

3. **Calculation of `sm`:**
   - `sm` is the maximum value of `suf[i] - smin[i]` for all iterations from `i = 0` to `i = n`.
   - After calculating `sm`, it undergoes the following transformation:
     - If `sm < 0`, then `sm` is adjusted by adding `suf[n]` and taking the absolute value modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
     - Otherwise, `sm` is simply increased by `suf[n]` and taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Given these steps, the final value of `sm` depends on the specific values of `t`, `k`, `l`, and the operations performed during the iterations. Since the exact values of `t`, `k`, and `l` are not provided, we cannot determine the precise numerical value of `sm`. However, the structure of the problem ensures that `sm` is computed correctly according to the given logic.

Therefore, the output will be the computed value of `sm` after all the operations described above.

Output: **sm (where sm is the maximum value of suf[i] - smin[i] for all iterations from i = 0 to i = n, adjusted as per the given conditions)**
