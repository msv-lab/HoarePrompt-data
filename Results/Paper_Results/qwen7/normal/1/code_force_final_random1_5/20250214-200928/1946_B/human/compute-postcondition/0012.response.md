Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\).
   - `j` is 0.
   - `b` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string.
   - `k` is the integer value of the second element in the list `b`.
   - `l` is a list of integers obtained from converting the input string using `map(int, input().split())`.
   - `suf` is `[0, suf[0] + l[0], suf[1] + l[1]]`.
   - `n` is `t`.
   - `i` is 2.

3. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop condition is `for i in range(n)`, which means the loop will run as long as `i < n`.

4. **Update the values for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 3.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged and is still `t`.

5. **Construct the new state**:
   - `t` remains the same (greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\)).
   - `j` remains 0.
   - `b` remains the same (list of strings obtained from splitting the input string).
   - `k` remains the same (integer value of the second element in the list `b`).
   - `l` remains the same (list of integers obtained from converting the input string using `map(int, input().split())`).
   - `suf` remains the same (`[0, suf[0] + l[0], suf[1] + l[1]]`).
   - `n` remains `t`.
   - `i` is now 3.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `j` is 0, `b` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `k` is the integer value of the second element in the list `b`, `l` is a list of integers obtained from converting the input string using map(int, input().split()), `suf` is [0, suf[0] + l[0], suf[1] + l[1]], `n` is `t`, `i` is 3**
