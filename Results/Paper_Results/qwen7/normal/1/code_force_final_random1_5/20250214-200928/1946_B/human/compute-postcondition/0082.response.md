Postcondition: **`i` is less than `n`, `suf` is a list of length `n+1` where each element `suf[j]` (for `j` from `0` to `n`) is the sum of the first `j+1` elements of the list `l`, `smin` is updated to `[0]`, `sm` remains as the maximum value of `suf[i] - smin[i]` for all iterations from `i = 0` to `i = n`, and `t`, `j`, `b`, `k`, `l`, and `n` retain their values from the initial state or after the first 3 iterations. Additionally, `suf[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to `smin[i]`.**
