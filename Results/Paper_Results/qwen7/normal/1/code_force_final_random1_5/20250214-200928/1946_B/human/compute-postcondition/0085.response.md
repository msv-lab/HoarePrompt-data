Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is less than `n`.
   - `suf` is a list of length `n+1` where each element `suf[j]` (for `j` from `0` to `n`) is the sum of the first `j+1` elements of the list `l`.
   - `smin` is updated such that its first element is the minimum value encountered so far.
   - `sm` remains as the maximum value of `suf[i] - smin[i]` for all iterations from `i = 0` to `i = n`.
   - `t`, `j`, `b`, `k`, `l`, and `n` retain their values from the initial state or after the first 3 iterations.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   The loop condition is `i < n`.

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop continues as long as `i < n`, we need to increment `i` by 1.
   - The other variables (`suf`, `smin`, `sm`, `t`, `j`, `b`, `k`, `l`, and `n`) should remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop body based on the given information.

4. **New State:**
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so if `i` was previously less than `n`, it will still be less than `n` but now equal to the next integer value.
   - All other variables (`suf`, `smin`, `sm`, `t`, `j`, `b`, `k`, `l`, and `n`) remain the same.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `i` is less than `n` and equal to the next integer value, `suf` is a list of length `n+1` where each element `suf[j]` (for `j` from `0` to `n`) is the sum of the first `j+1` elements of the list `l`, `smin` is updated such that its first element is the minimum value encountered so far, `sm` remains as the maximum value of `suf[i] - smin[i]` for all iterations from `i = 0` to `i = n`, and `t`, `j`, `b`, `k`, `l`, and `n` retain their values from the initial state or after the first 3 iterations.**

In a concise format:

**State: `i` is less than `n` and equal to the next integer value, `suf` is a list of length `n+1` where each element `suf[j]` (for `j` from `0` to `n`) is the sum of the first `j+1` elements of the list `l`, `smin` is updated such that its first element is the minimum value encountered so far, `sm` remains as the maximum value of `suf[i] - smin[i]` for all iterations from `i = 0` to `i = n`, and `t`, `j`, `b`, `k`, `l`, and `n` retain their values from the initial state or after the first 3 iterations.**
