Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n + 1)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\).
   - `j` is 1.
   - `b` is the list of strings obtained from splitting the input string.
   - `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`.
   - `l` is the list of integers obtained from converting the input string using `map(int, input().split())`.
   - `suf` is the list where each element is the sum of all previous elements in `l` including itself.
   - `n` is equal to `t`.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `smin` is updated to include the minimum value between `suf[2]` and the last element of `smin`.
   - `sm` is updated based on the new value of `i` (sm = `suf[2] - smin[2]`).

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 in the `range(n + 1)` and increases by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 3.
   - `n` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**State:**
- `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\).
- `j` is 1.
- `b` is the list of strings obtained from splitting the input string.
- `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`.
- `l` is the list of integers obtained from converting the input string using `map(int, input().split())`.
- `suf` is the list where each element is the sum of all previous elements in `l` including itself.
- `n` is equal to `t`.
- `i` is 3.
- `smin` is updated to include the minimum value between `suf[2]` and the last element of `smin`.
- `sm` is updated based on the new value of `i` (sm = `suf[2] - smin[2]`).

State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\), `j` is 1, `b` is the list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `b`, `l` is the list of integers obtained from converting the input string using `map(int, input().split())`, `suf` is the list where each element is the sum of all previous elements in `l` including itself, `n` is equal to `t`, `i` is 3, `smin` is updated to include the minimum value between `suf[2]` and the last element of `smin`, `sm` is updated based on the new value of `i` (sm = `suf[2] - smin[2]`)**
