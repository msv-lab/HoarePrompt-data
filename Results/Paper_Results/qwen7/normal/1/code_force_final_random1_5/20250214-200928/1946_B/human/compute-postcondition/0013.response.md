Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `j` is 0, `b` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `k` is the integer value of the second element in the list `b`, `l` is a list of integers obtained from converting the input string using map(int, input().split()), `suf` is [0, suf[0] + l[0], suf[1] + l[1], suf[2] + l[2]], `n` is `t`, `i` is 3**

Explanation: The code appends `suf[i] + l[i]` to the list `suf`. Given that `i` is 3, the value of `suf` changes to include the new element `suf[2] + l[2]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
