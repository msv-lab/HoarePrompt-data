Based on the initial state provided:

- `sm` is set to either 9999999995 or `sm % 10`.
- `a` is explicitly given as 2.

The condition states that if `sm` is less than 0, then `sm` is set to 9999999995. Otherwise, `sm` is set to its remainder when divided by 10.

Given that `sm` is set to either 9999999995 or `sm % 10`, and considering the condition, `sm` cannot be less than 0 because the only value it can take from the condition is 9999999995 or a non-negative remainder when divided by 10. Therefore, the condition `if sm < 0` will never be true, and `sm` will always be set to `sm % 10`.

Since `sm` is set to `sm % 10`, and the only possible value for `sm` is 9999999995, we need to find the remainder when 9999999995 is divided by 10. 

\[ 9999999995 \mod 10 = 5 \]

Thus, `sm` will be 5.

Output: **5**
