Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is given as:
   - `i` is 0
   - `n` is greater than 0
   - The postcondition involves updating `smin[i]` if `suf[i + 1]` is less than `smin[i]`. Otherwise, `smin[i]` remains unchanged and an additional element equal to `smin[0]` is appended to the list `smin`.

2. **Loop Head**: The loop is defined as:
   ```python
   for i in range(n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

4. **Update Conditions**:
   - `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
   - `n` must remain greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

5. **Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 0, the next value of `i` would be 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `n` must still be greater than 0.

6. **Postcondition Update**:
   - After the first iteration, the postcondition will be checked again for `i = 1`.
   - If `suf[1]` is less than `smin[1]`, then `smin[1]` is updated to `suf[1]`.
   - Otherwise, an additional element equal to `smin[0]` is appended to the list `smin`.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted for the next iteration of the loop is:

- `i` should be set to 1.
- `n` must still be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0**
