Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `j` is 0, `b` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `k` is the integer value of the second element in the list `b`, `l` is a list of integers obtained from converting the input string using `map(int, input().split())`, `suf` is [0]**.

Explanation: The code appends the value `0` to the list `suf`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `t`, `j`, `b`, `k`, and `l` retain their original values, and `suf` now contains the value `[0]`.
