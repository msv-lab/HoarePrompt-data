Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variables in the given for loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n`. This means the loop will continue as long as `i < n + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `sm` is updated to either `suf[i] - smin[i]` or remains -111.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 0.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `i` is currently 0, the loop will continue if `i < n + 1`.
   - Therefore, `i` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration, making `i` equal to 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than or equal to 0.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be updated to 1.
   - `n` must remain greater than or equal to 0.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`sm` is updated to either `suf[1] - smin[1]` or remains -111, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 0**.
