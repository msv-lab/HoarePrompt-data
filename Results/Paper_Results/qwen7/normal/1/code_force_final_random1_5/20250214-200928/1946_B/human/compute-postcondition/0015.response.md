Output State: `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `j` is 0, `b` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `k` is the integer value of the second element in the list `b`, `l` is a list of integers obtained from converting the input string using `map(int, input().split())`, `suf` is a list starting with 0 and followed by the cumulative sums of elements in `l` up to each index, `n` is `t`, `i` is `t`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` will still be between 1 and 10,000 (inclusive), `j` will remain 0, `b` will still be the list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `k` will still be the integer value of the second element in `b`, `l` will still be the list of integers obtained from converting the input string using `map(int, input().split())`, `suf` will be a list where each element is the sum of all previous elements in `l` including itself, `n` will be equal to `t`, and `i` will be equal to `t`.
