isOne is a boolean value indicating whether to return the number of test cases (t) as 1 if True, otherwise return the actual number of test cases as read from the input. The function should handle multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer n (number of constraints), followed by n lines describing the constraints (each line containing two integers a and x where a is the type of constraint and x is the value associated with the constraint).
