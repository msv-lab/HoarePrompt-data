Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in num:`. This means the loop variable `i` will take values from the list `num`.

2. **Determine the necessary adjustments**: For the loop to execute, the list `num` must contain at least one element. If `num` is empty, the loop will not execute.

3. **Check the initial state**: The initial state provided includes:
   - `count_num` is 0
   - `i` is `n-1`
   - `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100
   - `t` is `t`
   - `v` is `v`
   - `start` is the minimum value among all `v` where `t` is 1
   - `end` is the maximum value among all `v` where `t` is 2
   - `num` is a list containing all `v` where `t` is 3

4. **Adjust the state**: Since the loop depends on the list `num` having at least one element, we need to ensure that `num` is not empty.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `num` contains at least one element.

**Final State**:
State: **`count_num` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `t` is `t`, `v` is `v`, `start` is the minimum value among all `v` where `t` is 1, `end` is the maximum value among all `v` where `t` is 2, `num` is a non-empty list containing all `v` where `t` is 3**
