Output State: **`count_num` is 1, `i` is `n-1`, `t` is `t`, `v` is `v`, `start` is the minimum value among all `v` where `t` is 1, `end` is the maximum value among all `v` where `t` is 2, `num` is a non-empty list containing all `v` where `t` is 3, and `i` is within the range [start, end].**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `count_num` by 1. Since `count_num` was initially 0, it now becomes 1. All other variables (`i`, `t`, `v`, `start`, `end`, `num`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
