Postcondition: **`count_num` is the total number of elements in `num` that fall within the range [start, end], `i` is the last element in `num` processed by the loop, `t` is `t`, `v` is `v`, `start` is the minimum value among all `v` where `t` is 1, `end` is the maximum value among all `v` where `t` is 2, `num` is an empty list since all elements that satisfy the condition (fall within [start, end]) have been counted, and the condition `start <= end` is true**
