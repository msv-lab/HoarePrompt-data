Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `t` is `t`, `v` is `v`, `start` is equal to `v`, `end` is equal to `v`, and `num` is a list containing `[v, v]`**.

Explanation: The code snippet `num.append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the list `num`. Initially, `num` contains `[v]`. After appending `v` to `num`, `num` becomes `[v, v]`. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `t`, `start`, `end`) remain unchanged.
