Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `num`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is an element of `num`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `count_num` is either 0 or 1.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `t` is `t`.
   - `v` is `v`.
   - `start` is the minimum value among all `v` where `t` is 1.
   - `end` is the maximum value among all `v` where `t` is 2.
   - `num` is a non-empty list containing all `v` where `t` is 3.
   - `i` is outside the range `[start, end]` if `count_num` is 0, otherwise `i` is within the range `[start, end]`.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since `i` is currently `n-1`, it needs to be adjusted to the next element in `num` for the next iteration.
   - `num` remains the same unless the loop body modifies it, but since the loop body is omitted, we assume `num` stays the same.

5. **Determine the Next Value of `i`**:
   - Since `i` is currently `n-1`, the next value of `i` should be the first element in `num` (if `num` is not empty).

6. **Ensure the Loop Condition is Met**:
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must be an element of `num`.

Given these points, let's formulate the new state:

- `count_num` remains the same (either 0 or 1).
- `i` changes to the first element in `num`.
- `t`, `v`, `start`, `end`, and `num` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`count_num` is either 0 or 1, `i` is the first element in `num`, `t` is `t`, `v` is `v`, `start` is the minimum value among all `v` where `t` is 1, `end` is the maximum value among all `v` where `t` is 2, `num` is a non-empty list containing all `v` where `t` is 3**.
