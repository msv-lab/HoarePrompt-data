Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `t` is 3, `v` is an input integer, `num` is a list containing the value `v`.**

Explanation: The code `num.append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the list `num`. Since `v` is an input integer, after appending, `num` will contain the value `v`. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `t`) remain unchanged.
