The function `func_6` searches through a list of lists (`arr`) to find a sublist where the element at a specified index does not match a given value (`value`). If it finds such a sublist, it returns it. If no sublist matches the condition, it returns the next sublist that does not match the value, or `None` if all sublists match the value.
