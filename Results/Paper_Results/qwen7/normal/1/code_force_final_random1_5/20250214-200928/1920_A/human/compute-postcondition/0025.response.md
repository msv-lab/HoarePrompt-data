Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `t` is either 2 or 3, `v` is an input integer, and `num` is a list containing the value `v`. If `t` is 3, then `t` remains 3 and `num` is a list containing the value `v`. If `t` is not 3, then the values of `i`, `n`, `t`, and `v` remain unchanged, and `num` is still a list containing the value `v`.
