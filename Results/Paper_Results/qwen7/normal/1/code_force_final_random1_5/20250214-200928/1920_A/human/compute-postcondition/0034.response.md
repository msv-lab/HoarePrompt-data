Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `t` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `start` is equal to `v`, `end` is equal to `v`**.

Explanation: The variable `end` is assigned the value of `v`. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `t`, `v`, `start`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
