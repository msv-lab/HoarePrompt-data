Output State: **`y` is 0, `a_values` is an empty list, `b_values` is an empty list, `custo` is `b_values[0]`**.

Explanation: The code `custo += b_values[y]` increments `custo` by the value of `b_values[y]`. Given that `y` is initially set to 0 and `b_values` is an empty list, attempting to access `b_values[y]` (which is `b_values[0]`) would result in an error if strict list bounds checking is enforced. However, assuming the context allows such an access and considering the initial state, `b_values[0]` does not exist and cannot be accessed directly. For the sake of this exercise, let's assume `b_values[0]` is treated as 0 (or the operation is ignored due to the list being empty), thus `custo` remains unchanged from its initial state of 0. But if we consider the direct impact without error handling, `custo` would be updated to the value of `b_values[0]`, which is undefined in this case. Given the constraints, we can infer that `custo` is effectively updated to `b_values[0]`, which is 0 since `b_values` is empty.
