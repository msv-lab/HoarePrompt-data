Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided solution correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position within the first `m` people in the queue. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Initialization and Input Parsing**: 
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each one individually.
   - It correctly parses the number of people (`na_frente`) and the maximum allowable final position (`pos_final`).
   - It then reads and stores the costs `a_i` and `b_i` for each position in the queue.

2. **Backward Iteration and Cost Calculation**:
   - The program iterates backward from the last person to the first person in the queue.
   - For each position `v`, it checks whether moving Kirill to position `v` would be cheaper than passing through subsequent positions.
   - It updates the `total` cost and keeps track of the `best` cost found so far to ensure Kirill ends up in a position no worse than `pos_final`.

3. **Cost Comparison**:
   - The program compares the cost of swapping with the person at position `v` (`custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`) versus the cost of passing through subsequent positions (`custo_pra_passar_b[v]`).
   - It updates the `total` cost accordingly and ensures the `best` cost is updated only when a better option is found.

4. **Output**:
   - After processing all positions, the program prints the `best` cost, which represents the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to achieve his goal.

The logic and implementation in the provided code accurately reflect the problem statement and constraints, making the solution correct.
