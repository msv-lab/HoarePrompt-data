Output State: **`total` is 0, `na_frente` is an input integer minus 2, `c` is 1, `pos_final` is an input integer minus 1, `v` is -1, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers entered by the user converted to integers, `best` is 10000000000.**

Explanation: The line `best = 10 ** 12` assigns the value `10000000000` (which is `10 ** 12`) to the variable `best`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the initial values of `total`, `na_frente`, `c`, `pos_final`, `v`, and `custo_pra_passar_b` remain unchanged.
