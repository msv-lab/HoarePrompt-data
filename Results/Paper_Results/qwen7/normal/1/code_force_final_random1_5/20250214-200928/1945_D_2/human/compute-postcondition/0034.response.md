Postcondition: `total`, `c`, `na_frente`, and `pos_final` are integers. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`:
- If `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, then `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, `c` is reset to 0, `na_frente` and `pos_final` are each decremented by 1, and `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if it was greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` initially. Otherwise, `best` remains unchanged.
- If `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is not less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, then `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `c` is reset to 0, `na_frente` and `pos_final` are each decremented by 1, and `best` remains unchanged if `best` was not greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`.
Otherwise (`v` is greater than `pos_final`):
- `total` is either `total` plus the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `total` plus the value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is `na_frente` - 1, `pos_final` is `pos_final` - 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from another input split and mapped to integers, `best` is 10000000000, and the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is compared to `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to decide which cost to add to `total`.
