You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The guys lined up in a queue of n people, starting with person number i = 1 ,
to ask Serafim the Owl about the meaning of life. Unfortunately, Kirill was
very busy writing the legend for this problem, so he arrived a little later
and stood at the end of the line after the n -th person. Kirill is completely
dissatisfied with this situation, so he decided to bribe some people ahead of
him.

For the i -th person in the queue, Kirill knows two values: a_i and b_i . If
at the moment Kirill is standing at position i , then he can choose any
position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j .
In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that
j < k < i , Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k .
Kirill can perform this action any number of times.

Kirill is thrifty, so he wants to spend as few coins as possible, but he
doesn't want to wait too long, so Kirill believes he should be among the first
m people in line.

Help Kirill determine the minimum number of coins he will have to spend in
order to not wait too long.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows
the description of the test case.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le m \le n
\le 200\,000 ) — the number of people in the queue besides Kirill and the
maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n separated by spaces
(1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n separated by spaces (1
\le b_i \le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of coins
Kirill needs to spend.

    #State: Output State: `na_frente` is an input integer minus 1, `v` is -1 (indicating the loop has completed all its iterations), `c` is 10000 (the value of `cases` minus 1), and `total` holds the accumulated cost based on the conditions specified within the loop. The variable `best` will store the lowest value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` when `v <= pos_final` and the condition `custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]` is met during any iteration of the loop.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, `na_frente` will be the input integer minus 1, `v` will be -1 indicating the loop has completed, `c` will be the original input integer `cases` minus 1, and `total` will contain the minimum cumulative cost calculated by the loop. `best` will hold the lowest cumulative cost found during the loop's execution.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `cases`.
   - For each test case, it reads `na_frente` (number of people in front of Kirill) and `pos_final` (maximum allowable final position).
   - It then reads the lists `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b`.

2. **Variable Adjustments**:
   - `na_frente` and `pos_final` are decremented by 1, which is correct since indexing starts from 0.

3. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - The program uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate the minimum cost.
   - `total` keeps track of the cumulative cost.
   - `best` stores the minimum cost to achieve a position within `pos_final`.

4. **Loop Logic**:
   - The loop iterates backward from `na_frente` to 0.
   - For each position `v`, it checks if moving to that position is beneficial compared to passing through intermediate positions.
   - If `v` is within the allowed final position (`v <= pos_final`), it updates `best` and `total` accordingly.
   - If `v` is beyond the allowed final position, it directly adds the cost of moving to `v`.

### Detailed Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Initialization**:
   - `total` and `best` are initialized correctly.
   - The loop starts from `na_frente` and goes down to 0, which is appropriate for calculating the cost in reverse order.

2. **Cost Calculation**:
   - Inside the loop, the program correctly handles the conditions for updating `best` and `total`.
   - It ensures that the cost of moving to the current position is considered only if it is less than the cost of passing through intermediate positions.

3. **Boundary Conditions**:
   - The program correctly handles the boundary condition where `v` is beyond the allowed final position by adding the direct cost without considering intermediate costs.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the minimum cost stored in `best` for each test case.

### Conclusion
After analyzing the code, it appears that the logic and implementation are correct according to the problem statement. The program correctly calculates the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position within his desired range.
