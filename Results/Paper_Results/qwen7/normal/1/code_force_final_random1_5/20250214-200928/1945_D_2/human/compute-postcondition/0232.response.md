Output State: **`y` is `max_p - 1`, `a_values` is an empty list, `b_values` is an empty list, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement it is within. Since no such loop or conditional was specified, the only change is that we acknowledge breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement. All other variables retain their initial states.
