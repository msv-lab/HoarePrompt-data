Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `a_values` is a list containing all the integer values of `y` for each iteration of the loop, `b_values` is a list containing all the integer values of `y` for each iteration of the loop, and `y` is set to the last element of `b`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `a_values` will contain all the integer values of `y` from the start to the end of the loop, and `b_values` will also contain all these integer values since it appends the integer value of `y` in each iteration. The variable `y` will be set to the last element of the list `b` after the loop completes.
Code of the loop:
for y in range(num_fila - 1, max_p - 1, -1):
    if a_values[y] < b_values[y]:
        custo += a_values[y]
    else:
        custo += b_values[y]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `a_values` is an empty list, `b_values` is an empty list, `y` is within the range defined by `range(num_fila - 1, max_p - 1, -1)`, `num_fila` is a valid integer, and `max_p` is a valid integer; if `a_values[y] < b_values[y]`, then `custo` is increased by the value of `a_values[y]`. Otherwise, `custo` is increased by the value of `b_values[y]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `a_values` is an empty list, `b_values` is an empty list, `custo` is increased by either `a_values[y]` if `a_values[y] < b_values[y]` or `b_values[y]` if `a_values[y] >= b_values[y]`, and `y` is either within the range defined by `range(num_fila - 1, max_p - 1, -1)` with `y` decreased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `a_values` is an empty list, `b_values` is an empty list, and `custo` is increased by either `a_values[y]` if `a_values[y] < b_values[y]` or `b_values[y]` if `a_values[y] >= b_values[y]`, where `y` is within the range defined by `range(num_fila - 1, max_p - 1, -1)` with `y` decreased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
