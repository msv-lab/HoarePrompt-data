Output State: **`a_values` is an empty list, `b_values` is an empty list, `custo` is increased by `a_values[y]`, and `y` is within the range defined by `range(num_fila - 1, max_p - 1, -1)` with `y` decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `custo += a_values[y]` increments the value of `custo` by the value of `a_values[y]`. The values of `a_values` and `b_values` remain unchanged as they are empty lists. The condition for updating `custo` based on the comparison between `a_values[y]` and `b_values[y]` is not directly affected by this line of code, so the state of `y` remains as specified in the initial state.
