Output State: **`custo` is increased by `b_values[max_p - 2] + a_values[0]`, `y` is `max_p - 2`, `a_values` is an empty list, `b_values` is an empty list, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block specified, the `break` statement does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of `custo`, `y`, `a_values`, and `b_values` remain unchanged, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
