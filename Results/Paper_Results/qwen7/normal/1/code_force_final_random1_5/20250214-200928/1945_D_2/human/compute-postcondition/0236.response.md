Output State: **`custo` is increased by `b_values[y]`, `y` is `max_p - 2`, `a_values` is an empty list, `b_values` is an empty list**

Explanation: The code `custo += b_values[y]` increments the value of `custo` by the value of `b_values[y]`. Given that `y` is initially set to `max_p - 2`, and `b_values` is an empty list, the index `y` is out of bounds for the list `b_values`. However, since no error handling is provided, we assume the operation does not affect the values of `a_values` and `b_values`. Thus, `custo` is increased by `b_values[max_p - 2]`, which is undefined due to the empty list, but the structure of the variables remains unchanged otherwise.
