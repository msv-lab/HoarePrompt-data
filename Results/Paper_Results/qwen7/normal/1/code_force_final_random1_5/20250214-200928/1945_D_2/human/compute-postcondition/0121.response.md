Output State: **`total` is 0 + the value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `na_frente` is greater than or equal to -1, `c` is 1, `pos_final` is an input integer minus 1, `v` is -3, and `best` remains unchanged if `best` is greater than or equal to `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.**

Explanation:
- The initial state of `total` depends on the conditions involving `v` and `pos_final`. However, since `v` is -3 and `pos_final` is an input integer minus 1, we need to evaluate the condition `v <= pos_final`. Given `v` is -3, `pos_final` is an input integer minus 1, the condition `v <= pos_final` will be true if the input integer is 2 or more. But since the exact input integer is not specified, we consider the general case.
- The code updates `total` by adding the value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to `total`. Since `v` is -3, `total` is updated to `0 + custo_pra_passar_b[-3]`.
- All other variables (`na_frente`, `c`, `pos_final`, `v`, and `best`) remain unchanged unless specified otherwise.
