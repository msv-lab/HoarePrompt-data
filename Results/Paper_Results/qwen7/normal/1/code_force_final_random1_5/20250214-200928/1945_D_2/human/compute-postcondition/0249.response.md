State: **`custos` is a list containing the total sum of `custo` values calculated for each iteration of the loop, and `y` is 0, `c` must be in the list `custos`**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop iterates over the elements in the list `custos`.
2. The variable `c` is used as the iterator in the loop.
3. For the loop to execute, there must be at least one element in the list `custos`.
4. The initial state of `y` being 0 does not affect the loop's execution directly since `y` is not used in the loop header.
5. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the condition under which the loop can start executing, which is that `c` must be an element in the list `custos`.

Thus, the state to be adjusted is that `c` must be in the list `custos`.
