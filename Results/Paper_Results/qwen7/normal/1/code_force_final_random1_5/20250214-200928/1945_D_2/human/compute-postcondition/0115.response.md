Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables and their initial states:**
   - `v` is the loop variable.
   - `na_frente` is the starting value of `v`.
   - The loop iterates from `na_frente` to `-1` (inclusive) with a step of `-1`.

2. **Understand the loop body behavior:**
   - The loop updates `total` based on conditions involving `v`, `pos_final`, and other variables.
   - `best` is updated if `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is better than the current `best`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration:**
   - `total` is either `0 + custo_pra_trocar_a[-2]` or `0 + custo_pra_passar_b[v]` depending on whether `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`.
   - `na_frente` is greater than or equal to `-1`.
   - `c` is `1`.
   - `pos_final` is an input integer minus `1`.
   - `v` is `-2`.
   - `best` remains unchanged if `best` is greater than or equal to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, otherwise it is updated.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration:**
   - Since the loop iterates in reverse, the next value of `v` would be `-1`.
   - We need to check if `v` is within the range defined by `na_frente` to `-1`.

Given that `v` was `-2` at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `v` will be `-1`.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly:**
   - `v` will be `-1`.
   - `na_frente` remains unchanged and is still greater than or equal to `-1`.
   - `c` remains `1`.
   - `pos_final` remains unchanged.
   - `best` remains unchanged unless the condition `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is better than `best`, but since `v` is now `-1`, this condition will not be checked as `v` is out of the range for updating `best` (it was `-2`).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `total` is either `0 + custo_pra_trocar_a[-2]` or `0 + custo_passar_b[v]` depending on whether `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, `na_frente` is greater than or equal to `-1`, `c` is `1`, `pos_final` is an input integer minus `1`, `v` is `-1`, and `best` remains unchanged.**
