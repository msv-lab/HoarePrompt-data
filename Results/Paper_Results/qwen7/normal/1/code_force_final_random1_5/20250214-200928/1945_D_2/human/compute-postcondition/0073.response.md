Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the variable `v` iterating over the range from `na_frente` to `-1` with a step of `-1`. Therefore, the variables involved in the loop head are `v`, `na_frente`, and the range itself.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `v`**: The loop starts with `v` being equal to `na_frente`. Since `na_frente` is defined as an input integer minus 2, we need to ensure that `v` starts at this value.

3. **Understand the Range**: The range is specified as `range(na_frente, -1, -1)`. This means `v` will take values starting from `na_frente` down to `-1`.

4. **Initial Values of Other Variables**: The other variables (`c`, `pos_final`, `v`, `custo_pra_passar_b`, and `best`) are not directly involved in the loop head, so their initial values do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

5. **Ensure the Loop Can Execute**: For the loop to execute, `na_frente` must be greater than or equal to `-1`. If `na_frente` is less than `-1`, the loop will not execute because there would be no valid range to iterate over.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

- `v` should start at `na_frente`.
- `na_frente` must be greater than or equal to `-1`.

Therefore, the final state is:

**State: `total` is 0, `na_frente` must be greater than or equal to -1, `v` is `na_frente`**
