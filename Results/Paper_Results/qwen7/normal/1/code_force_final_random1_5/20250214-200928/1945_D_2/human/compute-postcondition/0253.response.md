Based on the initial state provided:

- `custos` is a list containing the total sum of `custo` values calculated for each iteration of the loop, excluding the previously processed value.
- `y` is 0.
- `c` is the next element in the `custos` list.

The `print(c)` statement will print the value of `c`, which is the next element in the `custos` list.

Output: **the next element in the `custos` list**
