Output State: **`total` is 0 plus `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `na_frente` must be greater than or equal to -1, `c` is 1, `pos_final` is an input integer minus 1, `v` is -1, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers entered by the user converted to integers, `best` is 10000000000, `v` is less than `pos_final`, and `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is greater than or equal to `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`**.

In more natural language: The variable `total` is now the sum of its previous value (which was 0) and the value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
