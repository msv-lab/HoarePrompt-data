Output State: **`total` is 0 + custo_pra_trocar_a[-2], `na_frente` is greater than or equal to -1, `c` is 1, `pos_final` is an input integer minus 1, and `v` is -2.**

Explanation: The code updates `total` by adding `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` to it. Given that `v` is -2, `total` becomes `0 + custo_pra_trocar_a[-2]`. The other variables (`na_frente`, `c`, `pos_final`, and `v`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
