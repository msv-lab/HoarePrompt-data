Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `y` will be set to 0, `a_values` will be a list containing all the integer values of `y` from `max_p - 1` down to 1, and `b_values` will also be a list containing the same integer values. The variable `custo` will be the sum of all elements in `a_values` plus the last element in `b_values` if the loop breaks when `y` is 1, or it will be the sum of selected elements based on the conditions inside the loop.

To break it down further:
- `y` starts from `max_p - 1` and decreases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0.
- During each iteration, `a_values` and `b_values` append the current value of `y`.
- `custo` is updated based on whether the condition `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]` is met. If the condition is true, `custo` is incremented by `b_values[y]`; otherwise, it is incremented by `a_values[y]`. If `y` reaches 1 and the condition holds, `custo` is further incremented by `a_values[0]` and the loop breaks. If the condition fails before `y` reaches 1, the loop breaks without adding `a_values[0]` to `custo`.

Since the loop runs from `max_p - 1` down to 1, `a_values` and `b_values` will contain the integers from `max_p - 1` to 1 in reverse order.
