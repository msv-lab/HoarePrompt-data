Output State: **`total` is 0 + the value at index `-2` of `custo_pra_passar_b`, `na_frente` is greater than or equal to -1, `c` is 1, `pos_final` is an input integer minus 1, `v` is -3, and `best` remains unchanged if `best` is greater than or equal to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, otherwise `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`.**

Explanation:
- The initial state of `total` is determined based on the conditions involving `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b`. Since `v` is -3, which is less than or equal to `pos_final` (which is an input integer minus 1), the condition `total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]` updates `total` to `0 + custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, which is `0 + the value at index `-2` of `custo_pra_passar_b``.
- The values of `na_frente`, `c`, `pos_final`, `v`, and `best` remain unchanged as per the given conditions.
