Output State: **`a_values` is an empty list, `b_values` is an empty list, `custo` is increased by `b_values[y]`, and `y` is within the range defined by `range(num_fila - 1, max_p - 1, -1)` with `y` decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `custo += b_values[y]` increments `custo` by the value of `b_values[y]`. The values of `a_values` and `b_values` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code. The variable `y` is also not directly modified by this line, but it continues to follow its defined range and decrementing behavior.
