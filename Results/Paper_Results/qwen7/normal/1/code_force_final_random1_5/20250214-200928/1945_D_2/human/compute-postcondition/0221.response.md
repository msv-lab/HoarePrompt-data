Output State: **`y` is 0; `a_values` is an empty list; `custo` is `a_values[0]` which is undefined because `a_values` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code attempts to add the value at index `y` of `a_values` to `custo`. Since `y` is 0 and `a_values` is an empty list, `a_values[0]` does not exist, resulting in an undefined value for `custo`. The other variables remain unchanged.
