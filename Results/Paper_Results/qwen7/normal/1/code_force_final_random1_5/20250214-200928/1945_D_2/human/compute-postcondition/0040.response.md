Output State: **`total` is an integer, `c` is an integer, `na_frente` is `na_frente - 1`, `pos_final` is `pos_final - 1`, `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]` if `best` is not greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `total` by adding `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to its current value. The other variables (`c`, `na_frente`, `pos_final`, and `best`) remain unchanged unless `best` is greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, which is not the case here.
