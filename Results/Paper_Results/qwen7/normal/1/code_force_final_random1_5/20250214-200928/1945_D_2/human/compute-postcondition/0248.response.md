Output State: **`custos` is a list containing the total sum of `custo` values calculated for each iteration of the loop, and `y` is 0.**

Natural Language Description: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `custos` will be a list that contains the cumulative sum of the `custo` values calculated for each individual iteration. The variable `y` will be reset to 0 at the end of the last iteration, as it is reinitialized to 0 at the start of each new iteration of the loop. The values of `a_values` and `b_values` lists will be updated according to the conditions specified within the loop, but since the question does not ask for their final state, we can conclude that they will contain the processed values as per the loop's logic for each iteration.
