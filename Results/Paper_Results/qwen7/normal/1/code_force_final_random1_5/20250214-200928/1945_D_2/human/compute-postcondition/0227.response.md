Output State: **`y` is `max_p - 1`, `a_values` is an empty list, `b_values` is an empty list, and `custo` is `a_values[0] + custo`.**

Explanation: The code `custo += a_values[0]` increments the value of `custo` by the first element of the list `a_values`. Since `a_values` is an empty list, `a_values[0]` does not exist, which means the code attempts to access an index that does not exist in the list. However, since the initial state of `custo` is defined as `b_values[0] + custo`, and `b_values` is also an empty list, `b_values[0]` does not exist either. Therefore, the value of `custo` remains unchanged from its initial state. Thus, the updated value of `custo` is `a_values[0] + custo`, which is equivalent to the initial value of `custo` since `a_values[0]` is undefined. All other variables remain in their initial state.
