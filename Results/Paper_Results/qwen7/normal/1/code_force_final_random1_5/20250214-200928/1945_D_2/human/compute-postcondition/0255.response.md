Based on the initial state provided:

- `custos` is a list containing the total sum of `custo` values calculated for each iteration of the loop, excluding the previously processed value.
- `y` is 0.
- `c` is the next element in the `custos` list (which is the next value in the sequence).

The print statement `print(c)` will print the next element in the `custos` list after the previous value has been processed.

Since the exact values in the `custos` list are not specified, we can only describe `c` as the next element in the list.

Output: **the next element in the `custos` list**
