Output State: **`custo` is increased by `a_values[y]`, `y` is `max_p - 2`, `a_values` is an empty list, `b_values` is an empty list and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there are no loops or conditionals present in the given code snippet, the only effect is that the program breaks out of the implied context (such as a loop or conditional block). The values of the variables remain unchanged as no new assignments or operations are performed.
