Output State: **`total` is 0, `na_frente` is the input integer minus 2, `c` is 1, `pos_final` is an input integer minus 1, `v` is -1, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers entered by the user converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code simply initializes `total` to 0. This affects only the `total` variable, setting it to 0. All other variables (`na_frente`, `c`, `pos_final`, `v`, and `custo_pra_passar_b`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
