Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head is `for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1):`. The variables involved in this loop are `v` and `na_frente`.

2. **Understand the Current State:**
   - `total` is either `0 + custo_pra_trocar_a[-2]` or `0 + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` depending on whether `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`.
   - `na_frente` is greater than or equal to -1.
   - `c` is 1 (not needed for this adjustment).
   - `pos_final` is an input integer minus 1.
   - `v` is -2.
   - `best` remains unchanged if `best` is greater than or equal to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, otherwise it is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`.
   - If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, `total` is `0 + custo_pra_passar_b[v]` if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, otherwise `total` is `0 + custo_pra_passar_b[-2]`.

3. **Determine the Next Value of `v`:**
   Since the loop is iterating from `na_frente` to `-1` in reverse order, the current value of `v` is `-2`. The next value of `v` will be `-3`.

4. **Adjust the State:**
   - `v` will be `-3`.
   - `na_frente` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.

5. **Construct the New State:**
   - `total` remains unchanged because the loop has not yet executed for `v = -3`.
   - `na_frente` remains the same.
   - `c` remains 1.
   - `pos_final` remains the same.
   - `best` remains unchanged because the loop has not yet executed for `v = -3`.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`total` is either 0 + `custo_pra_trocar_a[-2]` or 0 + `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` depending on whether `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, `na_frente` is greater than or equal to -1, `c` is 1, `pos_final` is an input integer minus 1, `v` is -3, and `best` remains unchanged if `best` is greater than or equal to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, otherwise `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, `total` is 0 + the value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, otherwise `total` is 0 + the value at index `-2` of `custo_pra_passar_b`.**
