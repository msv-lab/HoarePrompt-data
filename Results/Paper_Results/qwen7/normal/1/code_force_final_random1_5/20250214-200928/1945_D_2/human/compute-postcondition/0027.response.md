Output State: **`total` is 0 plus the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is `na_frente` - 1, `pos_final` is `pos_final` - 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from another input split and mapped to integers, `best` is 10000000000, `v` is greater than `pos_final`, and the current value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than the current value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.**

In simpler terms: The variable `total` is updated by adding the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` to its current value (which was 0). All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
