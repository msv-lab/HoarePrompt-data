The only variables in the loop head are `c` and `cases`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `c`. At the end of the last iteration, `c` is 1, and `pos_final` is the input integer minus 1. For the loop to execute again, `c` must be incremented by 1, so `c` becomes 2.

Since `cases` is not specified in the problem statement, we assume it is an initial value that allows the loop to start. If `cases` is set to 2 initially, then for the loop to execute again, `c` must be 2, and `cases` must be greater than or equal to 2.

Given this, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect these changes:

State: **`total` will be the sum of the minimum cost path from `na_frente` to `pos_final` considering both `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b`, `na_frente` will be -1, `c` will be 2, `pos_final` will be the input integer minus 1, `v` will be -1 - (the length of `custo_pra_frente`), and `best` will be the minimum cumulative cost found during the loop execution.**
