Postcondition: `total` is 0, `na_frente` is greater than or equal to -1, `c` is 1, `pos_final` is an input integer minus 1, `v` is -1, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers entered by the user converted to integers, and `best` is the minimum value between the initial `best` (1000000000) and `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. Additionally, if `v` is less than `pos_final`, `total` is either `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if it is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` if it is greater than or equal to `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.
