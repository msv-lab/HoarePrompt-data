Output State: **`total` is an integer, `c` is an integer, `na_frente` is `na_frente - 1`, `pos_final` is `pos_final - 1`, `v` is `na_frente - 1`, `total` is updated by adding `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` to its current value.**

Explanation: The code updates the `total` variable by adding the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` to its current value. The other variables (`c`, `na_frente`, `pos_final`, and `v`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
