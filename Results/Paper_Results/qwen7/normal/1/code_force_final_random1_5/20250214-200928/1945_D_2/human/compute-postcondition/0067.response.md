Output State: **`total` contains the minimum cumulative cost calculated by the loop, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is an input integer, `pos_final` is an input integer, `v` is -1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of space-separated integers from the user and converts them into a list of integers using `map(int, input().split())`. This list is assigned to the variable `custo_pra_trocar_a`. The other variables (`total`, `c`, `na_frente`, `pos_final`, and `v`) remain unchanged with their respective initial values.
