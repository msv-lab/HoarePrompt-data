You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The guys lined up in a queue of n people, starting with person number i = 1 ,
to ask Serafim the Owl about the meaning of life. Unfortunately, Kirill was
very busy writing the legend for this problem, so he arrived a little later
and stood at the end of the line after the n -th person. Kirill is completely
dissatisfied with this situation, so he decided to bribe some people ahead of
him.

For the i -th person in the queue, Kirill knows two values: a_i and b_i . If
at the moment Kirill is standing at position i , then he can choose any
position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j .
In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that
j < k < i , Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k .
Kirill can perform this action any number of times.

Kirill is thrifty, so he wants to spend as few coins as possible, but he
doesn't want to wait too long, so Kirill believes he should be among the first
m people in line.

Help Kirill determine the minimum number of coins he will have to spend in
order to not wait too long.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows
the description of the test case.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le m \le n
\le 200\,000 ) — the number of people in the queue besides Kirill and the
maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n separated by spaces
(1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n separated by spaces (1
\le b_i \le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of coins
Kirill needs to spend.

    #State: Output State: `na_frente` is an input integer minus 1, `v` is -1 (indicating the loop has completed all its iterations), `c` is 10000 (the value of `cases` minus 1), and `total` holds the accumulated cost based on the conditions specified within the loop. The variable `best` will store the lowest value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` when `v <= pos_final` and the condition `custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]` is met during any iteration of the loop.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, `na_frente` will be the input integer minus 1, `v` will be -1 indicating the loop has completed, `c` will be the original input integer `cases` minus 1, and `total` will contain the minimum cumulative cost calculated by the loop. `best` will hold the lowest cumulative cost found during the loop's execution.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case includes an integer `t`, two integers `na_frente` and `pos_final`, and two lists `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b`. It calculates the minimum cumulative cost based on specific conditions and prints the result for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function outputs the lowest cumulative cost found for each case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program does not handle the scenario where Kirill needs to move through multiple positions to reach his desired spot, and it incorrectly accumulates costs.

Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Incorrect Cost Accumulation Logic**: The program attempts to accumulate costs in a way that doesn't properly account for the conditions described. It tries to minimize the cost by choosing the cheaper option between `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b`, but it does not ensure that the best path is chosen for reaching the desired position.

2. **Logic Flaws**: The program uses a backward iteration approach to calculate the minimum cost, but it does not correctly propagate the minimum cost from each position to the next. This leads to incorrect results because it does not consider the cumulative effect of moving through multiple positions.

3. **Example Case to Demonstrate Incorrectness**:
   - Consider the following input:
     ```
     1
     4 2
     7 3 6 9
     4 3 8 5
     ```
   - According to the problem description, Kirill needs to be in one of the first 2 positions. The optimal strategy would be to move Kirill to position 1 directly, which would cost `7` coins (since `a_1 = 7` and `b_1 = 4`).

   - However, the program calculates the cost as `14` coins, which is incorrect. The program fails to recognize that moving directly to position 1 is the optimal choice.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem description, and thus, the correctness is **False**.
