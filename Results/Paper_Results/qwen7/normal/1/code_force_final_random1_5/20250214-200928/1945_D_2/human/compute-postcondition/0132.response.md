Output State: **`na_frente` is an input integer, `pos_final` is an input integer minus 1, `c` is 2, `v` is -1 minus the length of `custo_pra_frente`, and `best` is the minimum cumulative cost found during the loop execution.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `na_frente` and `pos_final`. These values are derived from the input split into two parts. The other variables (`c`, `v`, and `best`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
