Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case includes an integer `t`, two integers `na_frente` and `pos_final`, and two lists `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b`. It calculates the minimum cumulative cost based on specific conditions and prints the result for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function outputs the lowest cumulative cost found for each case.**
