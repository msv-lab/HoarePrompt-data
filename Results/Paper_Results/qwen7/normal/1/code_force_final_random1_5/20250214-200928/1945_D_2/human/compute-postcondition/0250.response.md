Based on the initial state provided:

- `custos` is a list containing the total sum of `custo` values calculated for each iteration of the loop.
- `y` is 0.
- `c` must be in the list `custos`.

The print statement `print(c)` will print the value of `c`, which is guaranteed to be one of the elements in the list `custos`.

Output: **c (where c is one of the elements in the list custos)**
