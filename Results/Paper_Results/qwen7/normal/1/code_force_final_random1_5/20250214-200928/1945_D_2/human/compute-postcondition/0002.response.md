Output State: **`cases` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, c is 0, `na_frente` is an input integer, `pos_final` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from input and assigns them to the variables `na_frente` and `pos_final`. The initial value of `cases` and `c` remains unchanged. Therefore, `cases` must still be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, and `c` is still 0. The values of `na_frente` and `pos_final` are the integers input by the user.
