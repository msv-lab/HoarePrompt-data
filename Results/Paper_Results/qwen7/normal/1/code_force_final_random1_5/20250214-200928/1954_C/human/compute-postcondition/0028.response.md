Output State: **`i` is equal to `i + 1`, `new2` is a list where each element is the minimum value of corresponding elements from lists `a` and `b` for each index except for the (i-1)-th index which is now the maximum value of `a[i-1]` and `b[i-1]`, `new` is a list where each element is the maximum value of corresponding elements from lists `a` and `b` for each index, and `new[i-1]` is updated to be the minimum value of `a[i-1]` and `b[i-1]`.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value to `i + 1`. All other variables and their relationships remain unchanged. Therefore, `new2` and `new` retain their original structure and values, with the exception that the (i-1)-th index in `new2` is now the maximum of `a[i-1]` and `b[i-1]`, and the (i-1)-th index in `new` is now the minimum of `a[i-1]` and `b[i-1]`.
