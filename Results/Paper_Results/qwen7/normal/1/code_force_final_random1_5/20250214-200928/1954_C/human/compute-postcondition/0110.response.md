Output State: **`new` array has its `i`-th element updated to be the minimum between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, while `i` remains less than `len(a)`.**

Explanation: The code updates the `new` array such that its `i`-th element is set to the minimum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]`. The condition `i` is less than `len(a)` is preserved, meaning `i` still satisfies this condition after the assignment.
