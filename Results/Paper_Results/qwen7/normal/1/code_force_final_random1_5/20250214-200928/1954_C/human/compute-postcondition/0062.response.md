Output State: `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `new` is a list where each element is the maximum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for the indices where `a[i]` was equal to `b[i]` during the loop's execution, and `new2` is a list where each element is the minimum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for the indices where `a[i]` was equal to `b[i]` during the loop's execution.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will have reached the length of list `a`. The list `new` will contain the maximum values from corresponding elements of lists `a` and `b` where those elements were equal. Similarly, the list `new2` will contain the minimum values from corresponding elements of lists `a` and `b` where those elements were equal.
