Output State: **`i` is `len(a)`, `new[i]` is `min(a[i], b[i])`, `new2[i]` is `max(a[i], b[i])`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `max(a[i], b[i])` to `new2[i]`. Since `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `new[i]` is `min(a[i], b[i])`, and there are no other changes to the variables, these values remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes the new assignment for `new2[i]`.
