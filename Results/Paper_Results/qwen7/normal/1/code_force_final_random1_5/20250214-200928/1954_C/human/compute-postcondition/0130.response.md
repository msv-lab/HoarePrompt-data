Functionality: **The function reads pairs of digit strings from standard input, compares the corresponding digits of each pair, and prints two new strings. The first string contains the minimum digit from each pair, while the second string contains the maximum digit from each pair. This process is repeated for the number of pairs specified by the user. After processing all pairs, the function does not return any value.**
