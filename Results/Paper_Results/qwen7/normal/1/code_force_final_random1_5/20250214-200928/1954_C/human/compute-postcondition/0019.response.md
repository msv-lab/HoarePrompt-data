Output State: `i` is equal to the length of `a`; for every index `j` where `0 <= j < len(a)`, `new[j]` is equal to `max(a[j], b[j])` and `new2[j]` is equal to `min(a[j], b[j])`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to the length of the list `a`. The lists `new` and `new2` will be fully populated such that for each index `j`, `new[j]` contains the maximum value between `a[j]` and `b[j]`, and `new2[j]` contains the minimum value between `a[j]` and `b[j]`. This occurs because the loop continues as long as `i` is less than the length of `a` and the elements at index `i` in both `a` and `b` are equal. Once these conditions are no longer met, the loop terminates, and `i` will be set to the length of `a`, indicating that all elements have been processed.
