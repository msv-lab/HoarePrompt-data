Output State: **`i` is 2; `new2[2]` is equal to `min(a[2], b[2])`; `a[1]` is equal to `b[1]`**

Explanation: The code assigns the minimum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]` to `new2[i]`. Given that `i` is 2, `new2[2]` is set to `min(a[2], b[2])`. The other variables and their relationships remain unchanged.
