The loop condition is `i < len(a)`. For the loop to execute one more time, the variable `i` must be less than `len(a)`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is increased by 1 and is now less than `len(a)`. This means that `i` was originally equal to `len(a) - 1` before the increment, and after the increment, `i` is now `len(a)`. However, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(a)`, which means `i` should be set to `len(a) - 1`.

So, we need to adjust the state of `i` to be `len(a) - 1`.

State: **`new2[i]` is assigned the maximum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `i` is `len(a) - 1` and is now less than `len(a)`**
