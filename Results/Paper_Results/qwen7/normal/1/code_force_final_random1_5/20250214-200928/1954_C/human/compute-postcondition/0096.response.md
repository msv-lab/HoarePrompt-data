Output State: **`new[i]` is equal to `max(a[i], b[i])`, `i` must be less than `len(a)`, and `a[1]` must be equal to `b[1]`**

Explanation: The code assigns the maximum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]` to `new[i]`. Since `i` must be less than `len(a)` and `a[1]` must be equal to `b[1]` before the code execution, these conditions remain valid after the code execution. The value of `new[i]` is updated to the maximum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`.
