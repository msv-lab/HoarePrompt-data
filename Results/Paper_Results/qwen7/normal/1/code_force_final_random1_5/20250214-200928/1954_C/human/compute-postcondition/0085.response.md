Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The key variables here are the input value that determines the number of iterations.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `i` is equal to `len(a)`.
   - For every index `j` from `0` to `len(a)-1`, `new[j]` contains the minimum value between `a[j]` and `b[j]`.
   - For every index `j` from `0` to `len(a)-1`, `new2[j]` contains the maximum value between `a[j]` and `b[j]`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as the input value (let's call it `num_iterations`) is greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is controlled by the input value, the only variable that needs to be adjusted is the input value itself.
   - After each iteration, the input value should be decremented by 1 because the loop runs for a specified number of times based on the input.

5. **Formulate the new state**: At the start of the next iteration, the input value should be decreased by 1. Therefore, if the input value was `num_iterations` before the last iteration, it will be `num_iterations - 1` for the next iteration.

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

**State: `i` is equal to `len(a)`, for every index `j` from `0` to `len(a)-1`, `new[j]` contains the minimum value between `a[j]` and `b[j]`, for every index `j` from `0` to `len(a)-1`, `new2[j]` contains the maximum value between `a[j]` and `b[j]`, and the input value for the next iteration is `num_iterations - 1`.**

Since the input value is the only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted, we focus on that:

**State: `i` is equal to `len(a)`, for every index `j` from `0` to `len(a)-1`, `new[j]` contains the minimum value between `a[j]` and `b[j]`, for every index `j` from `0` to `len(a)-1`, `new2[j]` contains the maximum value between `a[j]` and `b[j]`, and the input value for the next iteration is `num_iterations - 1`.**

However, since the input value is not explicitly mentioned in the state, we can simplify it to just the adjustment of the input value:

**State: The input value for the next iteration is `num_iterations - 1`.**

To fit the required format:

**State: **The input value for the next iteration is `num_iterations - 1`.**
