Postcondition: **`i` is equal to `len(a)`, `new` is a list where each element is the maximum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for the indices where `a[i]` was equal to `b[i]` during the loop's execution, and `new2` is a list where each element is the minimum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for the indices where `a[i]` was equal to `b[i]` during the loop's execution. The condition `i != len(a)` is not satisfied.**
