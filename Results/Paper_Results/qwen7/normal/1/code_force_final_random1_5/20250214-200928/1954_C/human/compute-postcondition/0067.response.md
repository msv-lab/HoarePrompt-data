Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `i < len(a)`.
2. **Determine the variables involved in the loop condition**: The only variable involved in the loop condition is `i`.
3. **Current state of `i`**: The state right before the loop is that `i` is increased by 1. This means `i` is already at least 1 (assuming `i` starts from 0).
4. **Loop condition requirement**: For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be less than `len(a)`.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `i` is less than `len(a)` for the loop to execute the first time. Since `i` is increased by 1 right before the loop, we need to make sure that `i` is less than `len(a)`.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i` being less than `len(a)`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is increased by 1 and must be less than `len(a)`**
