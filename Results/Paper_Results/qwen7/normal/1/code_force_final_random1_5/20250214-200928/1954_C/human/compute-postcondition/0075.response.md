The loop condition is `i < len(a)`. For the loop to execute one more time, the variable `i` must satisfy this condition. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `len(a) - 1`. To allow the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to `len(a)`.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. The current state of `i` is `len(a) - 1`.
2. For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `len(a)`.
3. Therefore, `i` must be incremented to `len(a)`.

No other states need to be adjusted because the loop condition only depends on `i`.

State: **`i` is `len(a)`**
