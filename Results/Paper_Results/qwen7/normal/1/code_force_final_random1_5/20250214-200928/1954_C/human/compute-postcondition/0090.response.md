Output State: **`i` is 0, `num_iterations - 1` is the input value for the next iteration, `a` is a list of integers converted from the input string, `b` is a list of integers converted from the current input, `new` is a list of length equal to `a` filled with `None` values, `new2` is a list of length equal to `a` filled with `None` values.**

The variable `i` is initialized to 0, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
