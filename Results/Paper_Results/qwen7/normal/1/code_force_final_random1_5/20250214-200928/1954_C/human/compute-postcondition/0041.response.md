Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is equal to the length of list `a`.
   - `new2` is a list where each element is the minimum value of corresponding elements from lists `a` and `b` for each index up to `len(a)-1`.
   - `new` is a list where each element is the maximum value of corresponding elements from lists `a` and `b` for each index up to `len(a)-1`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(''.join(str(x) for x in new))
   ```

From the initial state, we know:
- `i = len(a)`
- `new` is constructed such that for each index `j` (from 0 to `i-1`), `new[j]` is the maximum of `a[j]` and `b[j]`.

The `print` statement joins all elements of the list `new` into a single string, with each element converted to a string.

Given this, the output will be a string that concatenates all the elements of `new` into one continuous string.

Output: **a string of concatenated elements from the list `new`**
