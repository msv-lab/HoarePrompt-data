Output State: **`new2[i]` is set to the maximum between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `new` array has its `(i+1)`-th element updated to be the minimum between `a[i+1]` and `b[i+1]`, and `new[i]` is now the minimum between `a[i]` and `b[i]`; variable `i` is increased by 1.**

This means that the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, while the conditions and values of `new2[i]`, `new[i]`, and `new` array's `(i+1)`-th element remain unchanged from their previous states.
