Output State: **`i` is equal to the length of list `a`, `new2` is a list where each element is the minimum value of corresponding elements from lists `a` and `b` for each index up to `len(a)-1`, `new` is a list where each element is the maximum value of corresponding elements from lists `a` and `b` for each index up to `len(a)-1`, and `b` is a list of integers created from the input string.**

Explanation: The code `b = list(map(int, list(input())))` takes an input string, converts it into a list of characters, and then maps each character to an integer. This means `b` is updated to a list of integers based on the input. The values of `i`, `new2`, `new`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial state.
