Postcondition: `i` is equal to the length of `a`, and `new` and `new2` are lists where each element is determined as follows: if `a[i-1]` was equal to `b[i-1]` during the loop's execution, the element in `new` is the minimum value between the corresponding elements in `a` and `b`, and the element in `new2` is the maximum value between the corresponding elements in `a` and `b`.
