Output State: **`num_iterations - 1` is the input value for the next iteration; `a` is a list of integers converted from the input string.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, list(input())))` takes the input value for the next iteration which is `num_iterations - 1`, converts it into a string, splits it into individual characters, converts each character to an integer, and then maps these integers into a list. The original value of `num_iterations - 1` remains unchanged, but now there is a new variable `a` which holds the list of integers obtained from the input.
