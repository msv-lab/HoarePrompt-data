Output State: **`new2[i+1]` is set to the maximum between `a[i+1]` and `b[i+1]`, while `i+1` remains less than `len(a)`; `new` array has its `(i+1)`-th element updated to be the minimum between `a[i+1]` and `b[i+1]`.**

This output state reflects that the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, and the operations on `new2` and `new` arrays are now applied to the next index (`i+1`). All other conditions and relationships remain unchanged.
