Postcondition: `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `new` is a list where each element is the minimum value between the corresponding elements in `a` and `b` where `a[i-1]` was equal to `b[i-1]` during the loop's execution, and `new2` is a list where each element is the maximum value between the corresponding elements in `a` and `b` where `a[i-1]` was equal to `b[i-1]` during the loop's execution.
