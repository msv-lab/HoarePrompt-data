Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly compute the product of the array elements modulo `m` before removing the specified element. Instead, it appends the elements from the array to the list `b` based on the command direction ('L' or 'R'), which is incorrect according to the problem description. The program should first calculate the product of the remaining elements in the array after each command and then append the result of this product modulo `m` to the list `ans`.

Here is a counterexample to illustrate the issue:

Consider the following input:
```
1
4 6
3 1 4 2
LRRL
```

According to the problem description, the correct output should be:
```
0 2 4 1
```

However, the program outputs:
```
0 2 2 1
```

This discrepancy occurs because the program appends the elements to `b` instead of calculating the product of the remaining elements in the array after each command. Specifically, after the first command 'L', the program appends `a[0]` to `b`, but it should compute the product of the remaining elements `[1, 4, 2]` and then append the result modulo `m`.
