Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a logical error in how it processes the commands and updates the array `a`. Specifically, the program does not correctly compute the product of the remaining elements of the array `a` after each command. Instead, it incorrectly appends elements from the original array `a` to the list `b` based on the command direction ('L' or 'R'), which does not reflect the intended behavior of removing elements from `a`.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    print(*func_1(n, m, a, s))

def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    ans = []
    prod = 1
    for i in range(n):
        # Compute the product of the remaining elements in the array
        for j in range(i):
            prod = (prod * a[j]) % m
        ans.append(prod)
        
        # Process the command
        if s[i] == 'L':
            a.pop(0)  # Remove the leftmost element
        else:
            a.pop()   # Remove the rightmost element
            
        # Update the product with the new state of the array
        if a:
            prod = (prod // a[0]) % m if s[i] == 'L' else (prod // a[-1]) % m
        else:
            prod = 0
    
    return ans
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Code:
1. **Initialization**: We initialize `prod` to 1 and use it to keep track of the product of the remaining elements in the array.
2. **Product Calculation**: For each command, we compute the product of the remaining elements up to the current index `i`.
3. **Command Processing**: Depending on the command ('L' or 'R'), we remove the appropriate element from the array.
4. **Update Product**: After removing an element, we update `prod` to reflect the new product of the remaining elements.
5. **Result Collection**: We append the current value of `prod` to the result list `ans`.

This approach ensures that the product is correctly computed and updated after each command, reflecting the intended behavior of the problem.
