Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `v in reversed(b)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `v` and `b`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in `b` (i.e., `b` must contain at least one element).

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `p` is `p * v % m` (This is an expression, not a variable to be adjusted).
   - `ans` contains the value of `p` (This is an expression, not a variable to be adjusted).
   - `b` must contain at least one element.

4. **Adjusting the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `reversed(b)`, at the end of each iteration, `b` loses its last element.
   - Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `b` must still contain at least one element, but it will lose its last element after this iteration.

5. **Determine the new state**:
   - `p` and `ans` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.
   - `b` must still contain at least one element, but it will lose its last element after this iteration.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `b` will lose its last element but still contain at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`p` is `p * v % m`, `ans` contains the value of `p`, `b` must contain at least two elements**
