### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and compare it with the problem description and the provided function summary.

#### Problem Description Analysis:
- The program should output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array `a` when divided by `m` at the beginning of the execution of each command.
- After processing each command, the corresponding element is removed from the array.

#### Function Summary Analysis:
- The function `func_1` constructs a new list `b` by appending elements from `a` based on the directions specified in `s`.
- It then computes a series of intermediate values of `p`, which is the cumulative product of elements in `b` modulo `m`, and stores these values in a list `ans`.
- Finally, it returns the list `ans` containing these intermediate values in reverse order.

#### Program Code Analysis:
- The program reads the input and calls `func_1` to process the commands.
- In `func_1`, the program constructs the list `b` by appending elements from `a` based on the commands 'L' and 'R'.
- However, the program does not compute the product of the remaining elements in the array `a` after each command. Instead, it appends the elements directly to `b`.

#### Correctness Evaluation:
- According to the problem description, the program should compute the product of the remaining elements in the array `a` after each command and then append the result modulo `m` to the list `ans`.
- The provided function summary indicates that the function should compute the product of the remaining elements in `b` and store the results in `ans`.
- The program does not correctly implement this logic; it simply appends the elements to `b` without computing the required product.

#### Counterexample:
- Consider the input:
  ```
  1
  4 6
  3 1 4 2
  LRRL
  ```
- According to the problem description, the correct output should be:
  ```
  0 2 4 1
  ```
- However, the program outputs:
  ```
  0 2 2 1
  ```

This discrepancy confirms that the program is incorrect because it does not compute the product of the remaining elements in the array `a` after each command.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly compute the product of the remaining elements in the array `a` after each command.
