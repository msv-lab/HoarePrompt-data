Output State: **`i` is 2, `l` is either 1 or 2, `b` contains `a[l]` appended to its current value, `r` is either `n - 1` or `n - 2` or `n - 3**.

Explanation: The code `b.append(a[l])` appends the element `a[l]` to the list `b`. Since `l` is either 1 or 2, `a[l]` will be either `a[1]` or `a[2]`. The values of `i`, `r`, and the previous state of `b` remain unchanged.
