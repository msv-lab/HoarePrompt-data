Output State: **`p` is `p * v % m`, `ans` contains the value of `p * v % m`, `b` must contain at least two elements**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `p` to `p * v % m`. Since `ans` was previously equal to the old value of `p`, it now contains the value of `p * v % m`. The condition for `b` remains unchanged.
