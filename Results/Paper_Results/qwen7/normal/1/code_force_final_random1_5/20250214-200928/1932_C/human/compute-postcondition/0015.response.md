Output State: **`l` is either 1 or 0; `n` is a positive integer; `m` is a positive integer; `a` is a list of `n` positive integers; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'; `b` is a list containing either the element `a[l]` or the element `a[l]` appended; `r` is either `n - 1` or `n - 2`; `i` is 1; `s[i]` is either 'L' or not 'L'.**

Explanation: The code appends the element `a[l]` to the list `b`. Since `l` is either 1 or 0, `b` will contain either `a[0]` or `a[1]` depending on the value of `l`. All other variables remain unchanged.
