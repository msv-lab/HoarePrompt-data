Output State: **`p` is `p * v % m`, `ans` is a list containing one element which is `p * v % m`, and `p` is updated to `p * v % m`.**

Explanation: The code `ans.append(p)` appends the current value of `p` to the list `ans`. Since `p` is already updated to `p * v % m` before this line, `ans` now contains the value of `p * v % m`. The value of `p` remains the same as it was just updated to `p * v % m`.
