Output State: **The program returns a list containing the intermediate values of `p` computed in each iteration of the loop from the last to the first, with each value being the cumulative product of the elements in `b` up to that point modulo `m`**.

This means that the program will return a list where each element represents the product of all elements in the list `b` up to that point, taken modulo `m`, but in reverse order compared to how they were computed during the loop.
