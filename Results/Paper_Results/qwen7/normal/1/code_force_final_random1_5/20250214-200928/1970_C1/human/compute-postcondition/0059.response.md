Postcondition: `current` is a node that has at least one neighbor, `neighbor` is the first neighbor of `current`. If `neighbor` is not in `visited`, then `visited` now includes `neighbor`, `queue` now contains `(neighbor, dist + 1)`. Since there is no else part, these changes only occur when the condition `neighbor not in visited` is true.
