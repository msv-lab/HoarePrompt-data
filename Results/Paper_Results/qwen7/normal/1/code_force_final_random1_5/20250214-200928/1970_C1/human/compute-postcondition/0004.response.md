Output State: **`x` must be greater than 1, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input**.

Explanation: The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input separated by a space and assigns them to variables `a` and `b`. The condition that `x` must be greater than 1 remains unchanged. Therefore, `x` must still be greater than 1, while `a` and `b` are the integers entered by the user.
