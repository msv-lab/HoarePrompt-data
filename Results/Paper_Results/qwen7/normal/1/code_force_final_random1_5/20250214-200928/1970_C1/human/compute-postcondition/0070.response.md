Output State: All nodes in the tree have been visited, and for each node, the value of `dist` represents the shortest distance from the start node to that node. The `visited` set contains all nodes in the tree, and the `queue` is empty since all nodes have been processed.

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, every node in the tree has been explored, and the shortest path distances from the start node to all other nodes have been calculated and stored in the `dist` variable for those nodes. The `visited` set now includes every node in the tree, indicating that they have all been visited during the traversal. The `queue` is empty because there are no more nodes to process.
