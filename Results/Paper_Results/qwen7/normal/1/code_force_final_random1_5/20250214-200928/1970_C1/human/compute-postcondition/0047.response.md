Output State: All nodes in the tree have been visited, and for each node, its distance from the `start` node is correctly recorded in the `dist` variable. The `queue` contains tuples of all unvisited neighbors and their respective distances from the start node, and `visited` includes all nodes in the tree.

In more detail, the loop continues to execute until all nodes in the tree have been processed. At this point, every node has been added to the `visited` set, ensuring no node is visited more than once. For each node, the `dist` value accurately reflects its shortest distance from the `start` node. Additionally, the `queue` will contain tuples of all remaining unvisited neighbors and their distances from the start node, though since all nodes have been visited, the queue will eventually become empty.
