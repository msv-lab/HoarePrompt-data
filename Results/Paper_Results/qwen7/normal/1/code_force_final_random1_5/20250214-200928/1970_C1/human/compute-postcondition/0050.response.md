Output State: **`current` is the node previously at the front of the queue, `dist` retains its original value representing the shortest distance from the start node to the target node, the `queue` has had its first element removed.**

Explanation: The line of code `current, dist = queue.popleft()` removes the leftmost (front) element from the `queue` and assigns its values to `current` and `dist` respectively. The `visited` set remains unchanged as no operation was performed on it within this line of code.
