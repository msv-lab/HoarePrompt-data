The loop condition is `while queue:`. This means the loop will continue as long as there are elements in the `queue`. Since all nodes have been visited and the `queue` is empty, the loop cannot execute again under the current conditions.

To prepare for the next iteration of the loop, we need to ensure that the `queue` is not empty. Therefore, we need to add at least one node to the `queue`.

State: **All nodes in the tree have been visited, `current` is the `target` node, and `dist` represents the shortest distance from the `start` node to the `target` node. The `visited` set contains every node in the tree, and the `queue` must contain at least one node.**
