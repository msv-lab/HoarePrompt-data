Output State: **`current` is a node that has at least one neighbor, `neighbor` is the first neighbor of `current`, `neighbor` is not in `visited`, `visited` now includes `neighbor`, and `queue` now contains (neighbor, dist + 1)**.

This means that the `queue` has been updated by appending a tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`. The `current` node, its first neighbor (`neighbor`), and the `visited` set's state remain unchanged from the initial state.
