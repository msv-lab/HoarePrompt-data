Output State: **`x` must be greater than 1; `a` is an integer from the input; `b` is an integer from the input; `lst[a]` now contains the original elements plus `b`.**

Explanation: The code `lst[a].append(b)` appends the value of `b` to the list at index `a` of `lst`. Since `a` and `b` are integers from the input, the list `lst` at index `a` is modified to include the new element `b`. The conditions and values of `x` and `a` remain unchanged.
