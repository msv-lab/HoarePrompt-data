Output State: **`z` is an input integer, `tmp` is now the last element of the list obtained by repeatedly popping the last element from `lst[z]` until the list is empty, `x` is 0, `one` is False, `two` is True.**

Explanation: The variable `two` is assigned the value `True`. This assignment does not affect the values of `z`, `tmp`, `x`, or `one`. Therefore, these variables retain their previous states.
