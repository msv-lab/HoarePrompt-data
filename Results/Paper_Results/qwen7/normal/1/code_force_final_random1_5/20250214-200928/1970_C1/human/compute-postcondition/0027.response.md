Output State: **`z` is an input integer, `tmp` is the last element of `lst[lst[tmp].pop()]`, `x` is 0, `one` is False**.

Explanation: The code `tmp = lst[tmp].pop()` pops the last element from the list `lst[tmp]` and assigns it to `tmp`. The initial state of `tmp` was the last element of `lst[lst[tmp].pop()]`, but after executing the code, `tmp` now holds the last element of the list that was popped from `lst[tmp]`. The values of `z`, `x`, and `one` remain unchanged.
