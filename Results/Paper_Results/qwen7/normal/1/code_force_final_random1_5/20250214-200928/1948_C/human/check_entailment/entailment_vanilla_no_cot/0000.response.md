Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Movement Logic**: The function `func_1` does not correctly simulate the robot's movement through the grid. It only checks certain conditions without actually simulating the path the robot takes based on the arrows in the grid.

2. **Incomplete Simulation**: The logic in `func_1` does not fully simulate the robot's movement. It only checks a few specific conditions and returns a result based on those checks, which is insufficient to determine if the robot can reach the target cell.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled**: The solution does not handle all edge cases and does not correctly simulate the robot moving both horizontally and vertically based on the arrows.

To solve this problem correctly, you need to simulate the robot's movement step-by-step according to the arrows in the grid. Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func_1(n, row1, row2):
    """
    判断机器人是否能够从 (1,1) 到达 (2,n)。
    """
    x, y = 1, 1  # Start at (1, 1)
    while True:
        if x == 2 and y == n:
            return 'Yes'
        if x == 1 and y < n:
            if row1[y - 1] == '>':
                y += 1
            else:
                x, y = 2, y
        elif x == 2 and y > 1:
            if row2[y - 1] == '<':
                y -= 1
            else:
                x, y = 1, y
        else:
            return 'No'

def func_2():
    """
    读取输入并处理每个测试用例。
    """
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        row1 = input()
        row2 = input()
        results.append(func_1(n, row1, row2))
    print('\n'.join(results))

func_2()
```

This corrected solution properly simulates the robot's movement and checks if it can reach the target cell `(2, n)` by following the arrows in the grid.
