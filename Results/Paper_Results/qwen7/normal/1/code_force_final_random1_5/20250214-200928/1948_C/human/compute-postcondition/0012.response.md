Based on the initial state provided:

- `a` is an input string
- `b` is a new input string
- `i` is 3
- `n` is greater than 1

The code snippet to be executed is:

```python
print('No')
```

This `print` statement directly outputs the string `'No'` without any dependence on the values of `a`, `b`, `i`, or `n`.

Output: **No**
