Postcondition: `a` is a new input string, `b` is an input string, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `n` is an integer input from the user and must be at least 3, `t` is greater than 0, and if `i + 1 < n` and either `a[i] == '<'` and `b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == '<'` and `b[i - 1] == '<'`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
