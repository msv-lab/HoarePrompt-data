Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable involved here is `t`.

2. **Determine the condition for loop execution**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Given that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the loop will definitely execute because `t` is always positive.

3. **Adjust the state**: Since the loop will definitely execute regardless of the value of `t` within its given range, we don't need to change the value of `t` explicitly. However, we need to ensure that `t` is within the specified range.

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

Since the loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0, and given the constraint \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), we can conclude that `t` must be within this range for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is simply ensuring that `t` is within the specified range.

**State:**
**`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**
