Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining if a robot starting at (1,1) can reach (2,n) by following the arrows in a 2xN grid.
2. The `func_2` function correctly reads the input for each test case, including the number of columns `n`, and the two rows of arrows.
3. For each test case, it calls `func_1` with the appropriate parameters.
4. The `func_1` function checks specific conditions to determine if the robot can reach (2,n):
   - It checks if the middle column (if `n` is odd) has a left-pointing arrow in both rows, which would prevent reaching (2,n).
   - It checks if the last column has a left-pointing arrow in the first row and a left-pointing arrow in the second row before the last column, which would also prevent reaching (2,n).
   - If none of these conditions are met, it returns 'Yes', indicating the robot can reach (2,n).

Given the problem constraints and the provided execution summaries, the logic in `func_1` appears to correctly implement the required conditions to determine if the robot can reach the target cell. The `func_2` function correctly processes multiple test cases and prints the results.

Therefore, the given program meets the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
