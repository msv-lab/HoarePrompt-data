Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop `for i in range(1, n, 2)` means that `i` will take values starting from 1 up to (but not including) `n`, incrementing by 2 each time.

3. **Initial Values**:
   - `a` is a new input string.
   - `b` is an input string.
   - `i` is equal to `n-1`.
   - `n` is an integer input from the user.
   - `t` is greater than 0.

4. **Determine the Adjustments Needed**:
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must start from a value within the range specified by `range(1, n, 2)`.
   - Given that `i` is initially set to `n-1`, we need to ensure that `n-1` is within the range `[1, n-1]` for even steps of 2.
   - Specifically, `i` should be an odd number less than `n` because the loop increments by 2 starting from 1.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `i` is initially `n-1`, we need to ensure that `n-1` is an odd number and less than `n`. This means `n` must be at least 3 (since the smallest odd number is 1, and `n-1` would be 2 if `n` were 3).
   - Therefore, `n` must be at least 3.

Given these considerations, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `n` must be at least 3.
- `i` must be an odd number less than `n`.

Since `i` is initialized as `n-1`, we can directly state that `n` must be at least 3 to ensure `i` is within the valid range for the loop.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`a` is a new input string, `b` is an input string, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `n` is an integer input from the user and must be at least 3, `t` is greater than 0**
