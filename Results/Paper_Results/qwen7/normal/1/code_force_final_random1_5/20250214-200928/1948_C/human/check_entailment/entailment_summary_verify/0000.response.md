### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summaries to evaluate the correctness of the solution.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
- The function `func_1` is designed to determine if the robot can reach cell `(2, n)` starting from cell `(1, 1)`.
- The function iterates through the first half of the grid (up to `n // 2 - 1`) and checks specific conditions:
  - If the arrow in the first row at position `2 * i + 1` is `<` and either the arrow in the second row at positions `2 * i` or `2 * i + 2` is also `<`, it returns `'No'`.
  - If the arrow in the first row at position `n - 1` is `<` and the arrow in the second row at position `n - 2` is also `<`, it returns `'No'`.
  - Otherwise, it returns `'Yes'`.

#### Function `func_2` Analysis:
- The function `func_2` reads multiple test cases from the user input.
- For each test case, it calls `func_1` with the appropriate parameters and stores the result.
- Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

#### Function Summaries:
- The summary for `func_2` correctly describes its behavior: it reads multiple test cases and processes each one by calling `func_1` and storing the results.

#### Original Assessment:
- The original assessment stated that `func_1` has a logical flaw because it does not correctly handle all cases where the robot can or cannot reach the cell `(2, n)`.
- The provided counterexample demonstrates that `func_1` incorrectly returns `'No'` for a valid case where the robot can reach `(2, n)`.

#### Detailed Evaluation:
1. **Counterexample Analysis**:
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     4
     <>><
     ><>>
     ```
   - The robot starts at `(1, 1)` and follows the arrows:
     - From `(1, 1)` to `(1, 2)` (right arrow in `(1, 1)`).
     - From `(1, 2)` to `(1, 1)` (left arrow in `(1, 2)`).
     - From `(1, 1)` to `(1, 2)` (right arrow in `(1, 1)`).
     - From `(1, 2)` to `(1, 3)` (right arrow in `(1, 2)`).
     - From `(1, 3)` to `(1, 4)` (right arrow in `(1, 3)`).
     - From `(1, 4)` to `(2, 4)` (down arrow in `(1, 4)`).

   - The robot successfully reaches `(2, 4)`, but `func_1` incorrectly returns `'No'`.

2. **Function Behavior**:
   - The function `func_1` only checks specific conditions and does not simulate the entire path the robot can take.
   - It fails to consider the possibility of the robot moving back and forth within the grid before reaching `(2, n)`.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - To correctly determine if the robot can reach `(2, n)`, the function should simulate the robot's movement step-by-step and check if it can reach the target cell.
   - The current implementation does not simulate the full path, leading to incorrect results in some cases.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` does not correctly handle all cases where the robot can or cannot reach the cell `(2, n)`. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Final: False**
