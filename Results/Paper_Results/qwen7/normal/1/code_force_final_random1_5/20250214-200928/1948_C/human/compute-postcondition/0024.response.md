Output State: **`a` is an input string, `b` is a new input string, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `n` is an integer input from the user, and `t` is greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The other variables (`a`, `b`, `i`, and `t`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
