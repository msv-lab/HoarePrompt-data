Output State: `a` is an input string, `b` is a new input string, `i` is equal to `n-1` (since the loop increments `i` by 2 starting from 1 up to `n-1` if `n` is odd), `n` is greater than 1, and no 'No' has been printed during the loop's execution. This means that for every `i` in the loop where `i` is odd and within the bounds of `n`, the condition `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` did not hold true. Therefore, the loop completes without breaking and prints 'yes'.
