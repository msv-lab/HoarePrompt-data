Functionality: **The function `bfs` accepts two parameters, `start` and `target`, both integers representing nodes in a tree. It performs a breadth-first search to find the shortest path from the `start` node to the `target` node. If a path exists, it returns the distance (number of edges) between them; otherwise, it returns -1.**
