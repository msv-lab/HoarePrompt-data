Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `x` must be greater than 1.
   - `a` is an integer from the input.
   - `b` is an integer from the input.
   - `rev[b]` now contains the list `[a]`.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for _ in range(x - 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The loop runs `x - 1` times.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `x` must be greater than 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must still be greater than 1 (since `x - 1` will decrement `x` by 1).

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - Since the loop variable `_` is a placeholder and does not affect the state, we don't need to change it.
   - We need to ensure that `x` is still greater than 1 for the loop to execute one more time.

5. **New State:**
   - `x` must be greater than 0 (since `x - 1` means `x` was greater than 1 before, and now it is reduced by 1).
   - `a` remains an integer from the input.
   - `b` remains an integer from the input.
   - `rev[b]` remains the list `[a]`.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`x` must be greater than 0, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, `rev[b]` now contains the list `[a]`.**
