Output State: **`z` is an input integer, `tmp` is equal to `z`, `x` will be 0, `a` and `b` will no longer be defined within the loop context, `rev[b]` will contain a list of all integers `a` such that there is an edge from `a` to `b` in the graph, and `lst[a]` will contain a list of all integers `b` such that there is an edge from `a` to `b` in the graph.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `z` to a new variable `tmp`. The value of `z` remains unchanged, and `tmp` now holds the same value as `z`. The other variables (`x`, `a`, `b`, `rev[b]`, and `lst[a]`) remain in their original states as described in the initial state.
