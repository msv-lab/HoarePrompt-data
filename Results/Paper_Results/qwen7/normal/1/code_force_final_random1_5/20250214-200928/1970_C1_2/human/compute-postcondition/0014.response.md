Output State: **`x` is now greater than 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `rev[b]` is the list `[a, a, b]`, `lst[a]` is now `[b, b]`**

Explanation: The code `rev[b].append(a)` appends the value of `a` to the list `rev[b]`. Initially, `rev[b]` is `[a, a]`. After appending `a`, `rev[b]` becomes `[a, a, b]`. The values of `x`, `a`, `b`, `lst[a]` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `x` is still greater than 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `rev[b]` is now `[a, a, b]`, and `lst[a]` is still `[b, b]`.
