Output State: **`z` is an input integer, `tmp` is now the last element of `lst[z]`, `x` is 0, `one` is True, and `lst[tmp]` is not an empty list.**

Explanation: Initially, `one` is set to `False`. After executing `one = not one`, the value of `one` becomes `True`. All other variables remain unchanged.
