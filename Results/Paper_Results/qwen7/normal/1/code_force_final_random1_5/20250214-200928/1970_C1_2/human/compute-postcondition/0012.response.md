Output State: **`x` is now greater than 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `rev[b]` is the list `[a, a]`, `lst[a]` is now `[b], a` is updated to the first integer input, `b` is updated to the second integer input.**

Explanation: The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input and assigns them to variables `a` and `b`. The initial state of `a` and `b` being "an input integer" and "an input integer" respectively is updated to the actual values of the inputs. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
