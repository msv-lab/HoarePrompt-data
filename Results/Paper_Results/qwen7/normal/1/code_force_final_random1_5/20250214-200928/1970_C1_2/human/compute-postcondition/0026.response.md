Output State: **`z` is an input integer, `tmp` is now the last element of `lst[lst[tmp].pop()]`, `x` is 0, `one` is False, and `lst[tmp]` must not be an empty list.**

Explanation: The variable `one` is initially set to `True`. The line `one = not one` changes its value to `False`. All other variables (`z`, `tmp`, `x`, and `lst[tmp]`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
