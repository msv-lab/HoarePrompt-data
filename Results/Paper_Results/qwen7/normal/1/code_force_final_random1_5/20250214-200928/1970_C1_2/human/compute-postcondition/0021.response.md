Output State: **`z` is an input integer, `tmp` is now the last element of `lst[z]`, `x` is 0, `one` is False, and `lst[z]` is not an empty list.**

Explanation: The code `tmp = lst[tmp].pop()` pops the last element from the list `lst[tmp]` and assigns it to `tmp`. The other variables (`z`, `x`, `one`) remain unchanged. The list `lst[z]` is no longer the same as before because its last element has been removed.
