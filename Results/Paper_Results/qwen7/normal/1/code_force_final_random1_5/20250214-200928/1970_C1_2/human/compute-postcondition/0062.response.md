Output State: **`current` is a node that has at least one neighbor, `neighbor` is the next neighbor of `current`, `visited` now includes `neighbor`, and `queue` now contains `(neighbor, dist + 1)` if `neighbor not in visited`.**

Explanation: The line `visited.add(neighbor)` adds the `neighbor` node to the `visited` set. This means that the `neighbor` node is now marked as visited. The other variables (`current`, `neighbor`, and `queue`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
