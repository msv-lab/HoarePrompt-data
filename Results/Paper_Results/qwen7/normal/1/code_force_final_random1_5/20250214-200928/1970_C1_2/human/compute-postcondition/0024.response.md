Output State: **`z` is an input integer, `tmp` is now the last element of `lst[lst[tmp].pop()]`, `x` is 0, `one` is True, and `lst[tmp]` is now an empty list.**

Explanation: The code `tmp = lst[tmp].pop()` pops the last element from the list `lst[tmp]` and assigns it to `tmp`. After popping, the list `lst[tmp]` becomes empty. All other variables remain unchanged.
