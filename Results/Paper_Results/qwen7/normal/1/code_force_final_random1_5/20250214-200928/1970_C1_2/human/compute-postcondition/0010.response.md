Output State: **`x` is now greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `rev[b]` is the list `[a, a]`, `lst[a]` is now `[b]`**

Explanation: The code `rev[b].append(a)` appends the value of `a` to the list `rev[b]`. Since `rev[b]` was initially `[a]`, after appending `a` again, it becomes `[a, a]`. The values of `x`, `a`, `b`, `lst[a]` remain unchanged.
