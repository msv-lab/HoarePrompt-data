Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `l`.

2. **Understand the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `j` is less than `l`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is less than `l`.

3. **Determine the state changes**:
   - Since `j` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `j + 1`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `j < l`, so for the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `l`.

4. **Consider the other variables**:
   - `l` remains unchanged within the loop.
   - `ans` is a list with two elements, and its value depends on the internal logic of the loop body, which is omitted. However, since we are only adjusting the loop head variables, we do not need to change `ans` directly.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `j` will be incremented by 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must still be less than `l`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`j` is less than `l`, `l` is an input integer**
