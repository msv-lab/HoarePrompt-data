Output State: `j` is equal to `l`, `l` is an input integer, `array` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer, `rev_array` is a list of integers which is the reverse of `array`, `ans` is a list containing `l` elements where each element is the `(rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1)`-th element of `alp`.

In this final state, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `j` will be equal to `l`, meaning the loop has completed all its intended iterations. The variable `l` remains unchanged as it was an input parameter. The `array` and `rev_array` lists remain as they were initially set up from the input string. The `ans` list is filled with `l` elements, each corresponding to the count-based index in the `alp` list derived from the count of occurrences of each element in the reversed array starting from its current position.
