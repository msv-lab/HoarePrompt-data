Let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `j` is equal to `l`, where `l` is an input integer.
   - `array` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer.
   - `rev_array` is a list of integers which is the reverse of `array`.
   - `ans` is a list containing `l` elements, where each element is the \((\text{rev_array}[j:].\text{count}(\text{rev_array}[j]) - 1)\)-th element of `alp`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(''.join(map(str, ans)))
   ```

Given the above, let's analyze what will be printed:

- `j` is equal to `l`.
- `ans` is a list of length `l`, and each element in `ans` is determined by the formula \((\text{rev_array}[j:].\text{count}(\text{rev_array}[j]) - 1)\)-th element of `alp`.

To determine the exact elements in `ans`, we need to know the values of `rev_array` and `alp`. However, since these are not explicitly provided, we can only describe the general form of the output.

Each element in `ans` is derived from the count of occurrences of `rev_array[j]` in the sublist `rev_array[j:]` minus one, and then accessing the corresponding index in `alp`.

Therefore, the output will be a string formed by joining the elements of `ans` as strings.

Output: **''.join(map(str, ans)) (where each element in ans is the (\( \text{rev_array}[j:].\text{count}(\text{rev_array}[j]) - 1 \))-th element of alp)**
