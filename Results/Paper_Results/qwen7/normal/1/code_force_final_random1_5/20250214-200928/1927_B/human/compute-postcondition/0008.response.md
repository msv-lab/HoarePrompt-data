Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `j` and `l`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is 0
   - `l` is an input integer
   - `array` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer
   - `rev_array` is a list of integers which is the reverse of `array`
   - `ans` is a list containing one element which is the `(rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1)`-th element of `alp`

3. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `j < l`.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 0.
   - For the next iteration, `j` should be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 1.
   - `l` remains unchanged.
   - `array` and `rev_array` remain the same.
   - `ans` will be updated based on the new value of `j`, but since we are only asked to update the state, we don't need to explicitly state the change in `ans` here.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `j` is now 1.
   - `l` remains the same (an input integer).
   - `array` and `rev_array` remain the same.
   - `ans` will be updated based on the new value of `j`, but we don't need to state it explicitly.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`j` is 1, `l` is an input integer, `array` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer, `rev_array` is a list of integers which is the reverse of `array`, `ans` is a list containing one element which is the `(rev_array[1:].count(rev_array[1]) - 1)`-th element of `alp`.**
