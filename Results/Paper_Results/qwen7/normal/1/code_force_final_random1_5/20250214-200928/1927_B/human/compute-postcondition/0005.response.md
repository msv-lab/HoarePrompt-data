Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l` is an input integer, `array` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer, `rev_array` is a list of integers which is the reverse of `array`, `ans` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list `ans`. No changes are made to the values of `t`, `l`, `array`, or `rev_array`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
