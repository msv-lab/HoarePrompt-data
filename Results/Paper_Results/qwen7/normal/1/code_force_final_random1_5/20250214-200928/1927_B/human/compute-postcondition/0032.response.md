Output State: **`j` is `j + 1`, `l` is an input integer, `ans` remains the same, `array` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code creates a list called `array` by taking input as a string, splitting it into individual elements, and converting each element to an integer using the `map` function. The original values of `j`, `l`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
