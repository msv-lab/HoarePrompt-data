Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `j` is less than or equal to `l`.
   - `l` is an input integer.
   - `ans` is a list with `l` elements where each element is the character from `alp` list located at the index equal to the count of `rev_array[j]` in `rev_array[j:]` subtracted by 1.

2. **Loop Head:**
   - The loop is defined as `for i in range(int(input())):`.
   - This means the loop will run for the number of times specified by the input integer.

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop continues as long as `j` is less than `l`.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is less than or equal to `l`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 and still be less than `l`.

5. **New State Calculation:**
   - Since the loop increments `j` by 1, `j` will become `j + 1`.
   - We need to ensure that `j + 1` is still less than `l` for the loop to continue.

6. **Final State:**
   - `j` will be `j + 1`.
   - `l` remains the same as the input integer.
   - `ans` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`j` is less than `l`, `l` is an input integer, `ans` is a list with `l` elements where each element is the character from `alp` list located at the index equal to the count of `rev_array[j]` in `rev_array[j:]` subtracted by 1.**
