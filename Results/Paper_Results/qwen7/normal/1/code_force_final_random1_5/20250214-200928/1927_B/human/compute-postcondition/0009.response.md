Output State: **`j` is 1, `l` is an input integer, `array` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer, `rev_array` is a list of integers which is the reverse of `array`, `ans` is a list containing two elements where the first element is the `(rev_array[1:].count(rev_array[1]) - 1)`-th element of `alp` and the second element is the `(rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1)`-th element of `alp`.**

Explanation: The code appends to the `ans` list the element from `alp` at the index `(rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1)`. Since `j` is initially 1, `rev_array[j:]` is equivalent to `rev_array[1:]`. The value of `rev_array[1:].count(rev_array[1])` is the count of `rev_array[1]` in the sublist `rev_array[1:]`. This count is then used to index into `alp` to get the corresponding element. The initial `ans` list had one element, and now it has two elements due to the append operation.
