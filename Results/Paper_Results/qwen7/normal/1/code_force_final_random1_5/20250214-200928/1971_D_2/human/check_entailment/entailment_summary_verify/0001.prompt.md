You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 1
        flag = False
        j = 0
        while j < len(s) - 1:
            if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
                count += 1
                if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                    flag = True
            j += 1
        if flag:
            count -= 1
        print(count)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `t` and a binary string `s`. For each test case, it counts the number of transitions from '0' to '1' in the string `s`. If any transition from '0' to '1' is found, it subtracts one from the count. Finally, it prints the adjusted count for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `s`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - `count` is initialized to 1. This variable will keep track of the number of pieces.
   - `flag` is a boolean variable initialized to `False`. It will be used to check if there is a transition from '0' to '1'.

3. **Loop through the String:**
   - The loop iterates through the string `s` up to the second last character (`len(s) - 1`).
   - If the current character `s[j]` is different from the next character `s[j + 1]`, it increments `count` by 1.
   - If the current character is '0' and the next character is '1', it sets `flag` to `True`.

4. **Adjustment Based on Flag:**
   - After the loop, if `flag` is `True`, it decrements `count` by 1. This adjustment is intended to handle the case where there is a transition from '0' to '1'.

5. **Output:**
   - Finally, it prints the value of `count`.

### Reasoning:

- **Correctness of Count Increment:**
  - The logic of incrementing `count` when a character change is detected is generally correct. Each change indicates a potential boundary for a piece.
  
- **Handling Transition from '0' to '1':**
  - The decrement of `count` by 1 when a transition from '0' to '1' is found is intended to avoid counting the piece containing both '0' and '1'. However, this approach is flawed because:
    - It assumes that every '0' followed by a '1' should be split into separate pieces, which is not always necessary.
    - It does not correctly handle cases where multiple transitions exist without a '0' in between.

### Example Analysis:

- **Example 1: "11010"**
  - Expected output: 3
  - Actual output: 3 (Correct)
  - Explanation: The string can be split into "11", "0", "10".

- **Example 2: "00000000"**
  - Expected output: 1
  - Actual output: 1 (Correct)
  - Explanation: The string is already sorted.

- **Example 3: "1"**
  - Expected output: 1
  - Actual output: 1 (Correct)
  - Explanation: The string is already sorted.

- **Example 4: "10"**
  - Expected output: 2
  - Actual output: 2 (Correct)
  - Explanation: The string can be split into "1" and "0".

- **Example 5: "0001111"**
  - Expected output: 1
  - Actual output: 1 (Correct)
  - Explanation: The string is already sorted.

- **Example 6: "0110"**
  - Expected output: 2
  - Actual output: 2 (Correct)
  - Explanation: The string can be split into "01" and "10".

### Conclusion:

While the program seems to work correctly for the given examples, the logic for handling the transition from '0' to '1' is flawed. The program does not correctly account for all possible cases, especially when there are multiple transitions without a '0' in between.

Therefore, the program is not fully correct.

Correctness: **False**
