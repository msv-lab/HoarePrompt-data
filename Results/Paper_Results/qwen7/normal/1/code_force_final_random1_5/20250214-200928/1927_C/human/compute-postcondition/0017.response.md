Postcondition: **`aOnes` is 1 if the number of ones in `a` is less than the number of ones in `b`; otherwise, `aOnes` is 0. `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` and `b` are lists of integers obtained by converting the input string into integers split by spaces, `bOnes` is 1 if the else part was executed, and `i` is 1.**
