Postcondition: `aOnes` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the input string into integers split by spaces, `b` is a list of integers obtained by converting the input string into integers split by spaces, `bOnes` is 0, `i` is 1, and either `i` is not in `a` or `i` is not in `b` or `aOnes` is greater than `newk`.
