Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `k + 1`
- `aOnes` is either 0 or 1
- `bOnes` is the number of elements in list `b` that are not in list `a` but do not exceed `newk` in count
- `t` is `t + n`
- `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the input string into integers split by spaces
- `i` is `k + 1`
- The condition `aOnes == newk and bOnes == newk` is satisfied

The `print('yes')` statement will simply print the string 'yes'.

Output: **yes**
