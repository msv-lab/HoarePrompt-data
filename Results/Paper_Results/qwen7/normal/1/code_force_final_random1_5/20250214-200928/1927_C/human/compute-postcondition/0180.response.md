Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `aOnes` is either 1 or 2 depending on the presence of `i` in `a` and its count, `bOnes` is either 0, 1, or 2 depending on the presence of `i` in `b` and its count. If `i` is in both `a` and `b`, and `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `aOnes` is incremented by 1. If `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `bOnes` is set to 1.**
