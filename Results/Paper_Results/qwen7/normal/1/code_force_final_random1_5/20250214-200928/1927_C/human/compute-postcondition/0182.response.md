The variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust these two variables. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `i <= k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3.

For the loop to execute one more time, the following conditions must be met:
1. `i` must be less than or equal to `k`.

Since `i` is currently 3, `i` must remain 3 or decrease (but not increase) for the loop to continue. However, the exact value of `k` is not specified, so we cannot determine its exact value. We only know that `i` must still satisfy the condition `i <= k`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `i` remains 3 and `k` is greater than or equal to 3.

State: **`i` is 3, `k` must be greater than or equal to 3**
