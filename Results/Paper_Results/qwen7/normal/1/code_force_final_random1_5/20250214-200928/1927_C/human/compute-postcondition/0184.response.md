Output State: **`i` is 3, `k` must be greater than or equal to 3; `bOnes` is 1**

The variable `bOnes` is incremented by 1, starting from an unspecified initial value (but since no initial value is given and the only affected variable is `bOnes`, we assume it was 0 before this line). Given the initial state, `i` remains 3 and `k` must still be greater than or equal to 3.
