Postcondition: **`i` is `k + 1`, `aOnes` is either 0 or 1, `bOnes` is equal to the number of elements in list `b` that are not in list `a` but do not exceed `newk` in count, `t` is `t + n`, `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the input string into integers split by spaces, `i` is `k + 1`. Additionally, the condition `aOnes == newk and bOnes == newk` is satisfied.**
