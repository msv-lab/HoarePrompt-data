Postcondition: `aOnes` is either 0 or 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the input string into integers split by spaces, `i` is 1, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `k` must be at least 2, `bOnes` is either 0 or 1, `newk` is `k // 2`. If `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `aOnes` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not in `a` or `i` is not in `b`, and `aOnes` is greater than `newk` or `i` is not in `a`, then `aOnes` remains 0. If `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `bOnes` is incremented by 1.
