Output State: **`aOnes` is equal to the number of elements in list `a` that are also in list `b` and do not exceed `newk` in count; `bOnes` is equal to the number of elements in list `b` that are not in list `a` but do not exceed `newk` in count; `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and `t` is updated to `t + 1`; `a` and `b` are lists of integers obtained by converting the input string into integers split by spaces; `i` is equal to `k + 1`; `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values of `int(input().split())`.**

This means that the variables `aOnes`, `bOnes`, `t`, `a`, `b`, and `i` retain their previous conditions, while `n`, `m`, and `k` are now assigned the first three integers from the input string converted to integers.
