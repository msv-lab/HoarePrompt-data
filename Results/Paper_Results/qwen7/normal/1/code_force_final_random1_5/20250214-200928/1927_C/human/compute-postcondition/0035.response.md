Output State: **`aOnes` is 1 if `i` is in both `a` and `b` and the number of ones in `a` is less than or equal to `newk`; otherwise, `aOnes` is 0; `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `a` and `b` are lists of integers obtained by converting the input string into integers split by spaces; `bOnes` is 0 or 1; `i` is increased by 1.**

The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the conditions for `aOnes` and `bOnes` remain unchanged. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `bOnes` stay the same as the initial state.
