Output State: **`aOnes` is 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the input string into integers split by spaces, `i` remains `k + 1`, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `k` is the third integer input, `bOnes` is 0; `newk` is `k // 2`.**

Explanation: The variable `newk` is assigned the value of `k` divided by 2 using integer division (`//`). The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
