Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for t in range(int(input())):`.
   - The variables involved in this loop head are `t` and the result of `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `t`:**
   - It is given that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

3. **Determine the Input for `int(input())`:**
   - The input for `int(input())` will determine the number of iterations of the loop.
   - Since `t` is already defined as a positive integer within the specified range, the input value for `int(input())` should be a positive integer within the same range.

4. **Adjust the State:**
   - The variable `t` is already defined and within the required range.
   - We need to ensure that the input value for `int(input())` is a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input value for `int(input())`, ensuring it falls within the specified range.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, the input value for `int(input())` must be a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
