Output State: **`aOnes` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the input string into integers split by spaces, `b` is a list of integers obtained by converting the input string into integers split by spaces, `bOnes` is 0, `newk` is `k // 2`**.

This means that the variable `newk` is assigned the value of `k` divided by 2 using integer division (//). All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
