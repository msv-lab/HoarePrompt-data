Output State: **`i` is 3, `k` must be greater than or equal to 3; `bOnes` is 1**

Explanation: The variable `bOnes` is incremented by 1, starting from an unspecified initial value (which is not provided). Since `i` is initially 3 and does not change, and `k` must be greater than or equal to 3 and does not change, the only new information is that `bOnes` has been incremented by 1. Therefore, `bOnes` is now 1.
