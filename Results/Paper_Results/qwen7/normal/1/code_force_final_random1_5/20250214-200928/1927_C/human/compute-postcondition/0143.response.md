Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `i <= k`.
2. **Determine the current values of the loop variables**:
   - `i` is currently 1.
   - `k` is currently `k // 2`.

For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `i <= k` must be true.

3. **Check the current values**:
   - Since `i` is 1, we need to check if `1 <= k // 2` is true.
   - For this to be true, `k // 2` must be at least 1.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - We need to ensure that `k // 2` is at least 1. This means `k` itself must be at least 2.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `k` must be at least 2.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`aOnes` is 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the input string into integers split by spaces, `i` is 1, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `k` must be at least 2, `bOnes` is 0, `newk` is `k // 2`**
