Output State: **`aOnes` is either 0 or 1, `bOnes` is equal to the number of elements in list `b` that are not in list `a` but do not exceed `newk` in count, `t` is `t + 1`, `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the input string into integers split by spaces, `i` is `k`, `bOnes` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `bOnes += 1` increments the value of `bOnes` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
