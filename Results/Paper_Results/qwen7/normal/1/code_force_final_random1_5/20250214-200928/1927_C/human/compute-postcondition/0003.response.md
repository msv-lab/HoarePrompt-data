Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the input string into integers split by spaces, `b` is a list of integers obtained by converting the input string into integers split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `b = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings using spaces, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to `b`. The values of `t` and `a` remain unchanged.
