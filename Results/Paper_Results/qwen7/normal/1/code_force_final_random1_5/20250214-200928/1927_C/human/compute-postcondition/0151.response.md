Postcondition: **`aOnes` is either 0 or 1, depending on whether `aOnes` is less than `bOnes` or not. `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the input string into integers split by spaces. `i` is an integer present in both `a` and `b`. `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `k` is at least 2, `bOnes` is either 0 or 1, `newk` is `k // 2`.**
