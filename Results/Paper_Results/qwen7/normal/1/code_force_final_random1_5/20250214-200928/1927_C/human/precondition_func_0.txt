t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^5, and k is an even integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 2⋅min(n, m). a is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^6], and b is a list of m integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^6]. The sum of n and m over all test cases in a test does not exceed 4⋅10^5.
