Output State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `i` will be the first integer greater than `k`, `aOnes` will be the total count of elements in `a` that are also in the range from 1 to `k` (inclusive) and satisfy the conditions within the loop, `bOnes` will be the total count of elements in `b` that are also in the range from 1 to `k` (inclusive) and satisfy the conditions within the loop. `n` will be the last `n` value inputted, `m` will be the last `m` value inputted, and `k` will be the last `k` value set before the loop exited. If `aOnes` equals `newk` and `bOnes` equals `newk`, the loop would have printed 'yes' for that test case. Otherwise, it would have printed 'no'.
