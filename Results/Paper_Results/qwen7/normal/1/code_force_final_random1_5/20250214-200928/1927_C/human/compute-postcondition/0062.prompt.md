Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `aOnes` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the input string into integers split by spaces, `b` is a list of integers obtained by converting the input string into integers split by spaces, `bOnes` is 0, `i` is 1.
Code of the loop:
while i <= k:
    if i in a and i in b:
        if aOnes < bOnes:
            aOnes += 1
        else:
            bOnes += 1
    elif i in a and aOnes <= newk:
        aOnes += 1
    elif i in b and bOnes <= newk:
        bOnes += 1
    else:
        break
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `aOnes` is 1 if `i` is in both `a` and `b` and the number of ones in `a` is less than or equal to `newk`; otherwise, `aOnes` is 0; `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `a` and `b` are lists of integers obtained by converting the input string into integers split by spaces; `bOnes` is 0 or 1; `i` is increased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `aOnes` is 2 if `i` is in both `a` and `b` and the number of ones in `a` is less than or equal to `newk`; otherwise, `aOnes` is 1. `bOnes` is 0 or 1. `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). `a` and `b` are lists of integers obtained by converting the input string into integers split by spaces. `i` is increased by 1 and must be such that `i <= k`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `aOnes` is 3 if `i` is in both `a` and `newk` is greater than or equal to the number of ones in `a`; otherwise, `aOnes` is 2; `bOnes` is 1 if `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`; otherwise, `bOnes` is 0 or 1; `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `a` and `b` are lists of integers obtained by converting the input string into integers split by spaces; `i` is increased by 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
