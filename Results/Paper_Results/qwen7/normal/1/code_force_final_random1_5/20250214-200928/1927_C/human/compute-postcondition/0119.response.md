Postcondition: **`aOnes` is either 0 or 1, `bOnes` is equal to the number of elements in list `b` that are not in list `a` but do not exceed `newk` in count, `t` is `t + 1`, `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the input string into integers split by spaces, `i` is `k`, and if `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, then `bOnes` remains unchanged; otherwise, `bOnes` is increased by 1.**
