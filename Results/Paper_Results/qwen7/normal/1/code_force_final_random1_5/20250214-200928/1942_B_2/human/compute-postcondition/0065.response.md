Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given `for` loop are `i`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates from `len(ar) - 1` to `0` with a step of `-1`. This means `i` starts at `-len(ar)` and increments by `1` until it reaches `0`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `-len(ar)`
   - `mex` is `mex - ar[i]`
   - `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]`
   - If `mex` is greater than `mex - ar[i]`, then `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[i] - ar[i]` and `res[i]` is updated to `mex - ar[i] - ar[i]`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by `1`, the new value of `i` will be `-len(ar) + 1`.
   - The conditions for updating `mex` and `res[i]` depend on the current values of `mex` and `ar[i]`. However, these updates are not directly affecting the loop continuation condition.

5. **State adjustment**:
   - The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we need to update its value.
   - The other variables (`mex` and `res[i]`) are not directly affected by the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted here.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is `-len(ar) + 1`, `mex` is `mex - ar[i]`, and `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]`**.
