Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `i` is `-len(ar)`
- `mex` is `mex - ar[i]`
- `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]`

### Loop Head:
```
for i in range(len(ar) - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `len(ar) - 1` to `0` (inclusive) in reverse order.
2. **Variable `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `-len(ar)`. This means the loop has already completed its iterations starting from `len(ar) - 1` down to `0`.

### Next Iteration:
Since the loop has already completed all its iterations, there is no next iteration to consider. Therefore, no changes are needed to the states of the variables involved in the loop head.

### Conclusion:
No adjustments are necessary because the loop has already finished its execution.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is `-len(ar)`, `mex` is `mex - ar[i]`, and `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]`**
