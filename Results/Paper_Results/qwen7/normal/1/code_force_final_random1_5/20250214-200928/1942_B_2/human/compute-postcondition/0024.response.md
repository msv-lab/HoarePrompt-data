Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State Analysis
- The loop runs based on the input value, which is an integer.
- After all iterations of the loop, the following conditions hold:
  - `i` will be `-1`.
  - `mex` will be reduced by the sum of all elements in `ar`.
  - Each element in `res` will be set to `mex - ar[i]` for the last valid `i` value.

### Loop Head Variables
- The loop head variables are `_` (which is just a placeholder for the loop index) and the input value, which is an integer.

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Determine the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as the input value is positive.
2. **Effect of One Iteration**:
   - The input value decreases by 1 after each iteration.
   - The loop terminates when the input value becomes 0 or negative.
3. **Final State Before Termination**:
   - When the loop ends, `i` will be `-1` (since the loop runs from 0 to `input_value - 1`).
   - `mex` will be reduced by the sum of all elements in `ar`.
   - Each element in `res` will be set to `mex - ar[i]` for the last valid `i` value, which is `input_value - 1`.

### Adjusting States for the Next Iteration
Since the loop is driven by the input value, and the input value is consumed in each iteration, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the input value itself.

### Final Answer
State: **`i` is 0, `mex` is reduced by the sum of all elements in `ar`, each element in `res` is set to `mex - ar[0]`**.

However, since the exact values of `mex` and `res` depend on the loop body, we can only specify the initial conditions for the loop head variables:

State: **`i` is 0, `mex` is reduced by the sum of all elements in `ar`, each element in `res` is set to `mex - ar[0]`**.
