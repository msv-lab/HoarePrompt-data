Output State: **`i` is `-len(ar)`, `mex` is `mex - ar[i] - ar[i]`, and `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i] - ar[i]`**

Explanation: The code `mex = mex - ar[i]` updates the value of `mex` by subtracting `ar[i]` from it. Since `i` is `-len(ar)`, `ar[i]` is the last element of the list `ar`. The value of `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[i]`, and similarly, `res[i]` is also updated to `mex - ar[i]` because it was previously `mex - ar[i]`. Therefore, both `mex` and `res[i]` are updated by subtracting `ar[i]` again.
