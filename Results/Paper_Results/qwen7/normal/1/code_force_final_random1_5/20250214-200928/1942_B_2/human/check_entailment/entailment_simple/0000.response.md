### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to reconstruct a permutation \( p \) from the given array \( a \). The value of \( a_i \) is defined as the MEX (Minimum EXcluded) value of the subarray \( p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i \) minus \( p_i \).

2. **Reconstructing the Permutation**:
   - The provided solution iterates through the array \( a \) in reverse order.
   - For each position \( i \), it calculates \( p_i \) as \( \text{mex} - a_i \).
   - It updates the MEX value based on whether the calculated \( p_i \) is less than the current MEX value.

3. **Detailed Analysis of the Code**:
   - The code correctly initializes the MEX value to \( n \) (the length of the array).
   - It iterates from the end of the array to the beginning.
   - For each position \( i \), it sets \( p_i \) to \( \text{mex} - a_i \).
   - It updates the MEX value if the calculated \( p_i \) is less than the current MEX value.

4. **Edge Cases and Validity**:
   - The code handles the edge case where \( p_i \) might be equal to the current MEX value by ensuring the MEX value is updated only if the condition \( \text{mex} > \text{mex} - a_i \) holds true.
   - This ensures that the MEX value remains consistent with the definition of MEX.

5. **Output**:
   - The final permutation \( p \) is constructed and printed correctly.

Given the above analysis, the provided code logic aligns with the problem statement and correctly reconstructs the permutation \( p \) from the array \( a \).
