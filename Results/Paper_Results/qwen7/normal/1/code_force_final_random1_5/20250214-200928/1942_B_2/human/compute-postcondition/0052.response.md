Output State: **`i` is -len(ar), `mex` is n, `res` is a list of length n where each element is None, and `ar` is a list of integers inputted by the user.**

Explanation: The code simply reassigns the variable `mex` to the value of `n`. The values of `i`, `res`, and `ar` remain unchanged from their initial states.
