Output State: **`i` is `i - 1` and must be greater than or equal to `0`; `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `mex - ar[i]` to `res[i]`. Here, `i` is already defined as `i - 1` and must be greater than or equal to `0`. The values of `mex` and `ar` are not provided, so they remain unchanged. The only new information is that `res[i]` now holds the value of `mex - ar[i]`.
