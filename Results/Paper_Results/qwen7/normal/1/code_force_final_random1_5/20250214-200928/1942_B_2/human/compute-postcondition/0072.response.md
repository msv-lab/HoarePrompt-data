Let's break down the problem step by step based on the initial state provided:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `i` is `-1`.
   - `mex` is defined as `mex - len(ar) * ar[-1] + sum(ar)`.
   - `res[i+1:]` is defined as `[mex - ar[i] for i in range(-1, -len(ar)-1, -1)]`.

2. **Understanding `mex`:**
   - `mex` is initially set to a value that is dynamically computed based on the formula `mex - len(ar) * ar[-1] + sum(ar)`.
   - Since `i` is `-1`, the formula simplifies to `mex - len(ar) * ar[-1] + sum(ar)`.

3. **Understanding `res`:**
   - `res[i+1:]` means the slice of `res` starting from index `-1` (inclusive) to the end of the list.
   - The elements of `res` are defined as `[mex - ar[i] for i in range(-1, -len(ar)-1, -1)]`.
   - Given `i` is `-1`, the range `range(-1, -len(ar)-1, -1)` will only generate one value, which is `-1`.

4. **Simplifying `res`:**
   - Since `i` is `-1`, the list comprehension `[mex - ar[i] for i in range(-1, -len(ar)-1, -1)]` will evaluate to `[mex - ar[-1]]`.
   - Therefore, `res` will be a list with a single element: `mex - ar[-1]`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The `print` statement will join the elements of `res` into a space-separated string and print it.
   - Since `res` contains a single element `mex - ar[-1]`, the output will be a string representation of this value.

Given the above steps, the final output will be:

Output: **mex - ar[-1]**
