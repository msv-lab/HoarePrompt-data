Output State: **`i` is -1, `mex` is `mex - ar[i]`, `res` is a list where the element at index -2 is `mex - ar[-2]`, and the element at index -1 of `res` is `mex - ar[-1]`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `mex` by subtracting `ar[i]` from `mex`. Given that `i` is -1, the updated value of `mex` becomes `mex - ar[-1]`. The other variables and their relationships remain unchanged.
