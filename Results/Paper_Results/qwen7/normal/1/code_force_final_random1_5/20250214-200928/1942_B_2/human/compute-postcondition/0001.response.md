Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `n`. Since the initial value of `t` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^4, and no operation affects `t`, `t` remains unchanged. The value of `n` is set to the integer input provided by the user.
