Output State: **`i` is -1, `mex` is `mex - ar[-2]`, `res` is a list where the element at index -2 is `mex - ar[-2]`, and the element at index -1 of `res` is `mex - ar[-1]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `res` at index `i` (which is -1) to be `mex - ar[i]` (which is `mex - ar[-1]`). The other variables and their relationships remain unchanged.
