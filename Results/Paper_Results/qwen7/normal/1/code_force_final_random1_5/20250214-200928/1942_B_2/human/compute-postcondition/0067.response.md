Output State: **`i` is `-len(ar) + 1`, `mex` is `mex - 2*mex + ar[i]`, and `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]`**

Explanation: The code `mex = mex - ar[i]` updates the value of `mex` by subtracting `ar[i]` from it. Given that `i` is `-len(ar) + 1`, the value of `ar[i]` is `ar[-len(ar) + 1]`. Therefore, `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[-len(ar) + 1]`. Since `res[i]` was previously `mex - ar[i]`, it now becomes `mex - ar[-len(ar) + 1]`. The value of `i` remains unchanged.
