Output State: **`i` is `i - 1` and must be greater than or equal to `0`; `mex` is `mex - ar[i]`.**

Explanation: The code subtracts `ar[i]` from `mex`. Since `i` was previously defined as `i - 1` and must be greater than or equal to `0`, and `res[i]` was defined as `mex - ar[i]`, the value of `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[i]`. The conditions and values of other variables remain unchanged.
