Output State: **`i` is `-len(ar)`, `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]`, `len(ar)` is a constant value derived from the list `ar`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `mex - ar[i]` to `res[i]`. Here, `i` is initially `-len(ar)`, which means `i` is an index in the list `res`. The value of `mex` (minimum excluded number) is calculated based on the list `ar`, but since `mex` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot specify its exact value. However, we know that `res[i]` is now equal to `mex - ar[i]`. The length of the list `ar` remains unchanged, and the value of `i` also remains `-len(ar)`.
