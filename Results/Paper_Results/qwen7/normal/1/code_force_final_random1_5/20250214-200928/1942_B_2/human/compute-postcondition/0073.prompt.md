Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and the array a is a list of n integers where -n ≤ a_i ≤ n.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
    res = [None] * n
    mex = n
    for i in range(len(ar) - 1, -1, -1):
        res[i] = mex - ar[i]
        if mex > mex - ar[i]:
            mex = mex - ar[i]
    print(' '.join(str(x) for x in res))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be `-1`, `mex` will be reduced by the sum of all elements in `ar`, and each element in `res` will be set to `mex - ar[i]` for the last valid `i` value.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be -len(ar), `mex` will be the minimum value of `mex - ar[i]` for all `i` in the range of `len(ar)`, and `res` will be a list of length `n` where each element is `mex - ar[i]` for the corresponding index `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `i` is `-1`, `mex` is `mex - len(ar)*ar[-1] + sum(ar)`, and `res[i+1:]` is `[mex - ar[i] for i in range(-1, -len(ar)-1, -1)]`.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be `-1` because the loop starts from `-len(ar)` and decrements `i` until it reaches `-1`. The value of `mex` will be updated in each iteration based on the condition `if mex > mex - ar[i]: mex = mex - ar[i]`. This results in `mex` being adjusted by subtracting twice the current `mex` and adding the current `ar[i]` for each iteration. The `res` list will be filled starting from index `-1` up to the original length of `ar`, with each element set to `mex - ar[i]` for the corresponding `i` value.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
