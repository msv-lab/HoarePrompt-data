Output State: **`i` is `-len(ar)`, `mex` is `mex - ar[i]`, and `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]`**

Explanation: The code `res[i] = mex - ar[i]` updates the value of `res[i]` to be `mex - ar[i]`. Since `i` is `-len(ar)` and `mex` is `mex - ar[i]`, these values remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
