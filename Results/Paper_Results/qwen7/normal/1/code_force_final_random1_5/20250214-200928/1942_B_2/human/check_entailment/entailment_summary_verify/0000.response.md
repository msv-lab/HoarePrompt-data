Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down why the original program is incorrect and how the corrected program addresses the issue.

### Original Program Analysis:
The original program attempts to calculate the MEX value in reverse order, which is incorrect. Specifically, the logic for calculating the MEX value and constructing the permutation is flawed. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why it fails:

1. **Reverse Order Calculation**: The original program iterates from the end of the array to the beginning, which means it tries to calculate the MEX for the suffix rather than the prefix.
2. **Incorrect MEX Calculation**: The MEX calculation should be done for the prefix up to index \(i\), but the program incorrectly calculates it for the suffix starting from index \(i\).
3. **Result Construction**: The result list `res` is filled in reverse order, leading to incorrect values when printed.

### Corrected Program Analysis:
The corrected program follows these steps:

1. **Initialize an Empty Result List**: `res` is initialized as an empty list.
2. **Iterate Through Indices**: For each index `i` in the array `ar`, the program calculates the MEX for the prefix up to `i`.
3. **Ensure Unique Values**: While iterating, the program ensures that the MEX value is unique and not already present in the result list.
4. **Construct Permutation**: The MEX value is adjusted according to the formula \( \texttt{MEX} - a[i] \) and appended to the result list.

Here is the corrected program again for clarity:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = []
        mex = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            while mex in res:
                mex += 1
            res.append(mex - ar[i])
        
        print(' '.join(str(x) for x in res))

func()
```

### Verification Using Function Summaries:
- **Function Summary**: The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then computes a new list `res` of length `n` where each element is calculated as `mex - a[i]`, with `mex` being the smallest non-negative integer not present in the list `a`. Finally, it prints the elements of `res` separated by spaces.

The corrected program correctly follows this summary:
- It initializes an empty list `res`.
- It iterates through the indices of the array `ar` and calculates the MEX for the prefix up to each index.
- It ensures that the MEX value is unique and not already present in the result list.
- It constructs the permutation correctly by adjusting the MEX value according to the formula \( \texttt{MEX} - a[i] \).

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The original program is incorrect due to its flawed MEX calculation and reverse order construction. The corrected program addresses these issues and produces the correct permutation.

Final: **True**
