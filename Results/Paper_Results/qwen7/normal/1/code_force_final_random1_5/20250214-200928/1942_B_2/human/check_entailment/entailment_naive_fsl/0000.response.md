Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate a permutation \( p \) based on the given array \( a \). Specifically, the logic for calculating the MEX value and constructing the permutation is flawed. 

Let's consider a specific example to illustrate this:

### Example:
- **Input:**
  ```
  3
  5
  1 1 -2 1 2
  ```

- **Expected Output:**
  ```
  0 1 4 2 3
  ```

- **Actual Output:**
  The program attempts to calculate the MEX value in reverse order, which is incorrect. Instead of calculating the MEX for the prefix up to index \( i \), it calculates the MEX for the suffix starting from index \( i \).

To correctly solve this problem, we need to construct the permutation \( p \) such that for each \( i \), \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \). Hereâ€™s a corrected approach:

1. Initialize an empty result list `res`.
2. Iterate through the indices of the array `ar` and for each index `i`, compute the MEX for the prefix up to `i` and adjust it according to the formula.
3. Ensure that each integer from 0 to \( n-1 \) appears exactly once in the permutation.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = []
        mex = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            while mex in res:
                mex += 1
            res.append(mex - ar[i])
        
        print(' '.join(str(x) for x in res))

func()
```

This corrected program ensures that the MEX is correctly computed for the prefix up to each index and constructs the permutation accordingly.
