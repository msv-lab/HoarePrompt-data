Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `res` is a list of `n` None values.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `res` with `n` elements, all set to `None`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `ar` remain unchanged from their initial state.
