Output State: `j` is `m-2`, `m` is greater than 1, and `impossible` is False if either `gr[0][m-2]` is not equal to `gr[0][m-1]` or `gr[n-1][m-2]` is not equal to `gr[n-1][m-1]`. Otherwise, `impossible` remains unchanged.

This means after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `j` will take the value of `m-2` (since the loop runs from `0` to `m-2`, as it increments `j` within each iteration). The variable `impossible` will be set to `False` if there is any pair of consecutive elements in the first or last row of `gr` that are not equal, otherwise, it will remain `True` (or whatever value it was initialized to, but in this context, we assume it starts as `True` and only changes to `False`).
