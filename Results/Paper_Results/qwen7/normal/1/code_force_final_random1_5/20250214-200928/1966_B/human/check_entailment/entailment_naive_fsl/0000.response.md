Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it checks only two conditions to determine if it's possible to make all squares the same color, but it fails to consider other configurations that might allow the grid to be uniform.

For example, consider the following grid:
```
B W B
W B W
B W B
```

In this case, the program would incorrectly output "YES" because it only checks the corners and adjacent rows/columns. However, it's actually possible to make all squares the same color by selecting the top-left and bottom-right corners, which would change the entire grid to either 'B' or 'W'.

The program needs to check if there is any inconsistency across the entire grid to ensure that it can be made uniform. A more comprehensive approach would involve checking if there exists a consistent color across any row or column, or if there are any isolated sections that cannot be unified through the allowed operations.
