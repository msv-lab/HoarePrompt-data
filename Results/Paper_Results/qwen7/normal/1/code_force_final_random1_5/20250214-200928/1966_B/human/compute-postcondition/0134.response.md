Output State: **`impossible` remains `False`, `ans` remains `'NO'`, `i` remains `n + n`, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements, each being an input from the user, `j` is `m - 2`, `m` must be greater than 2.**

Explanation: The line `impossible = False` simply assigns the value `False` to the variable `impossible`. No other changes are made to the other variables or their states. Therefore, the values of `ans`, `i`, `gr`, `j`, and `m` remain unchanged from their initial states.
