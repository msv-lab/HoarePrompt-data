Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for j in range(m - 1):`. The variables involved here are `j` and `m`.

2. **Initial State of Variables**:
   - `i` is `n + n`
   - `n` must be at least 2
   - `gr` is a list containing `n` elements, each being an input from the user
   - `ans` is 'NO'
   - `impossible` is `True`
   - `j` is `m - 2`

3. **Determine the Adjustments Needed**:
   - The loop will start with `j` set to `m - 2` and will continue as long as `j` is less than `m - 1`.
   - For the loop to execute, `j` must be less than `m - 1` at the start of the loop.

4. **Adjust the State**:
   - Since `j` is initially set to `m - 2`, for the loop to execute, `m` must be greater than 2 (because `j < m - 1`).

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `m` to ensure that the loop can execute.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is `n + n`, `n` must be at least 2, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements, each being an input from the user, `ans` is 'NO', `impossible` is `True`, `j` is `m - 2`, `m` must be greater than 2**
