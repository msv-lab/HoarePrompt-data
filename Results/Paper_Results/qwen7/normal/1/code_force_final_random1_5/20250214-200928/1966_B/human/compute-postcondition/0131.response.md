Output State: **`impossible` is `False`, `ans` is 'NO', `i` is `n + n`, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements, each being an input from the user, `j` is `m - 1`, `m` must be greater than 2**

Explanation: The code simply reassigns the variable `impossible` to `False`, which was already its value in the initial state. All other variables remain unchanged.
