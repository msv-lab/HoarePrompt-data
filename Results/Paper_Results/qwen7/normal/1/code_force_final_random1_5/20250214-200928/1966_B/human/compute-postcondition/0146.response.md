Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < n - 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `impossible` is `False`
   - `ans` remains `'NO'`
   - `i` remains `2n`
   - `gr` is a list containing `n` elements, each being an input from the user
   - `j` is `m - 2`
   - `m` must be greater than 2
   - The conditions `(gr[0][j] != gr[0][j + 1]) or (gr[n - 1][j] != gr[n - 1][j + 1])` and `(gr[i][0] != gr[i + 1][0] or gr[i][m - 1] != gr[i + 1][m - 1])` remain satisfied.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop runs as long as `i < n - 1`, and currently `i` is `2n`, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will become `2n + 1`.
   - All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `impossible` remains `False`
   - `ans` remains `'NO'`
   - `i` becomes `2n + 1`
   - `gr` remains the same list of `n` elements
   - `j` remains `m - 2`
   - `m` remains greater than 2
   - The conditions remain satisfied.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`impossible` is `False`, `ans` remains `'NO'`, `i` is `2n + 1`, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements, each being an input from the user, `j` is `m - 2`, `m` must be greater than 2, and the conditions `(gr[0][j] != gr[0][j + 1]) or (gr[n - 1][j] != gr[n - 1][j + 1])` and `(gr[i][0] != gr[i + 1][0] or gr[i][m - 1] != gr[i + 1][m - 1])` remain satisfied**.
