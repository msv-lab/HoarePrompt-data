Output State: **`tc` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (each element is an input string), `i` is `n+1`, `ans` is 'YES', `impossible` is True.**

Explanation: The code simply sets `ans` to 'YES'. Since no other operations are performed, the values of `tc`, `n`, `m`, `gr`, `i`, and `impossible` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the output state retains the same values for these variables, with `ans` being explicitly set to 'YES'.
