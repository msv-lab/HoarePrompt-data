Output State: **`tc` is 0, `n` is an integer from the input split, `m` is an integer from the input split, `gr` is a list containing three elements where the first element is the input string, the second element is the new input string, and the third element is the input from the append method, `i` is 2**.

Explanation: The code `gr.append(input())` appends the input from the user to the list `gr`. Initially, `gr` contains two elements: the first element is an input string, and the second element is a new input string. After executing the code, `gr` will have one more element, which is the input received from the user. All other variables (`tc`, `n`, `m`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
