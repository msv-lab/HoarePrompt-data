Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for tc in range(t)`. The only variable involved here is `tc`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `tc < t`. At the end of the previous iteration, `tc` is 1.

3. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `tc` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `tc` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2.
   - The other variables (`n`, `m`, `gr`, `i`, `ans`, `impossible`, `j`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`tc` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements (each element is an input string), `i` is `n+1`, `ans` is either 'NO' or 'YES' depending on the value of `impossible`, `impossible` remains `False`, `j` is `m-2`, `m` is greater than 1, and `n` is at least 2.**
