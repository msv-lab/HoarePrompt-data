Output State: **`tc` is 0, `n` is an integer from the input split, `m` is an integer from the input split**.

Explanation: The code splits the input into two integers and assigns them to `n` and `m`. The variable `t` was an integer between 1 and \(10^4\) and `tc` was 0. After executing the code, `t` and `tc` retain their initial conditions, while `n` and `m` are assigned the first and second integers from the input respectively.
