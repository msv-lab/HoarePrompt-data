Output State: **`impossible` is `True`, `j` is `m-2`, `m` is greater than 1.**

Explanation: The code sets `impossible` to `True`. The values of `j` and `m` remain unchanged from their initial state, and the condition for `impossible` being `True` or `False` based on the equality of certain elements in the matrix `gr` does not affect the current value of `impossible` since it is explicitly set to `True`.
