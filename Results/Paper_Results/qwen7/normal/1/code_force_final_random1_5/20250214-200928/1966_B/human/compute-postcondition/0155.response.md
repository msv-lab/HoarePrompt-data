Output State: **`impossible` is `True`, `ans` is `'NO'`, `i` is `n - 1`, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements, each being an input from the user, `j` is `m - 2`, `m` must be greater than 2, and the conditions `(gr[0][j] != gr[0][j + 1]) or (gr[n - 1][j] != gr[n - 1][j + 1])` and `(gr[i][0] != gr[i + 1][0] or gr[i][m - 1] != gr[i + 1][m - 1])` remain satisfied.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the string `'NO'` to the variable `ans`. No other changes are made to the other variables or their conditions. Therefore, the values of `impossible`, `i`, `gr`, `j`, `m`, and the specified conditions remain unchanged.
