Postcondition: ***`impossible` remains `False`, `ans` remains `'NO'`, `i` remains `n + n`, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements, each being an input from the user, `j` is `m - 2`, `m` must be greater than 2, and the condition `(gr[0][j] != gr[0][j + 1]) or (gr[n - 1][j] != gr[n - 1][j + 1])` is satisfied.***

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block. Since the if condition is the only part that has a specified postcondition, and the else part does not change the postcondition, the overall postcondition remains as the postcondition of the if part.
