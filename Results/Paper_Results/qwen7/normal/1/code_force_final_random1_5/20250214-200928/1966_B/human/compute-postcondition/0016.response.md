Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `j` and the value `m - 1`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `j`**: The initial value of `j` is 0 because the `range(m - 1)` function generates values from 0 to `m - 2`.

3. **Determine the Condition for the Loop to Execute**: The loop will execute as long as `j < m - 1`. Therefore, the loop will run until `j` reaches `m - 2`.

4. **Adjust the States**: We need to ensure that the loop can start executing. This means `j` should be 0 initially, and `m` must be at least 1 so that `m - 1` is a non-negative integer.

Given the initial state:
- `impossible` is True
- `tc` is 0
- `n` is an integer from the input split
- `m` is an integer from the input split
- `gr` is a list containing `n` elements, each being an input string from the loop's `append` method
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `ans` is 'YES'
- The first character of the first string in `gr` is not equal to the character at index `m - 1` of the last string in `gr`

We only need to adjust the states related to the loop head, which are `j` and `m`.

State: **`j` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0**
