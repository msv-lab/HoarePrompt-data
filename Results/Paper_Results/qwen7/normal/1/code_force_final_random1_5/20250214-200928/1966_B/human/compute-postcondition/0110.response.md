Let's break down the initial state and the conditions given:

1. `tc` is 1.
2. `n` is an input integer.
3. `m` is an input integer.
4. `gr` is a list containing `n` elements, and each element is an input string.
5. `i` is `n + 1`.
6. `ans` is either 'NO' or 'YES' depending on the value of `impossible`, which remains `False`.
7. `j` is `m - 2`.
8. `m` is greater than 1.
9. `n` is at least 2.
10. If `gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]` is true, then `ans` is set to 'NO'.
11. If `gr[0][0] == gr[n - 1][m - 1]`, then `ans` retains its original value of 'YES'.

Given these conditions, let's analyze the print statement:

- The value of `ans` depends on the comparison between `gr[0][0]` and `gr[n - 1][m - 1]`.
- Since `impossible` remains `False`, `ans` will be set to 'YES' if `gr[0][0] == gr[n - 1][m - 1]`, otherwise it will be set to 'NO'.

However, the initial state does not provide specific values for `gr[0][0]` and `gr[n - 1][m - 1]`. Therefore, we cannot definitively determine the value of `ans` without knowing these specific elements of the list `gr`.

Since the exact values of `gr[0][0]` and `gr[n - 1][m - 1]` are not provided, we can only describe the possible outcomes based on the conditions given.

Output: **ans (where ans is 'YES' if gr[0][0] == gr[n - 1][m - 1], otherwise 'NO')**
