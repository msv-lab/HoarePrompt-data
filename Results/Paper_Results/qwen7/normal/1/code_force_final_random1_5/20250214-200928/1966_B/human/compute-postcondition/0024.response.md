Postcondition: `j` is 1, `m` must be greater than 0, and `impossible` is True if either the first element of the first row in `gr` is not equal to the second element of the first row in `gr`, or the first element of the last row in `gr` is not equal to the second element of the last row in `gr`. Otherwise, `impossible` remains False.
