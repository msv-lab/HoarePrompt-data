Output State: **`tc` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements, each being an input string, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is 'NO' if `gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]' and 'YES' otherwise, `impossible` is True if `gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]' and the condition `gr[i][0] != gr[i + 1][0] or gr[i][m - 1] != gr[i + 1][m - 1]' holds for every `i` in the range `0` to `n-2`, `n, m = map(int, input().split())` has been executed.**

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input, splits them, and converts them to integers, assigning them to `n` and `m` respectively. The other variables (`tc`, `gr`, `i`, `ans`, `impossible`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
