Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `range(n - 1)`.
2. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute if `n - 1` is at least 1, meaning `n` must be at least 2.
   - The variable `i` will start from 0 and increment by 1 in each iteration.

3. **Adjust the given states**:
   - The state `impossible` being `True` does not affect the loop execution directly, so it can remain as is.
   - The state `j` being `m-2` and `m` being greater than 1 are not directly related to the loop head, so they can remain as is.

4. **Ensure the loop can execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 2.
   - At the start of the loop, `i` should be 0.

Given these considerations, the states that need adjustment are `n` and `i`.

**Final State**:
State: **`impossible` is `True`, `j` is `m-2`, `m` is greater than 1, `n` must be at least 2, `i` is 0**
