Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a grid of size n x m where n and m are positive integers (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500) and each cell contains either 'W' or 'B'. For each test case, identified by a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), the function evaluates the grid and returns a specific value or condition based on the given constraints.**

This means the function `func` indirectly accepts a series of test cases, each containing a grid of 'W' and 'B' values, and processes these grids according to the specified constraints. It then returns a result based on the evaluation of these grids.
