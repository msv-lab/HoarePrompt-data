Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions `n` and `m` of the grid.
   - It reads the grid itself row by row.

2. **Initial Assumption:**
   - The program assumes that if the top-left and bottom-right corners have different colors, it's impossible to make the entire grid the same color. This is a critical assumption.

3. **Checking Corners:**
   - The program checks if the top-left corner (`gr[0][0]`) and the bottom-right corner (`gr[n-1][m-1]`) have the same color.
   - If they don't, it sets `ans` to 'NO' and proceeds no further.

4. **Horizontal and Vertical Checks:**
   - The program then checks if all horizontal and vertical segments from the top-left to the bottom-right have the same color.
   - If any segment has different colors at the edges, it sets `ans` to 'NO'.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The program prints 'YES' if it passes all checks, otherwise 'NO'.

### Reasoning:

- **Edge Case Handling:**
  - The program correctly identifies the edge case where the top-left and bottom-right corners have different colors, making it impossible to unify the entire grid.
  - However, the program incorrectly assumes that if the top-left and bottom-right corners have the same color, the entire grid can always be made uniform. This is not necessarily true.

- **Counterexample:**
  - Consider a 2x2 grid:
    ```
    BB
    WB
    ```
  - Here, the top-left and bottom-right corners are the same ('B'), but it's impossible to make the entire grid uniform using the allowed operations.

### Conclusion:

The given program is incorrect because it fails to handle cases where the grid can still be unified even if the top-left and bottom-right corners have the same color. Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**
