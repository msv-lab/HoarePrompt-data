Postcondition: **`impossible` remains `False`, `j` is `m - 2`, `m` is greater than 1, `n` must be at least 2, `i` is 1, and either the first element of `gr[i]` is not equal to the first element of `gr[i + 1]`, or the last element of `gr[i]` is not equal to the last element of `gr[i + 1]`**.

This postcondition indicates that after the execution of the if-else block, the variables retain their initial states as described, and the condition regarding the elements of `gr[i]` and `gr[i + 1]` remains unchanged.
