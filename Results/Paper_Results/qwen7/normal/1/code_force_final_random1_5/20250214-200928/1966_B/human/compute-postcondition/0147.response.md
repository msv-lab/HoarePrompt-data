Output State: **`impossible` is `False`, `ans` remains `'NO'`, `i` is `2n + 1`, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements, each being an input from the user, `j` is `m - 2`, `m` must be greater than 2, and the conditions `(gr[0][j] != gr[0][j + 1]) or (gr[n - 1][j] != gr[n - 1][j + 1])` and `(gr[i][0] != gr[i + 1][0] or gr[i][m - 1] != gr[i + 1][m - 1])` remain satisfied**

Explanation: The line `impossible = False` simply assigns the value `False` to the variable `impossible`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged. The conditions involving the list `gr` and the indices `i`, `j`, and `m` also remain valid as per the initial state.
