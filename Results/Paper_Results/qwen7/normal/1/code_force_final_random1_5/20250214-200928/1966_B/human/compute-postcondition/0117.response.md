Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be at least 1, `m` is greater than 1, `n` is at least 2, `gr` is a list containing two elements where the first element is the original input and the second element is a new input from the user, `ans` is either 'NO' or 'YES' depending on the value of `impossible`, `impossible` remains `False`, `j` is `m-2`**.

Explanation: The code `gr.append(input())` appends a new input from the user to the list `gr`. Initially, `gr` contains one element which is the original input from the user. After appending a new input, `gr` now contains two elements: the original input and the new input. All other variables remain unchanged.
