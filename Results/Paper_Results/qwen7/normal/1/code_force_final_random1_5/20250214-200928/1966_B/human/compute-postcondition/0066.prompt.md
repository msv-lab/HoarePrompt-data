Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tc` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `gr` is an empty list, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is 'NO' if `gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]' and 'YES' otherwise, `impossible` is True if `gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]' and the condition `gr[i][0] != gr[i + 1][0] or gr[i][m - 1] != gr[i + 1][m - 1]' holds for every `i` in the range `0` to `n-2`, `n, m = map(int, input().split())` has been executed.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    gr.append(input())


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `tc` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `gr` is a list containing one element (an input string), `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is 'NO' if `gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]' and 'YES' otherwise, `impossible` is True if `gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]' and the condition `gr[i][0] != gr[i + 1][0] or gr[i][m - 1] != gr[i + 1][m - 1]' holds for every `i` in the range `0` to `n-2`, `n` must be a positive integer

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `gr` is appended with an input value, `i` is `n+1`, `n` remains unchanged, `ans` and `impossible` remain the same as they depend on the values in `gr` and the relationship between elements at specific indices.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `gr` is now a list with its last element being the input value, `i` is `n+2`, `n` remains unchanged, `ans` and `impossible` remain the same.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
