Output State: `impossible` is False, `ans` is 'NO', `n` must be greater than 1, and for every `i` in the range `0` to `n-2`, the condition `gr[i][0] != gr[i + 1][0] or gr[i][m - 1] != gr[i + 1][m - 1]` must hold true.

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, `impossible` will remain `False`, `ans` will still be `'NO'`, `n` must be greater than 1, and the condition `gr[i][0] != gr[i + 1][0] or gr[i][m - 1] != gr[i + 1][m - 1]` must be true for every pair of consecutive rows in the list `gr`.
