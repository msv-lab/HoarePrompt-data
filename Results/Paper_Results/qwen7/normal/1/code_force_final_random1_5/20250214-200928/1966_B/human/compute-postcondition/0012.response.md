Output State: **`tc` is 0, `n` is an integer from the input split, `m` is an integer from the input split, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements, each being an input string from the loop's `append` method, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is 'YES'**.

This output state reflects that the variable `tc` remains unchanged at 0, `n` and `m` retain their initial values, `gr` is a list of `n` strings collected during the loop, `i` is now `n-1`, and `ans` is set to 'YES'.
