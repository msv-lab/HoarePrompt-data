Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop condition is `for i in range(n - 1)`. This means the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `impossible` is `False`
   - `j` is `m - 2`
   - `m` is greater than 1
   - `n` must be at least 2
   - `i` is 0
   - Either the first element of `gr[i]` is not equal to the first element of `gr[i + 1]`, or the last element of `gr[i]` is not equal to the last element of `gr[i + 1]`.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and the loop runs until `i < n - 1`, the next value of `i` will be `1` (since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration).
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n - 1`. Given that `i` is currently 0 and `n` is at least 2, the loop can still execute.

5. **Update the States**:
   - `i` will be updated to `1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged and must still be at least 2.
   - All other variables (`impossible`, `j`, `m`, and the condition involving `gr`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`impossible` is `False`, `j` is `m - 2`, `m` is greater than 1, `n` must be at least 2, `i` is 1, and either the first element of `gr[i]` is not equal to the first element of `gr[i + 1]`, or the last element of `gr[i]` is not equal to the last element of `gr[i + 1]`**.
