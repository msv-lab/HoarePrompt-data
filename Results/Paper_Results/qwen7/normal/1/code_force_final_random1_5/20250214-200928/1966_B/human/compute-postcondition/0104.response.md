Output State: `impossible` is `False`, `j` is `m-2`, `m` is greater than 1, `n` is at least 2, and for every pair of consecutive rows in `gr`, either the first element of the current row is not equal to the first element of the next row, or the last element of the current row is not equal to the last element of the next row.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `impossible` remains `False` because no pair of consecutive rows in the grid `gr` had both their first and last elements matching. The value of `j` remains `m-2`, `m` stays greater than 1, and `n` is at least 2, as these variables are not modified within the loop.
