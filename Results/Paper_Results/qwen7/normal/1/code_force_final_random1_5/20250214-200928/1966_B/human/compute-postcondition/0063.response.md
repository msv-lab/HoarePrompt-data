Output State: **`gr` is appended with an input value, `i` is `n+1`, `n` remains unchanged, `ans` and `impossible` remain the same as they depend on the values in `gr` and the relationship between elements at specific indices.**

Explanation: The code `gr.append(input())` appends an input value to the list `gr`. The variable `i` is incremented by 1, making it `n+1`. The variables `n`, `ans`, and `impossible` remain unchanged because they are not affected by this operation.
