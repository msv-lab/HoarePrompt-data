Based on the initial state provided:

- `tc` is 0.
- `n` is an integer.
- `m` is an integer.
- `gr` is a list containing `n` elements, each being an input string.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `ans` is 'NO' if `gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]` and 'YES' otherwise.
- `impossible` is True if `gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]` and the condition `gr[i][0] != gr[i + 1][0] or gr[i][m - 1] != gr[i + 1][m - 1]` holds for every `i` in the range `0` to `n-2`.

To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the conditions for `ans` and `impossible`:

1. **Condition for `ans`:**
   - If `gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]`, then `ans` is 'NO'.
   - Otherwise, `ans` is 'YES'.

2. **Condition for `impossible`:**
   - `impossible` is True if `gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]` and the condition `gr[i][0] != gr[i + 1][0] or gr[i][m - 1] != gr[i + 1][m - 1]` holds for every `i` in the range `0` to `n-2`.

Given that `i` is `n-1`, the condition `gr[i][0] != gr[i + 1][0] or gr[i][m - 1] != gr[i + 1][m - 1]` cannot be checked because `i + 1` would be out of bounds (`n`), making the condition irrelevant.

Therefore, the key point is the comparison `gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]`:

- If `gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]`, then `ans` is 'NO'.
- Otherwise, `ans` is 'YES'.

Since the exact values of `gr[0][0]` and `gr[n - 1][m - 1]` are not provided, we can only describe the possible outcomes based on the conditions given.

Output: **'NO' if gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1] and 'YES' otherwise**
