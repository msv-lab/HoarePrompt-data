### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the annotated code step-by-step to determine its correctness.

#### Initial Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Grid Representation**: The grid is stored as a list of strings, where each string represents a row of the grid.
3. **Initial Check**: The program first checks if the top-left (`gr[0][0]`) and bottom-right (`gr[n-1][m-1]`) cells are the same. If they are different, it proceeds to check if the first row or the last column can be uniform without changing the top-left and bottom-right cells.
4. **Row and Column Checks**: If the first row or the last column cannot be uniform, it sets `ans` to 'NO' and exits the loop.

#### Detailed Evaluation Using Annotations:
1. **State Before Function Call**:
   - `t`: Number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
   - Each test case has `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500) and a grid of size `n × m` with 'W' or 'B'.
   - Sum of `n·m` over all test cases does not exceed 3·10^5.

2. **State After Reading Input**:
   - `n`, `m`: Dimensions of the grid.
   - `gr`: List of strings representing the grid.
   - `ans`: Initially set to 'YES'.
   - `impossible`: Boolean flag used to track if the grid can be uniform.

3. **Key Checks**:
   - **Corner Check**: If `gr[0][0]` is different from `gr[n-1][m-1]`, the program checks if the first row or the last column can be uniform without changing the corner cells.
   - **Row Check**: It iterates through the first row and checks if all elements are the same.
   - **Column Check**: It iterates through the last column and checks if all elements are the same.
   - **Final Decision**: If any of the checks fail, `ans` is set to 'NO'.

#### Example Grid Analysis:
Consider the grid:
```
B W B
W B W
B W B
```
- The top-left cell is 'B' and the bottom-right cell is 'B', so the initial check passes.
- The first row is inconsistent ('B', 'W', 'B').
- The last column is inconsistent ('B', 'W', 'B').

The program correctly identifies that the grid cannot be made uniform and sets `ans` to 'NO'.

#### Comprehensive Test Cases:
- **All 'W' or All 'B'**: The program correctly outputs 'YES' for grids where all cells are the same.
- **Consistent Rows or Columns**: The program correctly handles grids where a row or column is consistent and can be used to unify the entire grid.
- **Inconsistent Grids**: The program correctly identifies and outputs 'NO' for grids that cannot be made uniform.

Given the detailed analysis, the program correctly handles various edge cases and configurations, ensuring that it accurately determines whether it's possible to make all squares the same color.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct according to the problem description and the given test cases.
