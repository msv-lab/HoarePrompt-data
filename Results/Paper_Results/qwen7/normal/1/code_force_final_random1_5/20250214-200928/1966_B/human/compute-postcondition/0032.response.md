Output State: **`j` is `m-1`, `impossible` is True, and `ans` is 'NO'**.

The code assigns the string `'NO'` to the variable `ans`. This does not affect the values of `j` or `impossible`. Therefore, the output state remains as described in the initial state, with `j` being `m-1`, `impossible` being True, and `ans` set to `'NO'`.
