Output State: **`res` is incremented by 1, `a` must have at least one element, `num` is not in `count`, `count[(1 << 31) - 1 ^ num]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The line `res += 1` increments the value of `res` by 1. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
