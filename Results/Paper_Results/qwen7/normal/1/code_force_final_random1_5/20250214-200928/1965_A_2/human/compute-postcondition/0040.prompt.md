Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object created from integers split from input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique elements from `l`. The number 1 is in `lis` and the length of `lis` is greater than 1; `test` is True.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, len(lis)):
    if lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1:
        if j % 2 == 1:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
        test = False
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `j` is 1, `test` is False, and the length of `lis` is at least 2. If `lis[j] - lis[j - 1]` is greater than 1, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `lis[j] - lis[j - 1]` is not greater than 1, then no change occurs to `test`, `j`, or the length of `lis`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `j` is 2, `test` is False, and if the difference between `lis[j]` and `lis[j - 1]` is greater than 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not met, no change occurs to `j` or `test`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `j` is 3 and `test` is False. If `lis[3] - lis[2]` is greater than 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `lis[3] - lis[2]` is not greater than 1, no change occurs to `j` and `test`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
