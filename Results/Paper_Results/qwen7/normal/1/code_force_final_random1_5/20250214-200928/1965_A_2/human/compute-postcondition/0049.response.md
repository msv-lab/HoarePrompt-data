Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object created from integers split from input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique elements from `l`. If the first element of `lis` is not 1 or the length of `lis` is 1, then the postcondition remains as the initial state. Otherwise, `j` is 3, `test` is True, and the length of `lis` is at least 4.
