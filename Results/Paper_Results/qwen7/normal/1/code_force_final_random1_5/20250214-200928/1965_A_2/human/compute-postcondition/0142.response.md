Postcondition: **`test` remains False, `i` is 2, `l` is a map object created from integers split from input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique elements from `l` that must have at least 2 elements, the difference between the current element `lis[j]` and the previous element `lis[j-1]` in the list `lis` is either greater than 1 or `j` is an odd number, and `j` is less than `len(lis)`, and the length of `lis` is odd if the length of `lis` is odd, otherwise the length of `lis` is even.**

This postcondition summarizes that regardless of whether the condition `test == True` is met or not, the variables `test`, `i`, `l`, and `lis` retain their initial properties as described in the precondition. Specifically, `test` remains unchanged, `i` stays as 2, `l` is a map object created from integers split from input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique elements from `l` with at least two elements, and the difference between consecutive elements in `lis` follows the specified conditions. Additionally, the parity of the length of `lis` is preserved.
