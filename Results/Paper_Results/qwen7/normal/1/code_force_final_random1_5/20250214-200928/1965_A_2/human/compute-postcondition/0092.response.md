Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object created from integers split from the second input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique elements from `l`, `test` is True, and `j` is equal to the length of `lis`. If the length of `lis` is odd, `test` remains True. If the length of `lis` is even, `j` is equal to the length of `lis`.
