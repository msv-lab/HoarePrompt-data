Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object created from integers split from the second input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique elements from `l` that must have at least 2 elements, `test` is False, and `j` is the previous value of `j` + 1. If `lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `lis[j] - lis[j - 1] <= 1`, we do nothing and continue with the same state.
