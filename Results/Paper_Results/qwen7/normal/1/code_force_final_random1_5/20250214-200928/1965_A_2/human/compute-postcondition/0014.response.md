Output State: **`A` is True, `arr[0]` is 1, `set_` is [1], `i` is 2, `not_c` is False**

Explanation: The code `not_c = False` simply reassigns the value of `not_c` to `False`. Since `not_c` was already `False` in the initial state, the assignment does not change its value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
