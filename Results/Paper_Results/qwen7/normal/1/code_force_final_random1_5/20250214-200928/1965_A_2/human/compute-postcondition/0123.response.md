Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `l` is a map object created from integers split from input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique elements from `l` that must have at least 2 elements, `test` is False, the difference between the current element `lis[j]` and the previous element `lis[j-1]` in the list `lis` is either greater than 1 or `j` is an odd number, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `j` is less than `len(lis)` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but indicates that the most internal loop or if statement has been exited. Therefore, all the conditions and values of the variables remain the same as they were before the `break` statement was executed.
