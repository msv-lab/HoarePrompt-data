Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object created from integers split from input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique elements from `l`, `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`**.

The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
