Output State: **`A` is False, `arr[0]` is 1, `set_` is [1], `i` is 2, `not_c` is False**

The code `not_c = False` does not change any of the existing values of the variables. It simply reassigns the value of `not_c` to `False`, which was its original value. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
