Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `l` is a map object created from integers split from input, `lis` is a sorted list of unique elements from `l`, `test` is True**

The code simply assigns the boolean value `True` to the variable `test`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `i`, `l`, or `lis`. Therefore, the conditions and values of these variables remain unchanged.
