Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(t)`. This means the loop variables are `i` and `t`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
   - `t` must be greater than 0
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is an input integer (this variable is not part of the loop head)
   - `l` is a map object created from integers split from the second input (this variable is not part of the loop head)
   - `lis` is a sorted list of unique elements from `l` (this variable is not part of the loop head)
   - `test` is True (this variable is not part of the loop head)

3. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `i < t` must hold true. Given that `i` is currently 1, `t` must be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
- `t` must be greater than 1
- `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will be 2

The final state for the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2**
