Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer.
- `word` is either 'az' or 'aaa'.
- `i` is 4.

The conditions for `word` are:
- If `n` is greater than 52, then `word` is 'zzzzzz'.
- If `n` is greater than 26, `word` is 'az'.
- If `n` is less than or equal to 26, `word` is 'aaa'.

Since `i` is 4, it does not affect the value of `word`. We need to determine the value of `word` based on the value of `n`.

The value of `word` depends on the value of `n`:
- If `n > 52`, `word` would be 'zzzzzz'.
- If `n > 26`, `word` would be 'az'.
- If `n <= 26`, `word` would be 'aaa'.

Since the exact value of `n` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `word`. However, based on the given conditions, `word` could be either 'az' or 'aaa'.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is indeterminate without knowing the exact value of `n`.

Output: **word (where word is either 'az' or 'aaa' based on the value of n)**
