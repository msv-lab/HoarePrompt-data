You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Nikita had a word consisting of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters. The letters
in the Latin alphabet are numbered from 1 to 26 , where the letter "a" has the
index 1 , and the letter "z" has the index 26 .

He encoded this word as the sum of the positions of all the characters in the
alphabet. For example, the word "cat" he would encode as the integer 3 + 1 +
20 = 24 , because the letter "c" has the index 3 in the alphabet, the letter
"a" has the index 1 , and the letter "t" has the index 20 .

However, this encoding turned out to be ambiguous! For example, when encoding
the word "ava", the integer 1 + 22 + 1 = 24 is also obtained.

Determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have
been encoded.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of
the following holds:

  * a is a prefix of b , but a \ne b ;
  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \le n \le
78 ) — the encoded word.

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word
that could have been encoded on a separate line.

Example

Input

    5
    
    24
    
    70
    
    3
    
    55
    
    48

Output

    aav
    rzz
    aaa
    czz
    auz

- Program:
import string

def func():
    alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        word = ''
        if n > 52:
            word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'
        elif n > 26:
            word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'
        else:
            word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]
        print(word)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` and then iterates `t` times. During each iteration, it reads another integer `n` and constructs a string `word` based on the value of `n`. If `n` is greater than 52, `word` is set to `'zz'` plus a character derived from the alphabet. If `n` is between 27 and 52, `word` is set to `'a'` plus a character derived from the alphabet plus `'z'`. If `n` is between 4 and 26, `word` is set to `'aa'` plus a character derived from the alphabet. After processing all inputs, the function prints the constructed string `word` for each iteration.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   
2. **Encoding Logic:**
   - The program attempts to decode the given integer `n` into a three-letter word.
   - The logic used to decode the integer `n` into a word is as follows:
     - If `n > 52`, it means the word cannot start with 'a', so it uses the character at position `n - 53` (since 'a' is at position 1).
     - If `n > 26`, it means the word can start with 'a', so it uses 'a' and the character at position `n - 28`.
     - Otherwise, it uses 'aa' and the character at position `n - 3`.

3. **Character Mapping:**
   - The program uses the `string.ascii_lowercase` to get the list of lowercase letters.
   - The mapping from the integer `n` to the corresponding character is correct.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases like `n > 52` and `n > 26` appropriately.
   - However, the logic does not ensure that the resulting word is lexicographically smallest.

### Testing the Program

Let's test the program with the provided examples:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `24`
   - Expected Output: `aav`
   - Actual Output: `aav`

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `70`
   - Expected Output: `rzz`
   - Actual Output: `rzz`

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `3`
   - Expected Output: `aaa`
   - Actual Output: `aaa`

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - Input: `55`
   - Expected Output: `czz`
   - Actual Output: `czz`

5. **Test Case 5:**
   - Input: `48`
   - Expected Output: `auz`
   - Actual Output: `auz`

### Conclusion

The program correctly decodes the integer `n` into a three-letter word. However, the logic does not guarantee that the word is lexicographically smallest. For example, for `n = 24`, the expected output is `aav`, but the program outputs `aav`. This is correct, but the logic should be more robust to ensure the lexicographically smallest word is always chosen.

Given the problem statement and the provided examples, the program seems to work correctly for the given constraints. Therefore, the program is correct in terms of the given problem description.
