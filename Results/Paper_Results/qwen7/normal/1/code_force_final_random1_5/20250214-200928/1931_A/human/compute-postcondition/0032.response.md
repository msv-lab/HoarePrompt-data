Output State: **`word` is 'aaa', `n` is an input integer, `i` is 4**

Explanation: The code appends the string `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]` to the existing value of `word`. Given the initial state, `word` is an empty string (`''`). Assuming `alphabet` is a predefined list or dictionary where `alphabet[0]` corresponds to 'a', `alphabet[1]` to 'b', and so on, `alphabet[n - 3]` would be the character corresponding to the index `n - 3`. However, since the exact value of `n` is not specified, we can only say that `word` is now `'aaa'` because it starts with an empty string and then appends `'aa'` followed by the character at position `n - 3`, which in this case is another 'a' (assuming `n - 3` is within the bounds of the alphabet and maps to 'a'). The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.
