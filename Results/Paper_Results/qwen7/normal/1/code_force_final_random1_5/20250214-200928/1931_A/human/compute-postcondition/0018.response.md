Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `word` is an empty string, `i` is incremented by 1, and `int(input())` remains the same.**

Explanation: The code `word = ''` assigns an empty string to the variable `word`. The values of `n`, `i`, and `int(input())` remain unchanged from their initial states.
