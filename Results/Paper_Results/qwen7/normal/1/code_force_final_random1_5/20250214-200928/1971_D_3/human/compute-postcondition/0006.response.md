Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `while j < len(s) - 1:`. The variables involved here are `j` and `len(s) - 1`.

2. **Determine the current state of these variables**:
   - `j` is currently 0.
   - `len(s)` is the length of the string `s`.
   - Since `len(s)` is a property of the string `s`, it remains unchanged within the loop.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute the first time**: The loop will execute the first time if `j` is less than `len(s) - 1`. Given that `j` is currently 0, the condition `0 < len(s) - 1` must be true for the loop to execute.

4. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - `j` is already 0, so no adjustment is needed for `j`.
   - For the loop to execute, `len(s) - 1` must be greater than 0, which means `len(s)` must be greater than 1.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `len(s)` must be greater than 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 500, `i` is 1, `s` is an input string, `flag` is False, `j` is 0, `len(s)` must be greater than 1**
