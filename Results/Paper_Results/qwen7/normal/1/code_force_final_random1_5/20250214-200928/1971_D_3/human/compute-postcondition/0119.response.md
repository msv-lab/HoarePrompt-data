Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `t` and a binary string `s`. For each test case, it counts the number of transitions from '0' to '1' in the string `s`. If any transition from '0' to '1' is found, it subtracts one from the count. Finally, it prints the adjusted count for each test case.**
