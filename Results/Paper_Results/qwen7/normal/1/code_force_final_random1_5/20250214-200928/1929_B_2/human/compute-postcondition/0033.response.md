Based on the initial state provided:

- `s` is the next valid line of input starting from the second line.
- `n` is the integer value of the first element in `s` split by spaces and converted to an integer.
- `k` is the integer value of the second element in `s` split by spaces and converted to an integer.

The `print(math.ceil(k / 2))` statement will print the ceiling of `k / 2`.

Since `k` is an integer, `k / 2` will be a floating-point number. The `math.ceil()` function will round this number up to the nearest integer.

Therefore, the output will be the ceiling value of half of `k`.

Output: **math.ceil(k / 2)**
