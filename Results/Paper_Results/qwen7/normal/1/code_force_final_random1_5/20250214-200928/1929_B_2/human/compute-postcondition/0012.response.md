Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is an integer input from the user, split by space and converted to an integer.
- `k` is an integer input from the user, split by space and converted to an integer.
- `t` is reduced by 1, but `t` is not used in the print statement.

The print statement is `print(ceil(k / 2))`.

The `ceil` function rounds a number up to the nearest integer. Therefore, the expression `ceil(k / 2)` will take the value of `k` divided by 2 and round it up to the nearest integer.

Since the exact value of `k` is not specified, we can only describe the result in terms of `k`.

Output: **ceil(k / 2)**
