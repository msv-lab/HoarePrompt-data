Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the minimum number of cells to color in an \(n \times n\) grid such that at least \(k\) diagonals have at least one colored cell.
2. The solution provided correctly handles the two main cases:
   - When \(4n - 2 = k\), the formula \( \frac{k}{2} + 1 \) gives the exact minimum number of cells needed.
   - Otherwise, the ceiling of \( \frac{k}{2} \) is used, which ensures that we cover at least \(k\) diagonals.
3. The logic in the code matches the problem statement and the examples provided.
4. The loop iterates over each test case, correctly processing \(n\) and \(k\) for each case and printing the appropriate result.
5. The edge cases and boundary conditions are handled appropriately, as shown in the examples.

Given the above reasoning, the annotated program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
