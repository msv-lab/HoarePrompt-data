Output State: All inputs `n` and `k` from each iteration of the loop have been processed according to their conditions. The variable `t` has been decremented by the number of iterations (initially `t`, then `t-1`, `t-2`, ..., until `t-n` where `n` is the number of iterations), and the loop has terminated. For each iteration, if `4 * n - 2 == k`, the output was `k // 2 + 1`; otherwise, the output was `ceil(k / 2)`. The final state will include the last printed value from the loop and `t` will be 0 since all iterations have completed.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the value of `t` will be 0, and the output will consist of the results from each iteration based on the given conditions.
