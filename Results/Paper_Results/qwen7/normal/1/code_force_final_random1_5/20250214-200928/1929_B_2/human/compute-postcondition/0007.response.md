Postcondition: `n` is an integer input from the user split by space and converted to an integer, `k` is an integer input from the user split by space and converted to an integer. If 4 times the current value of `n` minus 2 equals the current value of `k`, the function does not change the values of `n` and `k`. Otherwise, the condition 4 * n - 2 is not equal to `k`.
