Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, and it is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    if 4 * n - 2 == k:
        print(k // 2 + 1)
    else:
        print(ceil(k / 2))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `n` is an integer input from the user split by space and converted to an integer, `k` is an integer input from the user split by space and converted to an integer. If 4 * n - 2 equals k, the condition holds true. Otherwise, the condition does not hold.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer input from the user split by space and converted to an integer, `k` is an integer input from the user split by space and converted to an integer, `t` is reduced by 1. If `4 * n - 2 == k`, no change is made to `n` and `k`. Otherwise, no change is made to `n` and `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer input from the user split by space and converted to an integer, `k` is an integer input from the user split by space and converted to an integer, `t` is `t - 1`. If `4 * n - 2 == k`, no change is made to `n`, `k`, or `t`. Otherwise, no change is made to `n`, `k`, or `t`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
