Postcondition: `i` is in the range 0 to `m-1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, and `i` is now `n - m + len(b) + 1`. If `a[i]` is in `b_values`, then the count of `a[i]` in `cnt_b` is greater than or equal to 0 and has been decremented by 1. If `a[i]` is not in `b_values`, no change is made to `i` and `cnt_b`.
