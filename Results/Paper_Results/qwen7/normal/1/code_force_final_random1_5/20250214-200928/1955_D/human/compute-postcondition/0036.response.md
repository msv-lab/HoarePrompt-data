Output State: **`i` is 3; `m` is a positive integer; `cnt_b[a[3]]` is decreased by 1; `curr` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `curr += 1` increments the value of `curr` by 1. Since `i` and `m` are not affected by this operation, their values remain unchanged. The value of `cnt_b[a[3]]` is also not directly involved in this operation, so it remains decreased by 1. Therefore, the updated state includes the increment of `curr` by 1 while keeping the other variables in their initial conditions except for `curr`.
