Output State: **`ans` is increased by 1, `i` is 0, `n` is known, `m` is known, `len(b)` is known, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is either `cnt_b[a[i]] - 1` or remains the same, `a[i + m]` is either in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decreased by 1, or `a[i + m]` is not in `b_values` and the other conditions remain unchanged, `curr` is now equal to `curr - 1` if `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, and `ans` is increased by 1 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`.**

This means that `ans` has been incremented by 1, while the other variables retain their previous states. The value of `i` remains 0, `n` and `m` remain known, the length of `b` remains known, the count of `a[i]` in `cnt_b` either decreases by 1 or stays the same, `a[i + m]` either gets removed from `b_values` and its count in `cnt_b` decreases by 1, or remains unchanged, `curr` is decremented by 1 if `a[i + m]` was in `b_values`, and `ans` is further incremented by 1 if `curr` is now greater than or equal to `k`.
