Output State: **`ans` is 0, `curr` is 0, `i` is `n - m + len(b)`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `cnt_b` is a dictionary with keys from the set of integers in `b` and values incremented by 1 for each index in `b`, `b_values` is a set of integers from the list `b`, `b` is a list of integers obtained from input, `m` must be greater than 0, and `i` is in the range `0` to `len(b)-1`.**

Explanation: The line `curr = 0` initializes the variable `curr` to 0. This does not affect the values of any other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the output state retains the values of all variables as they were in the initial state, with the addition of `curr` being initialized to 0.
