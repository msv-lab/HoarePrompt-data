Postcondition: `i` is 2; `n - m` must be at least `m - 1`; `cnt_b[a[i]]` (or `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` depending on the condition) is adjusted by 1 (either incremented or decremented); `curr` is adjusted by 1 (increased if `a[i + m] in b_values`, decreased otherwise); `ans` is increased by 1 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`.
