Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is known, `m` is known, `len(b)` is known, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is either `cnt_b[a[i]] - 1` or remains the same, `a[i + m]` is either in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decreased by 1, or `a[i + m]` is not in `b_values` and the other conditions remain unchanged, `curr` is now equal to `curr - 1` if `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, and `ans` is increased by 1 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`**

Explanation: The code `cnt_b[a[i + m]] -= 1` decrements the value of `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` by 1. Depending on whether `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, the value of `curr` changes (it becomes `curr - 1` if `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`), and the value of `ans` increases by 1 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
