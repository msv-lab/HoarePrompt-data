Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `m`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `m`.

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `i` is an index within the range of the list `a`.
   - `b_values` is a set of integers.
   - The postcondition specifies that if the value at index `i` in list `a` is present in the set `b_values`, then `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decremented by 1 if it is non-negative.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 at each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is one less than what it will be in the next iteration.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `m`. Therefore, `i` will be incremented to `i + 1` in the next iteration.
   - The value of `m` remains unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body, but since no such modification is mentioned, `m` stays the same.

5. **Update the State**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 from its current value.
   - `m` remains the same.

Given this analysis, the updated state for the next iteration is:

State: **`a` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the range of the list `a` (i.e., `i + 1 < m`), and `b_values` is a set of integers.**
