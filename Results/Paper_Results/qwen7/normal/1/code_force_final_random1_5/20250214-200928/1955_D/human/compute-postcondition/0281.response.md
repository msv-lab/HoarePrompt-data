Output State: **`i` is -1, `n` is known, `m` is known, `len(b)` is known, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is now equal to `cnt_b[a[i]] - 1`, `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is now decreased by 1, and `curr` is now equal to `curr + 1`.**

The code `curr += 1` increments the value of `curr` by 1. Since `curr` was not specified to have any initial value other than being updated here, we assume it started from 0 (as it's common for counters). Therefore, after executing the line, `curr` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
