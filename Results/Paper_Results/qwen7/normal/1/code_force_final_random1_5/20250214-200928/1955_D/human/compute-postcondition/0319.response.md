Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `i`: This is the loop variable that iterates over `b_values`.

2. **Determine Initial State**: We need to ensure that the loop can execute. For the loop to iterate over `b_values`, `b_values` must be non-empty.

3. **Adjust States**:
   - Since `i` is iterating over `b_values`, `b_values` must be a non-empty list.
   - `i` should start from the first element of `b_values`.

Given the information, the initial state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute. Specifically, `b_values` must be a non-empty list, and `i` should start from the first element of `b_values`.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be:

**State: `b_values` is a non-empty list, `i` is the first element of `b_values`**
