Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies the variable `i` and the value `m`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `m` is a positive integer.
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `b_values` is a set of values.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < m`.

4. **Calculate the new value of `i` for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it `i = 2`.

5. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `m`.
   - Since `i` is now 2, the loop will execute again if `m > 2`.

6. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `m` remains a positive integer (no specific change needed).
   - `a` and `b_values` remain unchanged.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 2, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b_values` is a set of values**.
