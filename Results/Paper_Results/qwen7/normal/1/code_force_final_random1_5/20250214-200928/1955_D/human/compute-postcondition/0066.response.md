Output State: **`ans` is incremented by 1, `i` is 0, `n - m` must be at least `m - 1`, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1, `curr` is decreased by 1, and `ans` is initialized. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, then `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1 and `curr` is decreased by 1. If `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, it is further decremented by 1. If `a[i + m]` is not in `b_values`, no change is made to `cnt_b[a[i + m]]`. Additionally, the current value of `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`.**

Explanation: The line `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. All other conditions and variable states remain unchanged from the initial state.
