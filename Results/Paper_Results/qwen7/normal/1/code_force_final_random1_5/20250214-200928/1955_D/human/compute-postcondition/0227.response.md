Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is `n - m`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `ans` is the final count of times `curr` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop execution, `cnt_b[b[i]]` is 1 for the index `i` in `b_values`, and `b_values` remains unchanged, `b` is a list of integers obtained from input, `m` must be greater than 0, and `i` must be in the range `0` to `m-1`**

Explanation: The code `cnt_b[b[i]] += 1` increments the count of the element `b[i]` in the list `cnt_b`. Since `i` is in the range `0` to `m-1`, the specific index in `cnt_b` that gets incremented is `b[i]`. The value of `cnt_b[b[i]]` is updated to 1, while all other values in `cnt_b` remain 0. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
