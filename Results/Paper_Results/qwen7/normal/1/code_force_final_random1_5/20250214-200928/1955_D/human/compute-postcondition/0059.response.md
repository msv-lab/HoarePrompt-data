Output State: **`i` is 0, `n - m` must be at least `m - 1`, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `curr` is 0, and `ans` is initialized.**

Explanation: The variable `curr` was initially decreased by 1, making its value -1. After executing `curr += 1`, `curr` is incremented by 1, resulting in `curr` being 0. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
