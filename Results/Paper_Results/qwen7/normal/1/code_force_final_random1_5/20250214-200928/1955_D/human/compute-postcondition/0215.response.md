Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given Information:
- **State before the loop starts:**
  - `i` is `n - m - 1`
  - `n` must be greater than `m`
  - `curr` is the total count of elements in `a` that are present in `b_values` and for which `cnt_b[a[i]]` was non-negative during the loop execution plus the appropriate adjustments based on the presence of `a[i + m]` in `b_values`
  - `ans` is the final count of times `curr` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop execution
  - `b_values` remains unchanged

- **Loop statement:**
  ```python
  for i in b_values:
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over the `b_values` list.
   - The loop variable `i` takes values from the `b_values` list.

2. **Determine Initial State of `i`:**
   - From the given information, `i` is initialized to `n - m - 1`.
   - This suggests that the loop will start iterating from the last element of `b_values` and move backwards.

3. **Check Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will continue as long as there are elements in `b_values` to iterate over.
   - Therefore, the initial state of `i` should be such that it can start from the last element of `b_values`.

4. **Adjust States Based on Loop Execution:**
   - Since `i` is being used to iterate over `b_values`, the initial value of `i` should be the last index of `b_values`.
   - The length of `b_values` determines how many iterations the loop will perform.

5. **Ensure `n` and `m` Conditions:**
   - `n` must be greater than `m` to ensure valid indexing and to avoid out-of-bounds errors.

6. **Final Adjusted States:**
   - `i` should be the last index of `b_values`, which is `len(b_values) - 1`.
   - `n` must be greater than `m` to ensure valid indexing.
   - `curr`, `ans`, and `b_values` remain unchanged as per the given information.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is the last index of `b_values`, `n` must be greater than `m`, `curr` is the total count of elements in `a` that are present in `b_values` and for which `cnt_b[a[i]]` was non-negative during the loop execution plus the appropriate adjustments based on the presence of `a[i + m]` in `b_values`, `ans` is the final count of times `curr` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop execution, and `b_values` remains unchanged.**

In terms of specific values:
- `i` is `len(b_values) - 1`
- `n` must be greater than `m`
- `curr` and `ans` are as described
- `b_values` remains unchanged

So, the final state is:
**`i` is `len(b_values) - 1`, `n` must be greater than `m`, `curr` is the total count of elements in `a` that are present in `b_values` and for which `cnt_b[a[i]]` was non-negative during the loop execution plus the appropriate adjustments based on the presence of `a[i + m]` in `b_values`, `ans` is the final count of times `curr` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop execution, and `b_values` remains unchanged.**
