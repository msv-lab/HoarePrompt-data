Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 elements where each element is incremented based on the value of `b[i]` for \(i\) in the range of `m`, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `i` is `m`, `m` is a positive integer, `b_values` is a set containing unique values from the list `b`, `ans` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `ans` to 0. Since no other operations are performed on `ans`, its value remains unchanged. All other variables and their states remain the same as the initial state.
