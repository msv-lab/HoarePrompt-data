Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i` and `m`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < m`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `cnt_b[b[i]]` is incremented by 1.
   - `i` is `i + 1`.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, `i` will be `i + 1` from the previous value.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must still be less than `m`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be updated to `i + 1`.
   - `m` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop.

Given the above steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is `i + 1`.
- `m` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`cnt_b[b[i]]` is incremented by 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `m` must be greater than `i + 1`**.
