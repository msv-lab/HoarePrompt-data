Postcondition: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `m`, `cnt_b[a[m-1]]` will be decreased by 1, `curr` will be increased by the number of times `a[m-1]` was found in `b_values`, and `ans` will be increased by 1 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**
