Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is known, `m` is known, `len(b)` is known, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is `cnt_b[a[i]] + 1`, `a[i + m]` is either in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decreased by 1, or `a[i + m]` is not in `b_values` and the other conditions remain unchanged, `curr` is now equal to `curr + 1` if `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, and `ans` is increased by 1 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k**.

This means that the value of `cnt_b[a[i]]` has been incremented by 1. All other variables retain their previous states unless specified otherwise by the conditions given.
