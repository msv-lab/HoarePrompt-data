Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is `n - m`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `ans` is the final count of times `curr` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop execution, `cnt_b[i]` is 0 for all `i` in `b_values`, and `b_values` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of space-separated integers from the input and splits them into a list using `map(int, input().split())`. This list is assigned to the variable `a`. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `ans`, `cnt_b`, and `b_values`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
