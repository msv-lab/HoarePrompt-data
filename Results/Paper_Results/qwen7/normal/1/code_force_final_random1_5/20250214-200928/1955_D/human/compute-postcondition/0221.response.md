Output State: **`i` is `n - m - 1`, `n` must be greater than `m`, `curr` is the total count of elements in `a` that are present in `b_values` and for which `cnt_b[a[i]]` was non-negative during the loop execution plus the appropriate adjustments based on the presence of `a[i + m]` in `b_values`, `ans` is the final count of times `curr` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop execution, `cnt_b[i]` is 0 for all `i` in `b_values`, and `b_values` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be set to `n - m - 1`, indicating that the loop has processed each element in the range from 0 to `n - m - 1`. Since the loop iterates over each element in `b_values` exactly once, `cnt_b[i]` will be 0 for all `i` in `b_values` because the loop body sets `cnt_b[i]` to 0 for each `i` in `b_values`. The value of `n` must still be greater than `m`. The variable `curr` reflects the cumulative effect of the conditions checked within the loop, adjusted by the presence or absence of elements in `b_values`. The variable `ans` holds the total count of times the condition `curr >= k` was satisfied throughout the loop's execution. Lastly, `b_values` remains unchanged, as no modifications were made to it within the loop.
