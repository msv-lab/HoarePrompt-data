Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than `m`, `curr` is the total count of elements in `a` that are present in `b_values` and for which `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` was non-negative during the loop execution plus 1, and `ans` is 2 if `curr >= k`. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, `curr` is incremented by 1 and `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1. If `a[i + m]` is not in `b_values`, `curr` remains unchanged and `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` remains unchanged.
