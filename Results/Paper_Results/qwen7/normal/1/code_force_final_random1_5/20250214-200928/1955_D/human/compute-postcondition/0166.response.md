Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than `m`, `curr` is the total count of elements in `a` that are present in `b_values` and for which `cnt_b[a[i]]` was non-negative during the loop execution plus 1 (if `a[i]` is in `b_values`), `ans` is 1, and `b_values` remains unchanged. If `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, `curr` is decremented by 1 (if `a[i]` is in `b_values`). Additionally, the condition `(a[i + m] in b_values)` is true.
