Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than `m`, `curr` is the total count of elements in `a` that are present in `b_values` and for which `cnt_b[a[i]]` was non-negative during the loop execution plus 2 (if `a[i + m]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is non-negative and has been decremented by 1), `ans` is 2, and `b_values` remains unchanged.**

The value of `ans` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. All other variables and their conditions remain the same as per the initial state.
