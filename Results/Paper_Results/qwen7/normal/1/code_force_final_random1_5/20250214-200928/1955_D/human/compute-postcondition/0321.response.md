Output State: **`i` is 0; `cnt_b[0]` is 0**

Explanation: The code `cnt_b[i] = 0` sets the value of `cnt_b` at index `i` to 0. Given that `i` is initially 0, `cnt_b[0]` is set to 0. The value of `i` remains unchanged as the code only modifies the `cnt_b` list. Therefore, the output state is that `i` is still 0 and `cnt_b[0]` is now 0.
