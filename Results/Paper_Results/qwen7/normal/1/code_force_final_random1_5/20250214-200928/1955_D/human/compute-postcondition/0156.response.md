Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than `m`, `curr` is the total count of elements in `a` that are present in `b_values` and for which `cnt_b[a[i]]` was non-negative during the loop execution, `ans` is 1, and `b_values` remains unchanged. The current value of `a[i]` is present in `b_values`.
