Output State: **`i` is `n - m + len(b) + m`, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decremented by 1 for each `i` from `n - m + len(b)` to `n - m + len(b) + m - 1`, and `curr` is increased by 1 for each valid `a[i]` (where `a[i]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is non-negative); `ans` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The line `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
