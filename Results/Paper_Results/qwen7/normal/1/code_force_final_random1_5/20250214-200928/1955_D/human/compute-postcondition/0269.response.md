Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is known, `m` is known, `len(b)` is known, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `cnt_b[a[i]] += 1` increments the count of `a[i]` in the dictionary `cnt_b`. Since `i` is initially 0, `a[i]` refers to the first element of the list `a`. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and the other variables (`n`, `m`, `len(b)`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, their states remain the same as the initial state.
