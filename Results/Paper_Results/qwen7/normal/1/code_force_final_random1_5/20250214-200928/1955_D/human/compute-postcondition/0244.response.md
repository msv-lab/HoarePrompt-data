Postcondition: `i` is in the range 0 to `m-1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, and `i` is now `n - m + len(b) + 1`; the current value of `a[i]` is in `b_values`; `cnt_b[a[i]]` is either greater than or equal to 0 and has been decremented by 1, or `cnt_b[a[i]]` remains unchanged (since there is no else part).
