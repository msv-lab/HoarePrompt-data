Output State: **`cnt_b[i]` is 0, `i` is the first element of `b_values`, `n` must be greater than `m`, `curr` is the total count of elements in `a` that are present in `b_values` and for which `cnt_b[a[i]]` was non-negative during the loop execution plus the appropriate adjustments based on the presence of `a[i + m]` in `b_values`, `ans` is the final count of times `curr` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop execution, `b_values` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The line `cnt_b[i] = 0` sets the value of `cnt_b[i]` to 0. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `m`, `curr`, `ans`, and `b_values`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
