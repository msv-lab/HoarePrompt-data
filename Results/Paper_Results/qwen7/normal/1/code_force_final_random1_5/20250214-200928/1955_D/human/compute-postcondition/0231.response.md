Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is (n - m) + 2, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `ans` is the final count of times `curr` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop execution, `cnt_b[b[i]]` is increased by 1 for the index `i` in `b_values`, `b_values` remains unchanged, `b` is a list of integers obtained from input, `m` must be greater than 0, and `i` is in the range `0` to `m-1`, `cnt_b[b[i]]` is incremented by 1.**

This means that the value of `cnt_b[b[i]]` has been incremented by 1 for the current index `i` in the list `b`. All other variables remain in their initial or previously described states.
