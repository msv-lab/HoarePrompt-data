Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be `n - m - 1`, `n` is known, `m` is known, `len(b)` is known, `cnt_b[a[i]]` will be either `cnt_b[a[i]] - 1` or remain the same, `a[i + m]` will be either in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` will be decreased by 1, or `a[i + m]` will be not in `b_values` and the other conditions will remain unchanged, `curr` will be the final value determined by the loop's logic, and `ans` will be increased by 1 every time `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will have reached the end of the range specified by `range(n - m)`. The counters in `cnt_b` will reflect the changes made during each iteration based on the conditions provided. The variable `curr` will hold the final count as per the loop's logic, and `ans` will contain the total count of times `curr` was greater than or equal to `k`.
Code of the loop:
for i in b_values:
    cnt_b[i] = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 0; `cnt_b[0]` is 0

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 1; `cnt_b[0]` is 0; `cnt_b[1]` is 0

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is the next element in `b_values`, `cnt_b[0]` is 0, `cnt_b[1] is 0, and cnt_b[i] is 0




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
