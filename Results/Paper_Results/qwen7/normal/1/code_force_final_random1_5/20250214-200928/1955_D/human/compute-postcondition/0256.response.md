Output State: **`i` is `n - m + len(b) + 3`, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decremented by 1**

Explanation: The code `cnt_b[a[i]] -= 1` decrements the value of `cnt_b[a[i]]` by 1. The value of `i` is determined by the initial state as `n - m + len(b) + 3`. Since `m` is the same as before, its value remains unchanged. The other variables are not affected by this line of code.
