Output State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 elements where each element is incremented based on the value of `b[i]` for \(i\) in the range of `m`, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `i` is `m`, `m` must be a positive integer, and the final state of `cnt_b` reflects the count of occurrences of each value in `b`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `cnt_b[j]` will contain the number of times the integer `j` appears in the list `b`. The variable `i` will be equal to `m`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The other variables (`t`, `max_val`, and `b`) remain unchanged as they were not affected by the loop.
