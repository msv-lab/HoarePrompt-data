Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in b_values`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `b_values`.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `cnt_b[0]` is 0
   - `cnt_b[1]` is 0

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are more elements in `b_values` for `i` to iterate over.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` would be the next element in `b_values`.
   - The values of `cnt_b[0]` and `cnt_b[1]` remain unchanged unless modified within the loop body, which is not specified here.

Given that the only variables in the loop head are `i` and `b_values`, and assuming `b_values` is a list, the state needs to be adjusted based on the next value of `i` from the list `b_values`.

Since the exact value of `b_values` is not provided, we can only infer that `i` will be incremented to the next element in the list. Therefore, if `i` was 1, the next value of `i` would be the second element in `b_values`.

However, without knowing the actual content of `b_values`, we can only state that `i` will be adjusted to the next element in the list.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is the next element in `b_values`, `cnt_b[0]` is 0, `cnt_b[1]` is 0**
