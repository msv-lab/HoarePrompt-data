Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 zeros with the element at index `b[3]` incremented by 1, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `i` is 4, `m` must be at least 2**.

Explanation: The code increments the count of the element `b[i]` in the list `cnt_b`. Initially, `i` is 3, so `cnt_b[b[3]]` is incremented by 1. After this operation, `i` is updated to `i + 1`, making it 4. All other variables remain unchanged.
