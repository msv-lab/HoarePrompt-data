Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is controlled by the `input()` function, which reads an integer value. This means the loop will run for as many times as the input integer specifies.

2. **Determine the initial state before the first iteration**: The initial state at the end of the previous iteration (which is actually the starting state) is given as:
   - `i` is `n - m - 1`
   - `n` must be greater than `m`
   - `curr` is the total count of elements in `a` that are present in `b_values` and for which `cnt_b[a[i]]` was non-negative during the loop execution plus the appropriate adjustments based on the presence of `a[i + m]` in `b_values`
   - `ans` is the final count of times `curr` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop execution
   - `cnt_b[i]` is 0 for all `i` in `b_values`
   - `b_values` remains unchanged

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - The variable `i` will be incremented by 1 at the start of each new iteration because it starts from `n - m - 1` and the loop will increment `i` by 1 each time.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `i < n - m`, because the loop runs for `int(input())` iterations, and `i` starts from `n - m - 1`.
   - Since `n` must be greater than `m` and `i` is incremented by 1, `n` must still be greater than `m` for the loop to continue.
   - `curr`, `ans`, `cnt_b`, and `b_values` remain unchanged unless the loop body modifies them, but since the loop body is omitted, we assume they stay the same.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `i` will be `n - m - 1 + 1 = n - m`
- `n` must still be greater than `m`
- `curr`, `ans`, `cnt_b`, and `b_values` remain unchanged

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is `n - m`, `n` must be greater than `m`, `curr` is the total count of elements in `a` that are present in `b_values` and for which `cnt_b[a[i]]` was non-negative during the loop execution plus the appropriate adjustments based on the presence of `a[i + m]` in `b_values`, `ans` is the final count of times `curr` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop execution, `cnt_b[i]` is 0 for all `i` in `b_values`, and `b_values` remains unchanged**.
