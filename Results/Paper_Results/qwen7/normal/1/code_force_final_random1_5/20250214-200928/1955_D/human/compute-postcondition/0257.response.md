Output State: **`i` is `n - m + len(b) + 3`, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decremented by 1, `curr` is increased by 1**.

Explanation: The variable `curr` is incremented by 1. The values of `i` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `i` is still `n - m + len(b) + 3`, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is still decremented by 1, and `curr` is increased by 1.
