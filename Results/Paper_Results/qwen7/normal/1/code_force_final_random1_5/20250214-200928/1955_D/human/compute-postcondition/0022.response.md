Output State: **`i` is 1, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b_values` is a set of values, and the count of `a[i]` in `cnt_b` is decreased by 1, and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than or equal to 0.**

Explanation: The line `curr += 1` increments the value of `curr` (which is `i` in this context) by 1. Initially, `i` was 0, so after executing this line, `i` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
