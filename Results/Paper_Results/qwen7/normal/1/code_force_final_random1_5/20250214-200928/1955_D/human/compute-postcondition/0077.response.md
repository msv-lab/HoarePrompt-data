Output State: **`i` is 1, `n - m` must be at least `m - 1`, `cnt_b[a[1 + m]]` is decremented by 1, `curr` is 0, `ans` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `curr += 1` increments the value of `curr` by 1. Given that `curr` was initially decreased by 1, its new value is now 0. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state description.
