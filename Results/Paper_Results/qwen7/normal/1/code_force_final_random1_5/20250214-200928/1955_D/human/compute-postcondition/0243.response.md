Output State: **`i` is in the range 0 to `m-1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `i` is now `n - m + len(b) + 1`, and the current value of `a[i]` is in `b_values`; `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than or equal to 0 and has been decremented by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `curr` is incremented by 1. Since `i` was initially set to `n - m + len(b)`, after executing `curr += 1`, `i` becomes `n - m + len(b) + 1`. All other conditions and values remain the same as the initial state.
