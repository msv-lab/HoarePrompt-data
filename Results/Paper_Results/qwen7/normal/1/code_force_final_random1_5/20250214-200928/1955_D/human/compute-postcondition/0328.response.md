Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n - m`, `cnt_b` will be reset to zero for all elements in `b_values`, `curr` will hold the final count as per the loop's logic, and `ans` will be the total count of times `curr` was greater than or equal to `k` during the entire loop execution.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop have completed:
- The variable `i` will be set to `n - m`.
- The list `cnt_b` will be reset to zero for all elements that were previously updated during the loop.
- The variable `curr` will contain the final count reflecting the net effect of all operations performed throughout the loop.
- The variable `ans` will store the cumulative count of how many times `curr` met or exceeded the threshold `k` across all iterations.
