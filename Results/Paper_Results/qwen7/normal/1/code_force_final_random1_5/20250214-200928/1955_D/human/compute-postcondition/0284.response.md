Postcondition: `i` is -1, `n` is known, `m` is known, `len(b)` is known, and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is either `cnt_b[a[i]] - 1` or `cnt_b[a[i]]` (depending on whether `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`), `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decreased by 1 if `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, and `curr` is now equal to `curr + 1` if `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`.
