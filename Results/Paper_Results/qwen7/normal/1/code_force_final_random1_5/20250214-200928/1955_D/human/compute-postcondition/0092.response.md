Output State: **`i` is 2; `n - m` must be at least `m - 1`; `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1; `curr` is decreased by 1; `ans` is increased by 1 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than 0, `curr` becomes 0 and `ans` is increased by 1 if `curr` is still greater than or equal to `k`**.

Explanation: The code decrements `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` by 1. The values of `i`, `n - m`, `cnt_b[a[i]]`, `curr`, and `ans` are updated according to the given conditions. The precondition that `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 when processing `a[i]` is no longer directly relevant since we are now processing `a[i + m]`. All other conditions remain unchanged.
