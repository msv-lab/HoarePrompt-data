Output State: **`x` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the range of the list `a`, the value at index `i` in list `a` is present in the set `b_values`, and `curr` is equal to `curr` + 1.**

The value of `curr` is incremented by 1, while the values of `x`, `a`, `i`, and `b_values` remain unchanged from their initial state.
