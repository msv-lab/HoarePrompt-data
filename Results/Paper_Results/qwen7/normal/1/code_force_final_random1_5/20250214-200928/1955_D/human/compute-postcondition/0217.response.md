Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in b_values`. This means the variable `i` is being iterated over the elements of `b_values`.

2. **Determine the state changes**:
   - `i` is the current element from `b_values` being processed in the loop.
   - Since `i` is the last index of `b_values` at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` would be the first element of `b_values` if it were to continue.

3. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` needs to be set to the first element of `b_values` for the next iteration.
   - The other variables (`n`, `m`, `curr`, `ans`, `cnt_b`, and `b_values`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head and their values are not directly modified within the loop head itself.

Given these points, we can now formulate the new state:

**State: **`i` is the first element of `b_values`, `n` must be greater than `m`, `curr` is the total count of elements in `a` that are present in `b_values` and for which `cnt_b[a[i]]` was non-negative during the loop execution plus the appropriate adjustments based on the presence of `a[i + m]` in `b_values`, `ans` is the final count of times `curr` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop execution, `cnt_b[i]` is 0, and `b_values` remains unchanged.**
