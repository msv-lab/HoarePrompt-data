Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than `m`, `curr` is the total count of elements in `a` that are present in `b_values` and for which `cnt_b[a[i]]` was non-negative during the loop execution plus 1, `ans` is 1, and `b_values` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The line `cnt_b[a[i]] += 1` increments the count of `a[i]` in the dictionary `cnt_b`. Since `a[i]` is present in `b_values`, the precondition that `curr` is the total count of elements in `a` that are present in `b_values` and for which `cnt_b[a[i]]` was non-negative during the loop execution remains valid, but now `curr` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
