Output State: **`cnt_b[b[i]]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `cnt_b[b[i]] += 1` increments the count of `b[i]` in the dictionary `cnt_b`. Since the initial state does not provide specific values for `cnt_b`, `b`, or `i`, the only change is that the count of the element `b[i]` in the dictionary `cnt_b` is increased by 1.
