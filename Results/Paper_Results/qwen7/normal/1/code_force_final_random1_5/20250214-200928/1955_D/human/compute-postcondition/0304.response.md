Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is known, `m` is known, `len(b)` is known, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is `cnt_b[a[i]] + 1`, `a[i + m]` is either in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decreased by 1, or `a[i + m]` is not in `b_values` and the other conditions remain unchanged, `curr` is now equal to `curr - 1` if `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, and `ans` is increased by 1 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`.**

Explanation: The code `cnt_b[a[i]] += 1` increments the count of `a[i]` in the dictionary `cnt_b` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
