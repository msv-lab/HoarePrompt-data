Output State: **`i` is 2; `m` is a positive integer; `a` is a list of integers; `b_values` is a set of values; `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `cnt_b[a[i]] -= 1` decrements the count of `a[i]` in the dictionary `cnt_b`. Given that `i` is 2, `a[i]` refers to the element at index 2 of the list `a`. The value of `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decreased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
