Output State: **`i` is 0, `n - m` must be at least `m - 1`, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1, `curr` is initialized to a value, `ans` is initialized.**

Explanation: The code `cnt_b[a[i]] += 1` increments the count of `a[i]` in the dictionary `cnt_b`. Given that `i` is initially 0, `a[i]` refers to `a[0]`. Therefore, `cnt_b[a[0]]` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
