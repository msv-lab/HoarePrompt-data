Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is known, `m` is known, `len(b)` is known, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is either `cnt_b[a[i]] - 1` or remains the same, `a[i + m]` is either in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decreased by 1, or `a[i + m]` is not in `b_values` and the other conditions remain unchanged, `curr` is now equal to `curr - 1` if `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, and `ans` is increased by 1 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`.**

This means that the value of `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` has been decremented by 1. If `a[i + m]` is present in `b_values`, then `curr` is reduced by 1. Additionally, if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k` after this decrement, `ans` is incremented by 1. All other variables retain their previous values or conditions.
