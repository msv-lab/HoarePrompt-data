Output State: **`i` is equal to `m`, `cnt_b[a[m-1]]` is decreased by 1, `curr` is increased by the number of times `a[m-1]` was found in `b_values`, and `ans` is increased by 1.**

This means that the variable `ans` has been incremented by 1, while the other variables (`i`, `cnt_b[a[m-1]]`, and `curr`) have their values updated according to the initial conditions provided.
