Output State: The final state of `dp` will contain values calculated up to `dp[n]` based on the given recurrence relation, with all calculations taken modulo \(1000000007\). Specifically, `dp[i]` for each `i` from 3 to `n` will be computed as \((dp[i-1] + 2 \times (i-1) \times dp[i-2]) \% 1000000007\).

In natural language, after the loop completes all its iterations, the `dp` array will have been filled according to the specified formula for each index from 3 to `n`, ensuring that all intermediate results are taken modulo \(1000000007\) to prevent overflow. The final state of `dp` will reflect the complete sequence of values generated by the loop, starting from the initial conditions provided.
