Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to calculate the number of different final configurations of an \(n \times n\) chessboard after \(k\) moves.
   - The moves are mirrored by the computer, and no two rooks can attack each other (same row or column).
   - The final configurations should consider the positions of rooks and their colors.

2. **Key Points in the Program:**
   - The program uses dynamic programming (`dp`) to store intermediate results.
   - The `dp` array is initialized to -1.
   - The `func_1` function populates the `dp` array using a specific recurrence relation.
   - The main loop reads the input and calculates the number of valid configurations based on the size of the board and the number of moves already made.

3. **Dynamic Programming Initialization:**
   - The `dp` array is initialized with -1, indicating uncomputed values.
   - The `func_1` function sets base cases for `dp[1]` and `dp[2]`.
   - For larger values of `i`, the recurrence relation is used: 
     \[
     dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 \times (i - 1) \times dp[i - 2]) \mod 1000000007
     \]

4. **Main Logic:**
   - For each test case, the program reads \(n\) and \(k\).
   - It then reads \(k\) pairs of coordinates, adding them to a set `invalid` to keep track of occupied rows and columns.
   - The final number of configurations is calculated as `max(1, dp[n - len(invalid)])`.

5. **Recurrence Relation Explanation:**
   - The recurrence relation seems to count the number of ways to place rooks on an \(i \times i\) board without attacking each other.
   - The term `2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]` accounts for placing a rook in a new row or column while ensuring no attacks.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The base cases handle small boards (1x1 and 2x2).
   - The `max(1, ...)` ensures that even if no valid configurations remain, the result is at least 1.

### Verification:
- The program correctly initializes the `dp` array.
- The recurrence relation appears to accurately count the number of valid configurations.
- The main logic correctly handles the input and computes the final result.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
