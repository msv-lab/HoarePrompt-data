The function accepts an integer \( n \) where \( 1 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5 \) and computes a dynamic programming array `dp` of length \( n+1 \). Each element `dp[i]` (for \( 1 \leq i \leq n \)) is calculated using the formula `(dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`. After completing the computation, the function returns nothing, leaving the `dp` array populated with the computed values.
