Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves determining the number of unique final configurations of rooks on an \( n \times n \) chessboard after \( k \) moves, where each move is mirrored by the opponent. The key is to calculate the number of ways to place the remaining rooks without violating the no-attack rule.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: The solution uses dynamic programming to precompute the number of valid configurations for a board of size up to \( n \). The recurrence relation used is:
   \[
   dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 \times (i - 1) \times dp[i - 2]) \mod 1000000007
   \]
   This relation accounts for placing a rook in a new row and column, considering the previously computed configurations.

3. **Function `func_1`**: This function populates the `dp` array based on the recurrence relation. It correctly initializes `dp[1]` and `dp[2]` and then iterates from 3 to \( n \) to compute the values.

4. **Main Logic**: For each test case, the program reads \( n \) and \( k \), and then reads \( k \) moves. These moves are stored in a set to track invalid positions. The number of valid rows and columns left is \( n - |invalid| \). The final answer is obtained from the `dp` array using this value.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases appropriately by ensuring the `dp` array is large enough and by taking the modulo operation to avoid overflow.

Given the above analysis, the annotated program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. The dynamic programming approach and the use of the recurrence relation are accurate, and the main logic correctly calculates the number of valid configurations.

Correctness: **True**
