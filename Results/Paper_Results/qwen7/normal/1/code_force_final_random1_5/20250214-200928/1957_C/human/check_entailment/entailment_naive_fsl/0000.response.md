Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the number of possible final configurations of the chessboard. Specifically, the program uses a dynamic programming approach to precompute the number of configurations for smaller boards and then uses this precomputed value to determine the number of configurations for the given board size `n` after accounting for the invalid positions due to the already placed rooks.

However, the dynamic programming solution used in the `func_1` function is incorrect. The formula `(dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007` is not accurate for calculating the number of configurations for an `n x n` board. This formula seems to be derived from a simpler combinatorial problem and does not account for the constraints of the rooks' placement correctly.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following example:

- For a 4x4 board with no rooks placed yet (`k=0`), the correct number of configurations is `15` (since there are `15` ways to place a single rook on a 4x4 board without attacking another).
- However, the program calculates `dp[4]` using the incorrect formula and prints the result, which is not `15`.

Given the problem's complexity and the need to correctly handle the constraints of rook placements, the provided solution does not meet the requirements. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
