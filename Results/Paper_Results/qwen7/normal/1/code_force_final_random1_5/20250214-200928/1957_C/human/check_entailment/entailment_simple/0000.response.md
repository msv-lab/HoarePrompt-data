Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves determining the number of possible final configurations of an \( n \times n \) chessboard after \( k \) moves, where each move places a rook, and the computer mirrors the move unless the move is along the diagonal. The configurations are counted modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code initializes a dynamic programming (DP) array `dp` to store the number of configurations for a board of size \( i \).
   - The function `func_1` populates this DP array using a specific recurrence relation.
   - The main loop reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the board size \( n \) and the number of moves \( k \). It also tracks invalid positions (positions where rooks are placed) using a set.
   - Finally, it prints the result using the precomputed DP array, adjusted for the number of invalid positions.

3. **Key Points**:
   - The recurrence relation used in `func_1` correctly computes the number of configurations for a board of size \( i \) based on smaller board sizes.
   - The logic for handling invalid positions (positions where rooks are placed) is correct.
   - The use of modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) ensures the result fits within standard integer limits.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the base cases \( dp[1] = 1 \) and \( dp[2] = 3 \) correctly.
   - The computation of `dp[i]` for larger \( i \) is done correctly using the recurrence relation.
   - The handling of invalid positions is straightforward and ensures that the count of configurations is accurate.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The code accurately implements the solution to the problem as described.
   - All logical steps and edge cases are handled correctly.

Correctness: **True**
