Postcondition: **`i` is 4, `t` must be greater than 4, `s` is a new input string with a length of at least 4, `flag` is True, `j` is equal to the length of `s`, `count` is 2.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the execution of the if statement, considering that the `flag` is True and thus the if part is executed. The values of `i`, `t`, `s`, `flag`, and `j` remain as specified, while `count` is decremented to 2.
