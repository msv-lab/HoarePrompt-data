Postcondition: `odd` has at least one element, the first element of `odd` (denoted as `gap`) is greater than `y` which is currently less than half of `gap`, and `ans` is increased by 2 * `y`, `y` is set to 0, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. If `y` is not less than half of `gap`, then no changes are made to `ans` and `y`.
