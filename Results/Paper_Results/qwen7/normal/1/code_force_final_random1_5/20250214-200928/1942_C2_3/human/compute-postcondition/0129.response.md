Output State: **`i` is 3, `tmp` is a list containing one element which is `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2`.**

Explanation: The code appends to `tmp` a tuple that is the result of `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`. Given that `i` is initially 2, after executing the code, `i` is incremented to 3. The value appended to `tmp` is `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2`. The initial state that `i` must be less than `len(a)` remains valid, but now `i` is 3, so it must be less than `len(a)`.
