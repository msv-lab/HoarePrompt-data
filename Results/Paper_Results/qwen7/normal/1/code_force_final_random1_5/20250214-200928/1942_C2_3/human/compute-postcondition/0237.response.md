Postcondition: `even` is a sorted list in ascending order with the first element removed, `ans` is increased by either `4 * y + first_gap` or `2 * y + first_gap`, `y` is decreased by `first_gap // 2`, and `y` is 0 or less than `first_gap // 2`. If `y` is less than `gap // 2`, `ans` is increased by `4 * y + first_gap` and `y` is decreased by `first_gap // 2`. If `y` is not less than `gap // 2`, `ans` is increased by `2 * y + first_gap` and `y` is decreased by `first_gap // 2`.
