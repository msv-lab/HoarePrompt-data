Postcondition: `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is equal to `len(a) - 2`, `tmp` is a list containing one element which is `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2`, `ans` is the sum of 1 for each pair of consecutive elements in `a` that differ by exactly 2, plus 1, and the sum of `(a[j+1] - a[j]) // 2` for each pair of consecutive elements in `a` that satisfy the condition `(a[j+1] - a[j]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[j+1] - a[j]) // 2 - 1`, without the total decrement of `y` which is the sum of `((a[j+1] - a[j]) // 2 - 1)` for each such pair, and the current value of `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is even and greater than `y - (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 + 1`. If the condition `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1` is true, then `y` is decreased by `((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1)`.
