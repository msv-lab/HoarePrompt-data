Output State: **`i` is `x + 1`, `ans` is `x`, `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `odd` is either `[gap]` or an empty list, `even` is either `[gap]` or an empty list, `gap` is equal to `gap - (next_elem - a[i] - 1)`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `next_elem`. If `i` is equal to `x - 1`, then `next_elem` is set to `a[0] + n`. Otherwise, `next_elem` remains as `a[i + 1]`. All other variables (`i`, `ans`, `t1`, `t2`, `odd`, `even`, `gap`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
