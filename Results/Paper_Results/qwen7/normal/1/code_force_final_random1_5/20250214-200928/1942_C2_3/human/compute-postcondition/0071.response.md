Postcondition: `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, `tmp` is a list containing one element which is the integer `(a[1] - a[0]) // 2`, and the value of `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus `(a[1] - a[0]) // 2`, provided that the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is even and the current value of `y` is greater than the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` divided by 2 minus 2. If the condition `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1` is not met, the values of `a`, `i`, `tmp`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
