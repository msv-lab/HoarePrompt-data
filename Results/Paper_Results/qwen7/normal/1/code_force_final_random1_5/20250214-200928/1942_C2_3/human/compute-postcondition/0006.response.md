Output State: **`tt` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, `ii` is 0, `n` is the first integer entered, `x` is the second integer entered, `y` is the third integer entered, `a` is a list of three integers sorted in ascending order `[min(n, x, y), middle_value(n, x, y), max(n, x, y)]`, `ans` is `x + y - 2`, `tmp` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list `tmp`. None of the other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
