Output State: **`even` list is empty, `ans` is the sum of all elements in the original `even` list minus half of each element (integer division), `y` is equal to the negative of the last element in the original `even` list divided by 2 (integer division), `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code reads three integers from input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `x`, and `y`. The initial state of the `even` list being empty, the value of `ans`, and the value of `y` remain unchanged in terms of their definitions but now `n`, `x`, and `y` have specific input values.
