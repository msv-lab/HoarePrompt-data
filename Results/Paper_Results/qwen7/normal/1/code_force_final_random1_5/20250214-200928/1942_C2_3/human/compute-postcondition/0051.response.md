Postcondition: `a` is a list of integers, `ans` is equal to 1 if the sum of the first element (`a[0]`) and `n` minus the last element (`a[len(a) - 1]`) equals 2. Otherwise, `ans` is increased by `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` if `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1])` is even and `y` is greater than the half of the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` minus 2. If the condition is not met, the values of `a` and `ans` remain unchanged.
