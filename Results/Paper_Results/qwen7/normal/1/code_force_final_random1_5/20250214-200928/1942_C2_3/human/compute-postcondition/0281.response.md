Postcondition: **`i` is `x`, `ans` is `x`, `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `odd` is an empty list, `even` is a list containing `gap`, `x` must be greater than 0, the gap is even and greater than 0, and the gap is less than or equal to 1 or gap is even.**

This postcondition summarizes that after the execution of the if-else block, `i` remains `x`, `ans` remains `x`, `t1` and `t2` remain as `(a[x-1] + 1) % n` and `(a[x-1] + 2) % n` respectively, `next_elem` remains `a[0] + n`, `odd` remains an empty list, `even` contains the value of `gap`, `x` remains greater than 0, and the `gap` is even and either less than or equal to 1 or even and greater than 0.
