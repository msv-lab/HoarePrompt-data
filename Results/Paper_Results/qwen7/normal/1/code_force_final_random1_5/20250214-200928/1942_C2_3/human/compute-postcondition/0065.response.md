Postcondition: `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, and the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is not equal to 2. The difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is even, and the current value of `y` is greater than the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` divided by 2 minus 1.
