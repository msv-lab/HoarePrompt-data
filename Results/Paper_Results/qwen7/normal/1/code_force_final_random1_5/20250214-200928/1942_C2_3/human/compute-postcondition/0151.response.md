Output State: **`i` is equal to `len(a) - 1` - 1, `tmp` is a list containing elements that are half of the differences between consecutive elements of `a` where those differences are even and greater than 2, and `ans` is the sum of these half differences plus the count of times the difference between consecutive elements was exactly 2; `tmp` is appended with the value \((a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2\), and the condition `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is not equal to 2, and the current value of `y` is greater than `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`; `y` is decreased by \((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1` and `ans` is increased by \((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2**.

This means that the value of `y` has been decreased by \((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1\) and the value of `ans` has been increased by \((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2\). All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
