Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 3, `tmp` is [a[1], (a[2] - a[1]) // 2], `ans` is incremented by (a[3] - a[2]) // 2, `y` is decreased by ((a[3] - a[2]) // 2 - 1)**.

Explanation: The initial state includes `a` being a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` being 3, `tmp` containing `[a[1], (a[2] - a[1]) // 2]`, and `ans` being incremented by `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2`. The code snippet modifies `y` by subtracting `((a[3] - a[2]) // 2 - 1)`. Since `a` is sorted, `a[3] - a[2]` is a positive integer, and its division by 2 results in an integer. Thus, `y` is updated accordingly.
