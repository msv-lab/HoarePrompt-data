Output State: **`i` is `x`, `ans` is `x`, `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`, and both `t1` and `t2` are in set `st`; `odd` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `odd`. Since no elements are added to the list `odd`, it remains empty. All other variables (`i`, `ans`, `t1`, `t2`, `st`) retain their initial states as described in the initial state.
