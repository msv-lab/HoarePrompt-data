Output State: **`i` is the first element of `val`, `x` is greater than or equal to 3, `c` is `i // 2`, `y` is `-1 - (i // 2)`, `sx` is `-4 + i**.

Explanation: The code `y -= c` subtracts the value of `c` from `y`. Given that `c` is `i // 2`, `y` is updated to `-1 - (i // 2)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
