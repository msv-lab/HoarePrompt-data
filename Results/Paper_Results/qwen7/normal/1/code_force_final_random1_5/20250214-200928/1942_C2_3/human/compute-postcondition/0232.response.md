Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `gap`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in the list `even`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `even` is a sorted list in ascending order with the first element removed.
   - `ans` is increased by `2 * y + gap`.
   - `y` is decreased by `gap // 2`.
   - `y` is less than `gap // 2`.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over the elements of `even`, the next value of `gap` will be the current first element of `even`.
   - After removing the first element from `even`, the new `even` list will have one less element.
   - `ans` will be updated based on the new `gap` value.
   - `y` will be updated based on the new `gap` value.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `even`: Remove the first element (let's call it `first_gap`).
   - `ans`: Increase by `2 * y + first_gap`.
   - `y`: Decrease by `first_gap // 2`.
   - Ensure `y` is still less than `first_gap // 2`.

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`even` is a sorted list in ascending order with the first element removed, `ans` is increased by `2 * y + first_gap`, `y` is decreased by `first_gap // 2`, `y` is less than `first_gap // 2`**.

Where `first_gap` is the first element of the original `even` list before the removal.
