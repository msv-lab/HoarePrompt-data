Postcondition: `odd` is a list with at least one element, the first element of `odd` (denoted as `gap`) is the next element in the list and satisfies the condition `gap > y - gap // 2`, `ans` is increased by either `2 * y` or `gap`, `y` is decreased by `gap // 2`, and `y` is 0, leading to breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement.
