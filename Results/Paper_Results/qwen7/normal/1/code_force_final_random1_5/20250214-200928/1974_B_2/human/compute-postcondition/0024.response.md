Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `char` is the next character in `s`, `unique_chars` is a list containing unique characters from `s` with the character `char` inserted at index `i`, `j` is increased by 1, `i` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. All other variables (`s`, `char`, `unique_chars`, and `j`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
