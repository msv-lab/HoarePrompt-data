Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is 0, `j` is len(`unique_chars`) - 1
Code of the loop:
for char in s:
    if char in unique_chars:
        s = s.replace(char, unique_chars[j])
        j -= 1
    else:
        unique_chars.insert(i, char)
        i += 1
        j += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `s` is a non-empty string. If `char` is found in `unique_chars`, then `char` in `s` is replaced by `unique_chars[j-1]`. If `char` is not in `unique_chars`, then `char` is added to `unique_chars` at index `i+1` and `j` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `s` is a non-empty string, `char` is the next character in `s`, and `unique_chars` is a list containing unique characters from `s`. If `char` is found in `unique_chars`, `char` is replaced by `unique_chars[j]` in `s`, `j` is decreased by 1, and `i` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `j` is increased by 1, `unique_chars` is updated to include `char`, and `i` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `s` is a modified version of the original string. If `char` is already in `unique_chars`, every occurrence of `char` in `s` is replaced with `unique_chars[j]`, `char` becomes the next character in the modified `s`, `unique_chars` contains unique characters from the modified `s`, `j` is decreased by 1, and `i` is increased by 1. If `char` is not in `unique_chars`, `s` remains unchanged except that `char` is the next character in `s`, `unique_chars` contains unique characters from `s` with `char` inserted at index `i`, `j` is increased by 1, and `i` is increased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
