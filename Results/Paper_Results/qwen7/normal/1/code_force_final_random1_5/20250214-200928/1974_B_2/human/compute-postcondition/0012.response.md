Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `s` is a non-empty string.
- If `char` is found in `unique_chars`, then `char` in `s` is replaced by `unique_chars[j-1]`.
- If `char` is not in `unique_chars`, then `char` is added to `unique_chars` at index `i+1` and `j` is increased by 1.

### Loop Head:
```
for char in s:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over each character `char` in the string `s`.
- The loop head includes the variable `char` from the string `s`.

### Adjusting the States:
- Since the loop is iterating over each character in `s`, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `char`.
- The variables `unique_chars`, `i`, and `j` are not directly controlled by the loop head, so they remain unchanged for the purpose of adjusting the state for the next iteration.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **Identify the current state of `char`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `char` was the current character being processed in the string `s`.

2. **Determine the next character in `s`:**
   - The next character in `s` will be the one that was not processed in the previous iteration.

3. **Adjust the state:**
   - The state of `char` needs to be updated to the next character in `s`.

### Final State:
- `char` is now the next character in `s`.

### Updated State:
State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `char` is the next character in `s`**
