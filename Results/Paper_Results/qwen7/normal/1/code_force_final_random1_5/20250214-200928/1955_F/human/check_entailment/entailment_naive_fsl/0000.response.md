Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program attempts to calculate the maximum number of times Bob can win by removing numbers from the sequence. However, the logic used in the program is flawed.

Let's consider the following test case:
```
3 1 1 0
```
- Initial sequence: [1, 1, 1, 2, 3]
- According to the problem description, we need to maximize the number of times Bob wins by ensuring the XOR of the remaining sequence is zero.

The program's logic:
1. It maps each element to its parity (even or odd).
2. It sums the elements and checks conditions to determine the result.

However, this approach does not correctly handle the logic of removing numbers to achieve the desired XOR value. For the given test case, the correct output should be 2, because by removing two ones, the sequence becomes [2, 3], and the XOR of [2, 3] is 1, which means Alice would win. By removing one one and one three, the sequence becomes [1, 2], and the XOR of [1, 2] is 3, which means Bob would win. Therefore, Bob can win twice by removing two ones and one three.

The provided program does not account for this complexity and thus fails to produce the correct output for various test cases.
