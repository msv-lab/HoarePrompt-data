The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by a positive integer \( t \) and a list \( p \) containing four integers representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the initial sequence. For each test case, it calculates and prints the sum of half the total count of elements in the initial sequence plus one if exactly three of the first three elements in \( p \) are odd, otherwise zero. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value.
