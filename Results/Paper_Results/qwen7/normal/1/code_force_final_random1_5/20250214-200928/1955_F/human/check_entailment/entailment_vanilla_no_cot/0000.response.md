Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Bob's Wins:**
   - The program attempts to calculate the number of wins for Bob using the expression `(sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2`. 
   - This logic is flawed because it incorrectly calculates the number of times Bob can win.
   - Specifically, the condition `sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3` checks if all the first three numbers (p[0], p[1], p[2]) are odd. However, this does not necessarily determine the optimal strategy for Bob to maximize his wins.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - To determine the maximum number of times Bob can win, we need to consider the parity (odd/even nature) of the counts of the numbers.
   - If the total count of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s is even, Bob can win at least once by removing a number that makes the XOR of the remaining numbers zero.
   - For each subsequent removal, Bob should aim to maintain the parity of the counts to ensure he can still achieve a zero XOR in the end.

3. **Correct Approach:**
   - We need to count the total number of elements (i.e., the sum of p).
   - If the total number of elements is even, Bob can win at least once.
   - For each subsequent removal, Bob should remove numbers in such a way that the parity of the counts is maintained to ensure he can still achieve a zero XOR in the end.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        total_elements = sum(p)
        # If the total number of elements is even, Bob can win at least once
        if total_elements % 2 == 0:
            print(total_elements // 2)
        else:
            # If the total number of elements is odd, Bob can win at most (total_elements - 1) // 2 times
            print((total_elements - 1) // 2)

func()
```

This corrected program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win based on the given constraints.
