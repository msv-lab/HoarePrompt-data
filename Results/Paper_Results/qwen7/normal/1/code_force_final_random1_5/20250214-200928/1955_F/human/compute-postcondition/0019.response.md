Output State: **`a` is a list of integers from input, `cnt` is 0**.

Explanation: The line `cnt = 0` sets the variable `cnt` to 0. The initial state of `a` as a list of integers where the first three elements are equal and each is an odd integer is no longer relevant since `a` is updated to a list of integers from input. The value of `cnt` is explicitly set to 0, overriding its previous calculation based on the elements of `a`.
