You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))
        print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, p_i is a list of four non-negative integers representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the initial sequence, respectively, such that 0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))
        
        print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)
        
    #State: t is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `p` is a list of integers where each element is the nearest even number to the corresponding input integer, and the loop has executed for all provided test cases.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program attempts to calculate the maximum number of times Bob can win by removing numbers from the sequence. However, the logic used in the program is flawed.

Let's consider the following test case:
```
3 1 1 0
```
- Initial sequence: [1, 1, 1, 2, 3]
- According to the problem description, we need to maximize the number of times Bob wins by ensuring the XOR of the remaining sequence is zero.

The program's logic:
1. It maps each element to its parity (even or odd).
2. It sums the elements and checks conditions to determine the result.

However, this approach does not correctly handle the logic of removing numbers to achieve the desired XOR value. For the given test case, the correct output should be 2, because by removing two ones, the sequence becomes [2, 3], and the XOR of [2, 3] is 1, which means Alice would win. By removing one one and one three, the sequence becomes [1, 2], and the XOR of [1, 2] is 3, which means Bob would win. Therefore, Bob can win twice by removing two ones and one three.

The provided program does not account for this complexity and thus fails to produce the correct output for various test cases.
