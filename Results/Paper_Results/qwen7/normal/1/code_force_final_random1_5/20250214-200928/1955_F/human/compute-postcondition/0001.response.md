Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `p` is a list of integers where each element is the nearest even number to the corresponding input integer.**

Explanation: The code takes a list of integers as input from the user, splits the input string into individual elements, and then applies a lambda function to each element. The lambda function subtracts the remainder when divided by 2 from the integer, effectively rounding it down to the nearest even number. The resulting list of integers is stored in the variable `p`. The initial value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not used in the code.
