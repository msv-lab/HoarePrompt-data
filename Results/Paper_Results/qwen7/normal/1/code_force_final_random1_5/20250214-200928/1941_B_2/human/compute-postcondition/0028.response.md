Output: **NO**

Explanation: According to the initial state, `i` is set to 4. The variable `opNum` is assigned the value of `a[3]`. The subsequent elements `a[1]`, `a[2]`, `a[3]`, `a[4]`, and `a[5]` are updated based on `opNum`, but since the print statement does not reference any of these variables, it simply prints the string 'NO'.
