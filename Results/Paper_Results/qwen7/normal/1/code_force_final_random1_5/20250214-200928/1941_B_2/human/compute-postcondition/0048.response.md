Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `n - 3`
- `opNum` is equal to `a[n - 3]`
- `a[n - 2]` is decreased by `2 * opNum`
- `a[n - 1]` is decreased by `opNum`
- `stop` is `True`
- `a[len(a) - 1]` is `0`
- `a[len(a) - 2]` is `0`

The `print('YES')` statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
