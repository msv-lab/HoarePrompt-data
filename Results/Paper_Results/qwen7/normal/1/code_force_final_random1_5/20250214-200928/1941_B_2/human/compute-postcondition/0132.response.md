Output State: **`stop` is `True`, `opNum` is `a[i]`, `a[i]` is `a[i] - 2 * opNum`, `a[i + 1]` is `a[i + 1] - 3 * opNum - 2 * opNum`, `a[i + 2]` is `a[i + 2] - 2 * opNum`, `i` is `i + 1`, and `_` is `0`.**

Explanation: The code `a[i + 1] -= 2 * opNum` subtracts `2 * opNum` from `a[i + 1]`. Given that `opNum` is `a[i]`, the updated value of `a[i + 1]` becomes `a[i + 1] - 3 * opNum - 2 * opNum` (since `a[i + 1]` was already `-3 * opNum` before this line). All other variables remain unchanged.
