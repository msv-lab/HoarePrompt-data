Output State: **`stop` is `True`, `opNum` is `a[i]`, `a[i]` is `a[i] - 2 * opNum`, `a[i + 1]` is `a[i + 1] - 3 * opNum`, `a[i + 2]` is `a[i + 2] - 2 * opNum`, `i` is `i + 1`, and `_` is `0`**.

Explanation: The code sets `stop` to `True`, which does not change its value but confirms its state. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state, including the expressions involving `a[i]`, `a[i + 1]`, `a[i + 2]`, and `i`. The variable `_` remains `0`.
