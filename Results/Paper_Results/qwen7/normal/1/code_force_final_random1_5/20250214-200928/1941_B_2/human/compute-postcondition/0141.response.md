Based on the initial state provided:

- `stop` is `True`
- `opNum` is `a[i]`
- `a[i]` is updated to `a[i] - (i+1) * opNum`
- `a[i+1]` is updated to `a[i+1] - (i+1) * opNum - (i) * opNum`
- `a[i+2]` is updated to `a[i+2] - (i+1) * opNum`
- `i` is incremented by 1 (`i = i + 1`)
- `a[len(a) - 1]` is not `0` or `a[len(a) - 2]` is not `0`
- `_` is `0`

The print statement is:
```python
print('NO')
```

This print statement directly outputs the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
