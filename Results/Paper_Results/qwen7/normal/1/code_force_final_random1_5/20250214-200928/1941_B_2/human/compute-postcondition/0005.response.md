Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting an input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer.
- The first element of `b` is an odd number.
- The second element of `b` is not equal to the first element plus 2.
- The last element of `b` is an odd number.
- The second last element of `b` is not equal to the last element plus 2.

The print statement is simply `print('NO')`.

Given this information, the print statement will output the string `'NO'` regardless of the values of `t`, `a`, and `b`.

Output: **NO**
