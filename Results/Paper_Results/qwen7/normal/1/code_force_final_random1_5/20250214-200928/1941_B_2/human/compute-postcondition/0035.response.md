Output State: **`i` is 4; `opNum` is equal to `a[4]`; `a[i + 1]` is decreased by `2 * opNum`.**

Explanation: The variable `i` is 4, so `a[i]` is `a[4]` and is decreased by `opNum`, which is equal to `a[4]`. The code then decreases `a[i + 1]`, which is `a[5]`, by `2 * opNum`, which is `2 * a[4]`. The states of the other variables are not affected.
