Output State: **`stop` is `True`, `i` is `n - 2`, `opNum` is `a[i] - opNum`**

Explanation: The code `a[i] -= opNum` subtracts `opNum` from `a[i]`. Initially, `opNum` is equal to `a[i]`. After executing the code, `a[i]` becomes `a[i] - opNum`, which simplifies to `a[i] - a[i]` or `0`. However, since the question asks to include the updated values of the variables that have been changed, we keep `opNum` as `a[i] - opNum`. The values of `stop` and `i` remain unchanged.
