Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial value of `i`**: According to the given state, `i` is `n - 1`.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop runs from `0` to `n - 2`. Therefore, the loop will execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `0`.

4. **Check the current value of `i`**: Since `i` is initially `n - 1`, it is not within the range `0` to `n - 2`. For the loop to execute, `i` must be in the range `[0, n-2]`.

5. **Adjust the state**: To make the loop execute, `i` must be set to a value within the range `[0, n-2]`. Given that `i` is currently `n - 1`, we need to reduce its value to be within the valid range.

6. **Consider other relevant variables**: The other variables (`stop`, `opNum`, `a`, and `_`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need adjustment for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `i` is within the range `[0, n-2]`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`stop` is `False`, `opNum` is `0`, `a` is a list of integers split from the input, `a[i]` is the first element of the list, `a[i + 1]` is the second element of the list, `a[i + 2]` is the third element of the list, either the last element of `a` is not `0` or the second last element of `a` is not `0`, and `i` must be in the range `[0, n-2]`, `_` is `0`**.
