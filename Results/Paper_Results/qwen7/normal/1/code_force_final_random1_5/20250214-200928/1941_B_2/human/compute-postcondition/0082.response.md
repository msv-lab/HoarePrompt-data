Output State: **`stop` is `True`, `i` is `n - 2`, `opNum` is `a[i]`, and `a[i]` is equal to itself, `a[i + 1]` is decreased by `2 * opNum`, `a[i + 2]` is decreased by `opNum`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `a[i]` to `opNum`. The value of `stop` remains `True`, `i` remains `n - 2`, and `opNum` is updated to the value of `a[i]`. The values of `a[i + 1]` and `a[i + 2]` are also updated according to the initial conditions given.
