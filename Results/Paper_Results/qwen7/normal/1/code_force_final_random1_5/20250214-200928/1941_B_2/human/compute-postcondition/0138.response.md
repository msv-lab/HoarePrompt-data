Postcondition: **`stop` is `True`, `opNum` is `a[i]`, `a[i]` is `a[i] - (i+1) * opNum`, `a[i+1]` is `a[i+1] - (i+1) * opNum - (i) * opNum`, `a[i+2]` is `a[i+2] - (i+1) * opNum`, `i` is `i + 1`, and `_` is `0`.**

This means that after executing the if statement, `stop` remains `True`, indicating that no negative value was encountered in the array `a`. The operations on `a[i]`, `a[i+1]`, and `a[i+2]` continue to decrement these values based on the value of `opNum`, which is initially `a[i]` and changes with each iteration. The variable `i` increments by `1` after each iteration, and the loop terminates when `i` reaches `n-3`.
