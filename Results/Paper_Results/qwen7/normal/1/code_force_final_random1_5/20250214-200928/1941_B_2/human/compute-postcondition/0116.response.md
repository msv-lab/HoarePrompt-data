Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `stop` is `True`.
   - `opNum` is the value of `a[i]`.
   - `a[i]` is updated to `a[i] - opNum - opNum`, which simplifies to `a[i] - 2 * opNum`.
   - `a[i + 1]` is updated to `a[i + 1] - 2 * opNum`.
   - `a[i + 2]` is updated to `a[i + 2] - opNum`.
   - `a[i + 2]` is explicitly stated as the third element of the list.
   - Either the last element of `a` is not `0` or the second last element of `a` is not `0`.
   - `i` is incremented by `1` (i.e., `i = i + 1`).
   - `_` is `0`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement simply outputs `'NO'`.

Given the above information, the print statement will directly output the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
