Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is an input integer, `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `b = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, converts each integer to an integer type using `map(int, ...)` and then converts the map object to a list. The variable `b` now holds this list of integers. The values of `t` and `a` remain unchanged from their initial state.
