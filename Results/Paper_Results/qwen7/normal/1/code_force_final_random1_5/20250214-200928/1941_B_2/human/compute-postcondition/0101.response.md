Output State: **`stop` is `True`, `i` is `n - 1`, `opNum` is `0`, `a` is a list of integers split from the input, `a[i]` is the first element of the list, `a[i + 1]` is the second element of the list, `a[i + 2]` is the third element of the list, either the last element of `a` is not `0` or the second last element of `a` is not `0`, and `_` is `0`.**

Explanation: The code `a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]` takes an input, splits it into elements, and converts each element to an integer, storing the result in the list `a`. The values of `stop`, `i`, `opNum`, `a[i]`, `a[i + 1]`, `a[i + 2]`, and `_` remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition about either the last element of `a` or the second last element of `a` not being `0` remains valid as well.
