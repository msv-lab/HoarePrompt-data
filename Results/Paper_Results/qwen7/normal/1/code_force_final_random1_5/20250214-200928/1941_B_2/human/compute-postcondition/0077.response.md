Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `0` to `n-2`, meaning `i` must be less than `n-2`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `stop` is `True`
   - `i` is `n - 3`
   - `opNum` is `a[i] - opNum`
   - `a[i + 1]` is decreased by `2 * opNum`
   - `a[i + 2]` is decreased by `opNum`

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop runs from `0` to `n-2`, if `i` is currently `n-3`, the next value of `i` would be `n-2`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n-2`. Since `i` is `n-3`, it is not less than `n-2`, so the loop will not execute again.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `stop` remains `True` because the loop does not execute again.
   - `i` will be `n-2` (the next value of `i` if the loop were to execute).
   - `opNum` remains unchanged as it is not directly modified by the loop.
   - `a[i + 1]` and `a[i + 2]` remain unchanged as they are not directly modified by the loop either.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration (which will not occur) is:

State: **`stop` is `True`, `i` is `n - 2`, `opNum` is `a[i] - opNum`, `a[i + 1]` is decreased by `2 * opNum`, `a[i + 2]` is decreased by `opNum`**
