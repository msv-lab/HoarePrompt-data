Output State: **`stop` is `True`, `i` is equal to `n - 3`, `opNum` is equal to `a[n - 3]`, `a[n - 2]` is decreased by `2 * opNum`, `a[n - 1]` is decreased by `opNum`, and the current value of `a[i]` is less than 0.**

Explanation: The variable `stop` is set to `True`, which changes its state from `False`. All other variables (`i`, `opNum`, `a[n-2]`, `a[n-1]`) retain their previous values and conditions as described in the initial state. The value of `a[i]` (which is `a[n-3]`) remains less than 0.
