Output State: `stop` is `True`, `opNum` is `a[i]`, `a[i]` is `a[i] - (2 * opNum) * (n - 2 - i)`, `a[i + 1]` is `a[i + 1] - (3 * opNum + 2 * opNum) * (n - 2 - i)`, `a[i + 2]` is `a[i + 2] - (3 * opNum) * (n - 2 - i)`, `i` is `i + (n - 2)`, and `_` is `0`.

In this final state, the loop has executed all its iterations, and `stop` is `True` because the condition `a[i] < 0` was met at some point, triggering the break statement. The value of `opNum` remains as the value it had when the loop condition was no longer satisfied. The elements of the list `a` have been modified according to the operations performed within the loop. The index `i` has been incremented by `n - 2`, which means it has moved past the last valid index of the list, assuming `i` started from `n - 1`.
