Output State: **`stop` is `True`, `i` is `n - 2`, `opNum` is `a[i]`, `a[i]` is `a[i] - opNum`, `a[i + 1]` is `a[i + 1] - 2 * opNum`, `a[i + 2]` is `a[i + 2] - opNum`**.

Explanation: The code `a[i] -= opNum` decrements the value of `a[i]` by `opNum`. Since `opNum` is equal to `a[i]` initially, `a[i]` becomes `a[i] - opNum`, which simplifies to `a[i] - a[i]` or `0`. The values of `stop`, `i`, `opNum`, `a[i + 1]`, and `a[i + 2]` remain unchanged.
