Output State: **`stop` is `True`, `i` is equal to `n - 3`, `opNum` is equal to `a[i]`, and the value of `a[i]` is less than 0.**

The code `opNum = a[i]` assigns the value of `a[i]` to `opNum`. Since `i` is equal to `n - 3` and the value of `a[i]` is less than 0, `opNum` now holds the same value as `a[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
