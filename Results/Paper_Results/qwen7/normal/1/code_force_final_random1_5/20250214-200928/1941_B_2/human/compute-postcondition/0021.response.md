Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an input integer, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the new input string split on spaces and converted to integers, the number of iterations left is `int(input()) - 2`, and `a` is updated to the new input integer. This holds true whether the condition `b[0] % 2 == 1 and b[1] != b[0] + 2 or (b[-1] % 2 == 1 and b[-2] != b[-1] + 2)` is met or not.**
