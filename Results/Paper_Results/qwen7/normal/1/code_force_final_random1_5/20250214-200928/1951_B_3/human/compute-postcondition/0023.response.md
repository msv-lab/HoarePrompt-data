Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head includes the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Behavior**:
   - `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration.
   - `n` remains the same throughout the loop.
   - `ind` and `c` retain their current values unless `a[i] > x`, in which case `ind` is set to `i + 1` and `c` is incremented by 1.

3. **Determine the Current State**:
   - We need to know the initial state at the start of the previous iteration.
   - From the postcondition, we know that `i` is incremented by 1, `n` remains the same, and `ind` and `c` retain their current values unless `a[i] > x`.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1, the new value of `i` will be the old value of `i` plus 1.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `ind` and `c` retain their current values unless `a[i] > x`, but since we are looking at the state before the condition is checked, we assume they retain their current values.

Given this information, let's formulate the new state:

- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `n` remains the same.
- `ind` and `c` retain their current values.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is incremented by 1 (so if the previous `i` was `k`, now `i` is `k+1`), `n` remains the same, and `ind` and `c` retain their current values.**
