Output: **[index_of_first_element, index_of_second_element]** (where `index_of_first_element` and `index_of_second_element` are the indices of the first two elements in `a` that are greater than `x`)

Explanation:
- `ind` is a list containing the indices of the first two elements in `a` that are greater than `x`.
- `c` is equal to 2, but this variable is not used in the `print(ind)` statement.
- `i` is equal to the index of the second element in `ind` + 1, but this variable is also not used in the `print(ind)` statement.
- `k` is equal to 14, but it is not used in the `print(ind)` statement either.

Therefore, the `print(ind)` statement will simply print the list `ind`, which contains the indices of the first two elements in `a` that are greater than `x`.
