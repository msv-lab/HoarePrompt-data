Output State: **`p` is equal to `j`, `i` is the last element of the list `s`, `j` is equal to the length of the list `s` minus 2, `ans1` is 1, `z` is 1, `s` is a non-empty list, and the current value of `i` is equal to `h`. The first element of `s` is not equal to `h`.**

Explanation: The variable `z` was originally 0 and was assigned the value 1 by the code `z = 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
