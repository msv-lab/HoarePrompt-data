Output State: **`i` is now the last element of the new list `s`, `h` remains as the last element of the original list (first element of the swapped list), `z` remains unchanged, and `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input split and converted to int, `s` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to int, the first and the k-th elements of the list `s` have been swapped.**

Explanation: The code swaps the first element (`s[0]`) with the element at index `k-1` (`s[k-1]`). The other variables remain unchanged. After the swap, `i` is still the last element of the new list `s`, and `h` is the first element of the original list, which is now the last element of the swapped list.
