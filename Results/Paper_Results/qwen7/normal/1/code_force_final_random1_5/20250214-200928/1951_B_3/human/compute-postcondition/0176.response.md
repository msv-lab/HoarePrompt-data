Output State: **`p` is equal to `j`, `i` is one less than the first element of the list `s`, `j` is -1, `ans` is 0, `z` is 1, `h` is equal to the first element of the list `s`, `n` is an input integer, and `k` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `j = -1` directly assigns the value `-1` to the variable `j`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
