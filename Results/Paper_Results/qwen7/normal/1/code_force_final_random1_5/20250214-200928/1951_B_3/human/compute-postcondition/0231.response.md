Postcondition: **`p` is equal to `j`, which is the length of the list `s` minus one; `ans` is the count of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h`; `z` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether the condition `i > h` is true or false; `i` will be the next element in the list `s`; if `s[0] != h`, then `ans1` is incremented by 1.**
