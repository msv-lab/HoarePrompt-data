Output State: **`p` is equal to `j`, which is the length of the list `s` minus one; `ans` is the count of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h`; `z` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether the condition `i > h` is true or false; `i` is the next element in the list `s`; `ans1` is equal to `ans1 + 1`.**

Explanation: The line `ans1 += 1` increments the value of `ans1` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states. Therefore, `p` is still equal to `j`, which is the length of the list `s` minus one. `ans` remains the count of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h`. `z` remains either 0 or 1 depending on whether the condition `i > h` is true or false. `i` is still the next element in the list `s`. `ans1` is now one more than its previous value.
