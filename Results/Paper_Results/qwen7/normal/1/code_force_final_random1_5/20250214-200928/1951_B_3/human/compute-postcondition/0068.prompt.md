You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of n distinct integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of n cows, and k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n.

    ind = []
    c = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] > x:

        if (ind[0] == 0) :
            return k - 1
            #The program returns a value which is k - 1, given that k is not equal to 14 and the length of ind is 1 with ind[0] being 0.
        #State: Postcondition: `ind` is a list containing indices of the first two elements in `a` that are greater than `x`, `c` is equal to 2, and `i` is equal to the index of the second element in `ind` + 1, and if `k` is not equal to 14, then `k` takes on a new value, and the length of `ind` is 1, and `ind[0]` is not equal to 0.

    if (k > ind[1]) :

    return max(ind[0] - 1, k - ind[0])
    #The program returns the maximum value between (ind[0] - 1) and (k - ind[0])
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `a`, which is a list of n distinct integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of n cows. It returns -1 if no conditions are met. Otherwise, it returns a value based on specific conditions involving the list `a`, the integer `k`, and a list `ind` containing indices of certain elements in `a`.

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns -1

Case_2: The program returns a value which is k - 1, given that k is not equal to 14 and the length of ind is 1 with ind[0] being 0.

Case_3: The program returns the value of `ind[0]` minus 1, given that `ind` is a list containing indices of the first two elements in `a` that are greater than `x`, and `ind[0]` is greater than `k`.

Case_4: The program returns the maximum value between k - ind[0] and ind[0] - 1, given that ind[0] is less than or equal to k.

Case_5: The program returns the minimum value between the index of the second element in `ind` minus 1 and 13 (since `k` is not equal to 14, we use 13 as its value for calculation)

Case_6: The program returns the maximum value between ind[0] - 1 and ind[1] - ind[0], given that ind[0] is not equal to 0.

Case_7: The program returns the maximum value between (ind[0] - 1) and (k - ind[0])
