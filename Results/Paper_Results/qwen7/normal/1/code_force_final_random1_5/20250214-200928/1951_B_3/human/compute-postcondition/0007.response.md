Output State: **`ind` is a list containing the integer `i`, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= n`, `x` is the `k`-th element of list `a`, `c` is 1, and the current value of `i` is such that `a[i] > x`.**

Explanation: The code `c += 1` increments the value of `c` by 1. Initially, `c` was set to 0. After executing this line, `c` becomes 1. All other variables (`ind`, `a`, `k`, `x`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
