Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a list of test cases, where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), two integers n and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n), and a list a containing n distinct integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). For each test case, it returns information based on the values of t, n, k, and the list a.**
