Output State: **`i` is the third element of the list `s`, `j` is increased by 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block specified, the `break` statement does not change the values of `i` or `j`. It simply indicates that the program would exit the current loop or conditional block if one existed. Therefore, the values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged from their initial states, and the `break` statement is noted as having been executed.
