Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Logic in `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to find the maximum number of wins for the cow at position `k`. However, its logic is flawed.
   - The function should consider the possibility of swapping the cow at position `k` with another cow to maximize the number of wins.
   - The current implementation only checks a few conditions and does not explore all possible swaps optimally.

2. **Incomplete Swap Consideration**:
   - The function does not properly handle the scenario where swapping the cow at position `k` with another cow could result in more wins.
   - It only checks a few specific positions and does not consider all possible swaps.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled Properly**:
   - The function does not handle edge cases where the cow at position `k` might be the highest-rated cow or the lowest-rated cow.
   - It does not consider the possibility of the cow being in a position where it can win more matches by swapping with another cow.

### Correct Solution:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the following steps:

1. Identify the cow with the highest rating (`max_rating`) and its position (`max_pos`).
2. Check if the cow at position `k` can win the first match by swapping with the cow at position `1`.
3. Determine the number of consecutive wins the cow at position `k` can achieve without any swaps.
4. Determine the number of consecutive wins the cow at position `k` can achieve by swapping with the cow at position `1`.

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    k -= 1
    max_rating = max(l)
    max_pos = l.index(max_rating) + 1

    # Case 1: Do not swap
    wins_without_swap = 0
    for i in range(k + 1, n):
        if l[i] > l[k]:
            break
        wins_without_swap += 1

    # Case 2: Swap with the cow at position 1
    wins_with_swap = 0
    if l[0] < l[k]:
        wins_with_swap += 1
        for i in range(2, n):
            if l[i] > l[k]:
                break
            wins_with_swap += 1

    # Determine the maximum wins
    max_wins = max(wins_without_swap, wins_with_swap)
    print(max_wins)
```

This solution correctly handles all the necessary cases and provides the optimal number of wins for the cow at position `k`.
