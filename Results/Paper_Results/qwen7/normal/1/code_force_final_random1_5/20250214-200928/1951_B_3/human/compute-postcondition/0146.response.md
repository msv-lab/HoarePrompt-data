Output State: **`p` is equal to `j`, `i` is the second-to-last element of the list `s`, `j` is equal to the length of the list `s` minus 1, `ans1` is 2, `z` is 1, `s` is a non-empty list**

Explanation: The code `ans1 += 1` increments the value of `ans1` by 1. Initially, `ans1` is 1, so after executing this line, `ans1` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
