Reasoning:
1. The problem requires moving chips to form a single block with the minimum number of operations.
2. The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem. Specifically, the logic for counting the minimum number of operations is flawed.
3. The current implementation counts the number of zeros between the first and last '1' in the string representation of the array. This approach does not account for the optimal way to move chips to form a single block.
4. The solution does not handle the movement of chips to the closest free cell to the left, which is a key part of the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**

A correct solution would involve identifying the positions of all chips, calculating the distance each chip needs to move to the nearest position in the target block, and summing these distances.
