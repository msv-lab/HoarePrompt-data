Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t < 1000, `n` is the integer input by the user, `arr` is the string obtained by joining the input string split by spaces, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`, `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr[::-1]`, `z` is a substring of `arr` starting from index `x` and ending just before the index `n - y`, `_` is 1, `x` is updated to the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`, `n` is an integer input by the user.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input(''))` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `x` is updated to the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`, but since the code does not execute until an input is given, the exact value of `x` cannot be determined without knowing the input string `arr`.
