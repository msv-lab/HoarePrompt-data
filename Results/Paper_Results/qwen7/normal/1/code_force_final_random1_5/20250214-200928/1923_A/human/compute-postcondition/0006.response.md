Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a string created by joining the input string split by spaces, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`, `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in `arr[::-1]`, `z` is a substring of `arr` starting from index `x` and ending just before the index `n - y`, `_` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `z = arr[x:n - y]` slices the string `arr` starting from the index `x` (the first occurrence of '1') and ending just before the index `n - y` (the position `n` minus the last occurrence of '1' in the reversed string `arr[::-1]`). The values of `t`, `n`, `arr`, `x`, `y`, and `_` remain unchanged except for the new value of `z`.
