Output State: **`arr` is the string obtained by joining the input string split by spaces; `n` is the integer input by the user; `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr[::-1]`; `z` is a substring of `arr` starting from index `x` and ending just before the index `n - y`; `_` is 1; `x` is updated to the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`; `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr[::-1]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `y` to be the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string `arr[::-1]`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `x` is now updated to the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`, and `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string `arr[::-1]`.
