Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to move all chips into a single block. Specifically, the program fails to handle cases where chips are scattered in such a way that moving them requires more than just moving the last chip to the nearest free cell to the left.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
8
0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
```
The correct output should be `1`, as moving the last chip to the 5th cell will result in all chips being together. However, the program's logic is flawed because it only checks the first occurrence of '1' and the last occurrence of '1' in the string representation of the array, which does not account for the optimal sequence of moves.

A correct approach would involve counting the number of free cells between consecutive chips and summing these counts, as this represents the minimum number of moves required to bring all chips together.
