Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an input integer, `_` is 0**

Explanation: The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was initially an integer between 1 and 1000. The variable `n` is assigned the value of the integer input provided by the user using `int(input(''))`. The variable `_` remains 0 as it was not affected by the code.
