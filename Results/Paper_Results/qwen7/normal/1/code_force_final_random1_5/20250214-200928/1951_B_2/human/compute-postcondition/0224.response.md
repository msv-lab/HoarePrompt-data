Postcondition: `p` is equal to `j`, `j` is equal to the length of the list `s` minus one, `ans` is the count of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h`, and `z` is 1. This is because if `z` equals 1, the postcondition of the if part is directly adopted, setting `ans1` to 1 and keeping `z` as 1. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains unchanged from the if part.
