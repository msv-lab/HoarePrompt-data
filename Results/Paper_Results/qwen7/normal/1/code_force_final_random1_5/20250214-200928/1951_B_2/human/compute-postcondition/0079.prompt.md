Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `j` is equal to the length of the list `s` minus 1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is an integer from the input, `s` is a list of integers with its first and last elements swapped, `ans` is 1 if `h` is greater than or equal to every element in the list `s` starting from the second element, otherwise `ans` is 0, `h` is the last element of the original list (first element of the swapped list), `i` is the last element of the list `s`, `p` is equal to `j - 1`, `s[0]` and `s[k-1]` have swapped values, `ans1` is 0, `z` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    if i == h:
        if s[0] != h:
            ans1 += 1
        z = 1
    elif i > h:
        break
    elif z == 1:
        ans1 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is the first element of the list `s`, and `h` is a reference point. If `i` is equal to `h`, then `z` is 1. If `i` is not equal to `h`, then `ans1` is set to 1 if `z` is 1, and `i` is greater than `h` causes breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement, while `i` less than or equal to `h` keeps `i` and `h` unchanged and `ans1` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is the second element of the list `s`, `h` is a reference point, `z` and `ans1` remain unchanged if `i` is not equal to `h`. If `i` is equal to `h`, `z` remains unchanged, and `ans1` is increased by 1 if `i` is not greater than `h`. If `i` is greater than `h`, then `z` and `ans1` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is the third element of the list `s`, `h` is a reference point, `z` remains unchanged, and `ans1` is increased by 1 if `s[0]` is not equal to `h`. If `i` is not greater than `h`, `ans1` is also increased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
