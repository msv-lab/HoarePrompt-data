Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in s`. This means the variable `i` is being iterated over each element of the list `s`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the start of the loop**: 
   - `p` is equal to `j`.
   - `i` is the last element of the list `s`.
   - `j` is equal to the length of the list `s` minus 2.
   - `ans1` is 1.
   - `z` is 1.
   - `s` is a non-empty list.
   - If `i` equals `h`, then `ans1` and `z` are set to 1, otherwise `i` is not equal to `h`.
   - If `i` is greater than `h`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in the list `s` to iterate over. Since `i` is currently set to the last element of the list `s`, the next iteration would start with `i` being the second-to-last element of the list `s`.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `p` remains unchanged because it is not directly involved in the loop.
   - `i` will now be the second-to-last element of the list `s`.
   - `j` will be reduced by 1 (since `j` was initially the length of `s` minus 2, and `i` is now the second-to-last element).
   - `ans1` and `z` remain unchanged unless the new value of `i` equals `h`, but since we don't have information about `h`, we assume they stay as 1.
   - `s` remains a non-empty list.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `p` is equal to `j`.
   - `i` is now the second-to-last element of the list `s`.
   - `j` is now the length of the list `s` minus 1.
   - `ans1` is 1.
   - `z` is 1.
   - `s` is a non-empty list.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`p` is equal to `j`, `i` is the second-to-last element of the list `s`, `j` is equal to the length of the list `s` minus 1, `ans1` is 1, `z` is 1, `s` is a non-empty list**.
