Output State: **`p` is equal to `j`, `i` is the last element of the list `s`, `j` is equal to the length of the list `s` minus 2, `s[0]` and `s[k-1]` have swapped values.**

Explanation: The code swaps the first and the last elements of the list `s`. The values of `p`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged from their initial states. After the swap, `s[0]` will now hold the value that was previously at `s[k-1]`, and `s[k-1]` will hold the value that was originally at `s[0]`.
