Output State: **`p` is equal to `j`, which is the length of the list `s` minus one; `ans` is the count of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h`; `z` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether the condition `i_next > h` is true or false; if `i_next == h`, then `ans1` is incremented by 1; `ans1` is now `ans1 + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `ans1 += 1` increments the value of `ans1` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
