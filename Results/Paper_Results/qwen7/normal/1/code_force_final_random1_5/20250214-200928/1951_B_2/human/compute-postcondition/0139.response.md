Postcondition: `p` is equal to `j`, `i` is the last element of the list `s`, `j` is equal to the length of the list `s` minus 2, `ans1` is 1, `z` is 1, `s` is a non-empty list, and if `i` equals `h`, `ans1` and `z` are set to 1, otherwise `i` is not equal to `h`, and if `i` is greater than `h`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.
