Postcondition: `p` is equal to `j`, which is the length of the list `s` minus one, `ans` is the count of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h`, and `z` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether the condition `i > h` is true or false. If `i > h` is true, `z` is set to 0 and the loop or if statement is broken. If `i > h` is false, `z` remains 1, and `ans1` is 1 if `i` is equal to `h` and the first element of `s` is not equal to `h`.
