Output State: **Postcondition: `i` is `i + 1`, `n` remains the same, and if `a[i] > x`, then `ind` contains the value of `i + 1` and `c` is incremented by 1. If `a[i] <= x`, then `ind` and `c` remain unchanged. We break out of the loop or if statement we were inside.**

The `break` statement causes the loop or conditional block to exit without further evaluation of the remaining code within it. Since no changes are made to the variables outside the scope of the loop or conditional block, the values of `i`, `n`, `a`, `x`, `ind`, and `c` remain as they were before the `break` statement was executed.
