You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[The HU - Shireg Shireg](https://youtu.be/SNCx4n2m5_o)

ඞ

There are n cows participating in a coding tournament. Cow i has a Cowdeforces
rating of a_i (all distinct), and is initially in position i . The tournament
consists of n-1 matches as follows:

  * The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2 . 
  * Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1 . 
  * In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match. 

You are the owner of cow k . For you, winning the tournament is not important;
rather, you want your cow to win in as many matches as possible. As an
acquaintance of the tournament organizers, you can ask them to swap the
position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do
nothing.

Find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le n \le
10^5, 1 \le k \le n ) — the number of cows and your cow's index.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the Cowdeforces rating of the cows. It is guaranteed that
a_i 's are pairwise different.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of wins cow k can
achieve if you choose to swap (or do nothing) optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    6 1
    
    12 10 14 11 8 3
    
    6 5
    
    7 2 727 10 12 13
    
    2 2
    
    1000000000 1

Output

    1
    2
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal to do nothing. Let a' be the Cowdeforces
rating of the cows in the original order (with your cow's rating bolded), then

  * Initially, a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 14 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 1 match.

In the second test case, it is optimal to swap your cow to position 3 . Then,
let a' be the Cowdeforces rating of the cows in the order after the swap.

  * Initially, a' = [7, 2, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 2 and wins. a' = [7, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against your cow, and your cow wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 727 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 2 matches.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `a` of distinct integers representing Cowdeforce ratings and an integer `k`. It searches for the first two elements in `a` that are greater than the `k`-th element. If found, it returns a specific value based on the positions of these elements relative to `k`. If no such elements are found, it returns -1. The function can return one of the following values:
1. -1 if no conditions are met.
2. `k - 1` if `k` is not 14 and the list `ind` contains exactly one element, which is 0.
3. `ind[0] - 1` if `ind` contains the indices of the first two elements greater than `x` and `ind[0]` is greater than `k`.
4. The maximum of `k - ind[0]` and `ind[0] - 1` if `ind[0]` is less than or equal to `k`.
5. The minimum of `ind[1] - 1` and `13` if `ind[0]` is 0.
6. The maximum of `ind[0] - 1` and `ind[1] - ind[0]` if `ind[0]` is not 0.
7. The maximum of `ind[0] - 1` and `k - ind[0]` otherwise.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic inside `func_1` does not accurately determine the maximum number of wins for the cow at position `k`. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Indicators**: The program tries to find up to two positions where the cow's rating is less than the current cow's rating (`x`). However, this approach is flawed because it does not consider the optimal strategy for maximizing wins. The program should consider the best possible swaps and positions to ensure the cow at position `k` can win as many matches as possible.

2. **Edge Cases Not Handled**: The program does not handle scenarios where the cow at position `k` might benefit from swapping with another cow to secure more wins. For example, if the cow at position `k` is very strong but surrounded by weaker cows, swapping with a slightly weaker cow could potentially allow the cow to win more matches.

3. **Logic Flaws**: The logic for determining the number of wins based on the positions of cows with higher ratings is overly simplistic. It does not account for the optimal placement and swapping strategies needed to maximize the number of wins.

To illustrate, consider the following example:

**Input:**
```
3
6 1
12 10 14 11 8 3
6 5
7 2 727 10 12 13
2 2
1000000000 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
2
0
```

**Actual Output (from the provided program):**
```
1
1
0
```

The program fails to correctly calculate the maximum number of wins for the cow at position `k` in the second test case. By swapping the cow at position 5 with the cow at position 3, the cow at position 5 can win the first two matches, achieving 2 wins instead of just 1.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not handle all potential cases and edge scenarios correctly.
