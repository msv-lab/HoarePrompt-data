Output State: **`ans1` is 1, `p` is equal to `j`, `i` is the last element of the list `s`, `j` is equal to the length of the list `s` minus 2, `z` is 0, `s` is a non-empty list, and the current value of `i` is equal to `h`. The first element of `s` is not equal to `h`.**

Explanation: The code `ans1 += 1` increments the value of `ans1` by 1. Since `ans1` was initially 0, after executing this line, `ans1` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
