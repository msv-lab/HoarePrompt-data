Postcondition: `p` is equal to `j`, `i` is the last element of the list `s`, `j` is equal to the length of the list `s` minus 2, `ans1` is 1, `z` is 1, `s` is a non-empty list, and `i` is not equal to `h`. If `i` is greater than `h`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `i` is less than or equal to `h`.
