You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n. The list a contains n distinct integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        s = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        s[0], s[k - 1] = s[k - 1], s[0]
        
        ans = 0
        
        h = s[0]
        
        j = -1
        
        for i in s[1:]:
            j += 1
            if h < i:
                break
            else:
                ans += 1
        
        p = j
        
        s[0], s[k - 1] = s[k - 1], s[0]
        
        ans1 = 0
        
        s[p], s[k - 1] = s[k - 1], s[p]
        
        z = 0
        
        for i in s:
            if i == h:
                if s[0] != h:
                    ans1 += 1
                z = 1
            elif i > h:
                break
            elif z == 1:
                ans1 += 1
        
        print(max(ans, ans1))
        
    #State: All elements of the list `s` have been iterated over, `i` is now the first element of the list `s`, `h` remains as the maximum element encountered during the loop, `z` is 1 if there was at least one element in `s` that was greater than `h` and caused the loop to break, otherwise `z` is 0, `p` is equal to `j` which is the index of the last element of the list `s`, and `ans` is the count of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h`, `ans1` is the sum of 1 for each occurrence of `h` in `s` where `s[0] != h`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a list of test cases, where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), two integers n and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n), and a list a containing n distinct integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). For each test case, it returns information based on the values of t, n, k, and the list a.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
