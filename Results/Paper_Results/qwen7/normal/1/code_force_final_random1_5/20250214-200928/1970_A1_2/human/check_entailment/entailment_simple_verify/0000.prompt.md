You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A parentheses sequence is a string consisting of characters "(" and ")", for
example "(()((".

A balanced parentheses sequence is a parentheses sequence which can become a
valid mathematical expression after inserting numbers and operations into it,
for example "(()(()))".

The balance of a parentheses sequence is defined as the number of opening
parentheses "(" minus the number of closing parentheses ")". For example, the
balance of the sequence "(()((" is 3.

A balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence
with balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.

We define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and
returns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the
input sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before
that character and write those down in a table together with the positions of
the characters in the input sequence, for example:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
  
Then, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,
breaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
  
The last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case
"()(()())". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced
shuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle
of the input sequence.

You are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Print its balanced shuffle.

Input

The only line of input contains a string s consisting only of characters "("
and ")". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses
sequence with its length not exceeding 500\,000 .

Output

Print the parentheses sequence t — the balanced shuffle of s .

Example

Input

    (()(()))
    
Output

    ()(()())

- Annotated Code: 
class BalanceInfo:

    def __init__(self, balance, position, character):
        self.balance = balance
        self.position = position
        self.character = character
if __name__ == '__main__':
    s = input().strip()
    func_2(s)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: infoA and infoB are objects that have attributes `balance` and `position`, where `balance` is an integer and `position` is an integer representing the position of a character in a balanced parentheses sequence.
def func_1(infoA, infoB):
    if (infoA.balance != infoB.balance) :
        return infoA.balance - infoB.balance
        #The program returns the difference between infoA's balance and infoB's balance.
    #State: infoA and infoB are objects that have attributes `balance` and `position`, where both `balance` attributes are equal, and both `position` attributes represent the position of a character in a balanced parentheses sequence.
    return infoB.position - infoA.position
    #The program returns the difference between the position attribute of infoB and the position attribute of infoA, where both attributes represent the position of a character in a balanced parentheses sequence.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")". The string s is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.

    balance = 0
    for i in range(n):
        balance_info.append(BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i]))

        else:

    #State: Output State: `balance_info` now contains `n` instances of `BalanceInfo`. Each instance has the following attributes:
    #- The `balance` value starts from 0 and changes based on the parentheses encountered during the iteration.
    #- The `i` value ranges from 0 to `n-1`, indicating the position of each character in the string `s`.
    #- The `s[i]` value is the character at position `i` in the string `s`.
    #
    #In summary, `balance_info` will contain one entry for each index in the string `s`, with each entry reflecting the balance of parentheses up to that point in the string. The `balance` attribute will show the net count of open parentheses minus closed ones at each step, starting from 0 at the beginning of the string and updating with each iteration through the loop.
    balance_info.sort(key=lambda x: (x.balance, -x.position))
    result = ''.join(info.character for info in balance_info)
    print(result)
    #This is printed: the string formed by concatenating the `character` attributes of all `info` objects in `balance_info`, sorted by `balance` in ascending order and by `position` in descending order for ties




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the balanced shuffle operation. Specifically, the `func_2` function does not handle the sorting of the balance information correctly. The sorting key should prioritize non-negative balances and then descending positions for equal balances. However, the current implementation sorts based on balance first and then position, which can lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the input `(()(()))`. The expected output is `()(()())`, but the provided code might produce an incorrect result due to the sorting logic. The balance information should be sorted as follows:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )

The correct sorted order should be:

1. (balance 0, position 1, character '(')
2. (balance 1, position 4, character '(')
3. (balance 1, position 2, character '(')
4. (balance 1, position 8, character ')')
5. (balance 2, position 7, character ')')
6. (balance 2, position 5, character '(')
7. (balance 2, position 3, character ')')
8. (balance 3, position 6, character ')')

However, the current implementation might incorrectly sort the balance and position, leading to an incorrect shuffled sequence. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
