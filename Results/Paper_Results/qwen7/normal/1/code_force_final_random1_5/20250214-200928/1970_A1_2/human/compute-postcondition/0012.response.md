Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `balance` is either 1 if `s[0]` is '(', or `balance_info.balance` - 1 if `s[0]` is not an opening parenthesis ('('), `balance_info` now contains an instance of `BalanceInfo` with the updated `balance` value, `i` value equal to 0, and `s[0]` value, and a new `BalanceInfo` instance is appended to the list with the current `balance`, `i`, and `s[i]` values.**

This means that a new `BalanceInfo` instance is created with the current values of `balance`, `i`, and `s[i]` (which is the same as `s[0]`), and appended to the list. The other variables remain unchanged.
