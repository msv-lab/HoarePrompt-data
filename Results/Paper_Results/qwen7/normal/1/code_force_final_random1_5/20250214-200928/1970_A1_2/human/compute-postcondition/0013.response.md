Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `balance` is 1, `balance_info` now contains two instances of `BalanceInfo` with the first instance having the balance value of 1, i value of 0, and s[0] value, and the second instance having the current balance value of 1, i value of 0, and s[0] value, and a new `BalanceInfo` instance is appended to the list with the current `balance`, `i`, and `s[i]` values.**

Explanation: The code `balance += 1` increments the value of `balance` by 1. Given the initial state, `balance` was either 1 (if `s[0]` is '(') or `balance_info.balance - 1` (if `s[0]` is not an opening parenthesis). Since the initial state specifies that `balance` is either 1 if `s[0]` is '(', or `balance_info.balance - 1` if `s[0]` is not an opening parenthesis, and considering the initial value of `balance` is 1 (as per the given conditions), the new value of `balance` is 2. The `balance_info` list now contains two instances of `BalanceInfo`: the first one with the initial values and the second one with the updated `balance`, `i`, and `s[i]` values.
