Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the balanced shuffle operation. Specifically, the `func_2` function does not handle the sorting of the balance information correctly. The sorting key should prioritize non-negative balances and then descending positions for equal balances. However, the current implementation sorts based on balance first and then position, which can lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the input `(()(()))`. The expected output is `()(()())`, but the provided code might produce an incorrect result due to the sorting logic. The balance information should be sorted as follows:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )

The correct sorted order should be:

1. (balance 0, position 1, character '(')
2. (balance 1, position 4, character '(')
3. (balance 1, position 2, character '(')
4. (balance 1, position 8, character ')')
5. (balance 2, position 7, character ')')
6. (balance 2, position 5, character '(')
7. (balance 2, position 3, character ')')
8. (balance 3, position 6, character ')')

However, the current implementation might incorrectly sort the balance and position, leading to an incorrect shuffled sequence. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
