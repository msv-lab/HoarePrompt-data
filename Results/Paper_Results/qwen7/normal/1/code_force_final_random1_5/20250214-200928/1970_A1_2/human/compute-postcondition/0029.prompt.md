You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")". The string s is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.
def func_2(s):
    n = len(s)
    balance_info = []
    balance = 0
    for i in range(n):
        balance_info.append(BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i]))
        
        if s[i] == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: `balance_info` now contains `n` instances of `BalanceInfo`. Each instance has the following attributes:
    #- The `balance` value starts from 0 and changes based on the parentheses encountered during the iteration.
    #- The `i` value ranges from 0 to `n-1`, indicating the position of each character in the string `s`.
    #- The `s[i]` value is the character at position `i` in the string `s`.
    #
    #In summary, `balance_info` will contain one entry for each index in the string `s`, with each entry reflecting the balance of parentheses up to that point in the string. The `balance` attribute will show the net count of open parentheses minus closed ones at each step, starting from 0 at the beginning of the string and updating with each iteration through the loop.
    balance_info.sort(key=lambda x: (x.balance, -x.position))
    result = ''.join(info.character for info in balance_info)
    print(result)
    #This is printed: the string formed by concatenating the `character` attributes of all `info` objects in `balance_info`, sorted by `balance` in ascending order and by `position` in descending order for ties
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a string `s` consisting only of "(" and ")`, and returns whether `s` forms a valid balanced parentheses sequence.

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
