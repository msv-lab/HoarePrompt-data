### Reasoning:

The original assessment accurately describes the functionality and correctness of the provided Python program. Let's break down the reasoning step by step:

1. **Class Definition and Function Definitions:**
   - The `BalanceInfo` class is used to store the balance, position, and character information for each position in the input string.
   - The `func_1` function is not used in the main logic but is part of the class definition. It is used for comparison purposes, although it is not directly involved in the sorting process.

2. **Main Functionality:**
   - **Function `func_2`:**
     - It correctly initializes the `balance_info` list by iterating over the input string `s` and appending `BalanceInfo` objects with the current balance and position.
     - The balance is updated based on whether the character is `(` or `)`.
     - After constructing the `balance_info` list, it sorts the list using the custom key function `lambda x: (x.balance, -x.position)`. This ensures that the list is sorted by balance in ascending order and by position in descending order for ties.
     - Finally, it constructs the result string by joining the characters from the sorted `BalanceInfo` objects, which gives the desired shuffled sequence.

3. **Sorting Key Function:**
   - The sorting key function `lambda x: (x.balance, -x.position)` is crucial. It ensures that the list is sorted by balance in ascending order and by position in descending order for ties. This is exactly what is required for the balanced shuffle operation.

4. **Output Construction:**
   - The result string is constructed by joining the characters from the sorted `BalanceInfo` objects, which correctly reflects the balanced shuffle operation.

Given the detailed analysis, the provided code correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. The original assessment accurately captures this.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
