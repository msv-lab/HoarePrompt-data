Output State: **`balance_info` now contains four instances: the first instance is `balance` of 2 if `s[0]` is '(', otherwise 0; `i` of 0; `s[0]` value; the second instance is updated `balance` (2 if `s[0]` is '(', 0 if `s[0]` is not '('); `i` of 0; `s[0]` value; the third instance is new `balance`, `i` of 1, and `s[1]` value; `i` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `balance += 1` increments the `balance` value by 1. Since the initial state of `balance` for the first two instances is 1 if `s[0]` is '(', otherwise -1, after incrementing, it becomes 2 if `s[0]` is '(', otherwise 0. The third instance's `balance` is updated to `balance + 1`, so it becomes 2 if `s[0]` is '(', otherwise 0. All other values remain unchanged.
