Output State: `balance_info` now contains `n` instances. Each instance in the list represents the state of the balance and the index of the character in the string `s` at each iteration of the loop. The first instance corresponds to the initial state where `balance` is either 1 if `s[0]` is '(', or 0 if `s[0]` is ')', and `i` is 0. For each subsequent instance, the `balance` value is updated based on whether the current character is '(' or ')', and `i` increments by 1 until it reaches `n-1`.

Each instance in the list has the following structure:
- `balance`: The current balance value after processing up to the current character.
- `i`: The index of the current character being processed.
- `s[i]`: The current character from the string `s`.

For example, if `s = "(()))"`, then `n = 4`. The `balance_info` list would contain the following instances:
1. `balance` of 1, `i` of 0, and `s[0]` of '('.
2. `balance` of 2, `i` of 0, and `s[0]` of '('.
3. `balance` of 1, `i` of 1, and `s[1]` of '('.
4. `balance` of 2, `i` of 1, and `s[1]` of '('.
5. `balance` of 1, `i` of 2, and `s[2]` of ')'.
6. `balance` of 0, `i` of 2, and `s[2]` of ')'.
7. `balance` of -1, `i` of 3, and `s[3]` of ')'.
8. `balance` of -2, `i` of 3, and `s[3]` of ')'.
