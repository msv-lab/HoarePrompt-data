Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")"; `n` is the length of the string `s`; `balance_info` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list named `balance_info`. This does not affect the values of `s` or `n`. Therefore, the length of the string `s` is still stored in `n`, and `s` remains unchanged.
