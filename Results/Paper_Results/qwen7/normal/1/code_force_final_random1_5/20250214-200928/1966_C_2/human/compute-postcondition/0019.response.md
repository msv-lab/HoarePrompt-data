Output State: **`tc` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers in descending order followed by 0, `dp` is True.**

The code initializes the variable `dp` to `True`. This assignment does not affect the values of `tc`, `n`, or `arr`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions with `dp` being set to `True`.
