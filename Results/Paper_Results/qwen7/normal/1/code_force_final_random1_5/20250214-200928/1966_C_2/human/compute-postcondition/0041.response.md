Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1
   - `dp` is `arr[1] - arr[2] > 1 or not dp`

4. **Update the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and the loop continues as long as `i < n`, the next value of `i` will be 2.
   - The value of `n` remains the same because it is determined by the length of `arr` and does not change within the loop.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be updated to 2.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `dp` remains unchanged because the loop body is omitted and no operations are performed on `dp` during the iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1, `dp` is `arr[1] - arr[2] > 1 or not dp`**
