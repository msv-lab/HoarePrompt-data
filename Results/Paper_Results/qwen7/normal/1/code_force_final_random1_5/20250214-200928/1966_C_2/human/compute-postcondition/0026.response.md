Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `tc` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `dp` is `arr[2] - arr[3] > 1 or not dp`.
   - `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1, and `len(arr)` must be greater than 2.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop will continue if `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `i = 3`.
   - Since `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1 and `len(arr)` must be greater than 2, `n` remains unchanged.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `tc` must still be greater than 0 (unchanged).
   - `i` is now 3.
   - `dp` remains as `arr[2] - arr[3] > 1 or not dp` (unchanged).
   - `n` remains the length of `arr` minus 1 and `len(arr)` must still be greater than 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `tc` must be greater than 0, `i` is 3, `dp` is `arr[2] - arr[3] > 1 or not dp`, and `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1 and `len(arr)` must be greater than 2.**
