Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining whether a given grid of '0's and '1's forms a triangle or a square.
2. The provided program attempts to solve this by:
   - Reading the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, reading the size of the grid and then the grid itself.
   - Counting the number of '1's in each row.
   - Comparing the counts of '1's in the first two rows to decide if the shape is a square or a triangle.
3. However, the logic in the program is flawed:
   - The program only checks the first two rows to decide between a square and a triangle.
   - This is insufficient because:
     - A square would have the same number of '1's in each row.
     - A triangle would have a different pattern of '1's, starting with an odd number of '1's in the middle row(s).
4. The program does not correctly identify the shapes based on the problem's definition:
   - For example, a triangle with `k=3` would have rows like "1", "11", "111".
   - A square with `k=3` would have rows like "111", "111", "111".
   - The program's current logic cannot distinguish these patterns correctly.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
