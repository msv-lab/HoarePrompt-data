Output State: **Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `a` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is the total number of iterations the loop has executed (which is equal to `a`), `k` is a list containing the cumulative count of '1's in the binary representation of all integers provided as input through the loop, and `b` is the most recent input string from the user. If the first element of `k` is equal to the second element of `k`, the program prints 'SQUARE'. If the first element of `k` is not equal to the second element of `k`, the program prints 'TRIANGLE'.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `t` will still be within the range 1 to 100, `a` will be the total number of times the outer loop has run, `i` will be equal to `a`, `k` will contain the total count of '1's from all the inputs provided, and based on whether the first and second elements of `k` are equal or not, the program will print either 'SQUARE' or 'TRIANGLE'. The variable `b` will hold the most recent input string provided by the user during the last iteration of the loop.
