Output State: **`b` is an input string containing the character '1', `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in string `b` which is 1.**

Explanation: The code appends the count of the character '1' in the string `b` to the list `k`. Since `b` contains at least one '1', the count is 1, and this value is appended to `k`. Therefore, `k` now contains `[1]`.
