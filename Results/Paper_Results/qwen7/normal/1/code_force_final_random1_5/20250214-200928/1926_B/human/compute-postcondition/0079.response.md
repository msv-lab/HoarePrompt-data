Postcondition: `b` is an input integer from the user, and `k` is a list containing the cumulative count of '1's in the binary representation of all integers provided as input through the loop. If the first element of `k` is equal to the second element of `k`, the program does not change `k`. If the first element of `k` is not equal to the second element of `k`, the program does not change `k` either.
