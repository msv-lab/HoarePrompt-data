Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `a` is the integer input for the first test case and is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `k` is an empty list, `b` is the string input.**

Explanation: The code `b = input()` assigns the value of the string input to the variable `b`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
