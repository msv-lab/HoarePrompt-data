Output State: **`b` is an input integer from the user, and `k` is a list containing the cumulative count of '1's in the binary representation of all integers provided as input through the loop.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `b` will hold the last integer input by the user. The list `k` will contain the total count of '1's found in the binary representations of all the integers that were input during the loop's execution. Each time the condition `'1' in b` evaluates to True, the count of '1's in the binary representation of `b` is appended to the list `k`. Therefore, `k` accumulates the counts from each iteration where '1' was present in `b`.
