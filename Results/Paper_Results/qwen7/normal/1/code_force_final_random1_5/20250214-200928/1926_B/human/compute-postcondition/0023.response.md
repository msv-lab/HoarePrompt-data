Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `a` is an integer greater than 0.
- `i` is either 2 or remains 1.
- `k` is a list containing the integers 1 and the count of '1' in each of the input strings `b` for each iteration of the loop.
- `b` is the last input string from the user.
- The current value of `k[0]` is equal to `k[1]`.

The print statement is simply `print('SQUARE')`.

Since the print statement directly outputs the string 'SQUARE', regardless of the values of the other variables, the output will be:

Output: **SQUARE**
