Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `a` is an integer greater than 0.
- `i` is 2.
- `k` is a list containing the total count of '1's across all input strings provided during the loop executions.
- `b` is the most recent input string from the user.
- `num` is the most recent positive integer provided by the user.
- The first element of `k` is equal to the second element of `k`.

The print statement is simply `print('SQUARE')`. This statement will print the string "SQUARE" to the console.
