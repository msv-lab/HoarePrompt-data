You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a binary square grid of n \times n cells. A triangle or a square
is drawn on the grid with symbols \texttt{1} . As he is too busy being cool,
he asks you to tell him which shape is drawn on the grid.

  * A triangle is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has 2 \cdot i-1 consecutive characters \texttt{1} , and the central 1s are located in one column. An upside down triangle is also considered a valid triangle (but not rotated by 90 degrees).

Two left pictures contain examples of triangles: k=4 , k=3 . The two right
pictures don't contain triangles.

  * A square is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has k consecutive characters \texttt{1} , which are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

Examples of two squares: k=2 , k=4 .

For the given grid, determine the type of shape that is drawn on it.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq 10
) — the size of the grid.

The next n lines each contain n characters \texttt{0} or \texttt{1} .

The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all
the \texttt{1} s in the grid. It is guaranteed that the size of the triangle
or square is greater than 1 (i.e., the shape cannot consist of exactly one 1).

Output

For each test case, output "SQUARE" if all the \texttt{1} s in the grid form a
square, and "TRIANGLE" otherwise (without quotes).

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10; the input consists of t test cases, each test case starts with an integer n followed by n lines, each containing n characters that are either '0' or '1', and the grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that includes all the '1's in the grid, with the size of the triangle or square being greater than 1.

    a = int(input())

        k = []

    #State: Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `a` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is the total number of iterations the loop has executed (which is equal to `a`), `k` is a list containing the cumulative count of '1's in the binary representation of all integers provided as input through the loop, and `b` is the most recent input string from the user. If the first element of `k` is equal to the second element of `k`, the program prints 'SQUARE'. If the first element of `k` is not equal to the second element of `k`, the program prints 'TRIANGLE'.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `a` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` which is the size of the grid.
   - Then, it reads `n` lines of input, each containing `n` characters ('0' or '1').

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it creates a list `k` to store the count of '1's in each row.
   - It iterates through each row and counts the number of '1's in that row using `b.count('1')`.
   - If the count of '1's in the first row (`k[0]`) is equal to the count of '1's in the second row (`k[1]`), it prints 'SQUARE'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'TRIANGLE'.

### Issues in the Program:

1. **Triangle Detection:**
   - The program checks only the first two rows to determine if the shape is a square or a triangle.
   - This approach is flawed because:
     - For a triangle, the number of '1's in the rows increases linearly (e.g., 1, 3, 5, ...).
     - For a square, the number of '1's in each row is the same.
   - The program does not correctly identify the pattern of a triangle or a square.

2. **Square Detection:**
   - The program assumes that if the count of '1's in the first two rows is the same, then the shape is a square.
   - This assumption is incorrect because:
     - A square can have different patterns of '1's in each row, not necessarily the same count.
     - A triangle can also have rows with the same count of '1's initially but will eventually differ.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly identify whether the shape is a triangle or a square, we need to check the pattern of '1's in each row:
- For a square, the number of '1's in each row should be the same.
- For a triangle, the number of '1's in each row should increase linearly.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        n = int(input())
        grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]
        
        # Check for Square
        if all(grid[i][j] == grid[i+1][j] for i in range(n-1) for j in range(n) if grid[i][j] == '1'):
            print('SQUARE')
        else:
            # Check for Triangle
            for i in range(1, n):
                if len([j for j in range(n) if grid[i][j] == '1']) != 2 * i + 1:
                    break
            else:
                print('TRIANGLE')
            else:
                print('SQUARE')

func()
```

### Conclusion:

The original program is incorrect because it does not properly identify the patterns of a triangle or a square. Therefore, the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
