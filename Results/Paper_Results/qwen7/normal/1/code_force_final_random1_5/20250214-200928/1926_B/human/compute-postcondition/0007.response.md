Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `a` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `k` is a list containing the integer 1, `b` is a string containing the character '1'.**

Explanation: The code `k.append(b.count('1'))` appends the count of the character '1' in the string `b` to the list `k`. Since `b` contains the character '1', `b.count('1')` returns 1. Therefore, `k` now contains the integer 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
