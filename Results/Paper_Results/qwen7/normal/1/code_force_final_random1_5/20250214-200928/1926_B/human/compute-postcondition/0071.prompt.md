Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `a` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 3, `k` is an empty list, `b` is the most recent input string from the user, and `num` is the most recent positive integer provided by the user.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    b = input()
    if '1' in b:
        k.append(b.count('1'))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `b` is an input string. If the string `b` contains the character '1', `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in string `b`, which is 1. If the string `b` does not contain the character '1', `k` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `b` is an input integer from the user, and `k` is a list containing the count of '1's in the binary representation of `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `b` is an input integer from the user, and `k` is a list containing the count of '1's in the binary representation of `b`, which is updated to include the count of '1's in the binary representation of the new value of `b` if '1' is found in `b`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
