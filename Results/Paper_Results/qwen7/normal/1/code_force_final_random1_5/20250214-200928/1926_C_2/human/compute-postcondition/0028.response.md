Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `j` which iterates over each character in the string representation of `i`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the values are:
   - `i` is 200003
   - `j` is "0"
   - `pd[i]` is 200007

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are characters left in the string representation of `i`. Since `i` is an integer, its string representation is `"200003"`, which has 6 characters. The loop starts with `j` being the first character, which is "2".

4. **Determine the next state**: After the previous iteration where `j` was "0", the next character in the string representation of `i` is "0". Therefore, `j` will now be "0".

5. **Adjust the state**: The only variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `j`. The value of `pd[i]` is not part of the loop head and does not change within the loop itself.

Given the above steps, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is 200003, `j` is "0"**
