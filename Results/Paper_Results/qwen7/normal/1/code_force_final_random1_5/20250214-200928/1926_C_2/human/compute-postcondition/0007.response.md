Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `num != 0`.
2. **Determine the current state**: 
   - `a` is equal to `2 * (int(num / 10)) % 10`
   - `num` is equal to `int(num / 10)`
3. **Understand what needs to be adjusted**: For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `num != 0` must still hold true. This means `num` must not be zero.

Given that `num` is updated to `int(num / 10)` at the end of each iteration, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `num`.

Therefore, we need to ensure that `num` is not zero after the update.

**State:**
- `a` is equal to `2 * (int(num / 10)) % 10`
- `num` must be non-zero after the update (i.e., `num` must be `int(num / 10)` and not zero)

Since the loop updates `num` to `int(num / 10)`, we need to ensure that this new value of `num` is not zero.

**Final State:**
State: **`a` is equal to `2 * (int(num / 10)) % 10`, `num` must be non-zero after the update (i.e., `num` must be `int(num / 10)` and not zero)**
