Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer, `N` is 400001, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5, `pd` is a list of 400001 zeros.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, N):
    pd[i] += pd[i - 1]
    for j in str(i):
        pd[i] += int(j)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The variable `i` will be 200001, `j` will be "1", and `pd[i]` will be 200000.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `i` is 200002; `j` is "2"; `pd[i]` is 200004.

**Explanation:** The loop iterates over each digit of `i`. Initially, `i` is 200002, and `j` starts as "2". In the first iteration, `j` becomes "0" (the second digit of `i`), and `pd[i]` is updated to 2. In the second iteration, `j` becomes "0" again (the third digit of `i`), and `pd[i]` remains 2. In the third iteration, `j` becomes "0" once more (the fourth digit of `i`), and `pd[i]` remains 2. This process continues until all digits of `i` are processed. Since `i` is 200002, it has 6 digits. After processing all digits, `pd[i]` will be incremented by each digit, resulting in `pd[i]` being 200004.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `i` is 200003, `j` is "0", `pd[i]` is 0.

Natural Language Description: After all the iterations of the loop have finished, the value of `i` remains unchanged at 200003, while `j` also remains unchanged at "0". The variable `pd[i]` has been updated multiple times within the loop, with each iteration adding the integer value of each digit of `i` to `pd[i]`. Since the final given state shows `pd[i]` as 0 after 3 iterations, it implies that the digits of `i` (which are "2", "0", "0", "0", "0", "3") were added together and then somehow reduced back to 0, possibly due to a reset or an error in the loop logic. Therefore, the final state shows `pd[i]` as 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
