Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes multiple test cases (t) where each test case involves an integer (n). For each test case, if 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, it performs some operation; if n is out of this range, it may handle or report an error.**

This means the function processes a series of test cases, each defined by an integer `n`. It checks if `n` falls within the specified range (1 to 2·10^5), and based on this check, it either performs a specific operation or handles an error if `n` is out of the valid range.
