Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 1.
- `n` is an input integer.

The code snippet is:
```python
print(pd[n])
```

Here, `pd` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it is being accessed with an index `n`. Since `n` is an input integer, it could be any integer value. However, without knowing the specific content of `pd`, we cannot determine the exact value that will be printed.

Given the information, the output will depend on the value of `pd` at index `n`.

Output: **pd[n] (where n is the input integer)**
