Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect and inefficient for solving the problem as described:

1. **Pre-computation**: The program precomputes the sums for all numbers up to 200,000 and stores them in the list `A`. This is unnecessary and inefficient because the precomputed values are not needed for each test case independently. Each test case should compute the required sum dynamically without relying on precomputed values.

2. **Function `func_1`**: The function `func_1` correctly computes the sum of the digits of a number. However, it is defined but not used in the main part of the program where the actual computation should occur.

3. **List `A` and Unnecessary Storage**: The list `A` is filled with the cumulative sums of digit sums from 1 to 200,000. This is not necessary and wastes memory. Instead, the sum should be computed on-the-fly for each test case.

4. **Efficiency**: Given the constraints (e.g., \( t \leq 10^4 \) and \( n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5 \)), the current approach would be very slow due to the precomputation step.

### Corrected Program:
Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def sum_of_digit_sums(n):
    total_sum = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        digit_sum = 0
        num = i
        while num > 0:
            digit_sum += num % 10
            num //= 10
        total_sum += digit_sum
    return total_sum

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    print(sum_of_digit_sums(n))
```

This version avoids precomputation and directly calculates the required sum for each test case efficiently.
