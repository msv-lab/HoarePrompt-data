Output State: t must be greater than or equal to 3, `n` is an input integer for each iteration.

This means that the loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is greater than or equal to 3, with `n` being an input integer for each iteration. After all iterations, the final value of `t` will be at least 3, and `n` will be the last input integer provided. The initial values of `i`, `j`, and `pd[i]` will remain unchanged.
