Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. However, the initial state mentions that `t` must be greater than 0, which remains unchanged. The value of `n` is now an integer obtained from the input, but its specific value is not known without further input.
