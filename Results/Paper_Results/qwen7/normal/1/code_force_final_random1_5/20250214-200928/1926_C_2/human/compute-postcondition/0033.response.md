Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and `t`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of Variables in the Loop Head**:
   - `_`: This is a throwaway variable, so its value is not relevant for the loop condition.
   - `t`: This is the variable that determines how many times the loop will execute.

3. **Determine the Necessary Adjustments**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Therefore, `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 400001
- `j` is "0"
- `pd[i]` is 400000

None of these variables (`i`, `j`, or `pd[i]`) are involved in the loop condition. The only variable that affects the loop execution is `t`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` must be greater than 0.

**State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
