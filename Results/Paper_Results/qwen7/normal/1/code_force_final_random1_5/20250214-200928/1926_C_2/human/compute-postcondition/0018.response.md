Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for j in str(i):`. This means the loop variable `j` is derived from the string representation of `i`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 200002
   - `j` is "0"
   - `pd[i]` is 2

3. **Determine the next value of `j`**:
   - Since `j` is derived from the string representation of `i`, the next value of `j` would be the next digit in the string representation of `i`.
   - The current value of `i` is 200002, and its string representation is "200002".
   - The previous value of `j` was "0", which is the second character in the string "200002".
   - Therefore, the next value of `j` would be the third character in the string "200002", which is "0".

4. **Determine if the loop should continue**:
   - The loop will continue as long as there are more characters in the string representation of `i`.
   - Since the string "200002" still has more characters (the fourth character is "0"), the loop will continue.

5. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - `i` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop.
   - `j` will be the next character in the string representation of `i`, which is "0".
   - `pd[i]` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`i` is 200002, `j` is "0", `pd[i]` is 2**
