Output State: `i` is 200003, `j` is "0", `pd[i]` is 0.

Natural Language Description: After all the iterations of the loop have finished, the value of `i` remains unchanged at 200003, while `j` also remains unchanged at "0". The variable `pd[i]` has been updated multiple times within the loop, with each iteration adding the integer value of each digit of `i` to `pd[i]`. Since the final given state shows `pd[i]` as 0 after 3 iterations, it implies that the digits of `i` (which are "2", "0", "0", "0", "0", "3") were added together and then somehow reduced back to 0, possibly due to a reset or an error in the loop logic. Therefore, the final state shows `pd[i]` as 0.
