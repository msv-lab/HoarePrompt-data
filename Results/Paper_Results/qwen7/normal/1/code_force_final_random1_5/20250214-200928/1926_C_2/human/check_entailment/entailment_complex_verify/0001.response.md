### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program is incorrect due to unnecessary pre-calculation and inefficiency. However, the original assessment overlooks a critical aspect: the problem constraints and the nature of the solution.

1. **Problem Constraints:**
   - The problem specifies a time limit of 0.5 seconds per test case.
   - The maximum value of \( n \) is \( 2 \cdot 10^5 \).

2. **Efficiency Analysis:**
   - The current program pre-calculates the sum of digit sums for all numbers from 1 to 200,000, which is a constant-time operation.
   - For each test case, it simply retrieves the pre-calculated result, which is an \( O(1) \) operation.
   - Given the constraints, this approach is feasible and efficient.

3. **Functionality:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly computes the sum of digits of a given number.
   - The main loop correctly uses the pre-calculated results to answer each test case efficiently.

4. **Correctness:**
   - The program correctly implements the logic required by the problem statement.
   - It handles all test cases within the specified constraints.

### Conclusion:

While the original assessment correctly points out the inefficiency of the current approach, it fails to recognize that the pre-calculated approach meets the problem constraints and is correct under those constraints.

**Final: True**

The given program is correct under the problem constraints and efficiently solves the problem.
