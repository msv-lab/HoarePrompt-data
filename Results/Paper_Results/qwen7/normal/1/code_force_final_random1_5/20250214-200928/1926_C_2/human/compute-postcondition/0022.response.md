Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `i` is 200002
   - `j` is "2"
   - `pd[i]` is 200004

2. **Loop Condition**: 
   - The loop iterates over each digit of `i` using the range from 1 to `N`.
   - Since `i` is 200002, it has 6 digits, and the loop will run 6 times.

3. **Loop Body**: 
   - The loop body processes each digit of `i` and updates `pd[i]` accordingly.
   - After processing all digits, `pd[i]` will be incremented by each digit.

4. **Current Iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 200002, `j` is "2", and `pd[i]` is 200004.

5. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will become 200003.
   - The value of `j` will be set to the next digit of `i`, which is "0".
   - The value of `pd[i]` will remain the same since the loop body has not yet been executed for this new value of `i`.

6. **Updated States**:
   - `i` will be 200003.
   - `j` will be "0".
   - `pd[i]` will remain 200004 (since the loop body has not yet been executed for `i = 200003`).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`i` is 200003, `j` is "0", `pd[i]` is 200004**.
