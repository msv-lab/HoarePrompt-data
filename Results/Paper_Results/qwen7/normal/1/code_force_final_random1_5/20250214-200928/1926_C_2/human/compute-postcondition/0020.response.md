Output State: `i` is 200002; `j` is "2"; `pd[i]` is 200004.

Explanation: The loop iterates over each digit of `i`. Initially, `i` is 200002. The loop runs until there are no more digits left in the string representation of `i`. After the first iteration, `j` becomes "2" and `pd[i]` becomes 2 (200002 + 2). In the second iteration, `j` becomes "0" and `pd[i]` becomes 2 (200002 + 0). In the third iteration, `j` becomes "0" again and `pd[i]` becomes 200002 (200002 + 0). Since `i` is now "200002" as a string, the loop will continue to add each digit to `pd[i]`. Therefore, after the fourth iteration, `j` will be "0" and `pd[i]` will be 200002 (200002 + 0). After the fifth iteration, `j` will be "2" and `pd[i]` will be 200004 (200002 + 2). At this point, all digits have been processed, so the loop ends with `i` remaining 200002, `j` being "2", and `pd[i]` being 200004.
