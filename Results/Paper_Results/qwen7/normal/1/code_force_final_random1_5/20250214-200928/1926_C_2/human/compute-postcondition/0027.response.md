Output State: **`i` is 200003, `j` is "0", `pd[i]` is 200007**

Explanation: The code `pd[i] += int(j)` increments the value of `pd[i]` by the integer value of `j`. Given that `j` is "0", `int(j)` evaluates to 0. Therefore, `pd[i]` (which was initially 200007) becomes 200007 + 0 = 200007. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged.
