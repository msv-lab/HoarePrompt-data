Reasoning:
1. The provided program attempts to precompute the sum of digit sums for all numbers from 1 to 200,000 and store them in the list `A`.
2. However, the program does not correctly implement the logic to compute the sum of digit sums for each number.
3. Instead of storing the cumulative sum of digit sums in `A`, the program should store the individual digit sum for each number.
4. The function `func_1` correctly computes the sum of digits of a number.
5. The main loop in the program should append the result of `func_1(i)` to `A` instead of the cumulative sum.
6. When processing test cases, the program correctly prints the stored value from `A[n-1]`.

Given these points, the program's logic for storing the digit sums is flawed, but the approach to retrieve the correct digit sum for each test case is correct. Therefore, the program will produce the correct results for the test cases but will have incorrect intermediate values stored in `A`.

Correctness: **False**

The program needs to be corrected to store the individual digit sums in `A` rather than cumulative sums.
