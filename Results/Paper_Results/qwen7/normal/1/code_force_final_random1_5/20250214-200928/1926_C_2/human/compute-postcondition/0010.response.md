Output State: `a` will be the sum of all digits of the original value of `num`, and `num` will be reduced to 0.

Explanation: The loop continues to extract the last digit of `num` and add it to `a` until `num` becomes 0. Therefore, after all iterations, `a` will hold the sum of all digits of the original `num`, and `num` will be fully processed and reduced to 0.
