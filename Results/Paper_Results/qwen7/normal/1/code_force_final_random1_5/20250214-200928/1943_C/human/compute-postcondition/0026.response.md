Output State: **`d` is the shortest path distances from node 0 after the BFS traversal, `previous` is the parent pointers used to reconstruct paths in the BFS traversal, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the value `b`.**

Explanation: The line `path_ba = [b]` creates a list named `path_ba` and assigns it the value `[b]`. This means that `path_ba` now contains the single element `b`. All other variables (`d`, `previous`, and `b`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
