Postcondition: `d` is the shortest path distances from node 0 after the BFS traversal, `previous` is the parent pointers used to reconstruct paths in the BFS traversal, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the values `[-1, n]`, and `n` is set to the value of `previous[-1]`. If `n` is -1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
