Since the `while True` loop does not have any conditions in the header, it will always execute at least once. Therefore, no adjustments to the program state are necessary for the loop to proceed.

State: **`d` is the shortest path distances from node 0 after the BFS traversal, `previous` is the parent pointers used to reconstruct paths in the BFS traversal, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the value `b`**
