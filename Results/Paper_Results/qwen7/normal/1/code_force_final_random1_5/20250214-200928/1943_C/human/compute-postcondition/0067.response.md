Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `len(path_ba) - c1`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `c2` is the length of `path_ba` divided by 2 minus 1.
   - `d` is the shortest path distances from node 0 after the BFS traversal.
   - `previous` is the parent pointers used to reconstruct paths in the BFS traversal.
   - `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`.
   - `path_ba` is a list containing the full path from node `b` back to node 0.
   - `ops` is a list containing two tuples `((c2, 1), (c2, 2))`.
   - `i` is 2.

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range `1` to `len(path_ba) - c1` with a step of `2`.

4. **Determine the Next Value of `i`**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.
   - The loop will continue if `i < len(path_ba) - c1`.

5. **Calculate the Next Value of `i`**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 2, the next value of `i` would be `2 + 2 = 4`.
   - We need to check if `4 < len(path_ba) - c1` to determine if the loop can continue.

6. **Adjust the States**:
   - The only variable in the loop head that needs adjustment is `i`.
   - The value of `i` should be set to `4`.

7. **Ensure Other Variables Remain Unchanged**:
   - All other variables (`c2`, `d`, `previous`, `b`, `path_ba`, `ops`) remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`c2` is the length of `path_ba` divided by 2 minus 1, `d` is the shortest path distances from node 0 after the BFS traversal, `previous` is the parent pointers used to reconstruct paths in the BFS traversal, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the full path from node `b` back to node 0, with each element representing a node in the path, starting from `b` and ending at `0`, `ops` is a list containing two tuples `((c2, 1), (c2, 2))`, and `i` is 4**.
