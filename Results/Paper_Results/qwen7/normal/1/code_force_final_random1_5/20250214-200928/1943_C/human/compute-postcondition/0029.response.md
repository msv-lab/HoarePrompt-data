Postcondition: **`d` is the shortest path distances from node 0 after the BFS traversal, `previous` is the parent pointers used to reconstruct paths in the BFS traversal, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the value `b`, `n` is the value of `previous[b]`, and the current value of `n` is -1.**
