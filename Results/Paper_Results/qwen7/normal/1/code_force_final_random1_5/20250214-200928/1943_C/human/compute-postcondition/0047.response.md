Output State: `d` is the shortest path distances from node 0 after the BFS traversal, `previous` is the parent pointers used to reconstruct paths in the BFS traversal, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the full path from node `b` back to node 0, with each element representing a node in the path, starting from `b` and ending at `0`.

This final state indicates that the loop has iteratively traced back from the node `b` using the `previous` pointers until it reaches node 0, constructing the complete path. The loop terminates when `n == -1`, which signifies that no parent node can be found, meaning the path has been fully reconstructed.
