Output State: **`n` must be at least 4, `u` is the first integer from the input decreased by 3, `v` is the second integer from the input decreased by 2, `u2vs[v]` is a list containing `u` and `u`, `u` and `v` are integers from the input.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `u` and `v` respectively. These integers are then used to update the list `u2vs[v]` to contain two elements, both of which are `u`. The precondition that `n` must be at least 4 remains unchanged.
