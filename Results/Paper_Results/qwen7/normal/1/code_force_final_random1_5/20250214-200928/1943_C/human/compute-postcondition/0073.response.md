Output State: `c2` is the length of `path_ba` divided by 2 minus 1, `d` is the shortest path distances from node 0 after the BFS traversal, `previous` is the parent pointers used to reconstruct paths in the BFS traversal, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the full path from node `b` back to node 0, with each element representing a node in the path, starting from `b` and ending at `0`, `ops` is a list containing twelve tuples `((c2, 1), (c2, 2), (c1, 4), (c2, 4), (c1, 6), (c2, 6), (c1, 8), (c2, 8), (c1, 10), (c2, 10), (c1, 12), (c2, 12)), and `i` is 12.

This output state is calculated based on the given loop, which appends tuples to the `ops` list in increments of 2 for `i` starting from 1 up to `len(path_ba) - c1 - 1`. Since the loop runs for all iterations as described, it will append 12 tuples to `ops` when `i` reaches its final value of 12. The other variables (`c2`, `d`, `previous`, `b`, and `path_ba`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
