Output State: `ops` is a list containing tuples `(c, i)` for every integer `i` from `0` to `ci`.

Explanation: The loop runs from `0` to `ci` (inclusive), appending the tuple `(c, i)` to the list `ops` in each iteration. Since `ci` is initially set to half the length of `path_ba`, rounded down, and given that `path_ba` has an odd length, `ci` will be an integer. After all iterations of the loop, `ops` will contain one tuple for each integer from `0` to `ci`, inclusive.
