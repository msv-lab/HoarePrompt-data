Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10³, and a list `u2vs` of length `n` where each element is a list representing the neighbors of the corresponding vertex in the tree. The function also processes `n-1` lines describing the edges of the tree. After executing the function body, the function returns None.**

This means the function `func_2` takes an integer `n` within the specified range and a list `u2vs` that represents the adjacency list of a tree with `n` vertices. It also processes additional input to define the edges of the tree. The function does not return any value but modifies some internal state or performs some operations based on the given inputs.
