Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ci` is equal to half the length of `path_ba`, rounded down; `d` is the shortest path distances from node 0 after the BFS traversal; `previous` is the parent pointers used to reconstruct paths in the BFS traversal; `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`; `path_ba` is a list containing the full path from node `b` back to node 0 with each element representing a node in the path, starting from `b` and ending at `0`, the length of `path_ba` is odd; `ops` is an empty list; `c` is the value of `path_ba[ci]`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(ci + 1):
    ops.append((c, i))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ops` is a list with an additional tuple `(c, i)` appended to it.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ops` is a list with an additional tuple `(c, previous_i + 1)` appended to it.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ops` is a list with an additional tuple `(c, i)` appended to it, `i` is previous_i + 1, `ci` must be greater than or equal to previous_i + 1




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
