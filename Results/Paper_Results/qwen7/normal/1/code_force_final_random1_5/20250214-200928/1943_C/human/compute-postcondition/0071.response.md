The code appends a tuple `(c1, i)` to the list `ops`. Given that `i` is 6, the new tuple added to `ops` is `(c1, 6)`. The value of `c1` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it remains unchanged after this operation. All other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`c2` is the length of `path_ba` divided by 2 minus 1, `d` is the shortest path distances from node 0 after the BFS traversal, `previous` is the parent pointers used to reconstruct paths in the BFS traversal, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the full path from node `b` back to node 0, `ops` is a list containing five tuples `((c2, 1), (c2, 2), (c1, 4), (c2, 4), (c1, 6)), and `i` is 6.**
