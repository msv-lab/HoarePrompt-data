Output State: **`n` is an input integer, 1 ≤ n ≤ 2000; `u2vs` is a list of length `n` where each element is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes `u2vs` as a list of `n` empty lists. Each element in `u2vs` is set to an empty list, which means that initially, there are no neighbors for any vertex. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and the precondition that `n` is an integer between 1 and 2000 is still valid.
