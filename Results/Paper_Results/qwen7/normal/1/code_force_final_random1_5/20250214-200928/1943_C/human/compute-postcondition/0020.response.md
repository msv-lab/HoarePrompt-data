Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `n` must be at least 4, `u` is the first integer from the input decreased by the total number of iterations (which is `n-1`), `v` is the second integer from the input decreased by one less than the total number of iterations (which is `n-2`), `u2vs[v]` is a list containing all integers from the input decreased by 1 except `v` itself, and `u2vs[u]` is a list containing all integers from the input decreased by 1 except `u` itself.

This means that after the loop completes, each element `u` in the range `[0, n-1]` will have a list in `u2vs` that contains every other index except itself, forming a bidirectional adjacency list representing a complete graph with `n` nodes.
