Output State: `d` is the shortest path distances from node 0 after the BFS traversal, `previous` is the parent pointers used to reconstruct paths in the BFS traversal, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the full path from `b` back to node 0.

Explanation: The loop continues appending the parent nodes of the last node in `path_ba` until it reaches the root node (`n == -1`). Once `n` becomes `-1`, the loop breaks. This means `path_ba` will contain the entire path from the node represented by `b` back to the starting node (node 0). All other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
