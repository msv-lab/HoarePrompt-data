Output State: **`c2` is the length of `path_ba` divided by 2 minus 1, `d` is the shortest path distances from node 0 after the BFS traversal, `previous` is the parent pointers used to reconstruct paths in the BFS traversal, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the full path from node `b` back to node 0, with each element representing a node in the path, starting from `b` and ending at `0`, `ops` is a list containing two tuples `((c2, 1), (c2, 2))`, and `i` is 2.**

Explanation: The line `ops.append((c2, i))` appends a new tuple `(c2, i)` to the list `ops`. Since `i` is 2, the new tuple added is `(c2, 2)`. As `ops` already contained the tuple `(c2, 1)`, now it contains both `(c2, 1)` and `(c2, 2)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
