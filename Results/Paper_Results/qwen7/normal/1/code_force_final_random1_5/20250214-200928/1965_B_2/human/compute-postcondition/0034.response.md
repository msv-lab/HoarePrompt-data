Output State: **`i` is `lk - 2`, `ans` contains `2 ** (lk - 2)`**

Explanation: The code appends `2 ** i` to the list `ans`. Given that `i` is initially `lk - 2`, `2 ** i` becomes `2 ** (lk - 2)`. The values of `lk` and `l` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code. Therefore, `i` remains `lk - 2` and `ans` now contains the value `2 ** (lk - 2)`.
