Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `lk`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: According to the given state, `i` is equal to `lk - 2`.

3. **Determine the Condition for the Loop to Execute**: The loop `for i in range(lk, l)` will execute if `i` starts from `lk` and goes up to `l-1`. This means that `i` must be less than `l` and `i` must be equal to or greater than `lk`.

4. **Adjust the State of `i`**: Since `i` starts at `lk - 2`, we need to ensure that `i` can eventually reach `lk` and continue up to `l-1`. Therefore, we need to set `i` to `lk - 2` and ensure that `lk` and `l` are such that the loop can execute.

5. **Ensure `lk` is Greater Than 3**: The problem states that `lk` must be greater than 3.

6. **Adjust the State of `lk` and `l`**: To ensure the loop can execute, `l` must be greater than `lk`.

7. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`ans`, `k`, and `sum(ans)`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

- `i` should be `lk - 2`.
- `lk` must be greater than 3.
- `l` must be greater than `lk`.

Therefore, the final state is:

**State: **`i` is `lk - 2`, `lk` must be greater than 3, `l` must be greater than `lk`**.
