Output State: **`i` is `lk`, `ans` contains `[2, 2, 4 ** lk]`**

Explanation: The code appends `2 ** i` to the list `ans`. Given that `i` is `lk`, `2 ** i` becomes `2 ** lk`. Since `ans` initially contains `[2, 2]`, after appending `2 ** lk`, `ans` will contain `[2, 2, 4 ** lk]`. The value of `i` remains unchanged as `lk`.
