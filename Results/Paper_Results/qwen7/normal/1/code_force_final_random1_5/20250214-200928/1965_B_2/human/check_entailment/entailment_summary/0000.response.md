Reasoning:
1. The problem requires generating a sequence of non-negative integers that meets specific criteria.
2. The `func_14` function is designed to solve this problem directly. It takes no explicit parameters but uses `func_7()` to read the necessary input values (n and k).
3. `func_14` handles different cases based on the value of `k`:
   - If `k` is 1, it returns a simple sequence `[1, 2]`.
   - For other values of `k`, it constructs a sequence that avoids sums equal to `k` while ensuring all sums from 1 to `n` except `k` are achievable.
4. The constructed sequence in `func_14` ensures:
   - No subsequence sums to `k`.
   - All other sums from 1 to `n` (except `k`) are possible.
5. The `func_15` function correctly iterates over the number of test cases and calls `func_14` for each, printing the results.

Given that the logic in `func_14` is designed to meet the problem requirements and `func_15` correctly implements the solution for multiple test cases, the overall program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
