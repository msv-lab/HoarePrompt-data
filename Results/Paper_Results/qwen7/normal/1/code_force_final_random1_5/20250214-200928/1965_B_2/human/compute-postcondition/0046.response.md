Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and returns either the string '1\n2' or a sequence of numbers separated by spaces. If \(k = 1\), it returns '1\n2'. Otherwise, it constructs a list `ans` containing specific numbers based on the binary representations of `n` and `k`, and returns the length of this list followed by the numbers in the list separated by spaces.**
