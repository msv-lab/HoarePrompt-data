Output State: **`i` is equal to `lk - 2`; `lk` must be greater than 3; `ans` is a list containing the values `[1, 2, 4, ..., 2^(lk-2)], (k - 1 - sum(ans))`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `k - 1 - sum(ans)` to the list `ans`. Given that `i` is equal to `lk - 2` and the loop has completed `lk - 2` iterations, `k` would be `i + 1`, which is `lk - 1`. The sum of the elements in `ans` is the sum of the first `lk - 2` powers of 2, which is \(2^{lk-2} - 1\). Therefore, the new element appended to `ans` is \((lk - 1) - (2^{lk-2} - 1) = lk - 2^{lk-2}\). The other variables remain unchanged.
