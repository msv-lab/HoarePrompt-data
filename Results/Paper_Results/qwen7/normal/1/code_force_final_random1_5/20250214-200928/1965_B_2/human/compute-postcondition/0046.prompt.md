You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n.
def func_14():
    n, k = func_7()
    b = bin(n)[2:]
    l = len(b)
    if (k == 1) :
        if (n == 2) :
            return '1\n2'
            #The program returns the string '1\n2'
        #State: Postcondition: `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n`, `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`. The current value of `k` is 1, and `n` is not equal to 2.
        ans = [2, 3]
        for i in range(2, l):
            ans.append(2 ** i)
            
        #State: Output State: `i` is 1000000; `l` must be 1000001; `ans` is a list containing all powers of 2 from \(2^2\) to \(2^{1000000}\).
        #
        #This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will have reached the maximum value allowed (1000000), `l` will be one more than `i` (1000001), and `ans` will be a list starting from \(2^2 = 4\) up to \(2^{1000000}\).
    else :
        bk = bin(k)[2:]
        ans = []
        lk = len(bk)
        for i in range(lk - 1):
            ans.append(2 ** i)
            
        #State: Output State: `total` is an empty list, `bk` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n`, `lk` is the length of `bk` which will be equal to or greater than 5, `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`, and `k` is not equal to 1, `i` is equal to `lk - 1`, `ans` is a list containing all powers of 2 from \(2^0\) up to \(2^{lk-1}\).
        #
        #This means that if the loop runs its full course, `ans` will contain every power of 2 starting from \(2^0\) up to \(2^{lk-1}\), where `lk` is the length of the binary representation of `k`. The variable `i` will be set to `lk - 1` after the loop completes, indicating the last iteration it executed.
        ans.append(k - 1 - sum(ans))
        ans.append(k + 1)
        ans.append(2 * k + 1)
        for i in range(lk, l):
            ans.append(2 ** i)
            
        #State: Output State: `total` is an empty list, `bk` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n`, `lk` is the length of `bk` which must be at least 5, `n` and `k` are integers such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\) and \(1 \leq k \leq n\), and `k` is not equal to 1, `i` is equal to `lk + (lk - 1)`, `ans` is a list containing the values `2` and `2` repeated `lk - 1` times.
        #
        #To understand this output state, let's break it down:
        #- The loop runs from `i = lk` to `i = l - 1`.
        #- Since `lk` is the length of the binary representation of `k` and it is at least 5, the loop will run `l - lk` times.
        #- Each iteration appends `2 ** i` to the list `ans`.
        #- After the loop completes, `ans` will contain `[k + 1, 2 * k + 1]` followed by `2 ** i` for each `i` from `lk` to `l - 1`.
        #
        #Thus, the final state of `ans` will be a list starting with `[k + 1, 2 * k + 1]` and then followed by `2 ** i` for each `i` from `lk` to `l - 1`.
    #State: `ans` is a list. If `k` is 1, then `ans` contains all powers of 2 from \(2^2\) to \(2^{1000000}\). Otherwise, `ans` starts with `[k + 1, 2 * k + 1]` followed by \(2^i\) for each `i` from the length of the binary representation of `k` to `l - 1`.
    return str(len(ans)) + '\n' + ' '.join(map(str, ans))
    #The program returns the length of the list `ans` as a string, followed by the elements of `ans` joined by spaces.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function does not accept any parameters and returns either the string '1\n2' or the length of the list `ans` as a string followed by the elements of `ans` joined by spaces.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the string '1\n2'

Case_2: The program returns the length of the list `ans` as a string, followed by the elements of `ans` joined by spaces.

The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
