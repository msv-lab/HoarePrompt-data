Output State: **`sys.stdout.write` outputs the result of `func_14()` followed by a newline, and `func_10()` returns a value of at least 1.**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.write(str(func_14()) + '\n')` writes the result of `func_14()` converted to a string followed by a newline to the standard output. The precondition that `func_10()` must return a value of at least 1 remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the action of writing the result of `func_14()` and the unchanged precondition about `func_10()`.
