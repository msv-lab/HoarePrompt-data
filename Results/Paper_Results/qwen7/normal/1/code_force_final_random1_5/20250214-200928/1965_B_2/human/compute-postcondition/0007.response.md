Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: t (an integer representing the number of test cases), n (an integer), and k (an integer). It processes each test case, where it takes n and k as inputs, and returns different outputs based on the conditions specified in the problem statement.**

(Note: Since the specific conditions and outputs for the problem statement are not provided, the description focuses on the general structure and parameters of the function.)
