Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find a sequence `a` of at most 25 non-negative integers.
   - The sequence should not have any subsequence that sums to `k`.
   - For all `1 ≤ v ≤ n` where `v ≠ k`, there must be a subsequence of `a` that sums to `v`.

2. **Program Structure**:
   - The program defines several utility functions, but these are not used in the main logic.
   - The main logic is encapsulated in `func_14()` which is called inside `func_15()`.

3. **Function `func_14()`**:
   - This function takes two arguments `n` and `k`.
   - It converts `n` and `k` to binary representations.
   - If `k == 1`, it handles a special case where `n == 2`.
   - Otherwise, it constructs a sequence `ans`:
     - If `k` is 1, it creates a sequence `[2, 3, 2^i for i in range(2, l)]`.
     - Otherwise, it creates a sequence `[2^i for i in range(lk - 1)] + [k - 1 - sum(ans), k + 1, 2 * k + 1] + [2^i for i in range(lk, l)]`.

4. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The constructed sequence ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` because the sequence includes specific values that prevent this.
   - The sequence also ensures that every value from 1 to `n` except `k` can be formed by some subsequence due to the inclusion of powers of 2 and other carefully chosen values.

5. **Output**:
   - The function returns a string representation of the sequence, which is then printed in `func_15()`.

### Verification:

- The logic in `func_14()` correctly constructs a sequence that meets the problem requirements.
- The sequence construction ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` and that every value from 1 to `n` (except `k`) can be formed by a subsequence.
- The program handles all test cases as per the examples provided.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
