Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(2, l)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `l`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
   - `i` is 2
   - `l` is the length of `b` and must be greater than or equal to 2
   - `ans` contains the value 4

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop `for i in range(2, l)` will continue as long as `i` is less than `l`.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 3.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `i < l`. Given that `i` is now 3, `l` must still be greater than or equal to 3 to allow the loop to execute.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` is updated to 3.
   - `l` must be greater than or equal to 3.
   - The state of `ans` remains unchanged since it is not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 3, `l` is the length of `b` and must be greater than or equal to 3, `ans` contains the value 4**
