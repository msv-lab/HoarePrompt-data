### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly initializes the field dimensions and parses the initial state of the field, including players, goals, and the Quaffle. This part seems accurate based on the provided code.

2. **Movement and Action Handling**:
   - The program handles movements and actions for players and the Quaffle. It updates the positions of players and the Quaffle based on the input actions.
   - The logic for handling collisions with Bludgers and eliminating players is correctly implemented. Players are eliminated when they are on the same cell as a Bludger, and the Quaffle's position is updated accordingly.

3. **Scoring Logic**:
   - The scoring logic is correctly implemented. When a player throws the Quaffle into the opponent's goal, the appropriate team scores a point, and the Quaffle is reset to the middle of the field.
   - The program correctly identifies and prints the team that scored and updates the score accordingly.

4. **Elimination Handling**:
   - The program correctly identifies and prints the elimination of players when they collide with Bludgers. The players are sorted alphabetically before printing their elimination status.

5. **Final Score Output**:
   - The program correctly outputs the final score at the end of the game.

6. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is used to update the positions of entities based on the movement commands. The function works correctly by adding the movement vector to the current position.

Given that the provided code accurately implements the problem requirements and handles all aspects of the game as described, the program appears to be correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
