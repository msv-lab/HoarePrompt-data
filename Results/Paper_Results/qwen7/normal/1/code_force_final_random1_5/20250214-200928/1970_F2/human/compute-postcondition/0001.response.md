Output State: **`a` is a list of strings, `x` is the first element of `a`, `y` is the second element of `a`, `dx` is the first element of `b`, `dy` is the second element of `b`.**

Explanation: The code `dx, dy = b` unpacks the tuple `b` into two variables `dx` and `dy`. Since `b` is not defined in the initial state, `dx` and `dy` take the values from the first and second elements of `b`, respectively. The values of `a`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
