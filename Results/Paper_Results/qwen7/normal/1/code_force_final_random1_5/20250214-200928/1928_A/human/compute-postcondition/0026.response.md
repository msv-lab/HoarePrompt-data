Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies `i` as the iterator variable. It also implies that the loop will run for a number of iterations equal to the integer value of the input.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `t` is the new input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `a` is the first input integer from the split.
   - `b` is the second input integer from the split.

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `int(input())` iterations. Since the if condition always evaluates to true, the values of `i`, `t`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - The value of `t` remains the same as it is not used within the loop body.
   - The values of `a` and `b` remain the same as they are not used within the loop body.

5. **Determine the New State**:
   - `i` will be 2 (since it was 1 and is incremented by 1).
   - `t` remains the same.
   - `a` remains the same.
   - `b` remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 2, `t` is the new input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is the first input integer from the split, `b` is the second input integer from the split**.
