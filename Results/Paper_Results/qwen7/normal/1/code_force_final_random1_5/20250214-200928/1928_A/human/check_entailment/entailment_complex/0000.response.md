Reasoning:

The annotated program does not accurately reflect the logic required to solve the problem. Let's break down the requirements and the current implementation:

1. **Problem Requirements**: 
   - Bob needs to cut an \(a \times b\) rectangle into two smaller rectangles and then use those to form a new rectangle.
   - If two rectangles differ only by a 90-degree rotation, they are considered the same.
   - We need to check if it's possible to form a new rectangle from the two resulting rectangles after cutting.

2. **Current Implementation Issues**:
   - The conditions in the `if-elif-else` block do not correctly determine whether a new rectangle can be formed.
   - Specifically, the conditions `a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0` and `(a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b)` are not relevant to the problem statement.
   - The conditions `(a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0` also do not make sense in this context.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - A rectangle can always be cut into two smaller rectangles.
   - To form a new rectangle, the two smaller rectangles must be able to be rearranged to form a different rectangle.
   - The key insight is that if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, we can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and rearrange them to form a new rectangle. This is because at least one of the dimensions will allow for even division, allowing us to form a new rectangle.

Given this, the correct logic should be:
- If either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, print "Yes".
- Otherwise, print "No".

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')

# State: i is 3, t is the new input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), a is the first input integer from the split, b is the second input integer from the split.
```

Since the provided function does not match the correct logic, the correctness of the given program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
