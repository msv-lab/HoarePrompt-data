Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases according to the problem description. Specifically, the program fails to consider the scenario where one dimension is 1. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Case Analysis**:
   - **Case 1**: When both dimensions `a` and `b` are even.
     - The program correctly prints 'yes' because both dimensions can be halved.
   - **Case 2**: When one dimension is 1.
     - The program incorrectly prints 'no' because it does not check if the other dimension can be split into two equal parts. For example, a 2x1 rectangle can be split into two 1x1 rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form a 1x2 rectangle, which is considered the same as the original but rotated.
   - **Case 3**: When one dimension is greater than the other and their difference is odd.
     - The program incorrectly prints 'yes' because it does not properly handle the condition where the difference between the dimensions is odd. For example, a 3x2 rectangle can be split into two 3x1 rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form a 1x6 rectangle, which is different from the original.

2. **Example where the program fails**:
   - Input: `1 2`
   - Expected Output: `Yes`
   - Actual Output: `No`

The program fails to recognize that a 1x2 rectangle can be split into two 1x1 rectangles, which can then be rearranged to form a 2x1 rectangle, which is considered the same as the original but rotated. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
