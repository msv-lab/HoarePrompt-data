Output: **yes**

Explanation: The initial state provides us with the following information:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is initialized to 0.
- `a` and `b` are input integers where at least one of them is odd.
- The difference between `a` and `b` is not equal to zero and is odd.

The `print('yes')` statement simply outputs the string `'yes'`. Since no variables are being referenced within the print statement, the output is directly the string `'yes'`.
