Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer. If both `a` and `b` are even numbers, then `t` remains unchanged, `i` remains 0, and both `a` and `b` remain their original values. Otherwise, at least one of `a` or `b` is odd, and either `a - b` equals `-a` with `a` being the value after the operation, or `b - a` equals `-b` with `b` being the value after the operation, or neither \(a - b = -a\) nor \(b - a = -b\). The condition remains unchanged if the difference between `a` and `b` is not equal to zero and is odd, and if the difference between `a` and `b` is even, the condition remains unchanged as well.
