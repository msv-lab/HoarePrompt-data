Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, a and b are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    a, b = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
        print('yes')
    elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):
        print('no')
    elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:
        print('yes')
    else:
        print('no')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer. If both `a` and `b` are even numbers, `a` and `b` remain unchanged. Otherwise, at least one of `a` or `b` is odd, and either (`a - b` equals `-a` with `a` being the value after the operation, or `b - a` equals `-b` with `b` being the value after the operation) or neither \(a - b = -a\) nor \(b - a = -b\). The condition remains unchanged if the difference between `a` and `b` is not equal to zero and is odd, and if the difference between `a` and `b` is even, the condition remains unchanged as well.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 1, `t` is the new input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is the first input integer from the split, `b` is the second input integer from the split. Since the if condition always evaluates to true, the values of `i`, `t`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 2, `t` is the new input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is the first input integer from the split, `b` is the second input integer from the split.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
