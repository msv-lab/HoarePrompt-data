Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, `a1` equals `a2` which are both `a/2`, `b1` equals `b2` which are both `b//2`.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. However, since no loop was specified in the initial state, the values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
