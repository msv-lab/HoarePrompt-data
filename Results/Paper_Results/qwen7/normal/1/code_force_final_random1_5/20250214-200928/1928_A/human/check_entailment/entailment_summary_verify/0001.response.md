### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identified several logical errors in the given program. Let's break down the issues and provide a detailed analysis:

1. **Incorrect Conditions for "Yes" Output**:
   - The condition `if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:` is correct. If both dimensions are even, a new rectangle can be formed by cutting them into smaller even-sized rectangles.
   - The condition `elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):` is incorrect. The tuple creation `(a - b == -a, a)` and `(b - a == -b, b)` is not meaningful and does not serve the intended purpose. Instead, it should check if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is zero, indicating that the rectangle is a square and cannot form a different rectangle.
   - The condition `elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:` is also incorrect. It should check if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is odd, which means a new rectangle can be formed.

2. **Incorrect Conditions for "No" Output**:
   - The current logic for printing 'no' is incorrect and incomplete. It should print 'no' if neither of the above conditions for 'yes' are met, but the current logic does not cover all cases correctly.

### Correct Conditions:
- A rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles and reformed into a different rectangle if at least one of the following conditions is met:
  - Both dimensions are even.
  - One dimension is exactly double the other (i.e., `a == 2 * b` or `b == 2 * a`).

### Revised Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        elif a == 2 * b or b == 2 * a:
            print('no')
        else:
            print('yes')

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- If both `a` and `b` are even, we can always form a new rectangle by cutting them into smaller even-sized rectangles.
- If one dimension is exactly double the other, it means the rectangle is a multiple of a smaller rectangle, and no new distinct rectangle can be formed.
- In all other cases, a new rectangle can be formed.

### Conclusion:
The given program has logical errors and does not correctly implement the solution. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
