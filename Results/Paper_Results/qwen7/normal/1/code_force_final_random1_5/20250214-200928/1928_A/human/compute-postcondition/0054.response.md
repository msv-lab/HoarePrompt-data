Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 0.
- `a` is an integer from the input.
- `b` is an integer from the input.
- `a1` is `a` divided by 2.
- `a2` is `a` divided by 2.

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'Yes'`.

Since the `print` statement does not reference any of the variables `t`, `a`, `b`, `a1`, or `a2`, and only outputs a fixed string, the output will be:

Output: **Yes**
