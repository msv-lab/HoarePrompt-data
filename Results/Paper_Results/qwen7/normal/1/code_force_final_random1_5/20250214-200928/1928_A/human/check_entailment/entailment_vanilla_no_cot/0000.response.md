Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Even Sides:**
   - The condition `if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:` checks if both dimensions are even. If this is true, it prints 'yes', which is incorrect. Cutting an even-sized rectangle into two smaller rectangles will always result in at least one odd-sized dimension, which means you cannot form a new rectangle without rotating.

2. **Incorrect Condition for Single Test Case:**
   - The condition `(a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):` is incorrectly formatted and does not serve its intended purpose. It should check if one side is exactly double the other, but the way it is written makes no sense.

3. **Incorrect Logic for Odd Differences:**
   - The condition `elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:` is redundant and incorrect. The modulus operation will always return either 0, 1, or -1, so this condition is always true.

4. **Missing Cases:**
   - The program does not handle all edge cases properly. For instance, it does not correctly identify when a rectangle can be split into smaller rectangles that can form a new rectangle.

### Correct Implementation:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        # If either dimension is 1, no new rectangle can be formed
        if a == 1 or b == 1:
            print('No')
        # If both dimensions are equal, no new rectangle can be formed
        elif a == b:
            print('No')
        # If one dimension is twice the other, a new rectangle can be formed
        elif a == 2 * b or b == 2 * a:
            print('Yes')
        # If both dimensions are even, a new rectangle can be formed
        elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        # If the difference between dimensions is odd, a new rectangle can be formed
        elif (a - b) % 2 != 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')

func()
```

This corrected implementation handles all the necessary conditions to determine if Bob can form a new rectangle from the given dimensions.
