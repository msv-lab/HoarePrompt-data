Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, `a1` is `a` divided by 2, `a2` is `a` divided by 2.**

Explanation: The code splits `a` into two parts, each being `a // 2`. Since `a` is an integer from the input, `a1` and `a2` both take the value of `a` divided by 2 using integer division. The values of `t`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
