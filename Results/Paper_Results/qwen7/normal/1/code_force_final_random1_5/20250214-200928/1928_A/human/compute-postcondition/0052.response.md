Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 - 1, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, `a, b` are assigned the values from the input split and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `a` and `b` respectively. The initial conditions for `t`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged except that now `a` and `b` hold the specific integer values entered by the user.
