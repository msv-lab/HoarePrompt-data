Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - It reads two integers `a` and `b` for each test case, which represents the dimensions of the rectangle.

2. **Conditions for "Yes" Output**:
   - The program checks if both `a` and `b` are even (`a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0`). If true, it prints 'yes', indicating that a new rectangle can be formed.
   - The program then checks if the difference between `a` and `b` is equal to `-a` or `-b`. This condition seems incorrect and redundant. It should check if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is zero, which would mean the rectangle is already a square and cannot form a different rectangle.
   - The program then checks if `(a - b) % 2` is not zero. This condition is also incorrect and redundant. It should check if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is odd, which means a new rectangle can be formed.

3. **Conditions for "No" Output**:
   - The program incorrectly handles the conditions for printing 'no'. It should print 'no' if none of the above conditions for 'yes' are met, but the current logic does not cover all cases correctly.

### Correct Conditions:
- A rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles and reformed into a different rectangle if at least one of the following conditions is met:
  - Both dimensions are even.
  - One dimension is exactly double the other (i.e., `a == 2 * b` or `b == 2 * a`).

### Revised Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        elif a == 2 * b or b == 2 * a:
            print('no')
        else:
            print('yes')

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- If both `a` and `b` are even, we can always form a new rectangle by cutting them into smaller even-sized rectangles.
- If one dimension is exactly double the other, it means the rectangle is a multiple of a smaller rectangle, and no new distinct rectangle can be formed.
- In all other cases, a new rectangle can be formed.

### Conclusion:
The given program has logical errors and does not correctly implement the solution. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
