Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `t` is the new input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is the first input integer from the split, `b` is the second input integer from the split. Since the if condition `(a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0` is always true, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.**
