Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, `a1` is `a` divided by 2, `a2` is `a` divided by 2, and we continue the loop.**

The `continue` statement causes the flow of the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by the `continue` statement, their values remain unchanged. Therefore, the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `a1`, and `a2` stay the same, and the loop continues.
