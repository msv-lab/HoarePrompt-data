Based on the initial state provided:

- `m` must be greater than 0 (though `m` is not used in the print statement).
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer.
- `i` is calculated as `c[b] - c[a - 1]`.
- `s` is calculated as `p[b] - p[a - 1]`.
- The difference `s - (b - a + 1)` is greater than or equal to `i`.
- `b - a + 1` is greater than 1.

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('YES')
```

This statement will print the string 'YES' regardless of the values of the other variables.

Output: **YES**
