Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 1, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers with the first element being 1, `p` is a list containing two elements [0, 1], `c` is a list containing the elements [0, 1]**.

Explanation: The code `c.append(j)` appends the value of `j` (which is 1) to the list `c`. Initially, `c` contains the single element 0. After appending `j`, `c` now contains the elements [0, 1]. All other variables remain unchanged.
