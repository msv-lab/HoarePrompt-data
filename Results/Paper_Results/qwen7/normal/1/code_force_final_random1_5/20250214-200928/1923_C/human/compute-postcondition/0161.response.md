Output State: **`m` must be at least 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, `a` is the first input integer, `b` is the second input integer.**

Explanation: The code `i = c[b] - c[a - 1]` updates the value of `i` to `c[b] - c[a - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
