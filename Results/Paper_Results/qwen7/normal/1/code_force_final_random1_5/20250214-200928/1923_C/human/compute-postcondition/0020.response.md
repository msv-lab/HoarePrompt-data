Output State: **`i` is 1 + `x`, `j` is 2, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers with the first element being 1 and the second element being 1, `p` is a list containing three elements [0, 1, 1 + `x`], `c` is a list containing the elements [0, 1, 2]**.

Explanation: The code `c.append(j)` appends the value of `j` (which is 2) to the list `c`. Initially, `c` contains the elements [0, 1]. After appending `j`, `c` becomes [0, 1, 2]. All other variables remain unchanged.
