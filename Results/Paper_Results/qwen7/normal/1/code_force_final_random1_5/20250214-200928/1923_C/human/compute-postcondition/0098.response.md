Output State: **`i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, `m` is decreased by 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `s = p[b] - p[a - 1]` does not change the value of `s`. It simply reassigns the value of `s` to the same expression `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, which was already the value of `s` before. The other variables (`i`, `m`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
