Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is calculated as `c[b] - c[a - 1]`
- `s` is calculated as `p[b] - p[a - 1]`
- `m` is assigned the value `m - 1`
- `a` is an input integer
- `b` is an input integer

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

Since the `print` statement does not depend on the values of `i`, `s`, or `m`, and only outputs a fixed string, the output will be:

Output: **'YES'**
