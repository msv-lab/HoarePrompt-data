Output State: **`i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, `m` is decreased by 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `a` and `b`. The values of `i` and `s` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Additionally, `m` is decreased by 1 as stated in the initial state. The values of `a` and `b` are set to the integers input by the user.
