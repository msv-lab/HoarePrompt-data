Output State: **`x` is equal to 1, `j` is increased by 1, `l` must have at least one element, `i` is increased by 1, `p` contains the value `i+1`.**

Explanation: The code `p.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is increased by 1) to the list `p`. Since `i` was increased by 1 before this line, `p` now contains `i+1`. All other variables remain in their previous states.
