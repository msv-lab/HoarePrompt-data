Output State: **`x` is the next element in the list `l` (if it exists), `i` is increased by the value of `x`, `j` is increased by 2, `p` is a list containing the new value of `i`, `c` is a list containing the new value of `j`**.

Explanation: The code `i += x` increments `i` by the value of `x`. Since `x` is the next element in the list `l` (if it exists), `i` is increased by the value of `x`. The value of `j` is increased by 2, and `p` and `c` are lists containing the new values of `i` and `j`, respectively. The condition `if x == 1 then i and j are each incremented by 2; otherwise, i and j are also incremented by 2` does not affect the current operation since `i += x` has already taken place.
