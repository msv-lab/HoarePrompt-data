Output State: **`x` is 1; `i` is increased by 1; `j` is increased by 1; `p` is a list containing the value of `i`; `c` is a list containing the value of `j`.**

Explanation: The code `c.append(j)` appends the current value of `j` to the list `c`. Before the code execution, `i` is increased by 1 and `j` is increased by 1. Also, `p` is a list containing the value of `i` (which means `p` contains the value of `i` before `i` was increased). Since `j` is increased by 1, `c` will contain the new value of `j`.
