Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(m)`. The only variable mentioned here is `m`, which determines the number of iterations.

2. **Determine the initial state needed for the loop to execute**: For the loop to execute, `m` must be a positive integer (greater than 0). The other variables (`i`, `j`, `p`, and `c`) are not directly involved in determining whether the loop can execute; they are modified within the loop body.

3. **Adjust the state accordingly**: Since the loop depends on `m`, we need to ensure that `m` is greater than 0. The other variables (`i`, `j`, `p`, and `c`) do not need to be adjusted because their values will be modified during the loop execution.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `m`.

**State: **`m` must be greater than 0**
