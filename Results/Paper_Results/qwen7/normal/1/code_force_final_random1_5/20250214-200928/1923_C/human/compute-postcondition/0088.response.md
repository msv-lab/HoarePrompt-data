Output State: **`i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `p[b] - p[a - 1]` to the variable `s`. The values of `i` and the arrays `c` and `p` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `i` is still `c[b] - c[a - 1]` and `s` is now `p[b] - p[a - 1]`.
