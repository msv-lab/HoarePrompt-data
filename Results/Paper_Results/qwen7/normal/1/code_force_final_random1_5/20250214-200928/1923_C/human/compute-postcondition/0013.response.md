Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 1, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers with the first element being 1, `p` is a list containing two elements [0, 1], `c` is a list containing one element which is 0.**

Explanation: The code snippet `p.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 1) to the list `p`. Initially, `p` contains only one element, which is 0. After appending `i`, `p` now contains two elements: 0 and 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
