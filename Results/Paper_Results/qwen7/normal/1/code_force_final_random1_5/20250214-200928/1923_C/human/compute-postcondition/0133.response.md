Output State: **`x` is the next element in the list `l`, `i` is increased by the value of `x` plus 1, `j` is increased by 3, `p` is a list containing the new value of `i` and an additional element `i`, `c` is a list containing the new value of `j` and an additional element `j`.**

Explanation: The code `j += 1` increments the value of `j` by 1. Since `i` was previously increased by the value of `x`, the new value of `i` is now `x + 1`. Therefore, the updated value of `i` is increased by 1 more, making it `x + 2`. The value of `j` is increased by 2 from the initial state and then incremented by 1, making it `j + 3`. The lists `p` and `c` remain unchanged in terms of their structure but their last elements are updated to reflect the new values of `i` and `j`, respectively.
