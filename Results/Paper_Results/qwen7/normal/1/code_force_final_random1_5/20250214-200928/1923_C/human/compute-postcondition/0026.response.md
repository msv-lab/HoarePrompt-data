Output State: **`i` is 2 + x, `j` is 3, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers with the first element being 1 and the second element being 1, `p` is a list containing four elements [0, 1, 2, (2 + x)], `c` is a list containing the elements [0, 1, 2, 3]**.

Explanation: The code appends the value of `j` (which is 3) to the list `c`. Initially, `c` contains `[0, 1, 2]`. After appending `j`, `c` becomes `[0, 1, 2, 3]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
