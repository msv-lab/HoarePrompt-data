Postcondition: `x` is the next element in the list `l` (if it exists), `i` is increased by 2, `j` is increased by 2, `p` is a list containing the new value of `i`, `c` is a list containing the new value of `j`. If `x` equals 1, `i` and `j` are each incremented by an additional 1 compared to the else case.
