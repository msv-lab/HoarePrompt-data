Output State: **`i` is 3, `j` is increased by 1, `l` must contain the value 1, `x` is 1, `p` contains the value [3, 2], `c` is a list containing the value [2, 2]**.

Explanation: The code `i += x` increments the value of `i` by the value of `x`. Given that `x` is 1 and `i` is initially 2, `i` becomes 3. The other variables (`j`, `l`, `p`, and `c`) remain unchanged.
