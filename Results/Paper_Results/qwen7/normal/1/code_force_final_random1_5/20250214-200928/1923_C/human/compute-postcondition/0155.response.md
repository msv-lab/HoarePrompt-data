Based on the initial state provided:

- `m` must be at least 2.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer.
- `i` is calculated as `c[b] - c[a - 1]`.
- `s` is calculated as `p[b] - p[a - 1]`.

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`. There are no variables or objects whose values need to be substituted into this string because the string itself does not depend on the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, or `p`.

Output: **YES**
