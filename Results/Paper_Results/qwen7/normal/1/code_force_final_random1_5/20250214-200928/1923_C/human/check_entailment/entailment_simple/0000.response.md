### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to determine if a subarray is "good" based on the given conditions. A subarray is considered "good" if there exists another array \( b \) such that:
   - The sums of the elements in both arrays are equal.
   - No element in the subarray is the same as its corresponding element in \( b \).
   - All elements in \( b \) are positive.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads multiple test cases and processes each one separately.
   - It initializes lists `p` and `c` to keep track of cumulative sums and counts of 1s, respectively.
   - For each subarray defined by the indices \( l_i \) and \( r_i \), it calculates the sum of the subarray (`s`) and the count of 1s within the subarray (`i`).
   - The condition `b - a + 1 > 1 and s - (b - a + 1) >= i` is used to determine if the subarray is "good".

3. **Condition Analysis**:
   - `b - a + 1 > 1`: This ensures the subarray has more than one element.
   - `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`: This checks if the sum of the subarray minus the number of elements in the subarray is at least the count of 1s in the subarray. This condition indirectly ensures that there are enough non-1 elements to form a valid array \( b \).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code correctly handles the edge case where the subarray has only one element (`b - a + 1 <= 1`), which would always result in "NO".
   - The condition `s - (b - a + 1) >= i` ensures that there are enough non-1 elements to satisfy the second and third conditions of a "good" subarray.

5. **Output**:
   - The code prints "YES" if the subarray meets the conditions, and "NO" otherwise.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is "good" based on the given conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
