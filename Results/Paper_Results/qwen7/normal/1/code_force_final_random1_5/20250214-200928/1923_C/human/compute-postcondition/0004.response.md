Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `p` is a list containing one element which is 0, `c` is a list containing one element which is 0.**

The code initializes `c` as a list containing a single element `0`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, or `p`. Therefore, their states remain unchanged.
