Output State: **All elements in list `l` have been iterated over; `i` is the sum of all elements in `l`; `j` is the count of 1s in `l`; `p` is a list containing all intermediate values of `i` after each iteration; `c` is a list containing all intermediate values of `j` after each iteration, with each value repeated according to its occurrence in the loop.**

In this final state, `i` will hold the total sum of all elements in the list `l`. The variable `j` will hold the count of how many times the value 1 appeared in `l`. The list `p` will contain the cumulative sum of elements in `l` after each iteration, and `c` will contain the cumulative count of 1s in `l`, with each count repeated as many times as it was incremented during the loop.
