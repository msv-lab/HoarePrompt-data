Output State: **`m` must be at least 2, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input and assigns them to variables `a` and `b`. The values of `m`, `i`, and `s` remain unchanged from their previous states. Therefore, the updated states are that `a` and `b` are now input integers, while `m`, `i`, and `s` retain their original conditions and values.
