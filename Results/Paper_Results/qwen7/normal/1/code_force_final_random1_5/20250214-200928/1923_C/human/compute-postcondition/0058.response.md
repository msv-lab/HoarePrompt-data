Output State: **`i` is the sum of all elements in the list `l`, `j` is the length of the list `l`, `m` is 0, `a` is the input integer `k`, `b` is the input integer `k`, `s` is `p[k] - p[k - 1]`, `n` is the first input integer from `input().split()`, `t` is a positive integer, `l` is updated to a list of integers from the input, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of `l`, `c` is a list containing the count of occurrences of 1 in `l`, `n, m = map(int, input().split())` executes and `n` and `m` are assigned the respective integers from the input, `p` is now `[0]`**.

Explanation: The code initializes the list `p` with a single element `[0]`. This does not affect the values of `i`, `j`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `s`, `n`, `t`, `l`, `c`, or the assignment of `n` and `m` from the input. Therefore, these variables retain their previous states. The only change is that `p` is now initialized as `[0]`.
