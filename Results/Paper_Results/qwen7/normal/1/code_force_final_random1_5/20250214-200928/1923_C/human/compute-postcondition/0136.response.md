Output State: **`x` is the next element in the list `l`; if `x` equals 1, then `i` is increased by `x + 1`, `j` is increased by 3, `p` is a list containing the new value of `i` and an additional element `i`, `c` is a list containing the new value of `j` and an additional element `j`; if `x` does not equal 1, then `i` is increased by `x`, `j` is increased by 2, `p` is a list containing the new value of `i` and an additional element `i`, `c` is a list containing the new value of `j` and an additional element `j`.**

This means that the value of `i` and `j` will be updated based on the value of `x`. If `x` is 1, `i` will be increased by `x + 1` (which is 2), and `j` will be increased by 3. If `x` is not 1, `i` will be increased by `x`, and `j` will be increased by 2. The lists `p` and `c` will contain the new values of `i` and `j` respectively, along with an additional element which is the new value of `i` and `j` respectively.
