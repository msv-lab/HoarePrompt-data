Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    1
    
    5 4
    
    1 2 1 4 5
    
    1 5
    
    4 4
    
    3 4
    
    1 3

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO

# Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = [0]
        c = [0]
        (i, j) = (0, 0)
        for x in l:
            if x == 1:
                j += 1
            i += x
            p.append(i)
            c.append(j)
        for _ in range(m):
            (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
            i = c[b] - c[a - 1]
            s = p[b] - p[a - 1]
            if b - a + 1 > 1 and s - (b - a + 1) >= i:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')





# Execution Summary:
The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads two integers \( n \) and \( m \), followed by a list of \( n \) integers \( l \). It then handles \( m \) queries, each defined by two integers \( a \) and \( b \). For each query, it calculates the number of 1s in the subarray from index \( a-1 \) to \( b \) and the sum of the subarray. Based on these calculations, it prints 'YES' if the subarray meets a specific condition (i.e., the number of 1s plus the length of the subarray minus one is less than or equal to the sum of the subarray), otherwise it prints 'NO'. After processing all queries for a test case, the function moves on to the next test case until all test cases are processed.
