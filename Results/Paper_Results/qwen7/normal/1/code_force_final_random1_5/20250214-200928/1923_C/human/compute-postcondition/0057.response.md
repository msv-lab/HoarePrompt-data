Output State: **`i` is the sum of all elements in the list `l`, `j` is the length of the list `l`, `m` is 0, `a` is the input integer `k`, `b` is the input integer `k`, `s` is `p[k] - p[k - 1]`, `n` is the first input integer from `input().split()`, `t` is a positive integer, `l` is updated to a list of integers from the input, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of `l`, `c` is a list containing the count of occurrences of 1 in `l`, `n, m = map(int, input().split())` executes and `n` and `m` are assigned the respective integers from the input.**

Explanation: The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from the input and converts them into a list of integers. This updates the list `l`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
