Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 0, `m` is 0, `a` is the input integer `k`, `b` is the input integer `k`, `s` is `p[k] - p[k - 1]`, `n` is the first input integer from `input().split()`, `t` is a positive integer, `l` is updated to a list of integers from the input, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of `l`, `c` is a list containing the count of occurrences of 1 in `l`, `n, m = map(int, input().split())` executes and `n` and `m` are assigned the respective integers from the input, `p` is now `[0]`, `c` is now `[0]`, `i, j = 0, 0` executes and both `i` and `j` are assigned 0.**

In this output state, the variables `i` and `j` are explicitly set to 0. All other variables retain their previously described states.
