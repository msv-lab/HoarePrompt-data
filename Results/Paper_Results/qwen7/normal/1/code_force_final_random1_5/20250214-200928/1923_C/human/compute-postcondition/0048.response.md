Output State: **`i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `m` is greater than 1, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, and we take two integers as input and assign them to `a` and `b` respectively.**

Explanation: The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to variables `a` and `b`. The values of `i`, `m`, `s`, `a`, and `b` are updated accordingly. The initial values of `i` and `s` remain unchanged, but now `a` and `b` are updated to the input values.
