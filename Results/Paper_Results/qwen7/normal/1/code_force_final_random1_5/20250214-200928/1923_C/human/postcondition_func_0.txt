The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads two integers \( n \) and \( m \), followed by a list of \( n \) integers \( l \). It then handles \( m \) queries, each defined by two integers \( a \) and \( b \). For each query, it calculates the number of 1s in the subarray from index \( a-1 \) to \( b \) and the sum of the subarray. Based on these calculations, it prints 'YES' if the subarray meets a specific condition (i.e., the number of 1s plus the length of the subarray minus one is less than or equal to the sum of the subarray), otherwise it prints 'NO'. After processing all queries for a test case, the function moves on to the next test case until all test cases are processed.
