Output State: **`a` is an integer from the first input split, `b` is an integer from the second input split**.

Explanation: The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input, splits them based on whitespace, and converts each to an integer before assigning them to `a` and `b`. Since the exact input values are not specified, the output state describes `a` and `b` as integers resulting from the input split.
