Output State: **`i` is 3, `j` is increased by 1, `l` must contain the value 1, `x` is 1, `p` contains the value [3, 2, 3], `c` is a list containing the value [2, 2]**.

Explanation: The code `p.append(i)` appends the value of `i`, which is 3, to the list `p`. Initially, `p` contains `[3, 2]`. After appending 3, `p` becomes `[3, 2, 3]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
