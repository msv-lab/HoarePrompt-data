Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, n + 1):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i` and `n`**:
   - From the given state, `i` is initially set to `n + 1`.
   - The variable `n` is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state, but we know that the loop runs from `1` to `n + 1`.

3. **Check if the loop can execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must start from `1` and go up to `n + 1`.
   - Since `i` is currently `n + 1`, the loop will not execute because `i` will never be in the range `[1, n + 1)`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - To ensure the loop can execute, `i` must be set to `1` at the start of the loop.
   - The value of `n` does not need to be adjusted since it is used to define the upper bound of the loop.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `i` is `1` at the start of the loop.

**State:**
**`i` is 1, `n` remains as it is**
