Output State: **`x` is an array where the element at index `j-1` is equal to 'F', and the element at index `i` is incremented by 1, and the element at index `j` is increased by 1.**

The code `a[j] += 1` increments the value of the element at index `j` in the array `x` by 1. The element at index `i` was already incremented by 1 in the initial state, and the element at index `j-1` remains 'F'.
