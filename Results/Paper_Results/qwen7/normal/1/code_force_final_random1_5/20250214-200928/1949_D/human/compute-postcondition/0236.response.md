Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in the given for loop is `j`. The loop runs from `1` to `n + 1`.

2. **Understand the postcondition**: The postcondition provided is based on the values of `i` and `j` relative to `n/4`. Specifically:
   - If `i` is in the range from `1` to `n/4` or `j` is in the range from `1` to `n/4`, then `nx` is 'F'.
   - Otherwise, `nx` is 'S'.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `nx` is either 'F' or 'S'.
   - `i` and `j` are not explicitly mentioned in the postcondition, but they are part of the loop head.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `j` from `1` to `n + 1`, the value of `j` will increase by `1` in each iteration.
   - We need to ensure that the condition for `nx` remains consistent with the postcondition.

5. **Consider the possible scenarios**:
   - If `nx` is currently 'F', it means either `i` is in the range from `1` to `n/4` or `j` (at the end of the previous iteration) is in the range from `1` to `n/4`.
   - For the loop to continue, `j` needs to be in the range from `1` to `n/4` in the next iteration.

6. **Adjust the states**:
   - `j` will be incremented by `1` in the next iteration.
   - To keep `nx` as 'F', `j` must still be in the range from `1` to `n/4` in the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `nx` is either 'F' or 'S'.
- `j` is incremented by `1` from its previous value.

Given that `j` was in the range from `1` to `n/4` in the previous iteration, for the loop to continue, `j` must still be in this range in the next iteration.

State: **`nx` is either 'F' or 'S', `j` is in the range from `1` to `n/4`**
