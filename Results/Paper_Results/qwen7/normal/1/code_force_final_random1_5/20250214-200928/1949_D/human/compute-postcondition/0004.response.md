Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the value `n + 1`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `n + 1`.
   - `n` is an integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 24\).

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n + 1`.

Given this, we need to ensure that the loop can start and continue executing. This means that `i` should be initialized to 1 and `n + 1` should be such that the loop can run.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1, we need to set `i` to 1.
   - For the loop to execute, `n + 1` must be a valid number within the range, which means `n` must be within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 24\). However, since we are setting `i` to 1, `n + 1` will always be a valid number in this context.

5. **List the adjusted states**:
   - `i` must be 1.
   - `n` must be within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 24\) (though this is not strictly necessary since `i` is already set to 1, but it's good to mention for completeness).

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 24\)**.
