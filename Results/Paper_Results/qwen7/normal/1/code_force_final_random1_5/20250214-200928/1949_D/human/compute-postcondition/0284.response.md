Postcondition: `nx` is either 'S' or 'F', `i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be at least 1, `nx` is an empty string, `j` is 1, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is `'?'`. Additionally, the condition is met where either `i` is in the first quarter of `sb` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb` if `nx` is 'S'. If `nx` is 'F', then neither `i` nor `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`.
