Output State: **`j` is between 2 and `n` inclusive, `n` must be greater than 0, `b[i]` is increased by 1**.

The code `b[i] += 1` increments the value of `b[i]` by 1. Since `i` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot specify its exact value, but we know that `b[i]` is increased by 1. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
