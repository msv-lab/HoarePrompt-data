Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for j in range(1, n + 1):`. The variables involved in this loop head are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `nx` is either 'S' or 'F' plus the value of `xx[i][3]`.
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `n` is at least 4.
   - `j` is 4.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**: The loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = n`. Since `j` starts at 1 and increases by 1 in each iteration, the loop will continue as long as `j < n + 1`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 4.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to 5.
   - The value of `n` remains the same (at least 4).

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `j`.

**State: **`nx` is either 'S' or 'F' plus the value of `xx[i][3]`, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is at least 4, and `j` is 5**.
