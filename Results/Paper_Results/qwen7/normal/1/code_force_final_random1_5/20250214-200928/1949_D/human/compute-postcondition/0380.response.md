Functionality: **The function processes a square grid of size \( n \times n \) where \( n \) is an integer between 2 and 24. Each cell in the grid can contain 'F' (funny), 'S' (scary), '?' (unknown), or '.' (no transition video specified). The function calculates the total number of 'F' and 'S' characters in each column. Based on these counts, it generates two lists: one for columns with more 'F' than 'S', and another for columns with more 'S' than 'F'. Depending on the comparison of these lists' lengths, it fills in the unknown cells ('?') with either 'F' or 'S' and prints the resulting grid.**
