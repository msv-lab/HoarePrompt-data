Output State: **`nx` is either 'FF' or 'FS' or 'SF' or 'SS'; `j` is in the range from `1` to `n/4`.**

Explanation: The code `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` updates the value of `nx` by adding the value of `xx[i][j - 1]` to it. Since `nx` is initially either 'F' or 'S', and `xx[i][j - 1]` can also be either 'F' or 'S', the possible new values for `nx` are 'FF', 'FS', 'SF', or 'SS'. The value of `j` remains unchanged and is still within the range from `1` to `n/4`.
