Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `nx` is 'FS', and `j` is 3**.

Explanation: The variable `nx` was initially either equal to `xx[1][1]` if `xx[1][1]` is not '?', or 'F' or 'S' if `xx[1][1]` is '?'. After executing `nx += 'S'`, `nx` is appended with 'S', resulting in 'FS'. The values of `i`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged.
