Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the range for `j` as `range(1, n + 1)`. Therefore, the variables involved in the loop head are `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `j` is within the range from `1` to `n + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, the postcondition states that `j` is in the range from `1` to `n/4`.

3. **Determine the Next Value of `j`**: Since `j` starts from `1` and increments by `1` each iteration, the next value of `j` would be `j + 1`.

4. **Ensure the Loop Can Execute Again**: For the loop to execute again, `j + 1` must still be within the range from `1` to `n + 1`. Given that `j` was in the range from `1` to `n/4`, the next value `j + 1` should still be within this range.

5. **Adjust the State**: The only variable that needs adjustment is `j`. It should be set to `j + 1`, and it must still be within the range from `1` to `n/4` for the loop to continue.

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`nx` is either 'FF' or 'SF' or 'FS' or 'SS', and `j` is in the range from `1` to `n/4` but incremented by 1**.

Therefore, the final state is:
State: **`nx` is either 'FF' or 'SF' or 'FS' or 'SS', and `j` is in the range from `2` to `n/4`**.
