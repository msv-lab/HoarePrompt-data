Output State: **`nx` is now equal to `xx[i][j - 1]`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, the current value of `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?'.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `xx[i][j - 1]` to the string `nx`. Since `i` is 1 and `j` is 1, it specifically appends the first element of `xx[1]` (assuming `xx` is a list of lists) to `nx`. All other variables remain unchanged.
