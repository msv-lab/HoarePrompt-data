Output State: **`x` is a list where the element at index `j - 1` is 'S' + 2, and all other elements in the list retain their original values.**

Explanation: The code `b[j] += 1` increments the element at index `j` of the list `b` (which is the same as `x`) by 1. Since the initial state specifies that the element at index `j - 1` is `'S' + 1`, incrementing it by 1 results in the element at index `j - 1` becoming `'S' + 2`. All other elements in the list remain unchanged.
