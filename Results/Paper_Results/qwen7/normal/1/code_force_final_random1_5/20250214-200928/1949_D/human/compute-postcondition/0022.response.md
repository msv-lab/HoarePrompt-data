Output State: **`i` is 1 or 2; `n` is an integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 24\); `x` is an input string; `j` is 2; `b[1]` is 2 if `i` was 1 before the increment, otherwise `b[2]` is 2.**

Explanation: The code `b[i] += 1` increments the value of `b[i]` by 1. Since `i` can be either 1 or 2, `b[1]` will be incremented if `i` was 1, making it 2, or `b[2]` will be incremented if `i` was 2, also making it 2. The values of `n`, `x`, and `j` remain unchanged.
