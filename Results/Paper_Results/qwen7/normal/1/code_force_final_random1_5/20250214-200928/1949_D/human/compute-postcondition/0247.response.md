Output State: **`nx` is either 'FFS', 'SFS', 'FSF', or 'SSS', and `j` is in the range from `2` to `n/4`.**

Explanation: The value of `nx` is concatenated with the string `'S'`. Since `nx` can initially be one of 'FF', 'SF', 'FS', or 'SS', after adding 'S', the possible values of `nx` become 'FFS', 'SFS', 'FSF', or 'SSS'. The value of `j` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the operation.
