Output State: **`nx` is 'F', `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is at least 4, and `j` is 3, and `xx[i][2]` is `'?'`, with neither `i` nor `j` being in the first `n // 4` elements of `sb`.**

Explanation: The code `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the string `nx`, making `nx` become 'F'. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `j`, and `xx[i][2]`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
