Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 24\), `x` is an input string, and the character at index `j-1` of `x` is 'S', `b[j]` is incremented by 1.**

The code `b[j] += 1` increments the value of `b[j]` by 1. Since `j` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot specify the exact value of `b[j]`. However, we know that the character at index `j-1` of `x` is 'S'. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
