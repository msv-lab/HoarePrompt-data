Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for j in range(1, n + 1):`. The variables involved in this loop head are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Current Values**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `nx` is determined based on the conditions given.

3. **Conditions for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be 2.
   - `n` remains unchanged and must still be greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `j` needs to be set to 2.
   - `n` remains the same and must still be greater than 0.
   - `nx` is not part of the loop head, so its state does not need to be adjusted here.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`j` is 2, `n` is greater than 0**
