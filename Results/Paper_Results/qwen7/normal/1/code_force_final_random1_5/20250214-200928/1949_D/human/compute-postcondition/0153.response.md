Output State: **`i` is 1; `n` must be greater than 0; `nx` is an empty string**.

The code assigns an empty string to `nx`, which does not affect the values of `i` or `n`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions of `i` being 1 and `n` being greater than 0, while adding that `nx` is now an empty string.
