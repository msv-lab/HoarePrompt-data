Output State: **`i` is 1 or 2; `n` is an integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 24\); `x` is an input string; `j` is 2; `b[1]` is 3 if `i` was 1 before the increment, otherwise `b[2]` is 3.**

Explanation: The code `b[j] += 1` increments the value of `b[j]` by 1. Given that `j` is 2, the value of `b[2]` is incremented by 1. If `i` was 1 before the increment, then `b[1]` would be incremented by 1, making it 3. Otherwise, `b[2]` would be incremented by 1, also making it 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
