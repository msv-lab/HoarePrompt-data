To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the process:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `nx` is a variable whose final value is determined by concatenating all characters from `xx[1][j-1]` where `xx[1][j-1]` is not '?', 'F', or 'S'.
   - The loop continues until `j` reaches `n+1`.

2. **Process**:
   - The loop iterates over `j` starting from 1 up to `n+1`.
   - For each iteration, it checks the character at `xx[1][j-1]`.
   - If the character is not '?', 'F', or 'S', it is concatenated to `nx`.

Given this, the value of `nx` will be a string composed of all characters from `xx[1][j-1]` that are not '?', 'F', or 'S'.

Since the exact content of `xx[1]` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact string `nx` will be. However, we know it will be constructed from the non-excluded characters.

Therefore, the output will be the string `nx` which is constructed by concatenating all valid characters from `xx[1][j-1]`.

Output: **nx (where nx is the concatenation of all characters from xx[1][j-1] that are not '?', 'F', or 'S')**
