Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `sa` is a list containing the integer `i`.**

The code appends the value of `i` to the list `sa`. Since `i` is an integer and the initial state indicates that `a[i]` and `b[i]` are both 0, these values remain unchanged. The list `sa` is newly created and contains only the integer `i`.
