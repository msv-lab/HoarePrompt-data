Output State: **`nx` is the string 'xx[i][j - 1]', `i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be at least 4, `j` is 3.**

Explanation: The code `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` appends the character `xx[i][j - 1]` to the string `nx`. Given the initial state, `nx` is an empty string, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be at least 4, `j` is 3, and the current value of `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?'. Therefore, `nx` becomes the string `xx[i][j - 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
