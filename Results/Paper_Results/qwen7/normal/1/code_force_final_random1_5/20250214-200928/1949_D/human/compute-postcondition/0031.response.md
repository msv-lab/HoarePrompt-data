The code `b[i] += 1` increments the value of `b[i]` by 1. Given the initial state, `i` is either 1 or 2, and `b[1]` is 3 if `i` was 1 before the increment, otherwise `b[2]` is 3. 

- If `i` was 1 before the increment, `b[1]` is initially 3, so after the increment, `b[1]` becomes 4.
- If `i` was 2 before the increment, `b[2]` is initially 3, so after the increment, `b[2]` becomes 4.

The values of the other variables (`n`, `x`, and `j`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is 1 or 2; `n` is an integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 24\); `x` is an input string; `j` is 3; `b[1]` is 4 if `i` was 1 before the increment, otherwise `b[2]` is 4.**
