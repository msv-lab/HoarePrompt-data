Output State: **`nx` is either 'SF' or 'FS', `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is at least 4, and `j` is 4.**

Explanation: The value of `nx` is concatenated with 'F', changing its value from either 'S' or 'F' to either 'SF' or 'FS'. The values of `i`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet.
