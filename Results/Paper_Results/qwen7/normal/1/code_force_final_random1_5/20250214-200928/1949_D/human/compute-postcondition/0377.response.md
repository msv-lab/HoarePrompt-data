Output State: **nx is a string of length n-1 consisting of 'S' and 'F', `i` is n + 1, `j` is n + 1, and `n` is exactly the value it had after the last iteration of the loop.**

Natural Language Description: After the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be incremented to `n + 1`. The loop runs from `1` to `n`, and for each iteration, it constructs a string `nx` based on the conditions provided. By the end of the loop, `nx` will be a string of length `n-1` (since the loop iterates `n` times but `nx` is built up one character per iteration starting from index 0). The value of `j` will be `n + 1` because the loop increments `i` to `n + 1` and `j` is not modified within the loop. The variable `n` will retain its final value from the last iteration of the loop, which is `n`.
