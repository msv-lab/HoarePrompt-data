Output State: `nx` is a string, `i` is `n`, `j` is `n + 1`, and `n` is at least 4. The value of `nx` is constructed based on the following rules throughout the loop's execution:

- If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', then `nx` is appended with the value of `xx[i][j - 1]`.
- If `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', then:
  - If `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb` (i.e., `sb[:n // 4]`), `nx` is appended with 'S'.
  - Otherwise, `nx` is appended with 'F'.

After all iterations of the loop, the loop will terminate when `j` reaches `n + 1`. At this point, `nx` will contain the final concatenated result based on the above conditions applied to each element in `xx[i]` from index 0 to `n`. The variables `i` and `j` will be set to their respective final values as described, and `n` will remain unchanged but still meet the condition of being at least 4.
