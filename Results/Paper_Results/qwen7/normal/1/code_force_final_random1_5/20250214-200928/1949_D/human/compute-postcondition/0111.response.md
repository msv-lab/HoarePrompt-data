Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `xx` contains `n` input strings, `a` and `b` are lists where `a[j]` represents the total occurrences of 'F' at the `j-th` position across all inputs and `b[j]` represents the total occurrences of 'S' at the `j-th` position across all inputs, `sa` is an empty list, `sb` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list `sb`. The values of `i`, `xx`, `a`, `b`, and `sa` remain unchanged from their initial states.
