Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for j in range(1, n + 1):`. The variables involved in this loop are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `j` is initially set to `3` (given in the problem statement).
   - `n` must be at least 3 (given in the problem statement).

3. **Check if the loop can execute**:
   - For the loop `for j in range(1, n + 1)` to execute, the condition `1 <= j < n + 1` must be true.
   - Given that `j` is initially `3`, the loop will only execute if `n >= 4` because `j` starts from `1` and goes up to `n`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `j` is already set to `3`, we don't need to change its value.
   - We need to ensure that `n` is at least `4` to allow the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`nx` is an empty string, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be at least 4, and `j` is 3**
