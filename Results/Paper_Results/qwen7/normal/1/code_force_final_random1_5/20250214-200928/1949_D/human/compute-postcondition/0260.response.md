Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` remains the same, `xx` contains `n` input strings, `a` and `b` are lists where `a[j]` represents the total occurrences of 'F' at the `j-th` position across all inputs and `b[j]` represents the total occurrences of 'S' at the `j-th` position across all inputs, `sa` is a list containing all integers from `1` to `i-1` (inclusive) that satisfy the condition `a[i] > 0 and b[i] == 0`, `sb` is a list containing all integers from `1` to `i-1` (inclusive) that satisfy the condition `b[i] > 0 and a[i] == 0`, and the length of `sa` is less than the length of `sb`; `sb` now includes the integer `1` since `sb.append(1)` was executed.
