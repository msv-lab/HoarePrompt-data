Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State Analysis
- `x` is an array.
- `j` is `j + 1` from the previous iteration.
- The postcondition involves checking `x[j - 1]` and updating arrays `a` and `b` accordingly.

### Loop Head Variables
- The loop variable is `j`.
- The loop runs from `1` to `n + 1`.

### Previous Iteration Details
- At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was `j + 1`.
- Therefore, `j` in the current iteration will be `j + 2`.

### Conditions to Check
- We need to check the value of `x[j - 1]` (which is `x[(j + 1) - 1] = x[j]`).
- Depending on the value of `x[j]`, we update `a[i]`, `a[j]`, `b[i]`, and `b[j]`.

### Adjusting States
- `j` will be `j + 2` in the next iteration.
- `x[j - 1]` will be `x[(j + 1) - 1] = x[j]`.

Given this, let's summarize the state adjustments:

### Updated State
- `j` will be `j + 2`.
- `x[j - 1]` will be checked in the next iteration.

### Final Answer
State: **`x` is an array, `j` is `j + 2`, and the value of `x[j - 1]` (which is `x[j]`) will be checked in the next iteration.**

So, the final state is:
State: **`x` is an array, `j` is `j + 2`**
