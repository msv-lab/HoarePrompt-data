Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values at the start of the loop**:
   - From the given postcondition, at the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 2 and `n` must be at least 1.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = n + 1`. This means the loop will continue as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n + 1`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts at 2, the loop will run for `j = 2` if `n >= 1`.
   - After the first iteration (where `j = 2`), `j` will be incremented to 3 for the next iteration.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be 3.

5. **Maintain the value of `n`**: The value of `n` remains unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body, but since no modification is mentioned, `n` stays the same.

6. **Final state adjustment**: The state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated value of `j` while keeping `n` and other conditions intact.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`nx` is either 'S' or 'F', `i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be at least 1, `j` is 3**
