Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the variables involved in the loop. Here, the loop variable is `j`, and the loop runs from `1` to `n + 1`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be within the range `1` to `n + 1` (inclusive) and `n` must be greater than `0`.

3. **Adjust the States Based on the Loop Head**: The only variables that need to be adjusted are `j` and `n`.

4. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `j` must be between `1` and `n` inclusive.
   - `n` must be greater than `0`.

5. **Next Iteration**:
   - Since `j` is incremented by `1` at each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `j + 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.

6. **New State for the Next Iteration**:
   - `j` will be `j + 1`, which means if `j` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, `j` will be `k + 1` at the start of the next iteration.
   - `n` remains the same, so it must still be greater than `0`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`j` is between 1 and `n` inclusive, `n` must be greater than 0**.
