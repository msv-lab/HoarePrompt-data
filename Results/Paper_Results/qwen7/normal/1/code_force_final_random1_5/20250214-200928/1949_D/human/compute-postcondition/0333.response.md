Output State: **`nx` is either 'SS' or 'FS', `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is at least 4, and `j` is 5.**

Explanation: The value of `nx` is updated by concatenating 'S' to its current value. Since `nx` was either 'S' or 'F' plus the value of `xx[i][3]`, after adding 'S', `nx` will be either 'SS' or 'FS'. The values of `i`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged.
