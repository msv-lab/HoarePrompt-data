Output State: **`nx` is either 'FF' or 'SF', `j` is in the range from `1` to `n/4`.**

Explanation: The value of `nx` is concatenated with 'F', meaning if `nx` was originally 'F', it becomes 'FF', and if `nx` was originally 'S', it becomes 'SF'. The value of `j` remains unchanged as the code does not affect it.
