Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `nx` is `xx[1][1]` + `xx[1][2]`, and `j` is 3**.

Explanation: The code `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` adds the value of `xx[i][j - 1]` to the current value of `nx`. Given that `i` is 1 and `j` is 3, `j - 1` equals 2. So, `nx` is updated to its current value plus `xx[1][2]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
