Output State: **`i` is updated to 3 and appended to `sa` if `a[i]` is greater than 0 and `b[i]` is 0. Otherwise, `i` remains unchanged and `sa` does not change; `sb` now contains the value of `i`.**

This means that if the conditions `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0` are met, `i` is updated to 3, appended to `sa`, and also appended to `sb`. If not, `i` remains unchanged, and `sa` does not change. In either case, `sb` now contains the value of `i`.
