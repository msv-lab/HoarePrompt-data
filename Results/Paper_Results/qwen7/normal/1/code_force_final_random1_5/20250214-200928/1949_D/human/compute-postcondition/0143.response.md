Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and the constant `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n + 1`. This means `i` starts at `1` and increments by `1` until it reaches `n + 1`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `b` is a list of integers.
   - `sa` is a list containing the integer `i` if the condition `a[i-1] == 0 and b[i-1] == 0` is met.

4. **Analyze the loop body**: The loop body is omitted, but we know that if `a[i-1] == 0` and `b[i-1] == 0`, then `i` is added to `sa`.

5. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by `1` from its value at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is a constant.

6. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented by `1`.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - The state of `a` and `b` does not change as they are not modified within the loop.
   - The state of `sa` might change depending on the condition in the loop body, but since we are only asked to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, we focus on `i` and `n`.

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be the same as before**.

Since the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration is not provided, let's denote it as `i_end`. Therefore, the new value of `i` will be `i_end + 1`.

**State: **`i` is `i_end + 1`, `n` must be the same as before**.

If we assume `i_end` was `i` (the variable name), then:

**State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be the same as before**.

However, without the specific value of `i_end`, the most general form is:

**State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be the same as before**.
