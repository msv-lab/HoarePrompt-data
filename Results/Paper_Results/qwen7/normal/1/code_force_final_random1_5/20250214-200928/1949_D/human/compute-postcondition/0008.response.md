Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 24\), `x` is an input string, and the current value of `x[j - 1]` is 'F', `a[1]` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `a[i] += 1` increments the value of `a[i]` by 1. Given that `i` is initially 1, `a[1]` is increased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
