Output State: **`i` is updated to 3 and appended to `sa`.**

Explanation: The code `sa.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` (which is 3) to the list `sa`. Since `i` was updated to 3 before this line of code, and no other changes were made to `i` or `n`, the output state reflects that `i` is now 3 and has been appended to `sa`.
