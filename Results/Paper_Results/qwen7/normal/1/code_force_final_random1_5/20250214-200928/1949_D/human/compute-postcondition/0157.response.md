Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `nx` is the value of `xx[i][0]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `nx` by adding `xx[i][j-1]` to it. Given that `j` is 1, `xx[i][j-1]` is equivalent to `xx[i][0]`. Since the value of `xx[i][0]` is not '?', `nx` is now the numeric value of `xx[i][0]`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
