Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 24\), `x` is an input string, and the current value of `x[j - 1]` is 'F', `a[j]` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `a[j] += 1` increments the value of `a[j]` by 1. Since `j` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact value of `a[j]` after the increment, but we know that `a[j]` has been increased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
