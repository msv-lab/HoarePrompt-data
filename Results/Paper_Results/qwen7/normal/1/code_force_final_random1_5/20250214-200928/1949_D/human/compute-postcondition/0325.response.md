Output State: **`nx` is either 'FS' or 'SS', `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is at least 4, and `j` is 4**.

Explanation: The value of `nx` is concatenated with the string 'S'. Since `nx` can initially be either 'S' or 'F', after the operation `nx += 'S'`, `nx` will be either 'FS' or 'SS'. The values of `i`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged.
