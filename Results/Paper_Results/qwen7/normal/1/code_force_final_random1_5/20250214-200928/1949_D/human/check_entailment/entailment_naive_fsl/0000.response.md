Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate a valid transition video plan for all potential cases. Specifically, the logic for determining the type of transition videos (funny or scary) for undecided cases (`?`) is flawed. 

Consider the following input:
```
5
.?F??
?.???
F?.S?
??S.?
????.
```

The program's output for this input is:
```
.FFFF
F.FFF
FF.SF
FFS.F
FFFF.
```

However, this output does not satisfy the requirement that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) transition videos of the same type appear consecutively for any permutation of the scenarios. For example, if the scenarios are played in the order 1, 3, 5, 2, 4, the sequence of transition videos would be `FFSFF`, which has 3 consecutive scary videos (`SSS`), violating the constraint since \(\lceil \frac{3 \times 5}{4} \rceil = 4\).

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that the generated sequence adheres to the constraint for any permutation of the scenarios. The current implementation does not guarantee this, as it does not properly handle the distribution of funny and scary videos to avoid long sequences of the same type.
