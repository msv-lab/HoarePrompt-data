Output State: **`x` is an array, `j` is `j + 2`, `a[i]` is increased by 1**

The code `a[i] += 1` increments the value at index `i` of array `a` by 1. However, the initial state mentions `x` as an array and `j` as `j + 2`, which means `j` has not been assigned a specific value yet but is in the process of being incremented by 2. The output state includes these details while updating `a[i]` to reflect the increment operation.
