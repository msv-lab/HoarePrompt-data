Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `nx` is 'S', `j` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is equal to '?'.**

Explanation: The code `nx += 'S'` appends the character 'S' to the string `nx`. Since `nx` was initially an empty string (`''`), after executing this line, `nx` becomes `'S'`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state, including the conditions involving `i`, `n`, `j`, and `xx[i][j - 1]`.
