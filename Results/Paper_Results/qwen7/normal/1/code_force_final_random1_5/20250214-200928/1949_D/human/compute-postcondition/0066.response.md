Output State: **`j` is between 2 and `n` inclusive; `n` must be greater than 0; `b[j]` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `b[j] += 1` increments the value of `b[j]` by 1. Since `j` is between 2 and `n` inclusive and `n` must be greater than 0, these conditions remain unchanged. The only change is that `b[j]` has been incremented by 1.
