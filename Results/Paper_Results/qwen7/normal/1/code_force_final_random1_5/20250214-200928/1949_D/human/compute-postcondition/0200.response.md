Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `nx` is either 'F' or 'S', `j` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is equal to '?'.

This postcondition summarizes both cases of the if and else parts, indicating that `i` remains 1 and `j` remains 1, `n` is greater than 0, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is still equal to '?'. The value of `nx` depends on the condition of the if statement, being 'F' if the condition is true and 'S' if the condition is false.
