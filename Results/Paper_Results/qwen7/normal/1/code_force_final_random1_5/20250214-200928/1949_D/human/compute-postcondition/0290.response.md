Output State: **`nx` is either 'SF' or 'FS', `i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be at least 1, `j` is 2**

Explanation: The code `nx += 'S'` appends the character 'S' to the end of the string stored in `nx`. Since `nx` was either 'S' or 'F', appending 'S' results in either 'SF' or 'FS'. The values of `i`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged.
