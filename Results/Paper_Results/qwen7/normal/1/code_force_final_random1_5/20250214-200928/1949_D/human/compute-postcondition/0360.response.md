Output State: **`nx` is 'S' + the original string value of `nx`, `i` is `n`, `j` is 2, and `n` is at least 4.**

Explanation: The code `nx += 'S'` appends the string `'S'` to the end of `nx`. Since `nx` was initially a string, after appending `'S'`, `nx` becomes the original string value of `nx` plus `'S'`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `n` remain unchanged.
