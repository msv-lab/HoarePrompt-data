Output State: **`stop` is `False`, `i` is equal to `n - 3`, `opNum` is equal to `a[n - 3]`, `a[n - 2]` is decreased by `2 * opNum`, `a[n - 1]` is decreased by `opNum`**.

Explanation: The line `stop = False` changes the value of the variable `stop` to `False`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
