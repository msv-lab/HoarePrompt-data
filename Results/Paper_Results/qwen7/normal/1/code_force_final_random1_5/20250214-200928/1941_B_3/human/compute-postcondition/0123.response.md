Output State: **`stop` is `True`, `opNum` is `a[i]`, `a[i]` is `a[i] - 2 * opNum`, `a[i + 1]` is `a[i + 1] - 3 * opNum`, `a[i + 2]` is `a[i + 2] - opNum`, `a[i + 2]` is the third element of the list, either the last element of `a` is not `0` or the second last element of `a` is not `0`, `i` is `i + 1`, and `_` is `0**.

Explanation: The code `a[i + 1] -= 2 * opNum` subtracts `2 * opNum` from `a[i + 1]`. Given that `opNum` is initially `a[i]`, the new value of `a[i + 1]` becomes `a[i + 1] - 2 * a[i]`, which simplifies to `a[i + 1] - 3 * opNum` since `opNum = a[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
