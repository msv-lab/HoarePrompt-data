Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `a = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `a`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. Therefore, `t` is still a positive integer within the range of 1 to 10^4, and `a` now holds the value of the input integer.
