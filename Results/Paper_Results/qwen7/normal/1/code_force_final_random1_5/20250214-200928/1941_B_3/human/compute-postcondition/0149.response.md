Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a set of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5), and an array a consisting of n integers (0 ≤ a_j ≤ 10^9). For each test case, the function returns a result based on the given conditions.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing a specific number of integers and an array, and for each test case, it performs some unspecified operation (not detailed here) and returns a result.
