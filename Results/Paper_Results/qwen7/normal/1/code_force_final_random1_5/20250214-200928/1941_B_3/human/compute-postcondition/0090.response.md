Postcondition: **`stop` is `True`, `i` is `n - 1`, `opNum` is `a[i]`, `a[i]` is `a[i] - opNum`, `a[i + 1]` is `a[i + 1] - 3 * opNum`, `a[i + 2]` is `a[i + 2] - 2 * opNum`**.

This postcondition indicates that after the execution of the if-else block, `stop` remains `True`, `i` is set to `n - 1`, and the values of `opNum`, `a[i]`, `a[i + 1]`, and `a[i + 2]` are updated according to the specified operations. Since there is no else part, the postcondition directly reflects the state when `stop` is `True`.
