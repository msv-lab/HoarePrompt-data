Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting an input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer. 
- The first element of `b` is even or both the first and second elements of `b` differ by 2.
- The last element of `b` is even or both the second to last and last elements of `b` differ by 2.

The print statement is simply `print('YES')`.

Given this, the output of the print statement will be the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
