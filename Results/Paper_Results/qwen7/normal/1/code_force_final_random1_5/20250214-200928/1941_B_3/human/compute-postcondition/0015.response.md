Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is an input integer, `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer, the number of iterations left is `int(input()) - 1`, and `a` is assigned the value of the new input integer, `b` is updated to a list of integers obtained from the latest input string split on spaces and converted to integers. This holds true regardless of whether the if condition `b[0] % 2 == 1 and b[1] != b[0] + 2 or (b[-1] % 2 == 1 and b[-2] != b[-1] + 2)` is met or not.**
