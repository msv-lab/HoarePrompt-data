Based on the initial state provided:

- `stop` is `True`
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `opNum` is `a[i]`
- `a[i]` is updated to `a[i] - opNum`
- `a[i + 1]` is updated to `a[i + 1] - 3 * opNum`
- `a[i + 2]` is updated to `a[i + 2] - 2 * opNum`
- Either the last element of `a` is not 0 or the second last element of `a` is not 0.

The print statement is:
```python
print('NO')
```

This print statement will simply output the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
