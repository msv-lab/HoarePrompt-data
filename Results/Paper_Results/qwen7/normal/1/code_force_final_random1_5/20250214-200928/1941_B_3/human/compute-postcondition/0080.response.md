Output State: **`stop` is `True`, `i` is `n - 2`, `opNum` is `a[i] - opNum`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block without changing the values of the variables `stop`, `i`, `opNum`, `a[i + 1]`, and `a[i + 2]`. The values of these variables remain as they were in the initial state.
