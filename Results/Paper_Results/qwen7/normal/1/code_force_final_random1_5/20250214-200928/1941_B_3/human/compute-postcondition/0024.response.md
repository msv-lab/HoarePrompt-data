Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer n and an array a of n integers. It checks if the first two elements of the array have a difference of 2 and are both odd, or if the last two elements have a difference of 2 and are both odd. If either condition is met, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function does not return any value but prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case.**
