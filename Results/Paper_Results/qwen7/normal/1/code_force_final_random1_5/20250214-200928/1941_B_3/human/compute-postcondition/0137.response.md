Output State: **`stop` is `True`, `opNum` is `a[i]`, `a[i]` is `a[i] - (i+1) * opNum`, `a[i+1]` is `a[i+1] - (i+1) * opNum - (i) * opNum`, `a[i+2]` is `a[i+2] - (i+1) * opNum`, `i` is `i + 1`, and `_` is `0`**.

Explanation: The `continue` statement causes the loop to skip the rest of the current iteration and proceed to the next one. Since the loop has already executed for all possible iterations (from `i = 0` to `i = n-3`), and `stop` is set to `True` as soon as any negative value is encountered in `a[i]`, it remains `True`. The operations on `a[i]`, `a[i+1]`, and `a[i+2]` continue to decrement these values based on the value of `opNum` which is initially `a[i]` and changes with each iteration. The values of `i` and `_` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the `continue` statement.
