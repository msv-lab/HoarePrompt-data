Reasoning:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if all elements of the array can be made zero using the specified operations. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Condition Check**: The current implementation only checks the first two and the last two elements of the array for specific conditions (`b[0] % 2 == 1 and b[1] != b[0] + 2` or `b[-1] % 2 == 1 and b[-2] != b[-1] + 2`). This is insufficient because the problem requires checking the entire array to ensure that every element can eventually be reduced to zero through the allowed operations.

2. **Operations Description**: The operations allow reducing three consecutive elements by specific amounts. However, the current solution does not account for the cumulative effect of these operations on the entire array. For instance, it should check if the sum of the array is even and if the array can be reduced to zeros by repeatedly applying the operations.

3. **Sum of Array**: A key observation is that the sum of the array must be divisible by 3 for it to be possible to reduce all elements to zero. This is because each operation reduces the sum of the array by 3.

4. **Edge Cases**: The solution fails to handle edge cases where the array might contain elements that cannot be reduced to zero due to the constraints of the operations.

Given these points, the provided solution is incorrect. A correct solution would involve checking if the sum of the array is divisible by 3 and ensuring that no element in the array prevents the reduction process.

Correctness: **False**
