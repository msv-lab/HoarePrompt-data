Output State: **`i` is 3, `opNum` is equal to `a[3]`, `a[1]` is decreased by `2 * opNum`, `a[2]` is decreased by `2 * opNum`, `a[4]` is decreased by `3 * opNum`, `a[3]` is decreased by `2 * opNum`, `a[5]` is decreased by `opNum`.**

Explanation:
- Initially, `i` is 3.
- `opNum` is equal to `a[3]`.
- `a[1]` is decreased by `2 * opNum`.
- `a[2]` is decreased by `2 * opNum`.
- `a[4]` is decreased by `opNum`.
- `a[3]` is decreased by `opNum`.
- `a[4]` is further decreased by `2 * opNum`.

After executing `a[i + 2] -= opNum`, which translates to `a[5] -= opNum`, `a[5]` is decreased by `opNum`. Therefore, the updated state includes the decrease of `opNum` from `a[5]`.
