Output State: **`stop` is `True`, `i` is `n - 2`, `opNum` is `a[i]`**.

The code assigns the value of `a[i]` to `opNum`. Since `i` is `n - 2` and `a[i]` is not less than 0 (as per the initial postcondition), the values of `stop` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, `stop` is still `True` and `i` is still `n - 2`. The new variable `opNum` is assigned the value of `a[i]`.
