Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an input integer, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the final input string split on spaces and converted to integers, and the number of iterations left is `0`.**

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` remains within the specified range, `a` will be the value of the last input integer, `b` will be the list of integers from the last input string, and the loop has completed, leaving no iterations remaining.
