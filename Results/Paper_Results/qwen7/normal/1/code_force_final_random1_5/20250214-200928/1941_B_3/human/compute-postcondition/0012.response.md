Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `a` is an input integer, `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer, the number of iterations left is `int(input()) - 1`, and `a` is assigned the value of the new input integer, `b` is updated to a list of integers obtained from the latest input string split on spaces and converted to integers**.

Explanation: The code `b = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a new input string, splits it into individual elements based on spaces, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `b`. The other variables (`t`, `a`, and the number of iterations left) remain unchanged.
