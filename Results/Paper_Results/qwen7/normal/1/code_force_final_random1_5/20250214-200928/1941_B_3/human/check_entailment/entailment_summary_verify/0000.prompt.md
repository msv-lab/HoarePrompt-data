You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

    5
    
    1 3 5 5 2

    3
    
    7 1 0
    
    4
    
    1 1 1 1

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    NO
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if b[0] % 2 == 1 and b[1] != b[0] + 2 or (b[-1] % 2 == 1 and b[-2] != b[-1] + 2):
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer n and an array a of n integers. It checks if the first two elements of the array have a difference of 2 and are both odd, or if the last two elements have a difference of 2 and are both odd. If either condition is met, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function does not return any value but prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as per the problem description. Specifically, the program checks only the first and last elements of the array for specific conditions and prints 'NO' if these conditions are met. However, the problem allows for multiple operations to be performed, and the conditions checked are too restrictive.

Consider the following test case:
```
5
2 4 4 5 1
```

The program will check if `b[0] % 2 == 1` and `b[1] != b[0] + 2`, or if `b[-1] % 2 == 1` and `b[-2] != b[-1] + 2`. In this case, `b[0] = 2` (even), `b[1] = 4` (even), `b[-1] = 1` (odd), and `b[-2] = 5` (odd). Since none of the conditions are met, the program outputs 'NO'. However, we can see that the array can be made all zeros through the following operations:
1. Apply the operation at `i=3`: `[2, 4, 3, 3, 1]`.
2. Apply the operation at `i=2`: `[2, 2, 2, 1, 1]`.
3. Apply the operation at `i=3`: `[2, 2, 0, 0, 1]`.
4. Apply the operation at `i=2`: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 1]`.
5. Apply the operation at `i=4`: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.

Thus, the program incorrectly outputs 'NO' for this valid case, indicating that it does not correctly implement the solution for all possible inputs. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
