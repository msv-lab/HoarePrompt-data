Output State: **`stop` is `True`, `i` is `n - 3`, `opNum` is `a[i]`, `a[i + 1]` is `a[i + 1] - 2 * a[i]`, `a[i + 2]` is `a[i + 2] - opNum`**

Explanation: The code subtracts the value of `opNum` from `a[i + 2]`. Since `opNum` is equal to `a[i]`, `a[i + 2]` is updated to `a[i + 2] - a[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
