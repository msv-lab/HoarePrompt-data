Output State: **`i` is 4; `opNum` is equal to `a[4]`; `a[i]` is decreased by `opNum`.**

Explanation: The code `a[i] -= opNum` decrements the value of `a[i]` by the value of `opNum`. Given that `i` is 4 and `opNum` is equal to `a[4]`, `a[4]` is decreased by its own value, effectively setting `a[4]` to 0. However, since the question asks to include all the information of the precondition that is still valid after the code has been executed, we keep `i` and `opNum` as they are, and note the change in `a[i]`.
