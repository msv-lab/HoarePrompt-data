Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is a list of integers obtained from a new input string split on spaces and converted to integers.
- The number of iterations left is `int(input()) - 2`.
- `a` is updated to the new input integer.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print('YES')
```

This print statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and the number of iterations left do not affect this specific print statement.

Output: **YES**
