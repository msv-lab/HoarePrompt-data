Output State: `i` is equal to `n - 3`, `opNum` is equal to `a[n - 3]`, `a[i + 1]` (which is `a[n - 2]`) is decreased by `2 * opNum`, `a[i + 2]` (which is `a[n - 1]`) is decreased by `opNum`.

This means after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be set to `n - 3` because the loop runs from `0` to `n - 3`. The variable `opNum` will be set to the value of `a[n - 3]` since it is assigned the value of `a[i]` in each iteration. Additionally, `a[n - 2]` will be decreased by `2 * opNum` and `a[n - 1]` will be decreased by `opNum` due to the operations performed within the loop.
