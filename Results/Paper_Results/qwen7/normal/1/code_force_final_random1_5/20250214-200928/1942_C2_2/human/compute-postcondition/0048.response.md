Postcondition: `a` is a list of integers, `ans` is increased by `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` if `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1])` is even and `y` is greater than the half of the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` minus 2. If the condition `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1` is not met, the values of `ans` and other variables remain unchanged.
