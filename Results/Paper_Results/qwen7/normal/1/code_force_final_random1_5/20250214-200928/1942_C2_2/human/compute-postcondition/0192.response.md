Postcondition: `even` is a sorted list in ascending order, the first element in the list `gap` is odd. If `y` is less than `gap` divided by 2, then `ans` is increased by 2 times the current value of `y`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If `y` is not less than `gap` divided by 2, then no changes occur to `ans`.
