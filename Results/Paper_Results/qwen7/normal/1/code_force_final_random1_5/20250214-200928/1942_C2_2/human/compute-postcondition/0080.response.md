Postcondition: **`a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is either 2 or 3, `tmp` is a list containing one element which is the integer `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2` if the condition `(a[2] - a[1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[2] - a[1]) // 2 - 1` is met, `ans` is incremented by 1 if `a[2] - a[1] == 2`, or by `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2` if the condition in the else part is met, `y` is decreased by `((a[3] - a[2]) // 2 - 1)` if the condition in the else part is met.**
