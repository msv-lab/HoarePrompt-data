Postcondition: `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 3, `len(a)` remains unchanged, `tmp` is a list containing one element which is the integer \((a[2] - a[1]) // 2\) if the condition \((a[2] - a[1]) % 2 == 0\) and \(y > (a[2] - a[1]) // 2 - 1\) is met, and the same element is \((a[3] - a[2]) // 2\) if the condition \((a[3] - a[2]) % 2 == 0\) and \(y > (a[3] - a[2]) // 2 - 1\) is met, `ans` is incremented by 1 if \(a[2] - a[1] == 2\) or by \((a[3] - a[2]) // 2\) if the condition in the else part is met, and `y` is decreased by \(((a[3] - a[2]) // 2 - 1)\) if the condition in the else part is met.
