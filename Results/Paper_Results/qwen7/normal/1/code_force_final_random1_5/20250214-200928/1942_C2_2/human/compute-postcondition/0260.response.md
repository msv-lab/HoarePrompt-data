Output State: **`i` is 2, `ans` is 2, `t1` is (a[i] + 1) % n, `t2` is (a[i] + 2) % n and is in set `st`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. Initially, `ans` is 1, so after executing this line, `ans` becomes 2. The values of `i`, `t1`, and `t2` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet.
