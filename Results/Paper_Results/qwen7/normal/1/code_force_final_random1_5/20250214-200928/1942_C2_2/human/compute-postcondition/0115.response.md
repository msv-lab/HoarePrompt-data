Output State: **`i` is an integer with a value at least 1 and less than `len(a)`, `ans` is `ans` + 1, the value of `a[i]` is exactly 2 more than the value of `a[i - 1]`**.

Explanation: The line `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. All other conditions and relationships between the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` still satisfies the condition of being an integer with a value at least 1 and less than `len(a)`, and the value of `a[i]` is still exactly 2 more than the value of `a[i - 1]`.
