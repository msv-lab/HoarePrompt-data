Postcondition: **All iterations of the loop have completed, `a` is a list of integers, the sum of the first element `a[0]` and `n` minus the last element `a[len(a) - 1]` is not equal to 2, `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1])` is even, and `y` is greater than the half of the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` minus 1.**
