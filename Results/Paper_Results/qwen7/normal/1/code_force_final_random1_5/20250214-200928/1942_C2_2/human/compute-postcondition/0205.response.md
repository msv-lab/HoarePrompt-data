Output State: **`even` is a sorted list in ascending order, `gap` is the next odd number in the list `odd`, `odd` is the list `odd` minus the current `gap`, `ans` is increased by 2 times the value of `y`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += 2 * y` increments the value of `ans` by twice the value of `y`. The values of `even`, `gap`, and `odd` remain unchanged from their initial state.
