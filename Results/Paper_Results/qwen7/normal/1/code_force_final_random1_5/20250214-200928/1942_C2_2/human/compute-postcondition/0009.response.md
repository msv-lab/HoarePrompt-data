Output State: **`i` is 1, `a` is a list of integers, and `ans` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. The values of `i` and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `i` is still 1, `a` remains a list of integers, and `ans` is increased by 1.
