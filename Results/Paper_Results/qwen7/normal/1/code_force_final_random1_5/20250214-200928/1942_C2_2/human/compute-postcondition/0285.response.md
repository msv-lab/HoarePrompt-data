Output State: **`i` is `x`, `ans` is `x`, `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n` if `i` equals `x - 1` else `a[i + 1]`, `odd` is either `[gap]` or an empty list, `even` is either `[gap]` or an empty list, and `gap` is unchanged.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `next_elem` based on the condition `if i == x - 1`. If `i` is equal to `x - 1`, then `next_elem` is assigned the value of `a[0] + n`. Otherwise, `next_elem` is assigned the value of `a[i + 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
