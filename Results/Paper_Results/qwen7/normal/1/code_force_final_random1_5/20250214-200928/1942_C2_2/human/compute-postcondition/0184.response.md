Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input data consisting of multiple test cases. Each test case includes three integers n, x, and y, followed by x distinct integers from 1 to n. The function returns a result for each test case based on the given conditions.**

- For each test case, the function reads three integers n, x, and y, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (t being the number of test cases), and for each test case, 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2⋅10^5), and 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x.
- It then reads x distinct integers from 1 to n.
- Based on the values of n, x, and y, and the x distinct integers, the function determines and returns a specific result for each test case.
