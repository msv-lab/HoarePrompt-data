Output State: **`i` is `x + len(a)`, `ans` is `x`, `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `odd` is a sorted list of all odd gaps found during the iterations, and `even` is a list containing all even gaps found during the iterations.**

Explanation: The code `odd.sort()` sorts the `odd` list in ascending order. The values of the other variables (`i`, `ans`, `t1`, `t2`, `next_elem`, and `even`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the `odd` list is now sorted, while the rest of the variables retain their previous states.
