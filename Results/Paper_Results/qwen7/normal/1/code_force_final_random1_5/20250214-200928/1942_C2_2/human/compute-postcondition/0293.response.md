Output State: **`i` is `x + 1`, `ans` is `x`, `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `odd` is either `[gap]` or an empty list, `even` is either `[gap]` or an empty list, `gap` is equal to `next_elem - a[i] - 1`.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `gap` to be the value of `next_elem - a[i] - 1`. Given the initial state, `i` is `x + 1`, and `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`. Therefore, `gap` is updated to `next_elem - a[i] - 1`, which is `(a[0] + n) - (a[x + 1] - 1) - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
