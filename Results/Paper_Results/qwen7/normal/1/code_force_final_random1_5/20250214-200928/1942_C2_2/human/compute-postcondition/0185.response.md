Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers n, x, and y, followed by x distinct integers from 1 to n. It calculates a value `cons` based on the given conditions and prints the result for each test case. The final value of `cons` is either -2 or `n - 2`, whichever is smaller.**
