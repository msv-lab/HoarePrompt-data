Postcondition: **`i` is `x + 1`, `ans` is `x`, `t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x-1] + 2) % n`, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `odd` is `[gap]`, and `even` is either `[gap]` or an empty list. If `gap` is greater than 1 and odd, `even` becomes `[gap]`. Otherwise, `even` remains as either `[gap]` or an empty list.**
