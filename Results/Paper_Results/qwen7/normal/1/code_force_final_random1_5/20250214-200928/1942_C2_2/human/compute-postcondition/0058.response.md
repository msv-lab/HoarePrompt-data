Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers from input, `ans` is equal to `x + y - 2`, `ii` is `ii + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `ans = x + y - 2` assigns the value of `x + y - 2` to the variable `ans`. The other variables (`a`, `ii`, `n`, `x`, `y`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
