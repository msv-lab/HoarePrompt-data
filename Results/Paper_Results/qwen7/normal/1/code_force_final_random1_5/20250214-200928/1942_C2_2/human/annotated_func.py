#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, x, and y are integers such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2⋅10^5), and 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x. The sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5. The first line of each test case contains three integers n, x, and y. The second line of each test case contains x distinct integers from 1 to n, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.
def func():
    tt = int(input())
    for ii in range(tt):
        n, x, y = map(int, input().split())

            if a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2:
                ans += 1
            elif (a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1:
                tmp.append((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2)
                ans += (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2
                y -= (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1
        
        if a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2:
            ans += 1
        elif (a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1:
            tmp.append((a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2)
            ans += (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2
            y -= (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1
        
        ans += y
        
        print(min(ans, n - 2))
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `ans` will be the minimum value between the final calculated `ans` and `n - 2`. `tmp` will contain all the valid increments added during the iterations based on the conditions specified in the loop. `a` will be a sorted list of integers as provided by the input, and `tt` will be the number of times the loop has executed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers n, x, and y, followed by x distinct integers from 1 to n. It sorts the list of integers and calculates a value `ans` based on specific conditions involving the differences between consecutive elements and the value of y. The function then prints the minimum value between `ans` and `n - 2` for each test case.
