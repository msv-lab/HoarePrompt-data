Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is greater than or equal to 3, `c` is 0, `y` is -2, `sx` is -1, `cons` is -2 or `n` - 2, whichever is smaller.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `cons` to be the minimum between `n - 2` and the current value of `cons`. Since `n` is not defined in the initial state and no input is taken, we cannot determine the exact new value of `cons`. However, we know that `cons` will be set to the smaller of `-2` and `n - 2`. Given the initial state, `n` is not specified, so the output includes both possibilities.
