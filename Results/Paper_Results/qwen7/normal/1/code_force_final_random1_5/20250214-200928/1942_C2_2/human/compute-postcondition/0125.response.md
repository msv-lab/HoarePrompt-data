Postcondition: `i` is an integer such that it is at least 1 and less than `len(a)`. If the value of `a[i]` is exactly 2 more than the value of `a[i - 1]`, then `ans` is incremented by 1. If the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is even and the current value of `y` is greater than half of the difference minus 2, then `tmp` is a list with an additional element which is half of the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]`, and `ans` is increased by half of the difference. Otherwise, no changes occur to `tmp` and `ans`.
