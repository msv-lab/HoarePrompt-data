Output State: **`i` is the first element of `val`, `x` is greater than or equal to 3, `c` is `i // 2`, `y` is -1, `sx` is `-4 + i`.**

Explanation: The variable `sx` is incremented by the value of `i`. Since `i` is the first element of `val`, the value of `sx` becomes `-4 + i`. All other variables remain unchanged.
