Postcondition: `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `tmp` is a list containing zero or more elements, each of which is an integer calculated as `(a[j+1] - a[j]) // 2` where the condition `(a[j+1] - a[j]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[j+1] - a[j]) // 2 - 1` is met for some `j` in the range `[1, len(a)-1]`. `ans` is the sum of 1 for each pair of consecutive elements in `a` that differ by exactly 2, and the sum of `(a[j+1] - a[j]) // 2` for each pair of consecutive elements in `a` that satisfy the condition `(a[j+1] - a[j]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[j+1] - a[j]) // 2 - 1`, without the total decrement of `y` which is the sum of `((a[j+1] - a[j]) // 2 - 1)` for each such pair, and the current value of `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is even and greater than `y - (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 + 1`.
