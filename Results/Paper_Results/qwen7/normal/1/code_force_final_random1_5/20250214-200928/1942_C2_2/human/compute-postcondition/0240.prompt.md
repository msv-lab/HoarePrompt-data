Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: The `even` list remains a sorted list in ascending order. After all iterations of the loop, `ans` is the sum of all elements in the original `even` list minus half of each element (integer division), and `y` is equal to the negative of the last element in the original `even` list divided by 2 (integer division). The `odd` list is empty since all elements from it have been used in the loop iterations.

This means that after the loop completes, `ans` will be the cumulative sum of all elements in the `even` list minus half of each element, and `y` will hold the negative half of the last element from the `even` list.
Code of the loop:
for gap in even:
    if y < gap // 2:
        ans += 2 * y
        y = 0
        break
    ans += gap
    y -= gap // 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `even` is a sorted list in ascending order, `ans` is increased by `2 * y` plus `gap`, `y` is decreased by `gap // 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `even` is a sorted list in ascending order with the first element removed, `ans` is increased by `2 * y + gap`, `y` is decreased by `gap // 2`, `y` is less than `gap // 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `even` is a sorted list in ascending order with the first element removed, `ans` is increased by `gap`, `y` is decreased by `first_gap // 2 - gap // 2`, and `y` is 0 or less than `first_gap // 2 - gap // 2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
