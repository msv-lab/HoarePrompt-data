Postcondition: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `len(a) - 1`, `tmp` will be a list containing elements that are half of the differences between consecutive elements of `a` where those differences are even and greater than 2, and `ans` will be the sum of these half differences plus the count of times the difference between consecutive elements was exactly 2. Additionally, if `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2`, `ans` will be incremented by 1. If the condition `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) % 2 == 0` and `y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1` holds, then `tmp` will be appended with the value \((a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2\) and `y` will be decreased by \((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1\), and `ans` will be increased by \((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2\). Otherwise, no changes are made to `tmp`, `y`, and `ans`.**
