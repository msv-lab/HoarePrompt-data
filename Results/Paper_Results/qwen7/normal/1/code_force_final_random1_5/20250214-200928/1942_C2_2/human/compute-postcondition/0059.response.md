Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers from input, `ans` is equal to `x + y - 2`, `ii` is `ii + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `tmp` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list `tmp`. None of the other variables (`a`, `ans`, `ii`, `n`, `x`, `y`) are affected by this line of code. Therefore, they retain their initial values and states.
