Postcondition: `i` is 2, `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `ans` is either increased by 1 if `a[2] - a[1] == 2`, or set to `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2` and `tmp` is a list containing the element `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2`. Additionally, `y` is updated to `y - ((a[2] - a[1]) // 2 - 1)` if `(a[2] - a[1]) % 2 == 0` and `y > (a[2] - a[1]) // 2 - 1`. If the condition `a[2] - a[1] == 2` is not met, the values of `ans`, `tmp`, and `y` remain unchanged.
