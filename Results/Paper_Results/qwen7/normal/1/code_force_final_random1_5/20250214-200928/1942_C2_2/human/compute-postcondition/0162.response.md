Output State: **`i` is the first element of `val`, `x` is greater than or equal to 3, `c` is `i // 2`, `y` is -1, `sx` is -4**

Explanation: The code `sx += y * 2` updates the value of `sx` by adding `y * 2` to its current value. Given that `y` is -1, `y * 2` equals -2. Since `sx` was initially -2, after the operation, `sx` becomes -2 + (-2) = -4. All other variables (`i`, `x`, `c`, and `y`) remain unchanged.
