Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a specific integer between 1 and 10^4, `R()` is a lambda function that returns a tuple of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting it to integers, and `t` is assigned the first element of that tuple.
Code of the loop:
while t:
    t -= 1
    n, x, y = R()
    sx = 0
    l = list(R())
    l.sort()
    l.append(n + l[0])
    val = []
    for i in range(1, x + 1):
        c = l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1
        if c == 1:
            sx += 1
        val.append(c)
    val.sort(key=lambda x: (1 - x & 1, x))
    for i in val:
        c = i // 2
        if y < c:
            sx += y * 2
            break
        sx += i
        y -= c
    cons = x + sx - 2
    cons = min(n - 2, cons)
    print(cons)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `x` is greater than or equal to 1; `c` is 2; `sx` is 24; `val` is a list containing the values [1, None, None, None]; `y` is decreased by 2; `cons` is 23.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `cons` is calculated as `min(n - 2, cons)`, `i` from `val` have been processed, `c` is calculated as `i // 2` for each `i`, `y` is decreased by `c` for each `i`, `sx` is increased by `i + c` for each `i`, and `sx` is also increased by `2 * (y - c)` for each `i`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `i` is 1, `x` is greater than or equal to 3, `c` is 0, `y` is -2, `sx` is -1, `cons` is -2 or `n` - 2, whichever is smaller.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
