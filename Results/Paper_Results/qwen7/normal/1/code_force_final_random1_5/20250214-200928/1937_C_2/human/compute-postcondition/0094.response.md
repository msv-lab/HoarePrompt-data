Output State: **`best` is 5, `n` is an input integer, `i` is 6, `k` is 5, and `res` is an input string.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The other variables (`best`, `i`, `k`, and `res`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the updated state includes `n` being set to the input integer, while the other variables retain their previous values.
