Output State: **`best` is 4, `n` is an input integer, `i` is 5, `k` is 1, `res` is an input string**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. The values of `best`, `i`, `k`, and `res` remain unchanged from their initial states. The input integer for `n` must be greater than or equal to its original value, which is not specified but is implied to be the case since no further conditions are given.
