Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 2 to `n` (inclusive).

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `best` is 4
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 5
   - `i` is 5
   - `k` is 5
   - `res` remains unchanged if `res` equals '<'

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since the loop runs for `i` in the range from 2 to `n`, and `i` is currently 5, the loop will not execute again because the condition `2 <= i < n` is no longer satisfied (since `i` is already 5 and `n` is at least 5).
   - Therefore, the values of `i` and `n` do not change.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `best` remains 4.
   - `n` remains greater than or equal to 5.
   - `i` remains 5.
   - `k` remains 5.
   - `res` remains unchanged if `res` equals '<'.

Since the loop does not execute again, the state remains the same as the current state at the end of the previous iteration.

**Final State**:
State: **`best` is 4, `n` is greater than or equal to 5, `i` is 5, `k` is 5, and the string `res` remains unchanged if `res` equals '<'**
