Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given code are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop `for i in range(2, n)` will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` must be greater than 2.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `k` is 3.
   - `res` is an input string.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 3, for the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Given that `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3 for the loop to execute again.
   - The variables `k` and `res` are not part of the loop head, so their values remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `n` must be greater than 3.
- `i` is 3 (unchanged).
- `k` is 3 (unchanged).
- `res` is an input string (unchanged).

State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `k` is 3, `res` is an input string**
