Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it finds a pair of indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized using at most 3n queries. It interacts with an external entity to ask queries and receives responses. After completing the queries for each test case, it outputs the indices \(k\) and \(best\) that maximize \(p_i \oplus p_j\).**
