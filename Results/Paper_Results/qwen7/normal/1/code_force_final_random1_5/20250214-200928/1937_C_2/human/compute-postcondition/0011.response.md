Based on the initial state and the provided code snippet:

- `n` must be greater than 2, but its exact value is not specified.
- `i` is explicitly given as 3.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print('?', 0, k, 0, i, flush=True)
```

Here, `k` is not defined in the initial state, so it could be any value. However, since the question asks to determine exactly what will be printed and we don't have a specific value for `k`, we need to acknowledge this.

Given the information, the output will include the string `'?'`, followed by `0`, then `k`, another `0`, and finally `i` which is explicitly given as `3`.

Output: **'? 0 k 0 3'**
