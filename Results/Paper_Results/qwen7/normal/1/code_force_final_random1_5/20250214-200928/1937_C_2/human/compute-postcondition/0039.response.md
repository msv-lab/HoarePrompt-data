Based on the initial state provided:

- `best` is explicitly given as 2.
- `n` is greater than or equal to its original value, but its exact value is not needed for the print statement.
- `i` is explicitly given as 3.
- `k` is explicitly given as 1.
- `res` is an input string, and its current value is specified to be '<'.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', k, best, k, i, flush=True)
```

Breaking down the print statement:
- `'?'` is a literal string.
- `k` is 1.
- `best` is 2.
- `k` again is 1.
- `i` is 3.

So, the print statement will output these values in sequence.

Output: **'? 1 2 1 3'**
