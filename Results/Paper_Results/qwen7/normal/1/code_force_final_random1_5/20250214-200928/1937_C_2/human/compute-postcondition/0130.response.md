Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.
2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n-1` (inclusive) because the loop starts with `i = 1` and increments `i` by `1` each iteration.
3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` must be greater than `1`.
   - `res` is an input string.
   - `i` is incremented by `1` at the end of each iteration.
   - If `res` equals `'<'`, then `best` is set to `i + 1`. Otherwise, `best` remains unchanged.

4. **Analyze the loop body**:
   - Since the loop body is omitted, we cannot determine what changes occur inside the loop. However, we know that `i` is incremented by `1` at the end of each iteration.

5. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by `1` from its current value.
   - `n` must still be greater than `1` for the loop to continue.
   - The value of `res` and `best` remain unchanged unless they are modified within the loop body, but since the loop body is omitted, we assume no changes to these variables.

Given this analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`, which will be incremented by `1`.

**Final State**:
State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `res` is an input string, `i` is incremented by 1, `best` remains unchanged**.

Since `i` is incremented by `1` at the end of each iteration, if `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, it will be `k+1` at the start of the next iteration. However, the exact value of `i` is not specified, only that it is incremented by `1`.

Thus, the final state can be summarized as:
State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `res` is an input string, `i` is incremented by 1, `best` remains unchanged**.
