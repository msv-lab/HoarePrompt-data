You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
This is an interactive problem.

There is a secret sequence p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} , which is a permutation
of \\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\\} .

You need to find any two indices i and j such that p_i \oplus p_j is
maximized, where \oplus denotes the [bitwise XOR
operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

To do this, you can ask queries. Each query has the following form: you pick arbitrary indices a , b , c , and d (0 \le a,b,c,d < n ). Next, the jury calculates x = (p_a \mid p_b) and y = (p_c \mid p_d) , where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). Finally, you receive the result of comparison between x and y . In other words, you are told if x < y , x > y , or x = y .

Please find any two indices i and j (0 \le i,j < n ) such that p_i \oplus p_j
is maximum among all such pairs, using at most 3n queries. If there are
multiple pairs of indices satisfying the condition, you may output any one of
them.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ). The description of the test cases follows.

Interaction

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^4 ).
At this moment, the permutation p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} is chosen. The
interactor in this task is not adaptive. In other words, the sequence p is
fixed in every test case and does not change during the interaction.

To ask a query, you need to pick four indices a , b , c , and d (0 \le a,b,c,d
< n ) and print the line of the following form:

  * "? a b c d" 

After that, you receive:

  * "<" if (p_a \mid p_b) < (p_c \mid p_d) ; 
  * "=" if (p_a \mid p_b) = (p_c \mid p_d) ; 
  * ">" if (p_a \mid p_b) > (p_c \mid p_d) . 

You can make at most 3n queries of this form.

Next, if your program has found a pair of indices i and j (0 \le i, j < n )
such that p_i \oplus p_j is maximized, print the line of the following form:

  * "! i j" 

Note that this line is not considered a query and is not taken into account
when counting the number of queries asked.

After this, proceed to the next test case.

If you make more than 3n queries during an interaction, your program must
terminate immediately, and you will receive the Wrong Answer verdict.
Otherwise, you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will
continue to read from a closed stream.

After printing a query or the answer for a test case, do not forget to output
the end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get the verdict
Idleness Limit Exceeded. To do this, use:

  * fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++; 
  * System.out.flush() in Java; 
  * flush(output) in Pascal; 
  * stdout.flush() in Python; 
  * see the documentation for other languages. 

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4 .

Hacks

To hack, follow the test format below.

The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ). The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^4 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers p_0,p_1,\ldots,p_{n-1} ,
which represent a permutation of integers from 0 to n - 1 .

The sum of n over all test cases should not exceed 10^4 .

Example

Input

    2
    4
    
    <
    
    =
    
    >
    
    2
    
Output

    ? 0 2 3 1
    
    ? 1 1 2 3
    
    ? 1 2 0 3
    
    ! 3 2
    
    ! 0 1
    
Note

In the first test case, the hidden permutation is p=[0,3,1,2] .

For the query "? 0 2 3 1", the jury return "<" because (p_0 \mid p_2) = (0
\mid 1) =1 < (p_3 \mid p_1) = (2 \mid 3) = 3 .

For the query "? 1 1 2 3", the jury return "=" because (p_1 \mid p_1) = (3\mid
3)= 3 = (p_2 \mid p_3) = (1 \mid 2)=3 .

For the query "? 1 2 0 3", the jury return ">" because (p_1 \mid p_2) = (3
\mid 1) = 3 > (p_0 \mid p_3) = (0\mid 2)=2 .

The answer i = 3 and j = 2 is valid: (p_3 \oplus p_2) = (2 \oplus 1) = 3 is
indeed equal to the maximum possible value of p_i \oplus p_j . Another valid
answer would be i=0 and j=1 . As the number of queries does not exceed 3n=12 ,
the answer is considered correct.

In the second test case, n = 2 , so p is either [0, 1] or [1, 0] . In any
case, p_0 \oplus p_1 = 1 is maximum possible.

        k = 1
        for i in range(2, n):
            print('?', 0, k, 0, i, flush=True)
            res = input()
            if res == '<':
                k = i

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the input variables are explicitly defined in the function signature. However, the problem requires the function to handle multiple test cases, where each test case involves finding a pair of indices i and j such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized using at most 3n queries. The function must interact with an external entity to ask queries and receive responses. The variable n is an integer representing the size of the permutation, and t is an integer representing the number of test cases.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        k = 1
        
        for i in range(2, n):
            print('?', 0, k, 0, i, flush=True)
            res = input()
            if res == '<':
                k = i
        
        best = 0
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            print('?', k, best, k, i, flush=True)
            res = input()
            if res == '<':
                best = i
        
        print('!', k, best, flush=True)
        
    #State: Output State: `best` is 5, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is `n`, `k` is 5, and `res` is an input string.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop runs from `i=2` to `i=n-1`. Given that the loop has executed all its iterations, it means `i` has reached `n-1` and the loop has completed. Therefore, `i` is now equal to `n`. The value of `best` remains 5 because it was updated to the last value of `i` (which is 5) during the loop's execution. The value of `k` remains 5 as it is only updated inside the loop when `res` is '<', and since `res` was always '<' in the previous iterations, `k` was updated to the current value of `i` (which is 5) in the last iteration. The value of `n` must be greater than 1 as it is the size of the permutation, and `res` remains an input string as it is read from the input in each iteration.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the permutation `n`.

2. **Finding the Maximum Bitwise OR Pair:**
   - The program initializes `k` to 1.
   - It iterates from 2 to `n-1` and compares `(p_0 | p_k)` with `(p_0 | p_i)` for each `i` in this range.
   - If `(p_0 | p_i)` is greater than `(p_0 | p_k)`, it updates `k` to `i`.
   - This ensures that `k` is the index such that `(p_0 | p_k)` is maximized among all possible pairs involving `p_0`.

3. **Finding the Best Pair:**
   - After finding `k`, the program iterates through all indices from 1 to `n-1` and compares `(p_k | p_best)` with `(p_k | p_i)` for each `i` in this range.
   - If `(p_k | p_i)` is greater than `(p_k | p_best)`, it updates `best` to `i`.
   - This ensures that `best` is the index such that `(p_k | p_best)` is maximized among all possible pairs involving `p_k`.

4. **Outputting the Result:**
   - The program prints the indices `k` and `best` as the answer, which are supposed to maximize the bitwise XOR value.

### Verification

#### Correctness of Finding `k`:
- The logic to find `k` is correct. By comparing `(p_0 | p_i)` for all `i` from 2 to `n-1`, we ensure that `k` is the index that maximizes the bitwise OR with `p_0`.

#### Correctness of Finding `best`:
- The logic to find `best` is also correct. By comparing `(p_k | p_i)` for all `i` from 1 to `n-1`, we ensure that `best` is the index that maximizes the bitwise OR with `p_k`.

#### Maximizing XOR:
- The goal is to maximize `p_i ⊕ p_j`. The program does not directly maximize XOR but uses bitwise OR to indirectly help in finding the maximum XOR. However, the strategy is sound because the maximum XOR can often be achieved by maximizing the bitwise OR first.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the strategy to find the indices that maximize the bitwise XOR value by leveraging the bitwise OR operation. The number of queries used is within the allowed limit (3n), and the approach is logically sound.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
