Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` must be greater than 2.
- `i` is explicitly defined as 2.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print('?', 0, k, 0, i, flush=True)
```

Here, `k` is not defined in the initial state, so it remains as the variable `k`. The other values are directly provided or can be inferred from the initial state:
- `'?'` is a string literal.
- `0` is an integer.
- `k` is an undefined variable.
- `0` is another integer.
- `i` is explicitly defined as 2.

Therefore, the output will include the string `'?'`, followed by `0`, then `k`, then another `0`, and finally `2`.

Output: **'? 0 k 0 2'**
