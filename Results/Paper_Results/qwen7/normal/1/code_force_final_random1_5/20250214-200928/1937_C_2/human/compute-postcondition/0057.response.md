Output: **'? 0 5 0 5'**

Explanation:
- The value of `best` is 4, but it is not used in the print statement.
- The value of `n` is greater than or equal to 5, but its exact value is not needed for the print statement.
- The value of `i` is 5.
- The value of `k` is 5.
- The value of `res` is not needed for this print statement.

The print statement `print('?', 0, k, 0, i, flush=True)` will print the string `'?'` followed by the values of `0`, `k` (which is 5), `0`, and `i` (which is 5). The `flush=True` parameter ensures that the output is flushed immediately, but it does not affect what is printed.
