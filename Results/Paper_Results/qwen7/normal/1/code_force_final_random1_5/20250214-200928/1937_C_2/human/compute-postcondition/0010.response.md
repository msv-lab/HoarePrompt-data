Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head includes the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop `for i in range(2, n)` will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` must be greater than 2.
   - `i` is currently 2.
   - `res` is an input string (its value is not relevant for this adjustment).
   - If `res` is equal to '<', then `k` is set to 2 (this condition is not relevant for adjusting the loop variables).

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 3.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than 2.

Given these points, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

- `i` should be incremented to 3.
- `n` must still be greater than 2.

Therefore, the updated state is:

**State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 3**
