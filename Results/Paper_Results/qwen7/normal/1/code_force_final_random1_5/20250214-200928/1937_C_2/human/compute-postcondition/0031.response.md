Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n-1` because the loop starts at `1` and goes up to `n-1` (since `range(1, n)` generates values from 1 to `n-1`).

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `best` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to the original value of `n`
   - `i` is 1
   - `k` is the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<' (or 1 if `res` was never '<')
   - `res` is a new input string, and the current value of `res` is '<'

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, the next value of `i` will be `2`.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop body.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `i` will be updated to `2`.
   - `n` remains the same as it is not modified in the loop body.

6. **Final state**:
   - `best` remains 1.
   - `n` must still be greater than or equal to the original value of `n`.
   - `i` is now 2.
   - `k` remains the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<' (or 1 if `res` was never '<').
   - `res` remains a new input string, and the current value of `res` is '<'.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`best` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to the original value of `n`, `i` is 2, `k` is the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<' (or 1 if `res` was never '<'), `res` is a new input string, and the current value of `res` is '<'.**
