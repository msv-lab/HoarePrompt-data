Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: None of the input variables are explicitly defined in the function signature. However, the problem requires the function to handle multiple test cases, where each test case involves finding a pair of indices i and j such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized using at most 3n queries. The function must interact with an external entity to ask queries and receive responses. The variable n is an integer representing the size of the permutation, and t is an integer representing the number of test cases.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    k = 1
    for i in range(2, n):
        print('?', 0, k, 0, i, flush=True)
        res = input()
        if res == '<':
            k = i
    best = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        print('?', k, best, k, i, flush=True)
        res = input()
        if res == '<':
            best = i
    print('!', k, best, flush=True)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `best` is 4, `n` must be greater than or equal to the original value of `n`, `i` is 4, `k` is 1, `res` is an input string.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `best` is 5, `n` must be greater than or equal to 6, `i` is 5, `k` is 5, and `res` is an input string.

Explanation: The loop continues to run as long as `i` is less than `n`. Given that `i` starts at 5 and increments by 1 each iteration, the loop will continue until `i` reaches `n-1`. Since `n` is at least 6, the loop will run exactly 5 times (from `i=1` to `i=5`). In each iteration, `best` is updated to the current value of `i` if the input `res` is '<'. Since `res` is always '<' in the given states, `best` will be updated to each value of `i` in sequence (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). After 5 iterations, `best` will be 5. The values of `n`, `k`, and `res` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The loop has executed all its iterations, `n` must be greater than 1, `res` is an input string, `i` is incremented to `n`, and `best` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
