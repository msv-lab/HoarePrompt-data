Output State: **`n` is `n - (n + 1) // 2`, `k` is an integer equal to the second input number, `L` is a list containing `m`, where `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`.**

Explanation: The value of `n` is updated to `n - (n + 1) // 2`. The value of `k` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The list `L` contains `m`, which is `(n + 1) // 2`, and `m` is updated to `(n + 1) // 2` as per the initial state.
