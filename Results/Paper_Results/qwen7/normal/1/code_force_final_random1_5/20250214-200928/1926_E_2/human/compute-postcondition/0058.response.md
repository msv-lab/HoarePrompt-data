Output State: `a` is 1, `L` is [4, 1, 2, 1], `tot` is 1, `pow` is 8, `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer.

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `n` is non-zero. After the third iteration, `n` becomes 0. Therefore, the loop stops. The list `L` contains the values of `m` from each iteration, which are [4, 1, 2, 1] based on the pattern observed. The variable `a` remains 1, `tot` remains 1, `pow` remains 8, and `n` is now 0 since the loop has completed all its iterations. The value of `k` remains unchanged as it was not modified within the loop.
