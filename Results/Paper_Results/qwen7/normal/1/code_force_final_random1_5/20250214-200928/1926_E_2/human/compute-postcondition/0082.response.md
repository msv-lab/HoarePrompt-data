Output State: `a` is 1, `L` is [1], `tot` is 12, `k` is between 8 and 12, `pow` is 16.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `a` will take the last value from the list `L`, which is 1. The list `L` will be reduced to its last element, so it becomes [1]. The total sum `tot` will be the sum of all elements in the original list `L`, which is 4 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 8, plus the last element encountered in the loop, making it 12. The variable `k` remains within the range of 8 to 12 as it was in the last iteration. The variable `pow` doubles with each iteration of the loop, starting from 2, so after 3 iterations, it becomes 2^4 = 16.
