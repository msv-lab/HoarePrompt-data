Output State: **`a` is 2, `L` is [2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], `pow` is 2, `tot` is `tot` + 2.**

Explanation: The code `pow *= 2` doubles the value of `pow`. Since the initial value of `pow` is not given explicitly, we assume it to be 1 (as it is a common default value when not initialized). After executing the code, `pow` becomes 2. The values of `a`, `L`, and `tot` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `a` is 2, `L` is [2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], and `tot` is `tot` + 2.
