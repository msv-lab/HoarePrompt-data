Output State: `a` is 1, `L` is [2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], `tot` is 12, `k` is between 8 and 12, `pow` is 32, `m` is 1, `n` is 0.

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `n` is non-zero. After the first iteration, `n` becomes 1. In the second iteration, `n` becomes 0, which causes the loop to terminate. Since we know the loop executed 3 times initially, and each subsequent iteration reduces `n` by 1 until it reaches 0, the loop will execute a total of 6 times (1 + 2 + 3). Therefore, `L` will contain six elements, each being 1, resulting in `L` being [2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. The value of `n` will be 0 after all iterations.
