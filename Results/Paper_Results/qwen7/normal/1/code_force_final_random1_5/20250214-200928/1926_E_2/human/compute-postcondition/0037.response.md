Postcondition: `a` is 0, and `L` is a list containing the values [1, 0, 1]. If `tot < k` and `k <= tot + a`, then the condition is already met and remains unchanged. Since `a` is always 0, the condition simplifies to `tot < k` and `k <= 0`, which cannot be true simultaneously unless `k` is exactly 0. Therefore, the postcondition essentially states that `a` remains 0 and `L` remains [1, 0, 1].
