Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for a in L:`. This means the variables `a` and `L` are the ones that need to be adjusted.

2. **Determine the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` is 1
   - `L` is a list containing the values [1, 0, 1]
   - `pow` is multiplied by 2 (though this variable is not part of the loop head and does not need to be adjusted)

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element in the list `L`. At the end of the previous iteration, `a` was 1, meaning the first element of the list was processed.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `a` was 1, the next value in the list `L` will be 0.
   - The list `L` remains the same: [1, 0, 1].
   - The variable `pow` is not part of the loop head and does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `a` is 0
- `L` is still a list containing the values [1, 0, 1]

So, the final state is:
State: **`a` is 0, `L` is a list containing the values [1, 0, 1]**
