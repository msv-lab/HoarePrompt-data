Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers \( n \) and \( k \). It calculates and prints a value \( y \) based on specific conditions involving \( n \) and \( k \). If \( k > \frac{n + 1}{2} \), \( y \) is computed as \( 2^{k-2} \times (2k - 1) \); otherwise, \( y \) is simply \( 2k - 1 \). The function does not return any value but prints the calculated \( y \) for each test case.**
