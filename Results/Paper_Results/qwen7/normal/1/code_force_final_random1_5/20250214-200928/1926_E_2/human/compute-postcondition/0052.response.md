Output State: **`a` is 1, `L` is [4, 1], `tot` is 1, `pow` is 8, `n` is `k` - (1 + 1) // 2, `m` is (1 + 1) // 2**

Explanation: The code `L.append(m)` appends the value of `m` to the list `L`. From the initial state, `m` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`, which is `(1 + 1) // 2 = 1`. So, `L` changes from `[4]` to `[4, 1]`. The values of `a`, `tot`, `pow`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged according to the initial state.
