Output State: **`n` is now `n - (n + 1) // 2`, `k` is an integer equal to the second input number, `L` is a list containing 0 and `(n + 1) // 2`, `m` is equal to `(n + 1) // 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` remains unchanged as the code does not modify it directly. It is mentioned that `n` is now `n - (n + 1) // 2`, which is a precondition.
- The value of `k` remains unchanged as the code does not modify it.
- The list `L` is modified by appending `m` to it. Since `m` is equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, `L` becomes a list containing 0 and `(n + 1) // 2`.
- The value of `m` remains unchanged as the code does not modify it.
