Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer, and it is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    L = []
    while n:
        m = (n + 1) // 2
        n -= m
        L.append(m)
    tot = 0
    pow = 1
    for a in L:
        if tot < k and k <= tot + a:
            print(pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1))
        tot += a
        pow *= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `a` is 0, `L` is a list containing the values [1, 0, 1], `tot` is 1, `pow` is 4.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `a` will take the last value from the list `L`, which is 0. The variable `tot` will be the sum of all elements in `L`, which is 1 (1 + 0 + 0). The variable `pow` will be multiplied by 2 for each iteration of the loop, so after 3 iterations, `pow` will be \(2^3 = 4\). The list `L` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `a` is 1, `L` is [1], `tot` is 12, `k` is between 8 and 12, `pow` is 16.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `a` will take the last value from the list `L`, which is 1. The list `L` will be reduced to its last element, so it becomes [1]. The total sum `tot` will be the sum of all elements in the original list `L`, which is 4 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 8, plus the last element encountered in the loop, making it 12. The variable `k` remains within the range of 8 to 12 as it was in the last iteration. The variable `pow` doubles with each iteration of the loop, starting from 2, so after 3 iterations, it becomes 2^4 = 16.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `a` is 1, `L` is [2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], `pow` is 16, `tot` is 16.

To understand this output state, let's break down the loop execution:

1. Initially, `a` is 2, `L` is [2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], `pow` is 1, `tot` is 0, `k` is between 8 and 12, and `m` and `n` are both 1.
2. The loop iterates over each element in `L`.
3. In the first iteration, `a` is 2. Since `tot` (which is 0 initially) plus `a` (2) is less than or equal to `k`, the condition `if tot < k and k <= tot + a:` is satisfied. This prints `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)`, which is `1 * (2 * (k - 0) - 1) = 2 * k - 1`. Given `k` is between 8 and 12, let's assume `k` is 8 (the minimum value), so the output is `2 * 8 - 1 = 15`. However, since the exact value of `k` isn't provided, we focus on the changes to `pow` and `tot`.
4. After the first iteration, `tot` becomes `tot + a = 0 + 2 = 2`, and `pow` is updated to `pow * 2 = 1 * 2 = 2`.
5. In the second iteration, `a` is 1. Now `tot` is 2, and `tot + a = 2 + 1 = 3`. Since `tot + a` is still less than `k` (assuming `k` is still 8), the condition is satisfied again. The loop prints `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)`, which is `2 * (8 - 2) - 1 = 11`. Again, focusing on `pow` and `tot`, `tot` becomes `tot + a = 2 + 1 = 3`, and `pow` is updated to `pow * 2 = 2 * 2 = 4`.
6. In the third iteration, `a` is 1. Now `tot` is 3, and `tot + a = 3 + 1 = 4`. The condition is satisfied again. The loop prints `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)`, which is `4 * (8 - 3) - 1 = 17 - 4 = 13`. Focusing on `pow` and `tot`, `tot` becomes `tot + a = 3 + 1 = 4`, and `pow` is updated to `pow * 2 = 4 * 2 = 8`.
7. Continuing with the remaining elements in `L`:
   - For `a` = 1, `tot` becomes 5, and `pow` becomes 16.
   - For `a` = 1, `tot` becomes 6, and `pow` remains 16.
   - For `a` = 1, `tot` becomes 7, and `pow` remains 16.
   - For `a` = 1, `tot` becomes 8, and `pow` remains 16.

After all iterations, `a` will be 1 (since it cycles through the list `L`), `L` remains unchanged as `[2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`, `pow` is updated to 16, and `tot` is 16.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
