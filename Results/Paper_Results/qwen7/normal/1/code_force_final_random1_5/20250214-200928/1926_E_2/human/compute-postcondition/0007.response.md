Output State: **`n` is now `n - (n + 1) // 2`, `k` is an integer equal to the second input number, `L` is a list containing `m`, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`.**

Explanation:
- Initially, `n` is set to `n - (n + 1) // 2`.
- `k` is an integer equal to the second input number, which remains unchanged.
- `L` is an empty list before the code runs, and after running `L.append(m)`, `L` contains the value of `m`.
- `m` is defined as `(n + 1) // 2`, and it gets appended to the list `L`.
