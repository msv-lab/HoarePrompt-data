Output State: All variables will reach their final states based on the given conditions after all iterations of the loop have finished. Specifically:

- If `k > (n + 1) // 2`, then:
  - `i` will be `k - 1`.
  - `s` will be `2 * (n - 1)`.
  - `d` will be `1`.
  - `h` will be `0`.
  - `p` will be `k - 1`.
  - `g` will be `0`.
  - `f` will be `k - g`, which simplifies to `k - 0` or `k`.
  - `y` will be `2 ** (i - 1) * (2 * f - 1)`, which simplifies to `2 ** (k - 2) * (2 * k - 1)`.

- If `k <= (n + 1) // 2`, then:
  - `i` will be `k - 1`.
  - `n` remains the same.
  - `k` remains the same.
  - `s` will be `0`.
  - `d` will be `n`.
  - `h` will be `n`.
  - `p` will be `1`.
  - `f` will be `k - g`, where `g` is `0` initially, so it simplifies to `k`.
  - `y` will be `2 * k - 1`.

In both cases, the output value `y` will be calculated based on the conditions described above.
