Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is greater than 1. This variable is not used in the code snippet, so we can ignore it.
   - `n` is an input integer. We don't know the exact value of `n`, but this is not needed to determine the output of the code snippet.
   - `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer. For example, if the input string is "1 2 3 4", then `nums` would be `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1])
   ```
   - `nums[:-1]` is a slice of the list `nums` excluding the last element. For example, if `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]`, then `nums[:-1]` would be `[1, 2, 3]`.
   - `max(nums[:-1])` finds the maximum value in the sliced list. In our example, `max([1, 2, 3])` would be `3`.
   - `nums[-1]` refers to the last element of the original list `nums`. In our example, `nums[-1]` would be `4`.
   - The expression `max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1]` adds the maximum value from the sliced list to the last element of the original list. In our example, this would be `3 + 4 = 7`.

Given the above steps, the output of the code snippet will be the sum of the maximum value from all but the last element of the list and the last element of the list.

Output: **max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1]**
