Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - `t` is read as the number of test cases.
   - For each test case:
     - `n` is read as the number of books.
     - `nums` is read as a list of integers representing the number of pages in each book.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program prints the sum of the maximum value from the first \( n-1 \) elements (`max(nums[:-1])`) and the last element (`nums[-1]`).

### Reasoning:

- The goal is to maximize the total number of pages Alice can read by dividing the books into two piles such that each pile has at least one book.
- The program attempts to achieve this by always putting the book with the most pages in the second pile (last element) and the remaining books in the first pile.
- However, this approach is flawed because it does not consider all possible ways to divide the books into two piles.

### Example Analysis:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `2`
   - `1 1`
   - Output: `2`
   - The program outputs `1 + 1 = 2`, which is correct.

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `4`
   - `2 3 3 1`
   - Output: `4`
   - The program outputs `3 + 1 = 4`, which is correct.

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `5`
   - `2 2 3 2 2`
   - Output: `5`
   - The program outputs `3 + 2 = 5`, which is correct.

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - Input: `2`
   - `10 3`
   - Output: `13`
   - The program outputs `10 + 3 = 13`, which is correct.

5. **Test Case 5:**
   - Input: `3`
   - `1 2 3`
   - Output: `5`
   - The program outputs `3 + 2 = 5`, which is correct.

### Conclusion:

While the program happens to give the correct output for the given examples, it does not guarantee the optimal solution for all possible inputs. The approach of always putting the largest book in the second pile might not always yield the maximum total number of pages.

### Correctness:

Given the analysis, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
