Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `nums = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual strings based on spaces, converts each of those strings to integers, and stores them in a list called `nums`. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
