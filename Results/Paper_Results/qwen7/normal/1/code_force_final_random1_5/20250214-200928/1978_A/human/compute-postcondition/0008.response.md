Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer.

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1])`.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Splitting the Input String**: The input string is split by spaces, and each element is converted to an integer. This results in the list `nums`.

2. **Accessing Elements in `nums`**:
   - `nums[:-1]` refers to all elements of `nums` except the last one.
   - `nums[-1]` refers to the last element of `nums`.

3. **Finding the Maximum Value**:
   - `max(nums[:-1])` finds the maximum value among all elements in `nums` except the last one.

4. **Adding the Last Element**:
   - The result of `max(nums[:-1])` is added to `nums[-1]`.

Since the exact input string is not provided, we cannot determine the precise values of `nums`. However, we can describe the operation in general terms.

Output: **max(value1, value2, ..., valueN-1) + valueN** (where `value1, value2, ..., valueN-1` are the elements in `nums` except the last one, and `valueN` is the last element of `nums`).
