You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice has n books. The 1 -st book contains a_1 pages, the 2 -nd book contains
a_2 pages, \ldots , the n -th book contains a_n pages. Alice does the
following:

  * She divides all the books into two non-empty piles. Thus, each book ends up in exactly one of the two piles.
  * Alice reads one book with the highest number in each pile.

Alice loves reading very much. Help her find the maximum total number of pages
she can read by dividing the books into two piles.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 100
) — the number of books Alice has.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the number of pages in each book.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum number of pages
Alice can read.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    4
    
    2 3 3 1
    
    5
    
    2 2 3 2 2
    
    2
    
    10 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    2
    4
    5
    13
    5
    
Note

In the first test case, Alice can put book number 1 in the first pile, and
book number 2 in the second pile. Then she will read a_1 + a_2 = 1 + 1 = 2
pages.

In the second test case, Alice can put books with numbers 2 and 3 in the first
pile, and books with numbers 1 and 4 in the second pile. Then she will read
the book with the highest number 3 from the first pile, and the book with the
highest number 4 from the second pile. Then she will read a_3 + a_4 = 3 + 1 =
4 pages.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
        print(max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1])



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer t indicating the number of books, followed by an integer n and a list of n integers representing the number of pages in each book. For each test case, the function calculates and prints the sum of the maximum page count of the first n-1 books and the page count of the last book. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - `t` is read as the number of test cases.
   - For each test case:
     - `n` is read as the number of books.
     - `nums` is read as a list of integers representing the number of pages in each book.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program prints the sum of the maximum value from the first \( n-1 \) elements (`max(nums[:-1])`) and the last element (`nums[-1]`).

### Reasoning:

- The goal is to maximize the total number of pages Alice can read by dividing the books into two piles such that each pile has at least one book.
- The program attempts to achieve this by always putting the book with the most pages in the second pile (last element) and the remaining books in the first pile.
- However, this approach is flawed because it does not consider all possible ways to divide the books into two piles.

### Example Analysis:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `2`
   - `1 1`
   - Output: `2`
   - The program outputs `1 + 1 = 2`, which is correct.

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `4`
   - `2 3 3 1`
   - Output: `4`
   - The program outputs `3 + 1 = 4`, which is correct.

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `5`
   - `2 2 3 2 2`
   - Output: `5`
   - The program outputs `3 + 2 = 5`, which is correct.

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - Input: `2`
   - `10 3`
   - Output: `13`
   - The program outputs `10 + 3 = 13`, which is correct.

5. **Test Case 5:**
   - Input: `3`
   - `1 2 3`
   - Output: `5`
   - The program outputs `3 + 2 = 5`, which is correct.

### Conclusion:

While the program happens to give the correct output for the given examples, it does not guarantee the optimal solution for all possible inputs. The approach of always putting the largest book in the second pile might not always yield the maximum total number of pages.

### Correctness:

Given the analysis, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
