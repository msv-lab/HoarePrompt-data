Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the function `func()` is flawed. Specifically, it does not ensure that the books are divided into two non-empty piles such that the sum of the maximum page count from each pile is maximized.

Here's why the current solution is incorrect:
- The code takes the maximum value from all but the last element (`nums[:-1]`) and adds it to the last element (`nums[-1]`). This approach does not guarantee that the books are split into two non-empty piles optimally.

To solve this problem correctly, you need to sort the array of book pages and then calculate the sum of the maximum page counts from the two piles formed by splitting the array at any position. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
        nums.sort()
        max_pages = 0
        for i in range(1, n):
            max_pages = max(max_pages, nums[i-1] + nums[n-1])
        print(max_pages)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This solution works as follows:
1. It sorts the list of book pages.
2. It iterates through possible splits of the sorted list, calculating the sum of the maximum page count from each pile.
3. It keeps track of the maximum sum found and prints it.

This ensures that the books are divided into two non-empty piles optimally to maximize the total number of pages Alice can read.
