Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the program always includes the last element in one of the piles without considering the possibility of dividing the books into two piles such that the sum of the maximum elements from both piles is maximized.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
4
2 3 3 1
```
The correct output should be 6 (by putting books 2 and 3 in one pile and books 1 and 4 in another), but the program outputs 4 (by putting books 2 and 3 in one pile and book 1 in another).

The program's logic only considers the last element in one of the piles and does not ensure that the maximum possible sum of the highest books in both piles is achieved.
