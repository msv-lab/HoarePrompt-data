Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer**.

Explanation: The code `nums = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements based on spaces, converts each element to an integer, and stores the resulting list in `nums`. The initial values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and `nums` is updated to reflect the new list of integers.
