Output State: **`i` is equal to `lk - 2`, `lk` must be greater than 3, `ans` is a list containing the values `[1, 2, 4, ..., 2^(lk-2), k + 1]`, (k - 1 - sum(ans))**.

Explanation: The code `ans.append(k + 1)` appends the value `k + 1` to the list `ans`. Given the initial state, `ans` was originally `[1, 2, 4, ..., 2^(lk-2)]` with `(k - 1 - sum(ans))` as its last element. After appending `k + 1` to `ans`, the list now includes `k + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
