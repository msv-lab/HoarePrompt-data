Output State: `i` is `lk - 1`, `ans` contains `[2, 2, 4, 8, ..., 2^(lk-2), k + 1, 2 * k + 1, 2^lk]`.

Explanation: The loop continues to append `2 ** i` to the list `ans` for each iteration where `i` starts from `lk` and goes up to `l-1`. Since the loop runs until `i` reaches `l-1`, the final value of `i` will be `lk - 1`. The list `ans` will contain all the powers of 2 starting from `2` up to `2^(lk-2)`, followed by the values `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1`, and finally `2^lk`.
