The function accepts a dictionary `d` where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, a list `processing` of the same length as the maximum possible value in the lists within `d`, initialized with zeros, an integer key `da` present in the dictionary `d`, and a list `rank` of the same length as the keys in `d`, initialized with zeros. If the length of `d[da]` is 1, the function returns 1. Otherwise, it recursively processes each element in `d[da]` using `func_12`, updating the `processing` list and tracking the minimum value (`tmp`). Finally, it sets the rank of `da` in `d` to `tmp + 1` and returns this rank.
