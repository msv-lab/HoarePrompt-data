Output State: **`i` is 0; `lk` must be at least 1; `ans` contains the value 1**

Explanation: The code appends \(2^i\) to the list `ans`. Given that `i` is initially 0, \(2^0\) equals 1. Therefore, `ans` now contains the value 1. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 0, and the condition for `lk` remains the same.
