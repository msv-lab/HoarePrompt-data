Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head is defined as follows:
   ```python
   for i in range(lk, l):
   ```
   The only variable in the loop head is `i`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `i` should be less than `l`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `lk - 2`.

3. **Update the State:**
   For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 (since the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration). Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `lk - 1`.

4. **Adjust Other States:**
   - The variable `ans` does not change within the loop head and remains as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - The variable `lk` and `l` do not change within the loop head and remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Given this analysis, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is `lk - 1`, `ans` contains `2**
