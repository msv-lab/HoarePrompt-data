Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(lk, l):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i`, `lk`, and `l`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `i` is `lk - 1`
   - `ans` contains `[2, 2]`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `l`.

4. **Calculate the new value of `i`**: Since `i` was `lk - 1` at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` will be `lk`.

5. **Check if the loop should continue**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `l`. Given that `i` will now be `lk`, the loop will continue if `lk < l`.

6. **Adjust the state**: The only variables that need to be adjusted are those in the loop head, which are `i`, `lk`, and `l`. The variable `ans` is not part of the loop head and does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:
- `i` is `lk`
- `ans` still contains `[2, 2]`
- `lk` remains the same
- `l` remains the same

However, since the question asks to focus only on the objects in the loop head, we only need to adjust `i`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is `lk`, `ans` contains `[2, 2]`**
