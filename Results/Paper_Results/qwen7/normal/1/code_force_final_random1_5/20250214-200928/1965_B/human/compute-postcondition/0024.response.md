Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `lk`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < lk - 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `lk` must be at least 1
   - `ans` contains the value 1

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `lk - 1`.
   - Since `i` is currently 0, `lk - 1` must be greater than 0, which means `lk` must be at least 2.
   - After the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 1.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be 1 and `lk` must be at least 2.

**State: **`i` is 1, `lk` must be at least 2, `ans` contains the value 1**
