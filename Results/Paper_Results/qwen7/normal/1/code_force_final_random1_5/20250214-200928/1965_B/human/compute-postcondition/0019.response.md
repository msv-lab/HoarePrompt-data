Output State: **`b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `k` is the integer returned from `func_7()`, `l` is the length of `b`, `bk` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix.**

Explanation: The code `bk = bin(k)[2:]` converts the integer `k` into its binary representation using the `bin()` function and then slices off the '0b' prefix. The original values of `b`, `k`, and `l` remain unchanged. Therefore, `bk` is the new variable holding the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix.
