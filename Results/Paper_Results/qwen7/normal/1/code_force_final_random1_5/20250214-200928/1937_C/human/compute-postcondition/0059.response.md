Output State: **`best` is 4, `n` is greater than or equal to 5, `i` is 5, `k` is 5**

Explanation: The code `k = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 5) to `k`. The values of `best`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions with `k` updated to 5.
