Output State: **`best` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to the original value of `n`, `i` is 1, `k` is the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<' (or 1 if `res` was never '<'), `res` is a new input string, and the current value of `res` is '<'**.

Explanation: The code `best = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 1) to the variable `best`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
