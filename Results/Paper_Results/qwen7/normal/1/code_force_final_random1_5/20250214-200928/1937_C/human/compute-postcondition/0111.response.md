Output State: **`best` is 5, `i` is 4, `k` is 4, `n` must be greater than 3, `res` is an input string**

Explanation: The code `k = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 4) to `k`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `best` is still 5, `i` is 4, `k` is now 4, `n` must still be greater than 3, and `res` remains an input string.
