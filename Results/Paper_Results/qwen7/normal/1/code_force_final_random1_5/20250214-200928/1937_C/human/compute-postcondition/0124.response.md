Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `res` is an input string.
   - If the current value of `res` is '<', then `best` is assigned the value of `i`.

4. **Determine the state adjustments needed for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is controlled by `i` and `n`, we need to update these two variables.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was in the range `[1, n-1]` (since `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`).
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become `i + 1`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `i < n`, so `n` must remain the same.

5. **Post-condition for the next iteration**:
   - `n` remains the same and must still be greater than 1.
   - `res` remains the same and is still an input string.
   - `best` is only updated if `res` is '<' and the current value of `i` is the smallest so far. However, since we are only adjusting the loop variables, we do not need to change the value of `best` unless explicitly stated otherwise.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `res` is an input string, `i` is `i + 1`**.
