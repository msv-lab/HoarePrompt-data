Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but interacts with an external entity to find pairs of indices i and j such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized using at most 3n queries for each test case. It handles multiple test cases where n is the size of the permutation and t is the number of test cases. For each test case, it returns the maximum \( p_i \oplus p_j \) found.**

This means the function needs to process multiple test cases, each involving a permutation of size n. For each test case, it should use at most 3n queries to find a pair of indices (i, j) that maximizes the bitwise XOR of the elements at those indices. The function should then return the maximum XOR value found for each test case.
