Output State: **The output state after the loop executes all iterations is such that `n` must be greater than or equal to the original value of `n`, `i` is `n-1`, `k` is the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<' (or 1 if `res` was never '<'), and `res` is the final input string received.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `n` will be the same as the initial input integer. The variable `i` will be `n-1` because the loop runs from 2 to `n-1`. The variable `k` will be the last value of `i` for which the input `res` was '<', or it will remain 1 if `res` was never '<'. The variable `res` will be the input string received during the last iteration where `res` was read.
