State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2**

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop head specifies `for i in range(2, n)`.
2. For the loop to execute, the range function must generate at least one value for `i`.
3. The range function `range(2, n)` generates values starting from 2 up to (but not including) `n`.
4. To ensure the loop generates at least one value, `n` must be greater than 2. If `n` were 2 or less, the range would not produce any values for `i`, and the loop would not execute.
5. The variable `i` starts at the beginning of the range, which is 2.

Therefore, the state must be adjusted to ensure `n` is greater than 2 and `i` is initialized to 2.
