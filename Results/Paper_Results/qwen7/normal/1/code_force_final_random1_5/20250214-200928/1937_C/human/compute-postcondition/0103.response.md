Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(2, n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `best` is 5
   - `n` is greater than 1
   - `i` is 2
   - `k` is 2
   - `res` is an input string where the current value of `res` is '<'

3. **Determine the Conditions for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Given that `i` is currently 2, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to continue.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `i` is 2, it will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration, making `i` equal to 3.
   - Therefore, `n` must be greater than 3 for the loop to execute again.

5. **Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration**:
   - `best` remains 5 (unchanged)
   - `i` becomes 3
   - `n` must be greater than 3
   - `k` remains 2 (unchanged)
   - `res` remains '<' (unchanged)

So, the final state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`best` is 5, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `k` is 2, `res` is an input string where the current value of `res` is '<'**
