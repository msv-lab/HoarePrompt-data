Output State: **`best` is 4, `n` must be greater than or equal to 5, `i` is 5, `k` is 5, `res` is an input string and its current value is '<'**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `i` (which is 5) to `k`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `k` is updated to 5, while `best`, `n`, `i`, and `res` retain their original values.
