Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variables `i` and `n`.
2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n` (exclusive). This means the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `best` is 2
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to the original value of `n`
   - `i` is 2
   - `k` is 1
   - `res` is an input string, and its current value is an input string if it equals '<'
4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 3.
   - The value of `n` must remain the same as it was at the start of the loop because the loop condition is based on `i < n`.

Given these points, the only variables that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

- `i` will be incremented from 2 to 3.
- `n` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`best` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to the original value of `n`, `i` is 3, `k` is 1, `res` is an input string, and the current value of `res` is an input string if it equals '<'**
