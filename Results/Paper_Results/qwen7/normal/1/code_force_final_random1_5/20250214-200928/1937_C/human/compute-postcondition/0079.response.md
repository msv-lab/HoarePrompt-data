Output: **'? 5 1 5 2'**

Explanation:
- `best` is explicitly given as 1.
- `k` is explicitly given as 5.
- `i` is explicitly given as 2.
- `res` is explicitly given as '<', but it is not used in the print statement.
- The print statement is `print('?', k, best, k, i, flush=True)`, which will print the string '?' followed by the values of `k`, `best`, `k`, and `i` in that order.

Therefore, the output will be `? 5 1 5 2`.
