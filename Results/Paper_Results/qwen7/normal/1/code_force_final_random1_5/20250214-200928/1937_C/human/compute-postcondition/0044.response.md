Output State: **Postcondition: `best` is 4, `n` must be greater than or equal to the original value of `n`, `i` is 4, `k` is 1, `res` is an input string.**

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `i` from 1 to `n-1`. After 3 iterations, `best` is 3. If the loop runs one more time (making it 4 iterations total), `i` will become 4. Since the condition `res == '<'` has not been met for any `i > k` (where `k` is 1), `best` will remain 3. Therefore, after all iterations, `best` will be the maximum value of `i` for which `res` was '<', which is 3, unless `i` reaches `n-1` and `res` is not '<', in which case `best` will still be 3. However, since the problem does not specify that `i` reaches `n-1` and `res` is not '<', we assume the loop stops before reaching `n-1` if `res` is not '<'. Thus, `best` remains 3, but the next value of `i` is 4, and `k` remains 1.
