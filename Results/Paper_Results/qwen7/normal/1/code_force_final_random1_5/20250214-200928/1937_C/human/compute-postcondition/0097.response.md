Based on the initial state provided:

- `best` is explicitly given as 5.
- `n` is greater than 1 but its exact value is not needed for this specific print statement.
- `i` is explicitly given as 2.
- `k` is explicitly given as 1.
- `res` is an input string but its value is not needed for this specific print statement.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', 0, k, 0, i, flush=True)
```

Breaking it down:
- `'?'` is a literal string.
- `0` is a literal integer.
- `k` is explicitly given as 1.
- `0` is another literal integer.
- `i` is explicitly given as 2.

So, the print statement will output these values in the order they appear.

Output: **'? 0 1 0 2'**
