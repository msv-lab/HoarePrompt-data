Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `res` is an input string, `i` is `i + 1`, `best` is `i + 1`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `i + 1` to the variable `best`. Since `i` was previously `i + 1`, `best` now holds the value of `i + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
