### Reasoning:

1. **Test Case Initialization**: 
   - The program initializes `t` to 7 and `cas_de_test` with predefined test cases. This part is correct and serves as input for the function `func_1`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function iterates over each test case and calculates the total points and total matches.
   - It checks if the total points are even, which is necessary because each match contributes either 2 points (to the winners) or 1 point to each player in a draw.
   - It then calculates the total number of matches from the total points.
   - It checks if the total number of matches is more than 3 (since there are only 3 players) or if the highest score (`p3`) exceeds the total number of matches, which would be impossible.
   - It calculates the number of draws using the formula derived from the points distribution.
   - If any of these conditions fail, it appends `-1` to the results list, indicating an invalid configuration.

3. **Output**:
   - The function returns the list of results, which are then printed.

### Analysis:

- **Total Points Check**: The check for `total_points % 2 != 0` ensures that the total points are even, which is necessary for the points distribution to be valid.
- **Total Matches Calculation**: The calculation of `total_matchs = total_points // 2` correctly determines the total number of matches.
- **Match Constraints**: The checks `if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs` ensure that the number of matches and the highest score are feasible.
- **Draw Calculation**: The formula `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)` and the subsequent division by 2 correctly calculates the number of draws.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program correctly handles all test cases and outputs the expected results.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **True**
