### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine the maximum number of draws that could have happened given the scores of three players.
   - A draw gives 1 point to each player, while a win/loss gives 2 points to the winner and 0 to the loser.
   - The scores are given in non-decreasing order (p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3).

2. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The program is designed to handle multiple test cases.
   - It iterates over each test case and calculates the maximum possible number of draws.
   - The function `func_1` takes the number of test cases `t` and a list of tuples representing the scores `(p1, p2, p3)` for each test case.

3. **Key Steps in `func_1`:**
   - **Total Points Calculation:**
     - `total_points = p1 + p2 + p3`
     - This is the sum of all points scored by the three players.
   - **Check for Validity:**
     - `if total_points % 2 != 0:`
       - If the total points are odd, it's impossible to distribute them such that each game results in either a win/loss or a draw.
       - Hence, the result is `-1`.
   - **Calculate Total Matches:**
     - `total_matchs = total_points // 2`
     - This is the total number of games played.
   - **Further Validation:**
     - `if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs:`
       - If the total number of matches exceeds 3 or the highest score exceeds the total number of matches, it's impossible to achieve these scores.
       - Hence, the result is `-1`.
   - **Calculate Maximum Draws:**
     - `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`
     - This formula calculates the remaining points after accounting for the differences in scores.
     - `egalites // 2` gives the maximum number of draws.
     - If `egalites < 0`, it means the scores are inconsistent, and the result is `-1`.

4. **Testing the Program:**
   - The program is tested with predefined test cases.
   - The expected outputs match the provided examples.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of draws based on the given scores. It handles edge cases where the scores are inconsistent and returns `-1` appropriately.

**Correctness: True**
