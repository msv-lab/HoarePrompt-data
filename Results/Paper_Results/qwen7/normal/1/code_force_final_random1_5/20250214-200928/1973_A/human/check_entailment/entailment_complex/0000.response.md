Reasoning:

1. The program correctly initializes the number of test cases `t` and the test cases `cas_de_test`.
2. The function `func_1` iterates over each test case and performs the necessary calculations to determine the maximum number of draws.
3. The logic within the function checks several conditions to ensure the scores are consistent with a valid set of games:
   - The total points must be even.
   - The total number of matches must not exceed 3 (since there are only three players).
   - The highest score (`p3`) must not exceed the total number of matches.
4. The calculation of `egalites` (the number of draws) is done using the formula `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`. This formula accounts for the points distribution among the players.
5. The program correctly handles invalid cases by appending `-1` to the `resultats` list when any of the conditions fail.
6. The final output is generated by printing the results for each test case.

Given the problem statement and the provided code, the program appears to be logically sound and correctly implements the required functionality.

Correctness: **True**
