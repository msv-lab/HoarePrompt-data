Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the tuple `(p1, p2, p3)` from the list `cas_de_test`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements in `cas_de_test` to iterate over.

3. **Determine the state adjustments**:
   - `total_matchs`: This variable is derived from `total_points // 2` and does not depend on the loop itself but rather on the values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.
   - `total_points`: This is the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, and it remains unchanged within each iteration of the loop.
   - `egalites`: This value is calculated based on `total_points` and the differences between `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. Since these values are not modified within the loop, they remain the same.
   - `resultats`: This variable is determined by checking the value of `egalites` and setting `resultats` to either a list containing `-1` or a list containing `egalites // 2`. This value is set once per iteration and does not change until the next iteration.

Given that the loop iterates over different tuples `(p1, p2, p3)` from `cas_de_test`, the only thing that changes is the tuple itself. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the tuple `(p1, p2, p3)`.

Since the loop is about to start its next iteration, the tuple `(p1, p2, p3)` will be the next tuple from `cas_de_test`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`, `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`, `egalites` is `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`, and `resultats` is either a list containing `-1` or a list containing `egalites // 2` depending on whether `egalites < 0` or not, and `(p1, p2, p3)` is the next tuple from `cas_de_test`**.
