### Reasoning:

1. **Test Case Initialization**:
   - The program initializes `t` to 7 and `cas_de_test` with predefined test cases. This part is correct and serves as input for the function `func_1`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function iterates over each test case and calculates the total points and total matches.
   - It checks if the total points are even, which is necessary because each match contributes either 2 points (to the winners) or 1 point to each player in a draw.
   - It then calculates the total number of matches from the total points.
   - It checks if the total number of matches is more than 3 (since there are only 3 players) or if the highest score (`p3`) exceeds the total number of matches, which would be impossible.
   - It calculates the number of draws using the formula derived from the points distribution.
   - If any of these conditions fail, it appends `-1` to the results list, indicating an invalid configuration.

3. **Output**:
   - The function returns the list of results, which are then printed.

### Analysis:

- **Total Points Check**: The check for `total_points % 2 != 0` ensures that the total points are even, which is necessary for the points distribution to be valid.
- **Total Matches Calculation**: The calculation of `total_matchs = total_points // 2` correctly determines the total number of matches.
- **Match Constraints**: The checks `if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs` ensure that the number of matches and the highest score are feasible.
- **Draw Calculation**: The formula `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)` and the subsequent division by 2 correctly calculates the number of draws.

However, there are some issues with the logic and the provided test cases:

1. **Test Case (1, 1, 1)**:
   - Total points: `1 + 1 + 1 = 3`
   - Total matches: `3 // 2 = 1`
   - `p3 = 1`, which is less than or equal to `total_matchs = 1`
   - `egalites = 3 - 2 * (1 - 1) - 2 * (1 - 1) = 3`
   - `egalites // 2 = 3 // 2 = 1` (This should be 0 since no draws are possible with this configuration)

2. **Test Case (3, 3, 3)**:
   - Total points: `3 + 3 + 3 = 9`
   - Total matches: `9 // 2 = 4`
   - `p3 = 3`, which is less than or equal to `total_matchs = 4`
   - `egalites = 9 - 2 * (3 - 3) - 2 * (3 - 3) = 9`
   - `egalites // 2 = 9 // 2 = 4` (This should be 0 since no draws are possible with this configuration)

3. **Test Case (1, 1, 10)**:
   - Total points: `1 + 1 + 10 = 12`
   - Total matches: `12 // 2 = 6`
   - `p3 = 10`, which is greater than `total_matchs = 6`
   - The function should return `-1` here, but it does not.

### Corrected Logic:

The corrected logic should handle the following:
- Ensure that `p3` does not exceed `total_matchs`.
- Adjust the draw calculation to ensure it is non-negative and valid.

### Corrected Code:

```python
def func_1(t, cas_de_test):
    resultats = []
    for (p1, p2, p3) in cas_de_test:
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
        if total_points % 2 != 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        total_matchs = total_points // 2
        if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)
        if egalites < 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
        else:
            resultats.append(egalites // 2)
    return resultats
```

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment was partially correct but did not fully address the edge cases. The corrected logic ensures that all constraints are properly handled.

Final: **False**
