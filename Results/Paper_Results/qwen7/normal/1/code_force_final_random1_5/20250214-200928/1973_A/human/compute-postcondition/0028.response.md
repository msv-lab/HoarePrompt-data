Output State: **`total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`, `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`, `egalites` is `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`, `resultats` is a list containing `-1`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value `-1` to the list `resultats`. Since `total_points` is odd, the list `resultats` now contains `-1`. The other variables (`total_matchs`, `total_points`, and `egalites`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
