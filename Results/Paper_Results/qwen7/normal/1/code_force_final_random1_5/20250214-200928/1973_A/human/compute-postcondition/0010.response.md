Output State: **`total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`, `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`, and `resultats` contains `-1` and a list with one element `-1`.**

Explanation: The code `resultats.append(-1)` appends the value `-1` to the list `resultats`. Since `resultats` was initially a list (possibly empty), after appending `-1`, it now contains a single element `-1`. The values of `total_matchs`, `total_points`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` remain unchanged.
