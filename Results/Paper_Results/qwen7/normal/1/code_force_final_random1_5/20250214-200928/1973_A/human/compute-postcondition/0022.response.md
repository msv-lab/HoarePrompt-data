The code `total_points = p1 + p2 + p3` does not change the value of `total_points` because it is already defined as `p1 + p2 + p3`. The other variables (`total_matchs`, `egalites`, `resultats`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`, `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`, `egalites` is `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`, and `resultats` is either a list containing `-1` or a list containing `egalites // 2` depending on whether `egalites < 0` or not, and `(p1, p2, p3)` is the next tuple from `cas_de_test`.**
