Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the scores are `1 1 10`. According to the problem description, the maximum number of draws that could have happened for this case should be 2, but the program incorrectly outputs 2 instead of -1. This is because the logic in the program does not properly check if the scores are consistent with any valid set of games and results. Specifically, the condition `if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs:` is too restrictive and does not account for all valid scenarios, leading to incorrect outputs for certain inputs.
