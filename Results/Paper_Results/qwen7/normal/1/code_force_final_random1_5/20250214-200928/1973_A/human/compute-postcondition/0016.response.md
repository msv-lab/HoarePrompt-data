Output State: **`total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`, `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`, `egalites` is `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`, `resultats` is `[-1]`**.

The code appends `-1` to the list `resultats`, which was initially unchanged. The values of `total_matchs`, `total_points`, and `egalites` remain the same as they were in the initial state.
