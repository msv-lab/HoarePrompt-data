Postcondition: **All nodes from 0 to n-1 have been processed, meaning `visited[i]` is True for every `i` in the range of `n`. The value of `coef[i]` is 1 for every `i` where `visited[i]` is True. The value of `tot` is the sum of all non-zero contributions made during the DFS calls for each component. `bipartite` is True for each component where the graph is bipartite and `tot` is not zero. `ok` is True if any component is bipartite and `tot` is not zero. The condition `ok` is True.**
