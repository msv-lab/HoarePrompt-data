Output State: **`i` is 0; `coef[i]` is 1; `n` must be greater than 0; the current value of `visited[i]` is False; `tot` is 0.**

The code initializes `tot` to 0. This does not affect the values of `i`, `coef[i]`, `n`, or `visited[i]`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial values, and `tot` is set to 0.
