Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `i` is 0; `x[i]` is an input integer, `y[i]` is an input integer, `r[i]` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `x[i], y[i], r[i] = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input from the user and assigns them to `x[i]`, `y[i]`, and `r[i]` respectively. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state.
