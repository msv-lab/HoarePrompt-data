Output State: **`bipartite` is True; `i` is 0; `coef[i]` is 1; `n` must be greater than 0; the current value of `visited[i]` is True; `tot` is 0.**

Explanation: The `dfs(i)` function is called with `i` as the argument. This function typically performs a depth-first search starting from node `i`. After the call to `dfs(i)`, the state of the `visited` array will be updated such that `visited[i]` is set to `True`, indicating that node `i` has been visited. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
