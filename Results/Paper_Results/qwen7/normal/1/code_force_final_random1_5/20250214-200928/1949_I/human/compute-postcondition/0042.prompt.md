Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `bipartite` is True, `tot` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to the final value of `i`, which will be `n-1`, `ok` is False, and the values of `visited`, `coef`, and the initial conditions for `x`, `y`, and `r` lists remain as they were initialized.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if not visited[i]:
        coef[i] = 1
        tot = 0
        bipartite = True
        dfs(i)
        ok = ok or bipartite and tot != 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `visited[i]` is True, `coef[i]` is 1, `tot` is 0, and `ok` is True because `ok or bipartite and tot != 0` evaluates to True since `bipartite` is True and `tot` is 0 (which means the condition `tot != 0` is False, but the overall expression is True due to the `or` operator).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, if `visited[i]` is False, then `ok` is True, `bipartite` is True, and `tot` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `coef[2]` remains unchanged (which is 1), `tot` is either 0 or incremented by a value related to `visited[i]` (which is not explicitly defined in the if part but remains consistent with the initial state), `bipartite` remains True, and `ok` remains True.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
