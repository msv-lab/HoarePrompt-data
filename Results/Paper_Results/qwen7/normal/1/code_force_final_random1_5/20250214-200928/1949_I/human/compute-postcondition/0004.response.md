Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of length `n` initialized to None, `y` is a list of length `n` initialized to None, `r` is a list of length `n` initialized to None, `visited` is a list of boolean values of length `n` initialized to False, `coef` is a list of length `n` initialized to None, `visited` is now `[False] * n`**.

This means that the `visited` list has been updated to a list of `n` False values. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
