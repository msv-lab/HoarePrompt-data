Output State: **All nodes from 0 to n-1 have been processed, meaning `visited[i]` is True for every `i` in the range of `n`. The value of `coef[i]` is 1 for every `i` where `visited[i]` is True. The value of `tot` is the sum of all non-zero contributions made during the DFS calls for each component. `bipartite` is True for each component where the graph is bipartite and `tot` is not zero. `ok` is True if any component is bipartite and `tot` is not zero.**

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, every node in the graph has been visited exactly once. For each connected component in the graph, the `coef` array is set to 1 for all nodes in that component, indicating that each node belongs to one of the two sets in the bipartite graph. The `tot` variable accumulates the sum of `coef` values for nodes in each component, and `bipartite` is set to True if the component is bipartite and `tot` is not zero. Finally, `ok` is True if there exists at least one component that is both bipartite and has a non-zero `tot` value.
