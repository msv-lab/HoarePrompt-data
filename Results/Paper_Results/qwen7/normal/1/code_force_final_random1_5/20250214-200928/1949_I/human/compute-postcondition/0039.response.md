Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `coef[2]` is 1, `tot` is 0, `bipartite` is True, `ok` is True**

Explanation: The line `ok = ok or bipartite and tot != 0` updates the value of `ok`. Since `bipartite` is True and `tot` is 0 (which means `tot != 0` is False), the condition `bipartite and tot != 0` evaluates to False. However, since `ok` was not specified initially, it defaults to `False`. The `or` operation between `False` and `False` results in `False`. But since `bipartite` is True, the overall condition `ok or (bipartite and tot != 0)` evaluates to `True`. Therefore, `ok` becomes `True`. All other variables remain unchanged.
