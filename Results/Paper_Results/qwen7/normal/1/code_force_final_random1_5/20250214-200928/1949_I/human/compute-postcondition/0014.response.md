Output State: **`bipartite` is True, `tot` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to the final value of `i`, which will be `n-1`, and the values of `visited`, `coef`, and the initial conditions for `x`, `y`, and `r` lists remain as they were initialized.**

Explanation: The variable `bipartite` is assigned the value `True`. The other variables (`tot`, `n`, `visited`, `coef`, `x`, `y`, and `r`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
