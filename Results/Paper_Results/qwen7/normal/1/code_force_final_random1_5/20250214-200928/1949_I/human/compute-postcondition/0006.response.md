Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` should start from 0 and increment by 1 in each iteration.
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Check the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0, we don't need to change its initial value.
   - We need to ensure that `n` is at least 1 (greater than 0) for the loop to execute.

5. **Consider the other variables**:
   - `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, and `coef` are lists of length `n` initialized to specific values. These lists are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Based on the above analysis, the only states that need to be adjusted are `n` and `i`.

Therefore, the final state after adjusting the necessary variables is:

**State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
