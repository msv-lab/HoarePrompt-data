Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of length `n` initialized to None, `y` is a list of length `n`, `r` is a list of length `n`, `visited` is a list of boolean values of length `n` initialized to False, `coef` is a list of length `n` initialized to None**.

Explanation: The line `x = [None] * n` initializes the list `x` to a list of length `n` where each element is `None`. The values of `y`, `r`, `visited`, and `coef` remain unchanged from their initial states.
