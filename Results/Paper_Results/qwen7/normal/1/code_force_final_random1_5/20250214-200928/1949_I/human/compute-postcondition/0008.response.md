Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `x[i]` is an input integer.
   - `y[i]` is an input integer.
   - `r[i]` is an input integer.

2. **Loop Head Analysis:**
   - The loop is defined as `for i in range(n):`.
   - This means the loop will iterate from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`.

3. **Current Values:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
   - Since `i` is 0, the loop will continue to the next iteration if `i < n`.

4. **Next Iteration Requirements:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will become 1.
   - The condition `i < n` must still hold true, meaning `n` must be greater than 1.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `i` will be incremented to 1.
   - `n` must remain greater than 1 to allow the loop to continue.

6. **New State:**
   - `n` must be greater than 1 (since `i` will be 1).
   - `i` is now 1.
   - `x[1]` is an input integer.
   - `y[1]` is an input integer.
   - `r[1]` is an input integer.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `x[1]` is an input integer, `y[1]` is an input integer, `r[1]` is an input integer**
