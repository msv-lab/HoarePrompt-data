Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `a` is an input integer, `i` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and converts them to integers, assigning the first integer to `x` and the second integer to `y`. The values of `t`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
