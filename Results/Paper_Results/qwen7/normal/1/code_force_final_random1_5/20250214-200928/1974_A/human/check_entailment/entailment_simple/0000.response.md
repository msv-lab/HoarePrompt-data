Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `x` and `y`.
3. It calculates `z` which represents the minimum number of screens needed to place the icons.
   - `z = (y + 1) // 2` calculates the minimum number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons.
   - `m = 15 * z - y * 4` calculates the remaining capacity after placing the 2x2 icons.
   - If `m < a`, it means there is still space left on the current screen to fit some 1x1 icons, so we need to adjust `z` to account for the additional 1x1 icons that can fit.
   - The final formula `z = z + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15` ensures that we correctly account for the remaining 1x1 icons and round up to the nearest screen.
4. The program prints the result for each test case.

Given the logic and calculations in the program, it seems to follow the correct approach to calculate the minimum number of screens needed to place the icons. The formulae used are consistent with the grid constraints and the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
