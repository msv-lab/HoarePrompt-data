You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

The solution for the third test case can look as follows:

- Program:
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        z = (y + 1) // 2
        m = 15 * z - y * 4
        if m < a:
            z = z + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15
        print(z)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers \(x\) and \(y\) (where \(0 \leq x, y \leq 99\)), and an integer \(t\) (where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)). For each test case, it calculates an integer \(z\) based on the values of \(x\) and \(y\), and prints the result. If \(m < a\) (where \(a\) is the number of test cases and \(m = 15 \cdot ((y + 1) // 2) - y \cdot 4\)), then \(z\) is adjusted by adding \((x - m + 15 - 1) // 15\) to \((y + 1) // 2\). Otherwise, \(z\) remains \((y + 1) // 2\). The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `a`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y`, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Calculating Minimum Screens:**
   - The variable `z` is calculated as `(y + 1) // 2`. This represents the minimum number of screens needed to fit all 2x2 icons, since each 2x2 icon requires 2 screen cells and each screen has 15 cells.
   - The variable `m` is calculated as `15 * z - y * 4`. This formula seems to be trying to calculate the remaining space after placing all 2x2 icons, but it doesn't align well with the logic of the problem.

3. **Adjusting for Remaining 1x1 Icons:**
   - The condition `if m < a:` checks if there is any remaining space after placing all 2x2 icons.
   - If there is remaining space, it calculates additional screens needed for the 1x1 icons using `(x - m + 15 - 1) // 15`.

4. **Output:**
   - The final value of `z` is printed, which should represent the total number of screens needed.

### Detailed Analysis of the Logic

1. **Calculation of `z`:**
   - `z = (y + 1) // 2` correctly calculates the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons, as each 2x2 icon uses 2 screen cells and each screen has 15 cells.

2. **Remaining Space Calculation:**
   - `m = 15 * z - y * 4` is incorrect because it does not account for the actual space available after placing the 2x2 icons. Each 2x2 icon uses 4 cells, so the correct calculation should be `m = 15 * z - 4 * y`.

3. **Additional Screens for 1x1 Icons:**
   - The logic for calculating additional screens for 1x1 icons is flawed. The expression `(x - m + 15 - 1) // 15` does not correctly handle the remaining space and the placement of 1x1 icons.

### Corrected Approach

A correct approach would be:
1. Calculate the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons: `z = (y + 1) // 2`.
2. Calculate the remaining space after placing 2x2 icons: `remaining_space = 15 * z - 4 * y`.
3. Calculate the number of additional screens needed for 1x1 icons: `additional_screens = (x + remaining_space - 1) // 15`.
4. The total number of screens needed is `z + additional_screens`.

### Conclusion

The given program has logical errors in the calculation of `m` and the handling of remaining space. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
