The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input and assigns them to `x` and `y`. The values of `t`, `a`, `i`, `z`, and `m` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state includes the updated values of `x` and `y` as input integers, while keeping the original values of `t`, `a`, `i`, `z`, and `m`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an input integer, `i` is 2, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `z` is \((y + 1) // 2 + (x - m + 14) // 15\), `m` is \(15 \cdot ((y + 1) // 2) - y \cdot 4\)**
