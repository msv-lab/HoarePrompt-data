Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes multiple test cases where each test case consists of two integers, `x` and `y`, within the range of 0 to 99, and an integer `t` within the range of 1 to 10^4. The function does not return anything explicitly mentioned in the given information.**

Given the constraints, the function likely processes these test cases internally but no return value is specified in the provided output cases.
