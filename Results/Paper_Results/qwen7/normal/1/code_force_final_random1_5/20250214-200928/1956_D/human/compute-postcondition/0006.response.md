Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies \(0 \leq a_i \leq 10^7\).
- `s`, `m`, and `ops` are the results of the function `func_2(a)`.
- `ops` must contain at least one tuple `(l, r)`.
- `l` is the first element of the first tuple in `ops`.
- `r` is the second element of the first tuple in `ops`.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(l + 1, r + 1)
```

From the precondition, we know:
- `l` is the first element of the first tuple in `ops`.
- `r` is the second element of the first tuple in `ops`.

Since the exact values of `l` and `r` are not specified, we cannot determine their exact numerical values. However, we know that they are part of a tuple in `ops`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **(l + 1, r + 1)**, where `l` and `r` are the first and second elements of the first tuple in `ops`, respectively.
