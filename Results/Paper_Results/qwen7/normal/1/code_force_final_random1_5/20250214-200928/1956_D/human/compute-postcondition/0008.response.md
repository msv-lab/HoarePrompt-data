Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over tuples `(l, r)` from the list `ops`.
   - The variables in the loop head are `l` and `r`.

2. **Understand the Conditions for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute again, there must be at least one tuple `(l, r)` in `ops`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `l` is the first element of the first tuple in `ops`, and `r` is the second element of the first tuple in `ops`.

3. **Determine the State Adjustments:**
   - Since the loop continues as long as there are tuples in `ops`, we need to ensure that `ops` still contains at least one tuple.
   - After processing the first tuple, `ops` will be modified (e.g., the first tuple might be removed or updated).

Given these points, let's adjust the states:

- `n` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
- `a` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
- `s`, `m`, and `ops` are the results of the function `func_2(a)`, and since the loop continues as long as `ops` contains at least one tuple, `ops` must still contain at least one tuple.

At the end of the previous iteration, `l` is the first element of the first tuple in `ops`, and `r` is the second element of the first tuple in `ops`. For the loop to continue, `ops` must still contain at least one tuple. Therefore, `l` and `r` will be updated to the first elements of the next tuple in `ops`.

**State:**
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies \(0 \leq a_i \leq 10^7\).
- `s`, `m`, and `ops` are the results of the function `func_2(a)`, and `ops` must contain at least one tuple `(l, r)`.
- `l` is the first element of the second tuple in `ops`.
- `r` is the second element of the second tuple in `ops`.

So, the final state is:
State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies \(0 \leq a_i \leq 10^7\), `s`, `m`, and `ops` are the results of the function `func_2(a)`, `ops` must contain at least one tuple `(l, r)`, `l` is the first element of the second tuple in `ops`, and `r` is the second element of the second tuple in `ops`**.
