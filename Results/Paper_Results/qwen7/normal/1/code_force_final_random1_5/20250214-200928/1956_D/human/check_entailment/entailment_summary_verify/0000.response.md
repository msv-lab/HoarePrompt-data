### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to verify the original assessment.

#### Function `func_1`:
This function is responsible for setting all elements in the subarray `[l, r]` to the same value, which is the MEX of the subarray. The function works recursively by setting the element at position `l` to the MEX and then calling itself on the subarray `[l+1, r]`.

#### Function `func_2`:
This function is supposed to maximize the sum of the array using the allowed operations. It initializes an empty list `ops` to store the operations and calls `recursive_maximize_sum(0, n-1)` to start the process. However, there are a few issues:
1. The function returns the sum of the array, the number of operations, and the operations themselves, but it doesn't actually perform the operations.
2. The `recursive_maximize_sum` function is defined but not called in `func_2`.

#### Function `recursive_maximize_sum`:
This function attempts to maximize the sum of the subarray `[l, r]`. It checks if the sum of the subarray is less than or equal to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`. If true, it calls `func_1` to set all elements in the subarray to the MEX. Otherwise, it finds the maximum element in the subarray and recursively calls itself on the subarrays before and after the position of the maximum element.

#### Function `func_3`:
This function reads the input, calls `func_2` to get the sum, the number of operations, and the operations themselves, and then prints the results. However, the function `func_2` does not actually perform the operations; it only returns the necessary values.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Function `func_2`**: It does not call `recursive_maximize_sum`, which is supposed to perform the actual operations.
2. **Function `func_3`**: It assumes that `func_2` performs the operations, but it does not. Instead, it only returns the sum, the number of operations, and the operations themselves without executing them.

### Correctness Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate because the program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the array elements using the allowed operations. The `func_2` function does not call `recursive_maximize_sum`, which is crucial for performing the operations. Additionally, the `func_3` function assumes that `func_2` performs the operations, which it does not.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not perform the necessary operations to maximize the sum of the array elements as described in the problem statement.
