Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires maximizing the sum of an array by performing operations that set a subarray to the MEX (Minimum EXcluded) value of that subarray. The operations can be performed up to \(5 \times 10^5\) times.
2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: This function ensures that a subarray from `l` to `r` is set to the value `r - l + 1` if necessary. It recursively processes the subarray to ensure the condition is met.
   - **func_2**: This function calls `recursive_maximize_sum` to process the entire array and returns the sum of the array, the number of operations, and the operations themselves.
   - **recursive_maximize_sum**: This function recursively processes subarrays to maximize their sums by setting them to the value `r - l + 1` if the current sum is less than or equal to \((r - l + 1)^2\).
   - **func_3**: This function reads the input, calls `func_2`, and prints the result along with the operations.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - **func_1**: Ensures that a subarray is set to the correct value if needed.
   - **func_2**: Calls `recursive_maximize_sum` correctly and returns the expected values.
   - **recursive_maximize_sum**: Correctly processes subarrays to maximize their sums.
   - **func_3**: Reads input, calls the correct function, and prints the results in the required format.

Given the detailed analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Each function performs its intended operation, and the overall structure ensures that the solution meets the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
