Output State: **`s` is the sum of elements in list `a` from index `l` to index `r` inclusive, and `s` is greater than `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`, `pos` is the position of `mx` in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]` plus `l`, and `pos` is not equal to `l`; `pos` is decremented by 1, and the function `recursive_maximize_sum` is called with arguments `l` and `pos - 1`.**

This means that the value of `pos` has been decremented by 1, and the function `recursive_maximize_sum` has been called with the updated `pos` value. All other variables retain their initial values.
