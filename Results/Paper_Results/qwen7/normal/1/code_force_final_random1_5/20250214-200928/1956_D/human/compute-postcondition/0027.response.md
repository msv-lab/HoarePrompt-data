Postcondition: `s` is the sum of elements in list `a` from index `l` to index `r` inclusive, `i` is equal to `r + 1`, `l` is the same as the original value, `r` is the same as the original value, and every element in the list `a` from index `l` to index `r` is set to `r - l + 1` if `s` is less than or equal to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`. If `s` is greater than `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, `s` remains unchanged, `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`, `pos` is the position of `mx` in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]` plus `l`, and if `pos` is not equal to `r`, `pos` is decremented by 1 and the function `recursive_maximize_sum` is called with arguments `pos + 1` and `r`. If `pos` is equal to `r`, no further changes are made to `pos`.
