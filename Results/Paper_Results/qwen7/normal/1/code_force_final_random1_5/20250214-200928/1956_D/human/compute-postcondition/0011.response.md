Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies \(0 \leq a_i \leq 10^7\).
- `s`, `m`, and `ops` are the results of the function `func_2(a)`.
- `ops` must contain at least one tuple `(l, r)`, where `l` is the first element of the third tuple in `ops`, and `r` is the second element of the third tuple in `ops`.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(l + 1, r + 1)
```

Given the precondition, we know that `ops` contains at least one tuple `(l, r)`, and specifically, we need to focus on the third tuple in `ops`. Since the exact values of `l` and `r` are not provided, we can only describe them in terms of their positions in the `ops` list.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **(l + 1, r + 1)**, where `l` is the first element of the third tuple in `ops`, and `r` is the second element of the third tuple in `ops`.
