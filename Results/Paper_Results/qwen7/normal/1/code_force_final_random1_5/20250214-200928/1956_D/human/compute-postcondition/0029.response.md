Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, l and r, where l is a list of non-negative integers of length n (1 <= n <= 18) and each element in the list is between 0 and 10^7 inclusive. The function returns the maximum possible sum after performing a series of operations specified in the ops list.**

This means the function takes a list of numbers and a list of operations, and it aims to maximize the sum of the list through these operations, returning the highest achievable sum.
