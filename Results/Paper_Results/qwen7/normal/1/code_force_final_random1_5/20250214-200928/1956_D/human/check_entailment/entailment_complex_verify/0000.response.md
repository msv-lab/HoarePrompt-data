### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the logic to maximize the sum of the array elements using the allowed operations.

#### Function `func_1`:
- This function is responsible for setting all elements in the range `[l, r]` to the value `r - l + 1` if they are not already set to this value.
- The function is called recursively to process the entire array.

#### Function `func_2`:
- This function calls `recursive_maximize_sum(0, n - 1)` to start the process from the beginning of the array.
- It returns the sum of the array, the number of operations, and the list of operations.

#### Function `recursive_maximize_sum`:
- This function aims to maximize the sum of the subarray from `l` to `r`.
- If the sum of the subarray is less than or equal to \((r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)\), it sets all elements in the subarray to \(r - l + 1\).
- Otherwise, it finds the maximum element in the subarray, updates the subarray to ensure the sum is maximized by recursively calling itself on the left and right parts of the subarray excluding the position of the maximum element.

#### Function `func_3`:
- This function reads the input, calls `func_2` to get the sum, number of operations, and operations list, and then prints the sum and the operations.

#### Analysis of the Logic:
1. **Base Case in `func_1`:**
   - If `l == r` and `a[l] != 0`, it sets `a[l]` to 0 and records the operation.
   - This ensures that all elements in the array are eventually set to 0 if they are not part of the optimal subarray.

2. **Recursive Call in `func_1`:**
   - The function calls itself with `l + 1` to process the next element.
   - If the current element `a[l]` is not equal to `r - l + 1`, it sets all elements in the range `[l, r]` to `r - l + 1` and records the operation.
   - This ensures that the subarray is set to its maximum possible value.

3. **Condition in `recursive_maximize_sum`:**
   - The condition `if s <= (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)` checks if the sum of the subarray is less than or equal to the maximum possible sum of the subarray.
   - If true, it sets all elements in the subarray to `r - l + 1` and records the operation.
   - If false, it finds the maximum element and updates the subarray to ensure the sum is maximized by recursively calling itself on the left and right parts of the subarray.

4. **Operations Recording:**
   - The operations are recorded in the `ops` list, which is returned by `func_2`.

#### Correctness of the Program:
- The program correctly identifies the subarrays that need to be set to their maximum possible values.
- It ensures that the sum of the array is maximized by setting the appropriate subarrays to their maximum values.
- The operations are recorded and printed correctly.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to maximize the sum of the array elements using the allowed operations.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
