The function processes a list of non-negative integers `a` by performing operations on its sublists defined by indices `l` and `r`. If `l` equals `r` and `a[l]` is not zero, it sets `a[l]` to zero and records the operation. Otherwise, it recursively ensures that all elements from `l` to `r` are set to `r - l + 1`, records the operation, and continues processing the sublist starting from `l + 1` to `r`. No value is returned.
