Output State: The loop will continue to execute until there are no more tuples in `ops`. After all iterations of the loop have finished, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies \(0 \leq a_i \leq 10^7\), `s`, `m`, and `ops` are the results of the function `func_2(a)`, and `ops` is an empty list since all tuples have been processed. The loop variable `l` and `r` will hold the last values from the last tuple in `ops` if it exists, but since `ops` is empty, these variables will not have meaningful values outside the context of the loop.

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `n` remains the same input integer, `a` remains the same list of integers, and `s`, `m`, and `ops` are the final results of the function `func_2(a)`. Importantly, `ops` will be an empty list because all operations have been performed, and `l` and `r` will be undefined or irrelevant outside the loop context.
