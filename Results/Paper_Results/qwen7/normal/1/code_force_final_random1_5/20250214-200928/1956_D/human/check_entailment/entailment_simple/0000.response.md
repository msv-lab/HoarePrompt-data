Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_3`**:
   - Reads the input `n` and the array `a` from standard input.
   - Calls `func_2` to get the maximum sum `s`, the number of operations `m`, and the list of operations `ops`.
   - Prints the maximum sum `s` and the number of operations `m`.
   - Iterates over the list of operations `ops` and prints each operation.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - Computes the length `n` of the array `a`.
   - Initializes an empty list `ops` to store the operations.
   - Calls the recursive function `recursive_maximize_sum(0, n - 1)` to maximize the sum of the array.
   - Returns the sum of the array `a`, the number of operations `m`, and the list of operations `ops`.

3. **Function `recursive_maximize_sum`**:
   - Takes the left and right indices `l` and `r` of the current subarray.
   - Computes the sum `s` of the subarray.
   - If the sum `s` is less than or equal to \((r - l + 1)^2\), it calls `func_1` to set all elements in the subarray to \(r - l + 1\) and appends the operation to `ops`.
   - Otherwise, it finds the maximum value `mx` in the subarray and its position `pos`.
   - Recursively calls `recursive_maximize_sum` for the left and right subarrays based on the position `pos`.

4. **Function `func_1`**:
   - If `l` equals `r`, it checks if `a[l]` is not zero and sets it to zero if true.
   - Otherwise, it recursively processes the subarray and, if necessary, sets all elements in the subarray to \(r - l + 1\) and appends the operation to `ops`.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the functions, the program correctly maximizes the sum of the array by setting segments of the array to the smallest non-negative integer not present in the segment, ensuring the sum is maximized within the allowed operations limit.

Correctness: **True**
