Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `i` is 1, `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `n` is the first element of the list `feat`, `f` is the second element of the list `feat`, `a` is the third element of the list `feat`, `b` is the last element of the list `feat`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `array2` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `array2`. This does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the values of `test_cases`, `i`, `feat`, `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, and `arr` remain unchanged.
