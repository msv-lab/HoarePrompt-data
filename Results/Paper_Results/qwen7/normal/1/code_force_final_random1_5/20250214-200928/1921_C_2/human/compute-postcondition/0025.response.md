Based on the initial state provided:

- `test_cases` is a number greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\).
- `i` is equal to `n`.
- `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, with specific elements defined as follows:
  - `f` is the second element of `feat`.
  - `a` is the third element of `feat`.
  - `b` is the last element of `feat`.
- `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces.
- `array2` is a list containing elements where each element is \((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a\) for every `i` in the range from 2 to `n`, and the condition \(arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a\) must hold true for each of these elements.
- The sum of `array2` plus \((n - len(array2)) * b\) is less than `f`.

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('Yes')
```

Given the above conditions, the print statement will output the string `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
