Postcondition: **Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `arr` remains unchanged as an array of integers, `array2` contains all the elements `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` for every index `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1` (inclusive) where the condition `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a` is satisfied. The sum of elements in `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is less than `f`.**
