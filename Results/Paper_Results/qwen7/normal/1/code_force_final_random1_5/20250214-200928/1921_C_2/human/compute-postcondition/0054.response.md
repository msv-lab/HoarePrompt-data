Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `n-1`
- `n` is `feat[0]`
- `array2` contains elements \((arr[i+1] - arr[i]) * a\) for each `i` where `arr[i+1] - arr[i] < b / a` starting from `i = 1` up to `i = n-1`

The print statement is simply `print('Yes')`.

Given this, the output will be a string "Yes".

Output: **Yes**
