Output State: All the elements in `array2` will be determined based on the conditions specified within the loop for each iteration. Specifically, for each index `i` from 0 to `n-1`, if `i == 0`, `array2` will append `arr[0] * a` if `arr[0] < b / a`. For other indices, `array2` will append `(arr[i] - arr[i-1]) * a` if the difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[i-1]` is less than `b / a`. Otherwise, no new elements are appended to `array2` for that iteration. After all iterations, the final sum of `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` will be compared with `f`. If this sum is less than `f`, the output will be 'Yes'. Otherwise, the output will be 'No'.

The value of `i` will be `n-1` after all iterations, indicating that the loop has processed all elements in `arr`.
