Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue if `i` is less than `n`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` is 1

Given these conditions, we need to check if the loop can continue based on the values of `i` and `n`.

4. **Check the loop condition**: 
   - The loop condition is `i < n`.
   - Currently, `i` is 2 and `n` is 1.
   - Since `2` is not less than `1`, the loop will not execute again.

Since the loop does not satisfy the condition `i < n`, it will not execute again. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute one more time because the loop will not run.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 2, `n` is 1** (No changes needed as the loop will not execute again).
