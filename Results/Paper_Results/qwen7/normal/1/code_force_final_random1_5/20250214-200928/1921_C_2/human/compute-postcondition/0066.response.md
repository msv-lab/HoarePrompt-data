Output State: **`feat` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is `feat[1]`, `n` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `array2` is empty, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code creates a new list `arr` by splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer. This operation does not affect the values of `feat`, `i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, or `array2`. Therefore, their values remain unchanged, and `arr` is initialized as a new list based on the input.
