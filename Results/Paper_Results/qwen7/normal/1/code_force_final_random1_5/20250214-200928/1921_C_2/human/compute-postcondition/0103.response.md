Output State: **`i` is `feat[0]`, `test_cases` is `tc`, `n` is `feat[0]`, `array2` contains elements based on the specified conditions, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`**.

The code `a = feat[2]` assigns the value of `feat[2]` to the variable `a`. No other changes are made to the variables in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `i`, `test_cases`, `n`, `array2`, and `f` remain unchanged.
