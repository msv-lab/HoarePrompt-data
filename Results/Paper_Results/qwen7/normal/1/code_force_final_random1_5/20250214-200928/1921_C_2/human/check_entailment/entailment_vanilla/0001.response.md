### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates through each test case using a while loop.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b` and initializes the list `ls` with an extra 0 at the beginning.

2. **Charge Calculation**:
   - The function calculates the charge required to send each message and updates the remaining charge accordingly.
   - For each message, it checks whether it is more efficient to send the message directly or to turn off and on the phone to save charge.
   - Specifically, it uses `min(a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1]), b)` to decide whether to send the message directly or to turn off and on the phone. This logic ensures that the phone does not run out of charge before sending the next message.

3. **Final Charge Check**:
   - After processing all messages, it checks if the remaining charge `f` is greater than 0.
   - If the charge is still positive, it prints "YES".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO".

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where the phone might run out of charge before sending all messages.
   - It also handles the case where turning off and on the phone can save charge, ensuring the phone stays operational until all messages are sent.

Given the above analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.
