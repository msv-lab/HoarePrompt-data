Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variable and its initial state:**
   - The loop variable is `i`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n-1`.

2. **Determine the condition for the next iteration:**
   - The loop runs for `test_cases` iterations.
   - For the next iteration to occur, `i` must be less than `test_cases`.

3. **Adjust the state of `i`:**
   - Since `i` was `n-1` at the end of the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it `n`.

4. **Adjust the state of `n`:**
   - `n` remains unchanged because the loop itself does not modify `n`.

5. **Adjust the state of `array2`:**
   - The state of `array2` depends on the values of `arr`, `a`, `b`, and `f`.
   - We need to ensure that the conditions for generating `array2` are met for the new value of `i`.

Given these steps, let's formulate the new state:

- `i` will be incremented to `n`.
- `n` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
- The state of `array2` needs to be recalculated based on the new value of `i`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is `feat[0]`, and `array2` contains elements `(arr[i+1] - arr[i]) * a` for each `i` where `arr[i+1] - arr[i] < b / a` starting from `i = 1` up to `i = n-1`. Additionally, if the sum of `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is less than `f`, then the sum remains as calculated. Otherwise, `array2` includes elements `(arr[i+1] - arr[i]) * a` for each `i` where `arr[i+1] - arr[i] >= b / a` starting from `i = 1` up to `i = n-1`.**
