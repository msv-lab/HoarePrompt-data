Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `n-1`
- `n` is `feat[0]`
- `array2` contains elements `(arr[i+1] - arr[i]) * a` for each `i` where `arr[i+1] - arr[i] >= b / a` starting from `i = 1` up to `i = n-1`.

The print statement is simply `print('No')`.

Since the print statement directly outputs the string `'No'`, and there are no variables or expressions evaluated within it, the output will be exactly as written.

Output: **No**
