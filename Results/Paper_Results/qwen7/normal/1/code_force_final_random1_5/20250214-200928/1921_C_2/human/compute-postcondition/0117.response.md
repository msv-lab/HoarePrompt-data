Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers. If the difference between the first element of `arr` and the element just before the first element (considered as 0) is less than `b/a`, then `array2` is a list containing one element which is `(arr[0] - 0) * a`. Otherwise, `array2` remains unchanged.
