Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `ind` and `line`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each index `ind` from `0` to `len(line) - 1`.

3. **Determine the State After Each Iteration**:
   - `ind` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `ind < len(line)`.

4. **Postcondition Analysis**:
   - `ind` is set to the index of the last character of `line`.
   - `elements[line[ind]]` is assigned the tuple `(i, ind)`.
   - If `line[ind]` is a player (`isPlayer(line[ind])` is true), then `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to `True`.
   - If `line[ind][1]` is 'G', then `tmp` is set to 0 and `goal[tmp]` is appended with the tuple `(i, ind)`.
   - No additional changes occur if `line[ind][1]` is not 'G'.

5. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since the loop is about to enter the next iteration, `ind` will be incremented by 1.
   - The postcondition ensures that `ind` will be the index of the last character of `line` after the loop completes. However, for the next iteration, `ind` should be one less than the current last index.
   - `line[ind]` will be the next character in the string `line`.

Given these points, let's formulate the state at the start of the next iteration:

- `ind` will be incremented by 1 from its current value.
- The new value of `ind` will be the index of the next character in `line`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`ind` is now equal to the index of the next character in `line`, and `elements[line[ind]]` is assigned the tuple `(i, ind)`. If `line[ind]` is a player (i.e., `isPlayer(line[ind])` is true), then `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to `True`. Otherwise, if `line[ind][1]` is 'G', then `tmp` is set to 0 and `goal[tmp]` is appended with the tuple `(i, ind)`. If `line[ind][1]` is not 'G', no additional changes occur.**

However, since we are only adjusting the state for the start of the next iteration, we focus on the updated `ind` value:

State: **`ind` is now equal to the index of the next character in `line`**.
