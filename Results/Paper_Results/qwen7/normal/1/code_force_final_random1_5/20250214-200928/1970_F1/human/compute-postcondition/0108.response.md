Postcondition: `line` is a string, `ind` is an index within the string `line`. After executing the if-else block, `elements[line[ind]]` is either `False` (if `isPlayer(line[ind])` is true) or not `i, ind` (if `isPlayer(line[ind])` is false). If `line[ind][1]` is 'G' and `isPlayer(line[ind])` is false, then `tmp` is 0 and `goal[tmp]` is a list containing `(i, ind)`. Otherwise, `tmp` and `goal` remain unchanged.
