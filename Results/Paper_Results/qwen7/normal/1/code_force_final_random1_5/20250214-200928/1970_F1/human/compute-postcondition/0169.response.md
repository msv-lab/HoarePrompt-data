Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **`team`**: The value of `team` is the result of `goalIn(pos)`. Since `goalIn(pos)` is not `-1`, it means `team` is a valid team identifier (an integer).

2. **`time`**: The value of `time` is `0`.

3. **`command`**: This is a list of strings read from standard input and stripped. We don't know the exact content of this list, but we do know that `obj` and `com` are derived from it.

4. **`obj`**: The value of `obj` is the first element of `command`.

5. **`com`**: The value of `com` is the second element of `command`.

6. **`pos`**: The value of `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`. This means `pos` is a tuple representing a position (likely coordinates).

7. **`nxt`**: The value of `nxt` is a tuple with the value `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`. This represents the next position based on the movement direction specified by `mov[com]`.

8. **`allPlayers[obj]`**: The value of `allPlayers[obj]` is `False`, meaning the player at position `pos` is not a player (possibly an obstacle or something else).

9. **`GoalName[team]`**: This is the name of the team corresponding to `team`.

Given these details, the print statement is:
```python
print('%d %s GOAL' % (time, GoalName[team]))
```

- `time` is `0`.
- `GoalName[team]` is the name of the team corresponding to `team`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **0 [GoalName[team]] GOAL** (where [GoalName[team]] is the name of the team corresponding to `team`).
