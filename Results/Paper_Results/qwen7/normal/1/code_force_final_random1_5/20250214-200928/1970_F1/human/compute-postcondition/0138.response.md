Output State: **`t` must be an integer greater than 0, `time` is 0, `command` is a list of strings read from standard input and stripped.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of input from the standard input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and splits the line into a list of strings. These strings are assigned to the variable `command`. The values of `t` and `time` remain unchanged from their initial state.
