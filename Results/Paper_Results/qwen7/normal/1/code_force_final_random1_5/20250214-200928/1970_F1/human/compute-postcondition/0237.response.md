Output State: **`team` is the result of `goalIn(pos)`, `t` is an integer greater than 3, `time` is 3, `command` is a list of strings read from standard input and stripped, `obj` is the value of `elements[obj]`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `nxt` is a tuple with the value `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`, `allPlayers[obj]` is `False`**.

The code assigns the result of the function `goalIn(pos)` to the variable `team`. All other variables retain their initial values or states as described in the initial state.
