Postcondition: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `time` is 2, `command` is a list of strings read from standard input and stripped. If `el` equals '.Q', then `allPlayers[obj]` is set to True. Otherwise, `obj` is an element from the `command` list, `com` is an element from the `command` list, `el` is an element from the `command` list, `team` is 1 if the first character of `obj` is 'B', else `team` is 0; `points[team]` is increased by 10.
