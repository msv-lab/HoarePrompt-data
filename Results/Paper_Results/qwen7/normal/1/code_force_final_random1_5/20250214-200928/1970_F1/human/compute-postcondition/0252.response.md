Postcondition: `t` is an integer greater than 3, `time` is 3, `command` is a list of strings read from standard input and stripped, `comand` is equal to the list of strings read from standard input and stripped, `obj` is the first element of the `command` list, `com` is the second element of the `command` list, `el` is the third element of the `command` list, `team` is either 0 or 1, `points[team]` is incremented by 10 if `el` is equal to '.Q' and `obj` is valid, otherwise `obj` is the value of `nxt`, `nxt` is a tuple with the value `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`, and if the player is identified and `goalIn(pos)` is not `-1`, then `points[team]` is incremented by 1. If the player is not identified, the values remain unchanged.
