Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n and m, which are integers such that 3 ≤ n, m ≤ 99 and both are odd. It also accepts a grid (a 2D list of strings), allPlayers (a dictionary), goal (a list of two lists), points (a list of two integers), mov (a dictionary), and elements (a dictionary). The function does not return anything explicitly.**

This means the function `func_1` takes several parameters related to a game field setup, including the dimensions of the field, the current state of players and entities, goal positions, scores, movement commands, and entity positions. However, since no return value is mentioned, the function likely performs some operations or updates based on these inputs without returning any specific output.
