Postcondition: `t` is an integer greater than 3, `time` is 3, `command` is a list of strings read from standard input and stripped, `obj` is either the value of `nxt` or the value of `elements[obj]` depending on whether the player is identified or not, `com` is the second element of `command`, `nxt` is a tuple with the value `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`. If the player is identified (`isPlayer(obj)` evaluates to True) and `goalIn(pos)` is not `-1`, then `points[team]` is incremented by 1. If the player is not identified, the values remain unchanged.
