Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 3, `time` is 3, `command` is a list of strings read from standard input and stripped, `obj` is the value of `nxt`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `nxt` is a tuple with the value `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`.**

Explanation: The code `elements[obj] = nxt` updates the value of `elements[obj]` to be equal to `nxt`. Since `obj` was previously either the value of `nxt` or the value of `elements[obj]` depending on whether the player is identified or not, after this assignment, `obj` now holds the value of `nxt`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
