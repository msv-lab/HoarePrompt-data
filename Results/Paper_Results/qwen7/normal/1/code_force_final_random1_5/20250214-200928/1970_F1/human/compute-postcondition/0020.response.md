Output State: **`ind` is 1, `tmp` is 1, `goal[tmp]` contains the tuple `(i, ind)`, `elements[line[ind]]` is assigned `i`, `len(line)` remains the same, the current value of `line[ind]` is 'G', and `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns False.**

Explanation: The line `goal[tmp].append((i, ind))` appends the tuple `(i, ind)` to the list `goal[tmp]`. Since `tmp` is 1, this tuple is added to `goal[1]`. The other variables and their states remain unchanged.
