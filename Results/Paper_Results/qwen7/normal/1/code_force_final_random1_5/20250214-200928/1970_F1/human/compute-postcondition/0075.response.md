Output State: **`elements` is updated such that the element at the index `line[ind]` is set to `(i, ind)`, `ind` is incremented by 1, `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1; `goal[0]` or `goal[1]` (depending on the value of `tmp`) has the additional element `(i, ind)` appended to it.**

This means that the `elements` list at the specified index has been updated to contain the tuple `(i, ind)`. The variable `ind` has been incremented by 1. The variable `tmp` is now either 0 or 1 depending on whether `line[ind][0]` is 'B' or not. Finally, the `goal` list at index `tmp` has had the tuple `(i, ind)` appended to it.
