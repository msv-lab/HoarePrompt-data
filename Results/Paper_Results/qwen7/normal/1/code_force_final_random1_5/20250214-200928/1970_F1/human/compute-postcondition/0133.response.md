Output State: **Postcondition: `line` is a string, `ind` is an index that is equal to the length of `line`, `elements` contains key-value pairs for each non-'. '..' entry in `line` where the key is the character from `line` and the value is a tuple `(i, ind)`. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` is True, then `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to `False`. Otherwise, `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is 'B', else 1, and `goal[tmp]` now includes all tuples `(i, ind)` for non-'. '..' entries in `line`.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `ind` will be equal to the length of `line` because the loop increments `ind` in each iteration until it reaches the end of `line`. For every non-'. '..' character in `line`, `elements` will contain the key-value pair with the character as the key and the tuple `(i, ind)` as the value. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` is true for any character, `allPlayers[line[ind]]` will be set to `False`. The variable `tmp` will be 0 if the character is 'B' or 1 if the character is 'G', and `goal[tmp]` will contain all tuples `(i, ind)` for non-'. '..' characters in `line` that are not players.
