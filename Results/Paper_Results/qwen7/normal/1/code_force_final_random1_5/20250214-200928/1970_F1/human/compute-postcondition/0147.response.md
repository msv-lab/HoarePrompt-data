Output State: **`team` is 0; `time` is 0; `obj`, `com`, and `el` are the first, second, and third elements of the `command` list respectively; `points[team]` is 10.**

Explanation: The code `points[team] += 10` increments the value of `points[team]` by 10. Given that `team` is initially 0, `points[0]` is updated to 10. All other variables remain unchanged.
