Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `ind` and `line`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop iterates over each index of `line` from `0` to `len(line) - 1`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ind` is the index of the next character in `line`.
   - `elements` is updated such that the element at the index `line[ind]` is set to `(i, ind)`.
   - `ind` is incremented by 1.
   - If `isPlayer(line[ind])` is true, then `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to `False`.
   - Otherwise, `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1; `goal[0]` or `goal[1]` (depending on the value of `tmp`) has the additional element `(i, ind)` appended to it.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `ind` by 1 at the end of each iteration, the new value of `ind` will be the current value of `ind` plus 1.
   - The variable `line` remains unchanged within the loop.
   - The other variables (`elements`, `allPlayers`, `tmp`, `goal`) are updated based on the current value of `ind`, but these updates are not relevant for determining the next loop iteration.

Given this information, the only variables that need to be adjusted for the next iteration are `ind` and `line`.

5. **State at the start of the next iteration**:
   - `ind` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value.
   - `line` remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`ind` is now equal to the index of the next character in `line` (which is `ind + 1`), `line` is the same as before**.
