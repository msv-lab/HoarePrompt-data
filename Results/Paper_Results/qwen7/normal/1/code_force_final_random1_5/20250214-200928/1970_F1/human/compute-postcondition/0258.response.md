Functionality: **The function processes a game field represented by a 2D grid and updates the state based on player movements and interactions. It reads initial field dimensions and configuration from standard input, then processes a series of commands over multiple time steps. During each command, it updates player positions, checks for golden snitch catches, eliminations, and goal scoring. Finally, it prints the final score for both teams.**
