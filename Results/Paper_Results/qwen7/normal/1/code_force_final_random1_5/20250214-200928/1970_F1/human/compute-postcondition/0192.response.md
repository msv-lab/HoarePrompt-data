Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `time` is 2, `command` is a list of strings read from standard input and stripped, `obj` is an element from the `command` list, `com` is an element from the `command` list, `el` is an element from the `command` list, `team` is 1 if the first character of `obj` is 'B', else `team` is 0; `points[team]` is increased by 10.**

In this case, the code `points[team] += 10` increments the value of `points[team]` by 10. Since the initial value of `team` is determined by whether the first character of `obj` is 'B' (either 0 or 1), `points[team]` is increased by 10 for the corresponding team. All other variables remain unchanged.
