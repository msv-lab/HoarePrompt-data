Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable is `i`.
   - The loop condition is `range(n)`, which means `i` will iterate from `0` to `n-1`.

2. **Understand the Current State:**
   - `ind` is the index of the last character of `line`.
   - `elements` contains key-value pairs for each non-'. '..' entry in `line`, where each key is an entry in `line` and the value is a tuple `(i, ind)`.
   - If `isPlayer(line[ind])` is true, then `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to `False`.
   - For any entry in `line` that is a goal identifier (i.e., starts with 'G'), `goal[tmp]` (where `tmp` is 0 if the first character is 'B', otherwise 1) will contain a list of tuples `(i, ind)`.

3. **Determine the Next State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have been incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be the current value of `i` plus 1.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since the loop condition is based on `i` and `n`, we need to ensure that `i` is within the range `[0, n)`.
   - `ind`, `elements`, `allPlayers`, and `goal` should remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by the loop variable `i`.

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`ind` is the index of the last character of `line`, `elements` contains key-value pairs for each non-'. '..' entry in `line`, where each key is an entry in `line` and the value is a tuple `(i, ind)`. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` is true, then `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to `False`. For any entry in `line` that is a goal identifier (i.e., starts with 'G'), `goal[tmp]` (where `tmp` is 0 if the first character is 'B', otherwise 1) will contain a list of tuples `(i, ind)`. At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1 and will be `i + 1` if it was `i` in the previous iteration.**
