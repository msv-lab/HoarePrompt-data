Output State: **`line` is a string, `ind` is an index that is 1 more than the previous value, `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is 'B', else `tmp` is 1, `elements[line[ind]]` is now `i, ind`, `goal[tmp]` has the additional element `(i, ind)` appended to it.**

This means that the `goal` list at the index specified by `tmp` (which is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is 'B', otherwise 1) now includes an additional tuple `(i, ind)` appended to it. All other variables remain in their previously described states.
