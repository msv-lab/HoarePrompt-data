Postcondition: `ind` is 2, `len(line)` remains the same, `line[ind]` is not `'..'`, `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `False`, and `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is `False`; if `line[ind][1]` is 'G', then `tmp` is 0 and `goal[tmp]` contains the tuple `(i, ind)`, otherwise the state of the variables remains unchanged.
