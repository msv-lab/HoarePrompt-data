Output State: **`elements[line[ind-1]]` is now equal to `i`, `ind` is equal to 2, `tmp` is 0 if `line[1][0]` is 'B', else 1.**

Explanation: The initial state had `elements[line[ind]]` equal to `i`, and `ind` was increased by 1. This means `ind` is now `ind + 1`. The code then assigns `tmp` based on whether the first character of `line[ind]` (which is now `line[ind-1]` due to the increment) is 'B' or not. If it is 'B', `tmp` is assigned 0; otherwise, `tmp` is assigned 1.
