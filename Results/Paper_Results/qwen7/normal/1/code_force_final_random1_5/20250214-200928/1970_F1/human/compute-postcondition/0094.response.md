Output State: **`line` is split from the input string, `ind` is the index of the last character of the new `line`, `elements` contains key-value pairs for each non-'. '..' entry in `line`, where each key is an entry in `line` and the value is a tuple `(i, ind)`, `allPlayers` and `goal` remain unchanged, and `i` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and splits it into a list of strings based on spaces. This affects the variable `line`. The variable `ind` is updated to be the index of the last character of the new `line`. The variable `elements` is updated to contain key-value pairs for each non-'. '..' entry in the new `line`, where each key is an entry in `line` and the value is a tuple `(i, ind)`. The variables `allPlayers`, `goal`, and `i` remain unchanged from their previous states, with `i` being incremented by 1.
