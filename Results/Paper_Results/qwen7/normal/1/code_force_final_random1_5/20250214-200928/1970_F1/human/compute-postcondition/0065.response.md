Postcondition: `ind` is now `line[ind]`, `elements[line[ind]]` is assigned the tuple `(i, ind)`, the player condition `(isPlayer(line[ind]))` is false, and if the current value of `line[ind][1]` is 'G', then `tmp` is 0 and `goal[tmp]` is appended with the tuple `(i, ind)`. If the current value of `line[ind][1]` is not 'G', no additional changes are made.
