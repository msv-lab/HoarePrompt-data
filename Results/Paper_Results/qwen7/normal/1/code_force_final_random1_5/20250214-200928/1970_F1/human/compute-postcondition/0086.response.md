Output State: **`elements[line[ind-1]]` is now equal to `i`, `ind` is equal to 2, `tmp` is 0 if `line[1][0]` is 'B', else 1, `goal[tmp]` contains the tuple `(i, ind)`**.

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(i, ind)` to the list `goal[tmp]`. Given the initial conditions, `tmp` is determined by whether `line[1][0]` is 'B' or not. Once `tmp` is known, the tuple `(i, ind)` is appended to `goal[tmp]`. The values of `elements[line[ind-1]]`, `ind`, and `tmp` remain unchanged from their initial states.
