Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer between 3 and 99, `m` is an integer between 3 and 99, both are odd; `grid` is an empty list; `allPlayers` is an empty dictionary; `goal` is now `[[], []]`; `points` is now `[0, 0]`; `mov` is a dictionary mapping movement commands ('U', 'D', 'L', 'R') to their corresponding changes in position coordinates; `elements` is a dictionary mapping entity identifiers to their positions on the field with the entry '.B': (-1, -1)
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    line = stdin.readline().strip().split()
    grid.append(line)
    for ind in range(len(line)):
        if line[ind] != '..':
            elements[line[ind]] = i, ind
            if isPlayer(line[ind]):
                allPlayers[line[ind]] = False
            elif line[ind][1] == 'G':
                tmp = 0 if line[ind][0] == 'B' else 1
                goal[tmp].append((i, ind))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After the loop executes all its iterations, `ind` will be equal to the length of `line` minus one, `elements` will contain key-value pairs for each non-'. '..' entry in `line`, `allPlayers` will be populated with keys for any player identifiers found in `line` set to `False`, and `goal` will contain tuples for any goal identifiers found in `line`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `ind` is now equal to the index of the last character of `line`, `elements` contains key-value pairs for each non-'. '..' entry in `line`, where each key is an entry in `line` and the value is a tuple `(i, ind)`. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` is true, then `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to `False`. For any entry in `line` that is a goal identifier (i.e., starts with 'G'), `goal[tmp]` (where `tmp` is 0 if the first character is 'B', otherwise 1) will contain a list of tuples `(i, ind)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `line` is a string, `ind` is an index that is equal to the length of `line`, `elements` contains key-value pairs for each non-'. '..' entry in `line` where the key is the character from `line` and the value is a tuple `(i, ind)`. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` is True, then `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to `False`. Otherwise, `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is 'B', else 1, and `goal[tmp]` now includes all tuples `(i, ind)` for non-'. '..' entries in `line`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
