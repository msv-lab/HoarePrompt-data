### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the annotated code to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Key Points to Verify:
1. **Handling of Player Throwing Quaffle into Own Goal:**
   - The original assessment claims that the program does not handle the scenario where a player throws the Quaffle into their own goal correctly. We need to verify if this is indeed the case.

2. **Behavior of `goalIn` Function:**
   - The `goalIn` function checks if a position is a goal and returns the team index (0 for red, 1 for blue). If the position is not a goal, it returns -1.

3. **Handling of `T` Command:**
   - When a player throws the Quaffle (`T` command), the program checks if the position of the Quaffle is a goal using `goalIn`. If it is a goal, the program prints the appropriate message and updates the score.

#### Detailed Analysis:
1. **Function `goalIn`:**
   ```python
   def goalIn(pos):
       res = 0 if pos in goal[0] else 1 if pos in goal[1] else -1
       return res
   ```
   - This function correctly identifies if a position is a goal for the red or blue team.

2. **Handling `T` Command in `func_1`:**
   ```python
   elif com == 'T':
       allPlayers[obj] = False
       if goalIn(pos) != -1:
           team = goalIn(pos)
           print('%d %s GOAL' % (time, GoalName[team]))
           points[team] += 1
   ```
   - The program checks if the position of the Quaffle is a goal using `goalIn`. If it is a goal, it prints the appropriate message and updates the score.

3. **Scenario Analysis:**
   - If a player throws the Quaffle into their own goal, `goalIn` will return -1 (indicating it is not a goal) because the position is not in `goal[0]` or `goal[1]`. However, the program correctly handles this by checking `goalIn(pos) != -1` and updating the score accordingly.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly handles the scenario where a player throws the Quaffle into their own goal. The original assessment is incorrect because the program does handle this case properly.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The provided program is correct according to the problem description and the given examples.
