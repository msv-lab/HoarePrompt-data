Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `ind` will be equal to the length of the last `line` processed, `elements` will contain key-value pairs for each non-'. '..' entry in every `line` read from standard input, where each key is an entry in `line` and the value is a tuple `(i, ind)`. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` is true for any `line`, then `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to `False`. For any entry in `line` that is a goal identifier (i.e., starts with 'G'), `goal[tmp]` (where `tmp` is 0 if the first character is 'B', otherwise 1) will contain a list of tuples `(i, ind)` for all such entries across all lines.

This means that after processing all lines, the `grid` will be filled with the contents of all lines read, the `elements` dictionary will map each non-empty cell to its coordinates, the `allPlayers` dictionary will contain players found in the grid, and the `goal` list will contain the starting positions of blue or green goals based on their type.
