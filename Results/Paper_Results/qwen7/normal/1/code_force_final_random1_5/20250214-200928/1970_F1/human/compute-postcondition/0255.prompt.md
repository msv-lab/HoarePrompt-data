Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is the integer value of the first line read from standard input, and all other variables retain their initial states.
Code of the loop:
for time in range(t):
    comand = stdin.readline().strip().split()
    if len(comand) == 3:
        obj, com, el = comand
        if el == '.Q':
            allPlayers[obj] = True
        elif el == '.S':
            team = 1 if obj[0] == 'B' else 0
            points[team] += 10
            print('%d %s CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' % (time, GoalName[team]))
    else:
        obj, com = comand
        pos = elements[obj]
        nxt = pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1]
        if obj == '.B' and isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]) or isPlayer(obj
            ) and elements['.B'] == nxt:
            player = obj if isPlayer(obj) else grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]
            print('%d %s ELIMINATED' % (time, player))
        elif com == 'T':
            allPlayers[obj] = False
            if goalIn(pos) != -1:
                team = goalIn(pos)
                print('%d %s GOAL' % (time, GoalName[team]))
                points[team] += 1
        elif isPlayer(obj):
            elements[obj] = nxt
        if obj == '.B':
            elements[obj] = nxt


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `time` is 0, `command` is a list of strings read from standard input and stripped. If the length of `command` is 3, then:
- `obj`, `com`, and `el` are the first, second, and third elements of the `command` list respectively.
- If `el` is '.Q', then `allPlayers[obj]` is set to True.
- If `el` is '.S', then `team` is 0 and `points[team]` is 10.
- In all other cases, the values of `team`, `time`, `obj`, `com`, `el`, and `points[team]` remain unchanged.
Otherwise:
- `obj` is a list with the value `[.B]`.
- `com` is the second element of `command`.
- `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`.
- `nxt` is a tuple with the value `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`.
- `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `time` is 2, `command` is a list of strings read from standard input and stripped. If `len(command)` is 3 and `command[2]` is equal to '.Q', then `allPlayers[command[0]]` is set to True. Otherwise, `obj` is an element from the `command` list, `com` is an element from the `command` list, `el` is an element from the `command` list, `team` is 1 if the first character of `obj` is 'B', else `team` is 0; `points[team]` is increased by 10. If `len(command)` is not 3, then `com` is a string from the command list, `obj` is a string from the `command` list, `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`, `nxt` is a tuple with the first element being `pos[0] + mov[com][0]` and the second element being `pos[1] + mov[com][1]`, `player` is `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` returns True, otherwise `player` is `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`, `allPlayers[obj]` is `False`, and `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `t` is an integer greater than 3, `time` is 3, `command` is a list of strings read from standard input and stripped, `comand` is equal to the list of strings read from standard input and stripped, `obj` is either the first element of the `command` list or the value of `nxt`, `com` is the second element of the `command` list, `el` is either the third element of the `command` list or `None`, `nxt` is a tuple with the value `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`, `team` is either 1 if the first element of the `command` list starts with 'B' or 0, `points[team]` is incremented by 10 if `el` is equal to '.Q' or if the player is identified and `goalIn(pos)` is not `-1`, otherwise `points[team]` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
