Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 3, `time` is 3, `command` is a list of strings read from standard input and stripped, `obj` is the value of `elements[obj]`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `nxt` is a tuple with the value `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `nxt` by calculating a new position based on the current position `pos` and the movement vector `mov[com]`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
