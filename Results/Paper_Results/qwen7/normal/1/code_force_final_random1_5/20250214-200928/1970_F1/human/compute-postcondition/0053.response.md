Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head `for ind in range(len(line)):` involves the variable `ind`.

2. **Determine the initial value of `ind`**: According to the given state before the loop, `ind` is equal to the length of `line` minus one.

3. **Understand the condition for loop execution**: The loop will execute as long as `ind` is less than the length of `line`. Therefore, `ind` should start from the length of `line` minus one and decrement until it reaches zero or becomes negative.

4. **Adjust the state**: To ensure the loop can execute, `ind` must be initialized to the correct starting value and should be decremented correctly within the loop.

Given these points, we need to adjust the state such that `ind` is set to the length of `line` minus one, and the loop can proceed as expected.

**State after adjustment**:
- `ind` is equal to the length of `line` minus one.
- The loop will decrement `ind` in each iteration until it reaches zero or becomes negative.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`ind` is equal to the length of `line` minus one**.
