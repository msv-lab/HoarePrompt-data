Postcondition: `elements` is updated such that the element at the index `line[ind]` is set to `(i, ind)`, `ind` is incremented by 1. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` is true, then `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to `False`. Otherwise, `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1; `goal[0]` or `goal[1]` (depending on the value of `tmp`) has the additional element `(i, ind)` appended to it.
