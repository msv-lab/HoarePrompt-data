Output State: **`line` is a string, `ind` is an index within the string `line`, `elements[ line[ind] ]` is now `i, ind`**.

Explanation: The code updates the dictionary `elements` such that the key `line[ind]` (where `ind` is the current index within the string `line`) is mapped to the tuple `(i, ind)`. The values of `line` and `ind` remain unchanged, and the updated state of `elements` is included in the output state.
