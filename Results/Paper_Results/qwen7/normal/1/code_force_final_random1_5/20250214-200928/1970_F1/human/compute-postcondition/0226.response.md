Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Variables:**
   - `t`: An integer greater than 3.
   - `time`: 3.
   - `command`: A list of strings read from standard input and stripped.
   - `comand`: Equal to `command` (likely a typo, but we'll assume it's the same list).
   - `obj`: The first element of the `command` list.
   - `com`: The second element of the `command` list.
   - `el`: The third element of the `command` list.
   - `team`: 
     - 1 if the first element of the `command` list starts with 'B'.
     - 0 otherwise.
   - `points[team]`: 10 more than its previous value.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('%d %s CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' % (time, GoalName[team]))
   ```

Given the initial state:
- `time` is explicitly stated as 3.
- `team` is determined by the first element of the `command` list. Since the value of `team` depends on whether the first element of `command` starts with 'B', we need to consider both possibilities:
  - If `obj` (the first element of `command`) starts with 'B', then `team` is 1.
  - Otherwise, `team` is 0.
- `GoalName[team]` will refer to either `GoalName[1]` or `GoalName[0]`, depending on the value of `team`.

Since the exact value of `obj` (first element of `command`) is not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `team`. However, we know that `time` is 3 and `team` will be either 0 or 1.

Therefore, the output will be one of the following two possibilities:
- If `obj` starts with 'B': `3 GoalName[1] CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH`
- If `obj` does not start with 'B': `3 GoalName[0] CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH`

Given the format requirement, the answer should reflect the most precise description possible based on the given information.

Output: **3 GoalName[team] CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH (where team is 1 if the first element of command starts with 'B', else 0)**
