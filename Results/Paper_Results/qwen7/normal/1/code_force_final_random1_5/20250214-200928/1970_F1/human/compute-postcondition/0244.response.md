Postcondition: `t` is an integer greater than 3, `time` is 3, `command` is a list of strings read from standard input and stripped, `obj` is the value of `nxt`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `nxt` is a tuple with the value `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`. If the player is identified (`isPlayer(obj)` evaluates to True), then `obj` is updated to the value of `nxt`. If the player is not identified, the values remain unchanged.
