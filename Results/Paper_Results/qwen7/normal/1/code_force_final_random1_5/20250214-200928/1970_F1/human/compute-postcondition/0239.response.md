Output State: **`team` is the result of `goalIn(pos)`, `t` is an integer greater than 3, `time` is 3, `command` is a list of strings read from standard input and stripped, `obj` is the value of `elements[obj]`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `nxt` is a tuple with the value `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`, `allPlayers[obj]` is `False`, `points[team]` is `points[team] + 1`**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `points[team]` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `points[team]` is updated to its current value plus 1, while all other variables retain their original values.
