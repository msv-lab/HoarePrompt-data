Output State: **`t` is the integer value of the first line read from standard input, and all other variables retain their initial states.**

Explanation: The code reads an integer value from standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This means `t` now holds the value of the first line read from standard input after stripping any leading or trailing whitespace. However, the values of `grid`, `elements`, `allPlayers`, `isPlayer`, `goal`, `points`, and `mov` remain unchanged from their initial states.
