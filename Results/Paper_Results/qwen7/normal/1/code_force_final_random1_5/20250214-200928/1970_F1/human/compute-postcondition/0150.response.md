Postcondition: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `time` is 0, `obj`, `com`, and `el` are the first, second, and third elements of the `command` list respectively. If `el` is '.Q', then `allPlayers[obj]` is set to True. Otherwise, if `el` is '.S', then `team` is 0 and `points[team]` is 10. In all other cases, the values of `team`, `time`, `obj`, `com`, `el`, and `points[team]` remain unchanged.
