Output State: **`elements[line[ind]]` is now equal to `i`, `ind` is increased by 1, `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is False**

Explanation: The code sets `allPlayers[line[ind]]` to `False`. Given the initial state where `elements[line[ind]]` is equal to `i` and `ind` is increased by 1, after executing the code, `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to `False`. The other variables remain unchanged.
