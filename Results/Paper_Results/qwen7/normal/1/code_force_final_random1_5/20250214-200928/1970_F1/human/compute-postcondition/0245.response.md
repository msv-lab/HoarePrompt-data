Postcondition: `t` is an integer greater than 3, `time` is 3, `command` is a list of strings read from standard input and stripped, `obj` is either the value of `nxt` or the value of `elements[obj]` depending on the condition `com == 'T'`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `nxt` is a tuple with the value `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`. If `com == 'T'` and `allPlayers[obj]` is `False` and `goalIn(pos)` is not `-1`, then `points[team]` is incremented by 1. If `com != 'T'` or the player is identified (`isPlayer(obj)` evaluates to True), then `obj` is updated to the value of `nxt`. If `com != 'T'` and the player is not identified, the values remain unchanged.
