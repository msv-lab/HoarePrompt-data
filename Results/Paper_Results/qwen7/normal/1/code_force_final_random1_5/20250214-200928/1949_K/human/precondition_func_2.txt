num is an integer representing one of the positive integers from the input list, na, nb, and nc are non-negative integers such that 1 <= na, nb, nc <= n-2 and na + nb + nc = n, where n is the total number of integers to split into three groups. Additionally, sum_a, sum_b, and sum_c are initialized to 0 before calling this function, representing the current sums of the numbers in the three groups respectively. group_a, group_b, and group_c are initially empty lists that will store the numbers in their respective groups.
