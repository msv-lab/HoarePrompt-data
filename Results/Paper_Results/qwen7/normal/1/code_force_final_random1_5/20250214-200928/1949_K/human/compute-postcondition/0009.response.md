Output State: **All elements from the `numbers` list have been distributed into `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c`. The `numbers` list is now empty. `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are integers such that \(1 \leq na, nb, nc \leq 0\) and \(na + nb + nc = 0\). Each of `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` contains exactly one-third of the original elements (rounded down if necessary), and their sums (`sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c`) reflect the total sum of the elements in each respective group.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop, the `numbers` list will be completely empty since every number was distributed to one of the three groups. The counts `na`, `nb`, and `nc` will each be zero because no elements remain to be placed in any of the groups. Each group will contain approximately one-third of the original elements, and the sums of these groups will be the totals of the elements within them.
