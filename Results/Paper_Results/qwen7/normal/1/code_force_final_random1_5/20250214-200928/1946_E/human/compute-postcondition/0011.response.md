Output State: **The program returns d, which is the second value returned by func_1(b, a % b), and c - a // b * d, where c is the first value returned by func_1(b, a % b)**

Explanation: The function `func_1(b, a % b)` is called with `b` and `a % b` as arguments. This function returns two values: `c` and `d`. The code then returns `d` and `c - a // b * d`. Here, `a // b` gives the quotient when `a` is divided by `b`, and `c - a // b * d` calculates the difference between `c` and the product of `a // b` and `d`.
