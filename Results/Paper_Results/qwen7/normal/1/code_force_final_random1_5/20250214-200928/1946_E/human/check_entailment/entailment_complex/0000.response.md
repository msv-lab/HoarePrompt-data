### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves reconstructing permutations from given prefix and suffix maximum indices. The solution provided uses combinatorial methods to count the number of possible permutations that satisfy the given conditions.

2. **Key Components**:
   - **Factorials and Combinations**: The code uses precomputed factorials and a combination function (`func_2`) to calculate the number of ways to place elements in specific positions.
   - **Prefix and Suffix Maximums**: The code checks if the given prefix and suffix maximum indices are consistent with the permutation constraints.
   - **Combination Calculation**: The combination function `func_2` uses a modular inverse to compute combinations efficiently.

3. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1`**: This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm and returns the coefficients of BÃ©zout's identity. This is used to compute modular inverses.
   - **`func_2`**: This function computes the binomial coefficient \( \binom{a}{b} \) modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) using the result from `func_1`.

4. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic iterates through the prefix and suffix maximum indices to calculate the number of valid permutations.
   - It uses the combination function to determine the number of ways to place elements in the remaining positions after accounting for the fixed maximums.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code correctly handles edge cases where the prefix and suffix maximums do not match the expected indices.
   - It ensures that the permutation constraints are met by checking the boundary conditions.

6. **Modular Arithmetic**:
   - All calculations are performed modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) to handle large numbers and avoid overflow.

Given the detailed analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are implemented correctly, and the main logic accurately counts the number of valid permutations.
