Output State: **`a` is a positive integer where `a` >= `b`, and `b` is not equal to 0, and `a` is not divisible by `b`; `c` is the value returned by `func_1(b, a % b)`, and `d` is the second value returned by `func_1(b, a % b)`**.

This means that after executing the line `c, d = func_1(b, a % b)`, the function `func_1` has been called with arguments `b` and `a % b`. Since `a` is not divisible by `b`, `a % b` will be a non-zero value less than `b`. The function `func_1` returns two values, which are assigned to `c` and `d` respectively. The conditions on `a` and `b` remain unchanged.
