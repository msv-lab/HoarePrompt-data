Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not seem to be directly related to solving the problem of counting permutations based on prefix and suffix maximums. The problem requires understanding the constraints and properties of prefix and suffix maximums to derive the number of valid permutations. However, the given functions appear to be related to extended Euclidean algorithm and modular multiplicative inverse, which are not directly applicable to the problem at hand.

To solve this problem, one would need to analyze the given prefix and suffix maximums and use combinatorial logic to count the possible permutations. The current implementation does not address the core logic required to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
