### Reasoning

The original assessment concluded that the provided program is incorrect because the functions do not address the core combinatorial counting required to solve the problem. However, let's re-evaluate the problem and the provided functions to ensure the original assessment is accurate.

#### Re-evaluation of the Problem

1. **Problem Description Recap:**
   - Given the indices of prefix maximums and suffix maximums, we need to count the number of permutations that satisfy these conditions.
   - The solution should be modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Key Constraints:**
   - Prefix maximums: For each index \(i\) in the prefix maximums, the value at that index must be greater than all previous values.
   - Suffix maximums: For each index \(i\) in the suffix maximums, the value at that index must be greater than all subsequent values.

3. **Combinatorial Counting:**
   - The problem can be approached using combinatorial counting techniques, such as dynamic programming or inclusion-exclusion principles, to count the valid permutations.

#### Provided Functions

1. **`func_1(a, b)`**:
   - Implements the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to compute the modular multiplicative inverse.
   - This function is not directly related to solving the permutation problem but is useful for modular arithmetic operations.

2. **`func_2(a, b)`**:
   - Uses the result from `func_1` to compute \(a \mod (10^9 + 7)\).
   - Again, this function is not directly related to solving the permutation problem but is useful for modular arithmetic operations.

#### Function Summaries

- **`func_2`**: Accepts an integer `a` and a list of integers `b`. It calls `func_1` with `b` and a large prime number `1000000007` as arguments. It then returns the result `c` from `func_1`, multiplied by `a` and taken modulo `1000000007`.

#### Correct Approach

To solve the problem correctly, we need to use combinatorial counting techniques. Specifically, we can use a dynamic programming approach to count the valid permutations based on the given prefix and suffix maximums.

Given the provided functions do not address the combinatorial counting required to solve the problem, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
