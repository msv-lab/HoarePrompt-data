Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not seem to be relevant to solving the problem described. The problem requires determining the number of permutations based on the given indices of prefix and suffix maximums, which involves combinatorial logic rather than the operations these functions perform (which appear to be related to modular multiplicative inverses).

To solve the problem correctly, you would need to analyze the constraints and relationships between the prefix and suffix maximums to count the valid permutations. The given functions do not contribute to this analysis or calculation.
