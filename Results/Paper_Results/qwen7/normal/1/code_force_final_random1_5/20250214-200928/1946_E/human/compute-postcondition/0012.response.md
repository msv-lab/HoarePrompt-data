Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, both positive integers where `a` is greater than or equal to `b`. It returns either 1 and 0, two values 'd' and 'c' from a recursive call, a tuple containing 1 and the negation of (a // b - 1), or `d` and the result of `c - a // b * d` from recursive calls.**
