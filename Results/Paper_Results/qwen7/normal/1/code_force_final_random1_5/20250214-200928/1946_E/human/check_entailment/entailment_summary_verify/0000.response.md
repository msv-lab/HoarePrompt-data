### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem involves determining the number of permutations of length \( n \) that match given prefix and suffix maximums.
   - The solution should involve combinatorial logic to count valid permutations based on these constraints.

2. **Given Functions Analysis**:
   - **`func_1`**: This function appears to implement the Extended Euclidean Algorithm (EEA), which is used to find the multiplicative inverse of a number modulo another number. Specifically, it computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the coefficients of BÃ©zout's identity.
   - **`func_2`**: This function uses `func_1` to compute the modular multiplicative inverse of `a` modulo `1000000007` and then multiplies it by `a` and takes the result modulo `1000000007`.

3. **Relevance to Problem**:
   - The problem requires counting permutations based on prefix and suffix maximums. The given functions do not provide any mechanism to handle these constraints.
   - The EEA and modular multiplicative inverse are not directly relevant to the combinatorial logic needed to solve the problem.

4. **Core Logic Required**:
   - To solve this problem, one would need to:
     - Identify the positions of prefix and suffix maximums.
     - Use combinatorial methods to count the number of valid permutations that satisfy these conditions.
     - Ensure the count is computed correctly and efficiently, taking into account the constraints and properties of the maximums.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided functions do not address the core logic required to solve the problem. They are unrelated to the combinatorial counting needed for the solution.
   - Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not implement the necessary logic to solve the problem of counting permutations based on prefix and suffix maximums.
