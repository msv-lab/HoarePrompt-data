Output State: **`stop` is `True`, `i` is equal to `n - 3`, `opNum` is equal to `a[i]`, `a[i + 1]` is `a[i + 1] - 2 * a[i]`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `a[i + 1]` by subtracting `2 * opNum` from it. Since `opNum` is equal to `a[i]`, the new value of `a[i + 1]` becomes `a[i + 1] - 2 * a[i]`. The other variables (`stop`, `i`, and `opNum`) remain unchanged.
