Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an input integer, `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer, the number of iterations left is `int(input()) - 2`, and `a` is updated to the new input integer.**

Explanation: The code `a = int(input())` takes an input integer and assigns it to the variable `a`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states. The number of iterations left is still `int(input()) - 2`, and `b` remains as a list of integers obtained from the latest input string split on spaces and converted to integers.
