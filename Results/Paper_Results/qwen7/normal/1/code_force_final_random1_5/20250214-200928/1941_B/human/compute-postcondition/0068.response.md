Output: **NO**

Explanation:
- `stop` is `True`, but it is not used in the print statement.
- `i` is `n - 2`, but since `n` is greater than `n - 2`, this information is consistent but not needed for the print statement.
- The print statement simply outputs the string `'NO'`, regardless of the values of `stop`, `i`, or `n`.

Therefore, the output is **NO**.
