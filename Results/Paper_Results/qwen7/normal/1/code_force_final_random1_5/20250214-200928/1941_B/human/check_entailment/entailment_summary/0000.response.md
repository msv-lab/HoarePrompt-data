Reasoning:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by checking specific conditions related to the first and last elements of the array. However, the logic implemented is flawed. Let's analyze why:

1. **Condition for 'NO':**
   - The program checks if `b[0] % 2 == 1` and `b[1] != b[0] + 2`, or if `b[-1] % 2 == 1` and `b[-2] != b[-1] + 2`.
   - This condition is too restrictive. It only considers the parity (odd/even) and the exact difference of 2 between the first two elements and the last two elements. However, the problem allows for more flexibility in the operations, and these conditions do not cover all scenarios where making all elements zero is possible.

2. **Correct Approach:**
   - To correctly determine if all elements can be made zero, we need to check if the sum of the array elements is divisible by 3. This is because each operation reduces the sum of the array by exactly 3.
   - Additionally, we need to ensure that the array can be reduced to zeros through the allowed operations. This involves checking the parity and relative differences of consecutive elements, but the current implementation is overly simplistic and misses many valid cases.

Given the above analysis, the provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
