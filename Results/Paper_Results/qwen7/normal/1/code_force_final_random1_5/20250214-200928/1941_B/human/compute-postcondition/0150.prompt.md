You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and the array a consists of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 0 ≤ a_j ≤ 10^9. The sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func():
    numTest = int(input())
    for _ in range(0, numTest):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        
        stop = False
        
        for i in range(0, n - 2):
            if a[i] < 0:
                print('NO')
                stop = True
                break
            opNum = a[i]
            a[i] -= opNum
            a[i + 1] -= 2 * opNum
            a[i + 2] -= opNum
        
        if stop == True:
            continue
        
        if a[len(a) - 1] != 0 or a[len(a) - 2] != 0:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, and since `stop` was set to `True` during the first iteration, it remains `True` throughout the remaining iterations. Therefore, no further operations are performed on the list `a`. The final state of `a` will depend on the initial values provided by the inputs but will not change because the loop does not proceed beyond the first iteration due to the `stop = True` condition.
    #
    #In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is as follows: The loop terminates after the first iteration because the `stop` variable is set to `True`. Consequently, the list `a` remains unchanged from its initial state provided by the input. The value of `stop` remains `True`, and the loop does not perform any further operations on `a`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a set of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5), and an array a consisting of n integers (0 ≤ a_j ≤ 10^9). For each test case, the function returns a result based on the given conditions.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
