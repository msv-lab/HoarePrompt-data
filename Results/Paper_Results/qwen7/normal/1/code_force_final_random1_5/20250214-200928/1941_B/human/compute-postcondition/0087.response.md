Output State: `stop` is `True`, `i` is `n - 1`, `opNum` is `a[i]`, `a[i]` is `a[i] - opNum`, `a[i + 1]` is `a[i + 1] - 3 * opNum`, `a[i + 2]` is `a[i + 2] - 2 * opNum`.

### Explanation:
- The loop continues as long as `stop` is `False` and `i` is less than `n - 2`.
- After each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.
- The loop stops when either `stop` becomes `True` or `i` reaches `n - 2`.
- Given that the loop has executed 3 times, `i` will be `n - 2` after the last iteration.
- Since the loop exits due to the condition `stop = True`, it means that the condition `a[i] < 0` was met at some point during the loop's execution.
- Therefore, after all iterations, `stop` remains `True`, `i` is `n - 1` (since it increments one more time after the last valid iteration), and the operations on `opNum`, `a[i]`, `a[i + 1]`, and `a[i + 2]` continue as described in the previous states.
