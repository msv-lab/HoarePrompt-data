Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `i` is 3
- `opNum` is equal to `a[3]`
- `a[1]` is decreased by `2 * opNum`
- `a[2]` is decreased by `2 * opNum`
- `a[4]` is decreased by `3 * opNum`
- `a[3]` is decreased by `2 * opNum`
- `a[5]` is decreased by `opNum`

### Loop Statement
```
for i in range(0, n - 2):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < n - 2`.
2. **Current Value of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3.
3. **Next Value of `i`**: For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 4.
4. **Condition Check**: We need to check if `i < n - 2` holds true for `i = 4`.

Since the loop condition is `i < n - 2`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n - 2`. Given that `i` is currently 3, the condition `3 < n - 2` must hold true, which simplifies to `n > 5`.

### Adjusting the States

- **Variable `i`**: It will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 4.
- **Variable `opNum`**: It remains unchanged because it is derived from `a[3]` and does not depend on the loop index `i`.
- **Array `a`**: The values of `a[1]`, `a[2]`, `a[3]`, `a[4]`, and `a[5]` will be further modified according to the loop body, but since the loop body is omitted, we cannot specify the exact changes. However, we know that these values will be updated based on `opNum`.

### Final State

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is 4
- `opNum` is still equal to `a[3]`
- The values of `a[1]`, `a[2]`, `a[3]`, `a[4]`, and `a[5]` will be updated, but their exact values are not specified.

Therefore, the final state is:

State: **`i` is 4, `opNum` is equal to `a[3]`, `a[1]`, `a[2]`, `a[3]`, `a[4]`, and `a[5]` are updated based on `opNum`**
