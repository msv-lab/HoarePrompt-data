Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Descriptions:**
   - `stop` is `True`.
   - `i` is `n - 1`.
   - `opNum` is `a[i] - a[i]`, which simplifies to `0` because any number subtracted from itself is zero.
   - `a[i]` is `a[i] - (a[i] - a[i])`, which also simplifies to `a[i]` because `(a[i] - a[i])` is `0`.
   - `a[i + 1]` is `a[i + 1] - 3 * (a[i] - a[i])`, which simplifies to `a[i + 1]` because `(a[i] - a[i])` is `0`.
   - `a[i + 2]` is `a[i + 2] - 2 * (a[i] - a[i])`, which simplifies to `a[i + 2]` because `(a[i] - a[i])` is `0`.
   - `a[len(a) - 1]` is `0`.
   - `a[len(a) - 2]` is `0`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

Given the above breakdown, the print statement will output the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
