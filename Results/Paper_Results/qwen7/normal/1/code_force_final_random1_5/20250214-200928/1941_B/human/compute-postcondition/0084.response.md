Output State: **`stop` is `True`, `i` is `n - 2`, `opNum` is `a[i]`, `a[i]` is `a[i] - opNum`, `a[i + 1]` is `a[i + 1] - 3 * opNum`, `a[i + 2]` is `a[i + 2] - opNum`**

Explanation: The code `a[i + 1] -= 2 * opNum` subtracts `2 * opNum` from `a[i + 1]`. Given that `opNum` is `a[i]`, the updated value of `a[i + 1]` is `a[i + 1] - 2 * a[i]`, which simplifies to `a[i + 1] - 3 * opNum`. The other variables remain unchanged.
