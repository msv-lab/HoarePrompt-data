Postcondition: `stop` is `True`, `i` is `n - 1`, `opNum` is `0`, `a[i]` is `0`, `a[i + 1]` is `0`, `a[i + 2]` is `0`, and either the last element of `a` is not 0 or the second last element of `a` is not 0.

Explanation: 
- If the condition `a[len(a) - 1] != 0 or a[len(a) - 2] != 0` is true, then `opNum` remains as `a[i]`, and `a[i]`, `a[i + 1]`, and `a[i + 2]` are updated accordingly. In this case, the postcondition includes the condition that either the last or the second last element of `a` is not 0.
- If the condition is false, then `opNum` becomes `0`, and `a[i]`, `a[i + 1]`, and `a[i + 2]` are all set to `0`. In this case, the last and second last elements of `a` are both `0`.
- Since the `stop` flag is always set to `True` regardless of the condition, the final state of `stop` is `True`.
