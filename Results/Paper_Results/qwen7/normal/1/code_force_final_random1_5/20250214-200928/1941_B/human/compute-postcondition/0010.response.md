Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `range(int(input()))`. This means the loop variable is `_` (an underscore, typically used as a throwaway variable) and the loop runs for the number of times specified by `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `a` is an input integer.
   - `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer.
   - The first condition for `b`: The first element of `b` is either an odd number and the second element is not equal to the first element plus 2, or the last element of `b` is an odd number and the second last element is not equal to the last element plus 2.
   - The second condition for `b`: The first element of `b` is even or both the first and second elements differ by 2, and the last element of `b` is even or both the second to last and last elements differ by 2.

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - The loop variable `_` is a throwaway variable, so it doesn't need to be adjusted.
   - The number of iterations left is determined by the value of `int(input())`. Since the loop has already run once, the number of iterations left is `int(input()) - 1`.
   - The values of `t`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged unless the loop body modifies them, but since no modifications are shown in the loop body, they stay the same.

4. **Formulate the new state**:
   - The number of iterations left is `int(input()) - 1`.
   - The values of `t`, `a`, and `b` remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is an input integer, `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer. The first element of `b` is either an odd number and the second element is not equal to the first element plus 2, or the last element of `b` is an odd number and the second last element is not equal to the last element plus 2. Otherwise, the first element of `b` is even or both the first and second elements differ by 2, and the last element of `b` is even or both the second to last and last elements differ by 2. The number of iterations left is `int(input()) - 1`**.
