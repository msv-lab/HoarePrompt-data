Output State: **`i` is 4, `opNum` is equal to `a[3]`, `stop` is True**

The variable `stop` is assigned the value `True`, which changes its state. The values of `i` and `opNum` remain unchanged from their initial states. The updates to `a[1]`, `a[2]`, `a[3]`, `a[4]`, and `a[5]` are not specified in the code snippet, so they are not affected by this line of code.
