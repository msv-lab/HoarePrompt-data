Based on the initial state provided:

- `stop` is `False`
- `opNum` is `0`
- `a` is a list of integers split from the input
- The first element of `a` is less than `0`
- `a[i + 1]` is the second element of the list
- `a[i + 2]` is the third element of the list
- Either the last element of `a` is not `0` or the second last element of `a` is not `0`
- `i` must be in the range `[0, n-2]`
- `_` is `0`

The print statement is simply `print('NO')`.

Since the print statement does not reference any of the variables or objects listed in the initial state, it will simply print the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
