The function processes a list of integers and an integer `n`. It iterates through the list (excluding the first and last elements) and reduces the middle elements based on specific conditions. After processing, all elements in the list become non-positive, with the first element being the most reduced. If a certain condition is met when calling another function `func_1` with the processed list and `n`, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function ultimately ensures that the list is modified according to the given rules and prints a boolean result based on an additional check.
