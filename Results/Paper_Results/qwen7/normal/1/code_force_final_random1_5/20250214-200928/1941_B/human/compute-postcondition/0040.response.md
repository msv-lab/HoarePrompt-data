The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop context provided, the values of the variables remain unchanged. The `continue` statement does not affect the values of `i`, `opNum`, `a[n - 2]`, `a[n - 1]`, and `stop`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is equal to `n - 3`, `opNum` is equal to `a[n - 3]`, `a[n - 2]` is decreased by `2 * opNum`, `a[n - 1]` is decreased by `opNum`, `stop` is `True`.**
