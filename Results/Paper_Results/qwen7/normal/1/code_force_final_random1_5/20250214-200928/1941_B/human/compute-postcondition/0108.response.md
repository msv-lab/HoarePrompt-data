Output State: **`stop` is `True`, `opNum` is `0`, `a` is a list of integers split from the input, the first element of `a` is less than `0`, `a[i + 1]` is the second element of the list, `a[i + 2]` is the third element of the list, either the last element of `a` is not `0` or the second last element of `a` is not `0`, and `i` must be in the range `[0, n-2]`, `_` is `0**.

The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or the most nested block it is inside. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block (like an `if` statement) that the `break` is inside, the only thing we know is that the execution will exit the current block. However, since no block is specified, the variables remain unchanged, and the conditions related to the list `a` and the index `i` remain as they were in the initial state.
