Output State: **`stop` is `True`, `i` is equal to `n - 3`, `opNum` is equal to `a[n - 3]`, the current value of `a[i]` is less than 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it does not change the values of the variables `stop`, `i`, `opNum`, or the condition that `a[i]` is less than 0. It only indicates that the program breaks out of the current loop or conditional block.
