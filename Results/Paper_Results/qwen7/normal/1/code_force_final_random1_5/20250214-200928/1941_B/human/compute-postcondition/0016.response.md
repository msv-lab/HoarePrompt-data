Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `_` (which is a placeholder for the loop variable) and the number of iterations left, which is given as `int(input()) - 1`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states hold:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `a` is an input integer.
   - `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer.
   - The number of iterations left is `int(input()) - 1`.
   - `a` is assigned the value of the new input integer.
   - `b` is updated to a list of integers obtained from the latest input string split on spaces and converted to integers.

3. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - The number of iterations left decreases by 1 because one iteration has just completed.
   - The number of iterations left is now `int(input()) - 2`.

Given the above points, the states that need to be adjusted are the number of iterations left.

**Final State**:
- `t` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
- `a` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
- `b` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
- The number of iterations left is now `int(input()) - 2`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an input integer, `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer, the number of iterations left is `int(input()) - 2`, and `a` is assigned the value of the new input integer, `b` is updated to a list of integers obtained from the latest input string split on spaces and converted to integers.**
