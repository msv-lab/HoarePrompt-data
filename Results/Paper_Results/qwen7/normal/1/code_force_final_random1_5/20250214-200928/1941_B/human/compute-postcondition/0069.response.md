Output State: **`stop` is `True`, `i` is `n - 2`**

The code `stop = True` does not change the value of `stop`, so `stop` remains `True`. Similarly, the value of `i` is not affected by this line of code, so `i` is still `n - 2`. The precondition that `n` must be greater than `n - 2` is also still valid.
