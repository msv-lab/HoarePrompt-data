Output State: **`i` is 4; `opNum` is equal to `a[4]`; `a[i + 1]` is decreased by `2 * opNum`; `a[i + 2]` is decreased by `opNum`.**

Explanation:
- Initially, `i` is 4.
- `opNum` is equal to `a[4]`.
- `a[i + 1]` is decreased by `2 * opNum`, which means `a[5]` is decreased by `2 * opNum`.
- The new code `a[i + 2] -= opNum` decreases `a[i + 2]` (which is `a[6]`) by `opNum`.

Therefore, the updated states are as mentioned above.
