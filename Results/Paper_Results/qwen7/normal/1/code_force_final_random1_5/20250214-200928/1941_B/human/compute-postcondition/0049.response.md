Postcondition: `i` is equal to `n - 3`, `opNum` is equal to `a[n - 3]`, `a[n - 2]` is decreased by `2 * opNum`, `a[n - 1]` is decreased by `opNum`, and `stop` is `True`. Additionally, either the last element of `a` is not 0 or the second last element of `a` is not 0, and in the case where both the last and second last elements of `a` are 0, `a[len(a) - 1]` is `0` and `a[len(a) - 2]` is `0`.
