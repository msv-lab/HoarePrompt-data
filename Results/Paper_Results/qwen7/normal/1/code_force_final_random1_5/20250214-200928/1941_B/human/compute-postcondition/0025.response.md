Output State: **`i` is 3, `opNum` is equal to `a[3]`, `a[1]` is decreased by `2 * opNum`, `a[2]` is decreased by `2 * opNum`, `a[4]` is decreased by `opNum`, `a[3]` is decreased by `opNum`, `a[i + 1]` (which is `a[4]`) is further decreased by `2 * opNum`.**

Explanation: The code `a[i + 1] -= 2 * opNum` decreases the value of `a[i + 1]` (which is `a[4]` since `i` is 3) by `2 * opNum`. Given the initial conditions, `opNum` is equal to `a[3]`, and `a[4]` is already decreased by `opNum`. So, `a[4]` is further decreased by `2 * opNum`. All other variables remain unchanged.
