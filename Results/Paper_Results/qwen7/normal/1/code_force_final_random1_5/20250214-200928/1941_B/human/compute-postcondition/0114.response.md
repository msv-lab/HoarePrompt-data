Output State: **`stop` is `True`, `opNum` is the value of `a[i]`, `a[i]` is `a[i] - opNum - opNum`, `a[i + 1]` is `a[i + 1] - 2 * opNum`, `a[i + 2]` is `a[i + 2] - opNum`, `a[i + 2]` is the third element of the list, either the last element of `a` is not `0` or the second last element of `a` is not `0`, and `i` must be in the range `[0, n-2]`, `_` is `0**.

Explanation: The code `a[i + 2] -= opNum` subtracts `opNum` from `a[i + 2]`. Given that `a[i + 2]` was initially `a[i + 2] - 2 * opNum`, after the operation, it becomes `a[i + 2] - opNum`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
