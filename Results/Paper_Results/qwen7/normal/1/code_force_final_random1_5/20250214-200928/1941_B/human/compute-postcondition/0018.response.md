Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an input integer, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the new input string split on spaces and converted to integers, the number of iterations left is `int(input()) - 2`, and `a` is updated to the new input integer.**

Explanation: The code `b = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a new line of input, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `b`. The other variables (`t`, `a`, and the number of iterations left) remain unchanged from their previous states.
