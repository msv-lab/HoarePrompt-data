Output State: **`i` is 4, `opNum` is equal to `a[4]`.**

Explanation: The code `opNum = a[i]` assigns the value of `a[4]` to `opNum`. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 4, and `opNum` is set to the value of `a[4]`. The condition to set `stop` to True if `a[i]` is less than 0 is not checked in this line of code, so `stop` remains unchanged.
