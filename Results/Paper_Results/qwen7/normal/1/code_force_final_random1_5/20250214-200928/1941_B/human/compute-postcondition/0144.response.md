Based on the initial state provided:

- `stop` is `True`
- `opNum` is `a[i]`
- `a[i]` is updated to `a[i] - (i+1) * opNum`
- `a[i+1]` is updated to `a[i+1] - (i+1) * opNum - (i) * opNum`
- `a[i+2]` is updated to `a[i+2] - (i+1) * opNum`
- `i` is incremented by 1
- `_` is `0`
- `a[len(a) - 1]` is `0`
- `a[len(a) - 2]` is `0`

The print statement is simply `print('YES')`.

Since the print statement directly outputs a string without referencing any variables, the output will be exactly as written.

Output: **YES**
