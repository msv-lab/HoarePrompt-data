Postcondition: **`q` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `l` is now an integer from `data[idx]`, `idx` is increased by 4, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted to keep `v1` sorted, `it2` is the index where `r` would be inserted to keep `v2` sorted minus one, `r` is now an integer from `data[idx + 1]`, and `results` is either appended with 'YES' or 'NO' based on the condition `it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] <= r) and (v2[it2] >= l)`; `it2` is calculated as `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`**.
