The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. It does not change the values of any variables but indicates that the loop will continue to the next iteration. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`q` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `l` is now an integer from `data[idx]`, `idx` is increased by 4, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted to keep `v1` sorted, `it2` is the index where `r` would be inserted to keep `v2` sorted minus one, `r` is now an integer from `data[idx + 1]`, `results` is 'YES'**
