Output State: **`q` must be greater than 0; `l` is an integer value from `data[idx]`; `r` is an integer value from `data[idx + 1]`; `idx` is increased by 2; `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `results` contains 'YES'**.

Explanation: The line `results.append('YES')` appends the string `'YES'` to the list `results`. The other variables (`q`, `l`, `r`, `idx`, and `x`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
