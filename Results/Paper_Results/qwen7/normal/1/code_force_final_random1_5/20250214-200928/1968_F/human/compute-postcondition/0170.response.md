Output State: **`q` is a positive integer decreased by 2, `idx` is increased by 5, `l` is int(data[idx]), `r` is int(data[idx + 1]), `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted to keep `v1` sorted, `it2` is the index where `r` would be inserted to keep `v2` sorted minus one, and `results` is either appended with 'YES' or 'NO' based on the condition `it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] <= r) and (v2[it2] >= l)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `idx` is increased by 4 initially, and then the code increments it by 1 more, making it increased by 5.
- The value of `l` is updated to `int(data[idx])`.
- The value of `r` is updated to `int(data[idx + 1])`.
- All other variables (`q`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, `it2`, `results`) remain unchanged in terms of their assignment logic, but their current values depend on the updated `l` and `r`.
