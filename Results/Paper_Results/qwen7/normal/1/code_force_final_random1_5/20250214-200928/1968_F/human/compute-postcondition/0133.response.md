To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects mentioned in the loop head. The loop head in this case is:

```python
for _ in range(q):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

Here, the loop variable is `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable when the loop index is not needed), and the range is defined by `q`.

Given the provided state before the loop starts, we need to ensure that the loop can execute based on the loop head. Since the loop variable `_` is not used, the only relevant information from the loop head is the value of `q`.

Let's break down the required adjustments:

1. **Variable `q`:** The loop will execute `q` times. Therefore, `q` must be a positive integer for the loop to execute.
2. **Initial Values:** The other variables (`i`, `idx`, `a`, `pf`, `mp`, and `results`) are not directly affected by the loop head and their initial states are provided. They will be modified within the loop body.

Since the loop head does not depend on the values of `i`, `idx`, `a`, `pf`, `mp`, or `results`, these variables do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. The only thing that needs to be ensured is that `q` is a positive integer.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

State: **`q` must be a positive integer**
