Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `idx` is increased by 2, `n` is an integer value from `data[idx - 2]`, `q` is the integer value from `data[idx - 1]`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, `mp` is a dictionary with key (0) and value [0], `i` is 2, `a[1]` is an integer value from `data[idx]`**.

Explanation: The code `a[i] = int(data[idx])` updates the list `a` at index `i` with the integer value from `data[idx]`. Given that `i` was initially 1, after executing this line, `i` becomes 2, and `a[1]` is set to the integer value from `data[idx]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
