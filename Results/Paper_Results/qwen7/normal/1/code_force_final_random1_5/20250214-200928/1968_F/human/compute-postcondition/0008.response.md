Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `idx` is increased by 2, `n` is an integer value from `data[idx - 2]`, `q` is the integer value from `data[idx - 1]`**

Explanation: The variable `idx` is incremented by 2, making it `idx + 2`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `q` remain unchanged, but their references to `data` adjust accordingly. Specifically, `n` is now the integer value from `data[idx - 2]` and `q` is the integer value from `data[idx - 1]`.
