Output State: **`q` must be greater than 1, `l` is the integer value from `data[idx]`, `r` is updated to the integer value from `data[idx + 1]`, `idx` is increased by 6, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `results` contains either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it2` is the index of the element just before `r` in `v2` using binary search.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `x` to be the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `q`, `l`, `r`, `idx`, `results`, `v1`, and `v2` are still as per their initial states, and `it2` is now the index of the element just before `r` in `v2` using binary search.
