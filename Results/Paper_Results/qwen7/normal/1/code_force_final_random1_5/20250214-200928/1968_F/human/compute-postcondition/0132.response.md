Output State: `i` is `n + 1`; `idx` is `4 * (n + 1)`; `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is an integer from `data[idx - n - 1]` to `data[idx - 1]`; `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the cumulative XOR of elements in `a` up to that index; `mp` maps each unique prefix XOR value in `pf` to a list of indices where that value was calculated, including all indices from 0 to `n`; `results` contains either 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration based on the conditions checked within the loop, ending with an empty string for the last iteration.

This output state describes the final conditions of the variables after the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `i` will be equal to `n + 1` because the loop runs from 1 to `n + 1`. The variable `idx` will be `4 * (n + 1)` as it increases by 4 * (n + 1) in the initial state and remains unchanged in the loop body. The list `a` will contain integers from `data[idx - n - 1]` to `data[idx - 1]`, and `pf` will store the cumulative XOR values of the elements in `a`. The dictionary `mp` will map each unique prefix XOR value in `pf` to a list of indices where that value was calculated, covering all indices from 0 to `n`.
