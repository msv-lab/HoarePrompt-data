Output State: **`i` is 1; `a[1]` is an integer value from `data[idx]`**

The code `a[i] = int(data[idx])` assigns the integer value of `data[idx]` to the index `i` in the list `a`. Given that `i` is initially 1, the value of `a[1]` is updated to the integer value of `data[idx]`. The initial value of `i` remains unchanged, and the condition that `n` must be at least 1 is still valid but not directly affected by the code.
