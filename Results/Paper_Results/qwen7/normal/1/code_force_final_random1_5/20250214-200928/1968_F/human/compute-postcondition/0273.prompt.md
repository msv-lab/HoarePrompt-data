Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `idx` is 2, `t` is an integer from `data[0]`, `data` is a list of strings, `n` and `q` are not yet defined as integers, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 â‰¤ a_i < 2^{30}, and `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[idx])
    q = int(data[idx + 1])
    idx += 2
    a = [0] * (n + 1)
    pf = [0] * (n + 1)
    mp = {(0): [0]}
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        a[i] = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]
        if pf[i] not in mp:
            mp[pf[i]] = []
        mp[pf[i]].append(i)
    for _ in range(q):
        l = int(data[idx])
        r = int(data[idx + 1])
        idx += 2
        x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]
        if x == 0:
            results.append('YES')
            continue
        v1 = mp.get(pf[r], [])
        v2 = mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])
        it1 = bisect.bisect_left(v1, l)
        it2 = bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
        if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] <= r and v2[it2] >= l:
            results.append('YES')
        else:
            results.append('NO')
    results.append('')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The loop executes `q` times. After all iterations, `idx` is increased by `2 * (n + 1)`, where `n` is the maximum value of `len(a) - 1` encountered during the loop's execution. The list `a` is fully populated with integers from the data starting from `data[idx - 2]` up to `data[idx - 2 + n]`. The list `pf` is also fully populated such that each element `pf[i]` is the result of the prefix XOR operation up to index `i` in `a`. The dictionary `mp` maps each unique prefix XOR value in `pf` to a list of indices where that value was calculated. The variable `results` contains either 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration based on the conditions checked within the loop. The last element appended to `results` is an empty string.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: All iterations of the loop have been executed; q is a non-positive integer (0 or negative); idx is 4 * (n + 1); l and r are the last integers from data[idx] and data[idx + 1] respectively; x is the result of pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]; v1 and v2 are lists obtained from mp.get(pf[r], []) and mp.get(pf[l - 1], []) respectively; it1 is the index where l would be inserted into v1 to keep it sorted; it2 is the index where r would be inserted into v2 to keep it sorted minus one; results contains either 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration based on the condition it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] <= r) and (v2[it2] >= l), with the last element being an empty string; results now has an additional empty string appended to it.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The loop has completed all its iterations, meaning `i` is now `n + 1`; the variable `idx` is `4 * (n + 2) + n`; the list `results` now contains one additional empty string at the end; the prefix function `pf` remains unchanged with `pf[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `n + 1` storing the cumulative XOR of the first `i` elements of the list `a`; the dictionary `mp` remains unchanged with each unique value in `pf` mapped to their respective indices.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
