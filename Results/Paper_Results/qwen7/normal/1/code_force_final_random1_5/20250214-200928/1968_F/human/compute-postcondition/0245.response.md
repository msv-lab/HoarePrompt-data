Output State: **`q` is a positive integer, `idx` is `idx + 4`, `l` is `data[idx - 2]`, `r` is `int(data[idx - 1])`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `results` has 'YES' appended to it.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no variables are reassigned or modified within the scope of the `continue` statement, their values remain unchanged from their previous states. Therefore, the output state includes all the variables in their previously calculated or assigned states.
