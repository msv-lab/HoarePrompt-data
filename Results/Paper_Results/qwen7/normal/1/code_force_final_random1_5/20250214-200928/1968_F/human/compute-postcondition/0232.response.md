Output State: **`q` is a positive integer, `l` is an integer from `data[idx]`, `idx` is increased by 2, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, and the list `results` has appended 'YES'; `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`; `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`; `it1` is the index of the first occurrence in `v1` that is not less than `l`.**

Explanation: The code performs a binary search (`bisect_left`) on the list `v1` to find the index of the first element that is not less than `l`. The values of `q`, `l`, `idx`, `x`, `v2`, `v1`, `v2`, and `results` remain unchanged except for the assignment of `it1`, which is the result of the binary search.
