Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `idx` is increased by 2, `n` is an integer value from `data[idx - 2]`, `q` is the integer value from `data[idx - 1]`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `a` with `n + 1` elements, all set to 0. The values of `t`, `idx`, `n`, and `q` remain unchanged from their initial state.
