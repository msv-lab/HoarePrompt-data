Output State: **`q` is a positive integer; `l` is an integer from `data[idx]`; `idx` is increased by 2.**

Explanation: The code `idx += 2` increments the value of `idx` by 2. The values of `q` and `l` remain unchanged. Therefore, `q` is still a positive integer, `l` is still an integer from `data[idx]`, and `idx` is now increased by 2 compared to its original value.
