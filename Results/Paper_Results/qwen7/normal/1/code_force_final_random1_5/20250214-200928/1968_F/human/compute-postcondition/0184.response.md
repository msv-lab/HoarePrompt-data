Output State: **All iterations of the loop have been executed; q is a non-positive integer (0 or negative); idx is 4 * (n + 1); l and r are the last integers from data[idx] and data[idx + 1] respectively; x is the result of pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]; v1 and v2 are lists obtained from mp.get(pf[r], []) and mp.get(pf[l - 1], []) respectively; it1 is the index where l would be inserted into v1 to keep it sorted; it2 is the index where r would be inserted into v2 to keep it sorted minus one; results contains either 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration based on the condition it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] <= r) and (v2[it2] >= l), with the last element being an empty string; results now has an additional empty string appended to it.**

Explanation: The line `results.append('')` appends an empty string to the list `results`. Since no other changes occur to the variables, their states remain the same as described in the initial state.
