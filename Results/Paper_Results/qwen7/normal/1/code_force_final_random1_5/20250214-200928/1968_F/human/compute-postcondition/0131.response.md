Output State: `i` is equal to `n + 1`; `idx` is equal to `4 * (n + 1)`; `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is an integer value from `data[idx - n - 1]` to `data[idx - 1]`; `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the cumulative XOR of elements in `a` up to that index; `mp` is a dictionary where each key is a unique prefix XOR value in `pf` and each value is a list of indices where that value was calculated, starting with `mp[0]` mapped to `[0]`; `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration plus an empty string as the last element.

This final state indicates that the loop has completed all its iterations, with `i` reaching `n + 1`, `idx` being set to `4 * (n + 1)` (since `idx` starts at 0 and increases by 4 * (n + 1) initially), and both `a` and `pf` fully populated according to the loop's logic. The dictionary `mp` captures all unique prefix XOR values and their corresponding indices, and `results` reflects the outcome of the loop's checks.
