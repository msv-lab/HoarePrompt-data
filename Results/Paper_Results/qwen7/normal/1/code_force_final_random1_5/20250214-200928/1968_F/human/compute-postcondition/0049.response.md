Output State: **`q` must be greater than 0; `l` is an integer value from `data[idx]`; `r` is an integer value from `data[idx + 1]`; `idx` is increased by 2; the current value of `x` is 0, and `results` contains 'YES'.**

Explanation: The line `results.append('YES')` adds the string `'YES'` to the list `results`. The values of `q`, `l`, `r`, `idx`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states.
