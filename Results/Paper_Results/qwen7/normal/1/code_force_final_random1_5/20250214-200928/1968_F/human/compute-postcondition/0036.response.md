Postcondition: `a[i]` is now the value of `int(data[idx])`, `idx` is `idx + 2`, `pf[i]` is `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`, and `mp[pf[i]]` is either an empty list or a list containing the index `n + 1`. If `pf[i]` is not in `mp`, then `mp[pf[i]]` becomes an empty list. If `pf[i]` is already in `mp`, then `mp[pf[i]]` remains unchanged.
