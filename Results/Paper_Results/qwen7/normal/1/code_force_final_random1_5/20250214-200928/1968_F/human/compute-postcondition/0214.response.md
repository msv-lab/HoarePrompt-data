Output State: **`i` is 5; `n` must be greater than 5; `idx` is increased by 1; `pf[5]` is `pf[4] ^ a[5]`; `mp[pf[5]]` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code `mp[pf[i]] = []` assigns an empty list to the key `pf[i]` in the dictionary `mp`. Since `i` is 5, the key is `pf[5]`. The value of `pf[5]` remains `pf[4] ^ a[5]` as it was not changed by this line of code. All other variables remain unchanged.
