Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `_` (a dummy variable) and the range is defined by `q`. Therefore, the only variable that changes with each iteration is `q`.

2. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `q` must be greater than 0.

3. **Adjust the states**:
   - `q` must be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.
   - All other variables (`l`, `r`, `idx`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it2`, and `results`) are not part of the loop head and their values remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body.

Given the information provided, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is `q`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`q` must be greater than 0**
