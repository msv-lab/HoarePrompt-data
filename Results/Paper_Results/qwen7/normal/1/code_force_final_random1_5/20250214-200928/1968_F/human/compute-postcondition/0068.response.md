The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. It does not affect the values of the variables outside the loop context. Given the initial state, the following variables are updated or remain unchanged:

- `idx` is increased by 2.
- `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`.
- `results` contains 'YES'.

Since the `continue` statement does not change the values of these variables, they remain as specified in the initial state.

Output State: **`q` must be greater than 0; `l` is an integer value from `data[idx]`; `r` is an integer value from `data[idx + 1]`; `idx` is increased by 4; `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `results` contains 'YES'.**
