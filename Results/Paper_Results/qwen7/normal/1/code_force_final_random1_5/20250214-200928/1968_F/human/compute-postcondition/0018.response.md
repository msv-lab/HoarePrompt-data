Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `idx` is increased by 3, `n` is an integer value from `data[idx - 2]`, `q` is the integer value from `data[idx - 1]`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, `mp` is a dictionary with key (0) and value [0], `i` is 4, `pf[4]` is `pf[3] ^ a[4]`, `mp[pf[4]]` is an empty list, and `pf[i]` is not in `mp`.**

Explanation: The line `mp[pf[i]] = []` assigns an empty list to the key `pf[i]` in the dictionary `mp`. Since `i` is 4, `pf[4]` is `pf[3] ^ a[4]`, and this key-value pair is added to `mp`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
