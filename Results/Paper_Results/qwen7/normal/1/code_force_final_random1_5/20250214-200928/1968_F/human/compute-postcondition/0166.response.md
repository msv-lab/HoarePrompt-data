Output State: **`q` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `l` is now an integer from `data[idx]`, `idx` is increased by 4, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted to keep `v1` sorted, `it2` is the index where `r` would be inserted to keep `v2` sorted minus one, `r` is now an integer from `data[idx + 1]`, and `results` is appended with 'NO'; `it2` is calculated as `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`**

Explanation: The code appends the string 'NO' to the list `results`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. The values of `q`, `l`, `idx`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, `it2`, and `r` remain unchanged from their previous states. The `results` list now contains the additional element 'NO'.
