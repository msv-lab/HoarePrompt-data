Output State: **`a[i]' is now the value of `int(data[idx])', `idx` is increased by 1, `pf[i]' is equal to `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]', `mp[pf[i]]` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code `mp[pf[i]] = []` assigns an empty list to the key `pf[i]` in the dictionary `mp`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
