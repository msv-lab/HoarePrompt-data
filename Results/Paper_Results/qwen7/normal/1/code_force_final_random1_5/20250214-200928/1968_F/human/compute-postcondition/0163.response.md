Output State: **`q` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `l` is now an integer from `data[idx]`, `idx` is increased by 4, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted to keep `v1` sorted, `it2` is the index where `r` would be inserted to keep `v2` sorted minus one, `r` is now an integer from `data[idx + 1]`, and `results` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `it1 = bisect.bisect_left(v1, l)` calculates the position where `l` should be inserted into the list `v1` to maintain it in sorted order. This does not change the values of any variables except for `it1`, which is now set to the index where `l` would fit in the sorted list `v1`. All other variables remain in their previous states.
