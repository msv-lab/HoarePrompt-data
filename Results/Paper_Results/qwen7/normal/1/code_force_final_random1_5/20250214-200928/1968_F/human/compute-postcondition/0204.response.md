Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 0, `idx` is increased by 2, `pf[1]` is `pf[0] ^ a[1]`, `pf[2]` is either not in `mp` or `mp[pf[2]]` is an empty list, `mp[pf[3]].append(3)`, `a[4]` is an integer from `data[idx]`**.

Explanation: The code `idx += 1` increments the value of `idx` by 1. Initially, `idx` was increased by 1, so now it is increased by 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
