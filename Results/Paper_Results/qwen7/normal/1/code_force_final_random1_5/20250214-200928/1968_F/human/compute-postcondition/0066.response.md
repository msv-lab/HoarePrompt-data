Output State: **`q` must be greater than 0; `l` is an integer value from `data[idx]`; `r` is an integer value from `data[idx + 1]`; `idx` is increased by 2; `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`**.

This means that `q` remains greater than 0, `l` and `r` retain their original values from `data[idx]` and `data[idx + 1]` respectively, `idx` is increased by 2, and `x` is calculated as the bitwise XOR of `pf[r]` and `pf[l - 1]`.
