Postcondition: **`q` is a positive integer, `idx` is `idx + 4`, `l` is `data[idx - 2]`, `r` is `int(data[idx - 1])`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted in `v1` to keep it sorted (using bisect_left), `it2` is `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`, `results` contains either `'YES'` or `'NO'` based on the conditions specified in the if and else parts.**
