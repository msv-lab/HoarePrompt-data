Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `idx` is increased by 4 * (n + 1), `n` is an integer obtained from `data[idx]`, `a` is now a list of length `n + 1` initialized to 0, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized to 0, `mp` maps each unique prefix XOR value in `pf` to a list of indices where that value was calculated, `results` contains either 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration based on the conditions checked within the loop, and the last element appended to `results` is an empty string; `q` is assigned the value `int(data[idx + 1])`.**

Explanation: The code initializes the list `pf` to a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
