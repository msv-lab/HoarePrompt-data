Output State: **`a[i]' is now the value of `int(data[idx])', idx is increased by 1, the states of other variables remain unchanged**.

This means that the index `idx` has been incremented by 1, while the value of `a[i]` remains the same as it was initially set to `int(data[idx])`. All other variables retain their original states.
