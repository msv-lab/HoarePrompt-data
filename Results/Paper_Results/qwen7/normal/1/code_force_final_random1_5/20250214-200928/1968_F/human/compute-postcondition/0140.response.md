Output State: **`q` is a positive integer; `l` is an integer from `data[idx]`; `idx` is increased by 2; `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]` and is equal to 0; `results` now contains 'YES'.**

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by the `continue` statement itself, the values of the variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The only change is that the loop will continue to the next iteration.
