Output State: **`q` is a positive integer, `idx` is `idx + 11`, `l` is `int(data[idx - 2])`, `r` is `int(data[idx + 1])`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted in `v1` to keep it sorted, `it2` is `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`, `results` is now `['YES']` if `x == 0`, and remains unchanged as `['YES']` or `['NO']` otherwise, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`**

Explanation: The code assigns `mp.get(pf[r], [])` to `v1`. This means that `v1` now holds the value of the list obtained from the dictionary `mp` using the key `pf[r]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
