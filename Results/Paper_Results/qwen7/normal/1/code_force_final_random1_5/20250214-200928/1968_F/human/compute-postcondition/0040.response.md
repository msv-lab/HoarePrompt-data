Output State: `t` must be greater than 0, `idx` is increased by 2 * (n + 1), `n` is an integer value from `data[idx - 2]`, `q` is the integer value from `data[idx - 1]`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is filled with the integer value from `data[idx - 2 + i]` for `i` in range(0, n + 1), `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `pf[i]` is the result of `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]` for `i` in range(1, n + 1), `mp` is a dictionary where `mp[0]` is `[0]` and for each `pf[i]` in the range of 1 to `n`, `mp[pf[i]]` is a list containing all the indices `i` for which `pf[i]` was calculated.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `idx` will be increased by twice the value of `n + 1` (since `idx` is incremented by 2 in each iteration and there are `n + 1` iterations), the lists `a` and `pf` will be fully populated based on the data provided, and the dictionary `mp` will map each unique prefix XOR value (`pf[i]`) to a list of indices where that value was encountered.
