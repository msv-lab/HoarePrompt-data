Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `i` is `n + 1`; `idx` is `4 * (n + 1)`; `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is an integer from `data[idx - n - 1]` to `data[idx - 1]`; `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the cumulative XOR of elements in `a` up to that index; `mp` maps each unique prefix XOR value in `pf` to a list of indices where that value was calculated, including all indices from 0 to `n`; `results` contains either 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration based on the conditions checked within the loop, ending with an empty string for the last iteration.

This output state describes the final conditions of the variables after the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `i` will be equal to `n + 1` because the loop runs from 1 to `n + 1`. The variable `idx` will be `4 * (n + 1)` as it increases by 4 * (n + 1) in the initial state and remains unchanged in the loop body. The list `a` will contain integers from `data[idx - n - 1]` to `data[idx - 1]`, and `pf` will store the cumulative XOR values of the elements in `a`. The dictionary `mp` will map each unique prefix XOR value in `pf` to a list of indices where that value was calculated, covering all indices from 0 to `n`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(q):
    l = int(data[idx])
    r = int(data[idx + 1])
    idx += 2
    x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]
    if x == 0:
        results.append('YES')
        continue
    v1 = mp.get(pf[r], [])
    v2 = mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])
    it1 = bisect.bisect_left(v1, l)
    it2 = bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
    if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] <= r and v2[it2] >= l:
        results.append('YES')
    else:
        results.append('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `q` is a positive integer, `l` is an integer from `data[idx]`, `idx` is increased by 2, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted to keep `v1` sorted, `it2` is the index where `r` would be inserted to keep `v2` sorted minus one. If `it1 < len(v1)` and `it2 >= 0` and `v1[it1] <= r` and `v2[it2] >= l`, then `results` contains 'YES'. Otherwise, `results` contains 'NO'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `q` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `l` is now an integer from `data[idx]`, `idx` is increased by 4, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted to keep `v1` sorted, `it2` is the index where `r` would be inserted to keep `v2` sorted minus one, `r` is now an integer from `data[idx + 1]`, and `results` is either appended with 'YES' or 'NO' based on the condition `it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] <= r) and (v2[it2] >= l)`; `it2` is calculated as `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `q` is a positive integer decreased by 2, `idx` is increased by 7, `l` is int(data[idx]), `r` is int(data[idx + 1]), `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted to keep `v1` sorted, `it2` is the index where `r` would be inserted to keep `v2` sorted minus one, and if `it1 < len(v1)` and `it2 >= 0` and `v1[it1] <= r` and `v2[it2] >= l`, then `results` is ['YES']; otherwise, `results` is `results.append('NO')`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
