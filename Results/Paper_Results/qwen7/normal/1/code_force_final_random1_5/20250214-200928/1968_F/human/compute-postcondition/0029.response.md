Output State: **`a[i]' is now the value of `int(data[idx])', `idx` is increased by 1, `pf[i]' is equal to `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]', and `mp[pf[i]]` is a list containing the index `i`.**

Explanation:
- `a[i]` is set to the value of `int(data[idx])`.
- `idx` is incremented by 1.
- `pf[i]` is calculated as `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`.
- If `pf[i]` was not already a key in `mp`, then `mp[pf[i]]` is initialized as an empty list. Now, since `pf[i]` is a new key (or possibly an existing one), `mp[pf[i]]` contains the index `i` as its first (and only) element.
