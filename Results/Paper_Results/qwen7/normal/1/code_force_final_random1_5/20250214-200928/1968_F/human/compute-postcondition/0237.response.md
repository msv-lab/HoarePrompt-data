Output State: **`q` is a positive integer, `l` is an integer from `data[idx]`, `idx` is increased by 2, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, and the list `results` has appended 'NO'; `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`; `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`; `it1` is greater than or equal to the length of `v1` or `it2` is less than 0 or (the element at `it1` in `v1` is greater than `r`) or (the element at `it2` in `v2` is less than `l`).**

Explanation: The code snippet appends 'NO' to the list `results`. This changes the last state of `results` from 'YES' to 'NO'. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
