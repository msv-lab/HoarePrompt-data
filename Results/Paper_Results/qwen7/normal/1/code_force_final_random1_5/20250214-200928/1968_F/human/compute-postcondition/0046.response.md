Output State: **`q` must be greater than 0; `l` is an integer value from `data[idx]`; `r` is an integer value from `data[idx + 1]`; `idx` is increased by 2; `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `pf[r]` XORed with `pf[l - 1]` to `x`. The variables `q`, `l`, `r`, and `idx` are updated as per the initial state, and `x` is calculated based on the given expression.
