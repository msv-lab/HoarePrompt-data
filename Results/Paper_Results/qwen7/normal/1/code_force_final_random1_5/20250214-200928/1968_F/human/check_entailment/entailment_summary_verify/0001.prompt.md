You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let us call an array x_1,\dots,x_m interesting if it is possible to divide the
array into k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
values from each part are equal.

More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each
element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y_1,\dots,y_k be the XOR of
elements from each part respectively. Then y_1=y_2=\dots=y_k must be
fulfilled.

For example, if x = [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] , you can split it as follows:
[\color{blue}1], [\color{green}1], [\color{red}2, \color{red}3, \color{red}0]
. Indeed \color{blue}1=\color{green}1=\color{red}2 \oplus \color{red}3\oplus
\color{red}0 .

You are given an array a_1,\dots,a_n . Your task is to answer q queries:

  * For fixed l , r , determine whether the subarray a_l,a_{l+1},\dots,a_r is interesting. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array
and the number of queries respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (0 \le a_i < 2^{30} ) —
elements of the array.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 \le l < r \le n )
describing the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of q over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, output "YES" if the subarray is interesting and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, the strings "yES",
"yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as correct answers).

Note

Explanation for the first test case:

The first query is described in the statement.

In the second query, we should divide [1,2,3] . A possible division is
[1,2],[3] , since 1\oplus 2=3 .

It can be shown that for queries 3,4,5 , the subarrays are not interesting.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each containing a list of integers `a` and a set of queries. For each query, it checks if the XOR of the subarray from index `l-1` to `r-1` is zero. If the XOR is zero, it appends 'YES' to the results; otherwise, it appends 'NO'. After processing all queries for each test case, it appends an empty string to separate the results of different test cases. Finally, it prints the results, one per line, with empty lines separating the results of different test cases.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the entire input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
2. **Test Cases Loop**: It iterates over each test case, correctly extracting `n` and `q` for each test case.
3. **Prefix XOR Array**: The program constructs the prefix XOR array `pf` correctly, where `pf[i]` is the XOR of the first `i` elements of the array `a`.
4. **Mapping Construction**: It uses a dictionary `mp` to map each unique value in the prefix XOR array to a list of indices where this value occurs.
5. **Query Processing**: For each query, it calculates the XOR of the subarray `a[l:r]` using the prefix XOR values and checks if this XOR value is zero or if there exists a valid split such that the XOR of the subarray equals the XOR of the prefix up to some index.
6. **Binary Search**: The use of binary search (`bisect.bisect_left`) to find the appropriate indices in the mapped lists is correct.
7. **Output Formatting**: The program formats the output correctly, appending a newline after each test case's results.

Given the above steps, the program appears to follow the logic required to solve the problem accurately.

Correctness: **True**
