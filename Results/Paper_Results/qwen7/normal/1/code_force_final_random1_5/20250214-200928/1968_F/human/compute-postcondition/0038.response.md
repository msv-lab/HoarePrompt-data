Output State: **`a[i]` is now the value of `int(data[idx])`, `idx` is `idx + 2`, `pf[i]` is `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`, and if `pf[i]` is not in `mp`, then `mp[pf[i]]` is an empty list; `mp[pf[i]]` appends `i`.**

This means that the dictionary `mp` has a key `pf[i]` which is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between `pf[i-1]` and `a[i]`. If this key does not already exist in `mp`, then `mp[pf[i]]` is initialized as an empty list. After executing the line `mp[pf[i]].append(i)`, the value of `mp[pf[i]]` is updated to include the current index `i`.
