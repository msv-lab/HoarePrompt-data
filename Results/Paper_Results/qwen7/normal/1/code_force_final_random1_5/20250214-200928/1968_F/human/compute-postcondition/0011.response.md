Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `idx` is increased by 2, `n` is an integer value from `data[idx - 2]`, `q` is the integer value from `data[idx - 1]`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, `mp` is a dictionary with key (0) and value [0]**.

This means that the dictionary `mp` has been initialized with the key `0` mapped to the list `[0]`. All other variables retain their previous states as described in the initial state.
