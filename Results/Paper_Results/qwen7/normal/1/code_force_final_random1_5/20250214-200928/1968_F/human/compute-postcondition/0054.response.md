Output State: **`q` must be greater than 0; `l` is an integer value from `data[idx]`; `r` is an integer value from `data[idx + 1]`; `idx` is increased by 2; `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `v1` is assigned the list obtained from `mp.get(pf[r], [])`; `v2` is assigned the list obtained from `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`**.

Explanation: The code `v2 = mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])` assigns the list obtained from `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])` to `v2`. This does not affect the values of `q`, `l`, `r`, `idx`, `x`, or `v1`. Therefore, the conditions and values of these variables remain unchanged.
