Output State: **`a[i]` is now the value of `int(data[idx])`, `idx` is `idx + 2`, `pf[i]` is `pf[n] ^ a[n + 1]`, and `mp[pf[i]]` is a list containing the index `n + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `idx += 1` increments the value of `idx` by 1. Given that `idx` was initially `idx + 1`, after executing this line, `idx` becomes `idx + 2`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
