Output State: **All iterations of the loop have been executed; q is a non-positive integer (0 or negative); idx is 4 * (n + 1); l and r are the last integers from data[idx] and data[idx + 1] respectively, where idx is the final position after all loop iterations; x is the result of pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]; v1 and v2 are lists obtained from mp.get(pf[r], []) and mp.get(pf[l - 1], []) respectively; it1 is the index where l would be inserted into v1 to keep it sorted; it2 is the index where r would be inserted into v2 to keep it sorted minus one; results contains either 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration based on the condition it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] <= r) and (v2[it2] >= l), with the last element being an empty string.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have completed:
- The loop counter `q` is no longer positive.
- The index `idx` is set to `4 * (n + 1)`.
- The variables `l` and `r` hold the last two integers processed in the loop.
- The variable `x` is the result of the XOR operation between the prefix sums at positions `r` and `l - 1`.
- Lists `v1` and `v2` are derived from the dictionary `mp` based on the current prefix sums.
- The index `it1` is determined for `l` in `v1`, and `it2` is determined for `r` in `v2`.
- The `results` list contains 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration, with the last entry being an empty string indicating the end of the loop.
