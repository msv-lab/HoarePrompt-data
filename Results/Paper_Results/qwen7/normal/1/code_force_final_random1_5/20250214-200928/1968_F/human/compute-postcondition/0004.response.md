Output State: **`idx` is 2, `t` is an integer from `data[0]`, `data` is a list of strings, `n` and `q` are not yet defined as integers, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 â‰¤ a_i < 2^{30}, and `results` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `results`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
