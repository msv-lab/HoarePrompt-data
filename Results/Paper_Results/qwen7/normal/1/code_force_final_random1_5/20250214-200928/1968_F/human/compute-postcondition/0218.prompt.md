Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `pf` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`, `q` is `int(data[idx + 1])`, `idx` is 4 * (n + 2), `l` and `r` are the last integers from `data[idx]` and `data[idx + 1]` respectively, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` and `v2` are lists obtained from `mp.get(pf[r], [])` and `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])` respectively, `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted into `v1` to keep it sorted, `it2` is the index where `r` would be inserted into `v2` to keep it sorted minus one, `results` contains either 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration based on the condition `it1 < len(v1)` and `it2 >= 0` and `(v1[it1] <= r)` and `(v2[it2] >= l)`, with the last element being an empty string, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `a` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`, `mp` is updated to {(0): [0], (0): [0]}, and no other changes.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    a[i] = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]
    if pf[i] not in mp:
        mp[pf[i]] = []
    mp[pf[i]].append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 0, `idx` is increased by 1, `pf[1]` is `pf[0] ^ a[1]`, `pf[2]` is either not in `mp` or `mp[pf[2]]` is an empty list, `mp[pf[3]].append(3)`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 4; `n` must be greater than 0; `idx` is increased by 2; `pf[1]` is `pf[0] ^ a[1]`; `pf[2]` is either not in `mp` or `mp[pf[2]]` is an empty list; `mp[pf[3]].append(3)`; `a[4]` is an integer from `data[idx]`; `pf[4]` is `pf[3] ^ a[4]`; `mp[pf[i]].append(i)` is executed for `i` being 3.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 5; `n` must be greater than 5; `idx` is increased by 1; `pf[5]` is `pf[4] ^ a[5]`; if `pf[5]` is not in `mp`, then `mp[pf[5]]` becomes an empty list; `mp[pf[5]]` appends 5.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
