Output State: **`q` is a positive integer; `l` is an integer from `data[idx]`; `idx` is increased by 2; `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]` and is equal to 0; `results` now contains 'YES'.**

Explanation: The line `results.append('YES')` appends the string `'YES'` to the list `results`. This does not affect the values of `q`, `l`, `idx`, or `x`. The value of `x` remains unchanged at 0. Therefore, the updated state includes the new element in the `results` list.
