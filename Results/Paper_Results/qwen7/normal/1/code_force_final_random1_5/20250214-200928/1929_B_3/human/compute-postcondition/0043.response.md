Functionality: **The function processes multiple lines of input, each containing two integers \( n \) and \( k \). Based on specific conditions involving \( n \) and \( k \), it prints one of three possible values: \( \lceil k/2 \rceil \), \( 2n - 1 \), or \( 2n \). After processing all input lines, it prints the final calculated value for the last line of input.**
