Output State: The loop will continue to process each line of input until there are no more lines left. For each line, the values of `n` and `k` will be updated based on the conditions specified in the loop body. Specifically:

- If `k` is less than or equal to `4 * n - 4`, `k` remains unchanged.
- If `k` is exactly `4 * n - 3`, `k` is set to `4 * n - 3`.
- If `k` is exactly `4 * n - 2`, `k` is set to `4 * n - 2`.

After processing all lines of input, the final values of `n` and `k` for the last line processed will be printed according to the conditions in the loop body. The loop will terminate when there are no more lines to process.

In summary, the output state after all iterations of the loop will be the final values of `n` and `k` from the last line of input processed, adjusted according to the specified conditions, and the printed result will be the appropriate value based on those conditions.
