Based on the initial state provided:

- `s` is the next valid line of input starting from the second line.
- `n` is the integer value of the first element in `s` split by spaces and converted to an integer.
- `k` is the integer value of the second element in `s` split by spaces and converted to an integer.

The `print` statement is `print(2 * n - 1)`. 

Here, the expression `2 * n - 1` will be evaluated with the value of `n` being the integer value of the first element in `s`.

Since the exact value of `n` is not specified, we can only describe it in terms of the first element of `s`.

Output: **2 * [n] - 1 (where [n] is the integer value of the first element in `s` split by spaces and converted to an integer)**
