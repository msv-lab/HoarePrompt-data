Output State: **`s` is the next valid line of input starting from the second line; `n` is the integer value of the first element in `s` split by spaces and converted to an integer; `k` is the integer value of the second element in `s` split by spaces and converted to an integer.**

This means that the string `s` remains unchanged, but it is now known that `n` and `k` are integers derived from splitting `s` by spaces and converting the resulting strings to integers. Specifically, `n` corresponds to the first element and `k` to the second element of `s` after splitting.
