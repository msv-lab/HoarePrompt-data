Output State: All inputs `n` and `k` from each iteration of the loop have been processed, and the corresponding outputs have been printed. The variable `t` has been decremented until it reaches 0, indicating that all iterations of the loop have completed.

In more detail, after all iterations of the loop have finished:
- The variable `t` will be 0.
- For each iteration, either the condition `4 * n - 2 == k` was met, in which case `k // 2 + 1` was printed, or the condition was not met, in which case `ceil(k / 2)` was printed.
- The variables `n` and `k` from each iteration are no longer relevant as the loop has completed, but their values during the last iteration are the most recent ones used in the loop.
