Based on the initial state provided:

- `n_cases` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 2.
- `power` is equal to `n`, and the condition `power == n` is true.

From this, we can deduce that `power` is equal to `n`. Since `power` is set to `n` and the condition `power == n` is true, it implies that `n` is a valid integer (since `n_cases > 0` and `i` is 2, `n` must be a positive integer).

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(2 ** power)
```

Given that `power` is equal to `n`, the expression `2 ** power` translates to `2 ** n`.

Therefore, the output will be \(2\) raised to the power of `n`.

Output: **2 ** n**
