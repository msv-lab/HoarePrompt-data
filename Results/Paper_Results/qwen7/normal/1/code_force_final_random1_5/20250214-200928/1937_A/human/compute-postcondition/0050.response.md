Output State: **`n_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1 more than its previous value, `power` is 1, `n` is log2(`n`).**

Explanation: The code `n = log2(n)` updates the value of `n` to be the base-2 logarithm of its previous value. The other variables (`n_cases`, `i`, and `power`) are not affected by this operation.
