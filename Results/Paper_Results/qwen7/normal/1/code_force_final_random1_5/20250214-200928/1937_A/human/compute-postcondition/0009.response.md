Output State: **`n_cases` must be greater than 0, `n` is log2(n_cases) and must be greater than 1, and `power` is 2**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `power` by 1. Initially, `power` is 1, so after executing `power += 1`, `power` becomes 2. The conditions and values of `n_cases` and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, `n` is still log2(n_cases) and must be greater than 1, while `power` is now 2.
