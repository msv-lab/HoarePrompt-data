Output State: **`n_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `power` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1**

Explanation: The code `power += 1` increments the value of `power` by 1. Given that `power` was initially 1, after executing this line, `power` becomes 2. The values of `n_cases`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
