Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `while power < n:`. The variables involved here are `power` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state of these variables**:
   - `power` is currently 1.
   - `n` is currently `log2(n)`, but we need to know the initial value of `n` to determine the condition for the first iteration.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `power < n`. For the first iteration, `power` is 1, so `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `power` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute the first time.
   - The other given states (`n_cases must be greater than 0` and `i is 1 more than its previous value`) do not affect the loop condition directly and thus do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state right before the loop should be adjusted to reflect that `n` must be greater than 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1 more than its previous value, `n` must be greater than 1**
