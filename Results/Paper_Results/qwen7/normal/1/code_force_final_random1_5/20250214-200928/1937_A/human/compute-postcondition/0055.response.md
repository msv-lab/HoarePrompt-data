Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `power < n`.
2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n_cases` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `power` is 3.
   - `n` must be greater than 2.

3. **Determine which states need adjustment**:
   - The loop condition depends on `power` and `n`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `power` is less than `n` for the loop to execute again.
   - Since `power` is currently 3, `n` must be greater than 3 for the loop to continue.

4. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - We need to ensure that `n` is greater than 3.
   - Other states like `n_cases` and `i` do not affect the loop condition directly and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the modified state for the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`n_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 3, `power` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3**
