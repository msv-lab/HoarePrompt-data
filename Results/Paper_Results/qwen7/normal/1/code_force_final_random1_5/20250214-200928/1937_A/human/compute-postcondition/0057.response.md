Output State: `n_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is greater than 0, `power` is equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than 3.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `power` until it is no longer less than `n`. Given the initial conditions and the output states after the first three iterations, we can deduce that `power` will eventually equal `n` after the loop completes. At that point, `i` will be one more than the final value of `power`, which means `i` will be `n + 1`. The other variables (`n_cases` and `n`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
