Postcondition: `n_cases` must be greater than 0, if `n` equals 1, then no change is made to `n_cases`. Otherwise, `n` is either `log2(n_cases)` where `n_cases` must be greater than 4 and `n` equals `power` (which is 4), or `n` is `log2(n_cases)` where `n_cases` must be greater than 4 and `n` equals `power` (which is 3).
