Output State: `n_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `power` is equal to `n`.

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `power` is less than `n`. After each iteration, `power` is incremented by 1. Therefore, once `power` becomes equal to or greater than `n`, the loop will terminate. Given that the loop executes until `power` equals `n`, the final state will have `power` equal to `n`, while `i` remains 2 (as it is not affected by the loop). The condition that `n_cases` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged.
