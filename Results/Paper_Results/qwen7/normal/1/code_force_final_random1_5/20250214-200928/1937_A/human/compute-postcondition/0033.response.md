Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `power < n`.
2. **Determine the current values**:
   - `n_cases` must be greater than 0 (this is not relevant to the loop condition).
   - `i` is 2 (this is not relevant to the loop condition).
   - `power` is 1 more than its previous value.

3. **Check the loop condition**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `power` must be less than `n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `power` is 1 more than its previous value. Let's denote the previous value of `power` as `power_prev`. Therefore, `power = power_prev + 1`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - The only variable involved in the loop condition is `power`, so we need to ensure that `power` is less than `n` for the next iteration.
   - Since `power` is 1 more than its previous value, `power_prev` must have been less than `n - 1` for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `power` is less than `n` for the next iteration.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `power` must be less than `n`**
