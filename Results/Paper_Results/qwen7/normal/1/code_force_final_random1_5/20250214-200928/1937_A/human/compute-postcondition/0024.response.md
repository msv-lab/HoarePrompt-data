Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and `n_cases`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < n_cases`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n_cases` must be greater than 0.
   - If `n` equals 1, then no change is made to `n_cases`.
   - Otherwise, `n` is either `log2(n_cases)` (and `n_cases` must be greater than 4 if `power` equals `n`), or `n` is set to 3.

4. **Analyze the loop execution**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n_cases`.
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, the loop will execute again as long as `i < n_cases`.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 from the previous value.
   - `n_cases` remains unchanged unless `n` equals 1, but since we are not given that `n` equals 1, we assume it does not change.
   - Therefore, `n_cases` remains the same as the previous value.

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`n_cases` must be greater than 0, and `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.**

Since we don't know the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration, we just note that it will be incremented by 1. However, we can express the state as follows:

**State: **`n_cases` must be greater than 0, and `i` is 1 more than its previous value.**
