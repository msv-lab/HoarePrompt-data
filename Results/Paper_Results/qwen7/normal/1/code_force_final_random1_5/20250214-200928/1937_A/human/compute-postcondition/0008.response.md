Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `power < n`.

2. **Determine the current state**:
   - `n_cases` must be greater than 0 (though this is not directly relevant to the loop condition).
   - `n` is `log2(n_cases)`.
   - `power` is initially 1.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `power` must be less than `n`.
   - Currently, `power` is 1.
   - Therefore, `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute the first time.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - We need to ensure that `n` is greater than 1.

Given these steps, the state right before the loop should be adjusted as follows:

State: **`n_cases` must be greater than 0, `n` is log2(n_cases) and must be greater than 1, and `power` is 1**.
