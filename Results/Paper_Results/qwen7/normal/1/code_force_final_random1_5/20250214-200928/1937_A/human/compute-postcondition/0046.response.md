Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(n_cases)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n_cases`.

2. **Understand the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n_cases`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, the postcondition states that `n_cases` must be greater than 0.
   - Also, `i` is either 2 or 1 more than its previous value.
   - `power` is either equal to `n_cases` or `power - 1`.

3. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is either 2 or 1 more than its previous value, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1 (assuming it was 2 previously).
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must still be less than `n_cases`. Therefore, `n_cases` must remain the same or increase if `i` was 2 previously.
   - `power` should be updated to `power - 1` if it was equal to `n_cases` previously.

Given these points, let's formulate the new state:

- `n_cases` remains the same or increases by 1 (since `i` will be incremented by 1).
- `i` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `power` will be updated to `power - 1` if it was equal to `n_cases`.

Since the exact values of `i` and `power` are not specified, we can generalize the state based on the conditions provided.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1 more than its previous value, `power` is either equal to `n_cases` or `power - 1`**.
