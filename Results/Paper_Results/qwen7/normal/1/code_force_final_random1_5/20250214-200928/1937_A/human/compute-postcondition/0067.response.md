Output State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, `n_cases` will be 0, and `i` will be equal to the final value it took after the last iteration. The variable `power` will either be equal to `n_cases` or `power - 1`, and `n` will be an input integer. If `n` equals 1, then `power` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `power` is set to `n_cases` and `i` is set to `n_cases + 1`.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop, `n_cases` will be reduced to 0 as each valid case (`n_cases > 0`) will decrement `n_cases` by 1 during each iteration. The loop continues until `n_cases` becomes 0. The variable `i` will hold the final index value after the last iteration of the loop. Depending on the value of `n` and the calculation within the loop, `power` will either match `n_cases` (which is now 0) or be one less than `n_cases`.
