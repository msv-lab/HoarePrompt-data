Output State: **`n_cases` must be greater than 0, and `i` is 1 more than its previous value; `n` is an input integer; `power` is 1.**

The code initializes the variable `power` to 1. This does not affect the values of `n_cases`, `i`, or `n`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial conditions.
