You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Initially, a_i=i for each 1 \le
i \le n .

The operation \texttt{swap}(k) for an integer k \ge 2 is defined as follows:

  * Let d be the largest divisor^\dagger of k which is not equal to k itself. Then swap the elements a_d and a_k . 

Suppose you perform \texttt{swap}(i) for each i=2,3,\ldots, n in this exact
order. Find the position of 1 in the resulting array. In other words, find
such j that a_j = 1 after performing these operations.

^\dagger An integer x is a divisor of y if there exists an integer z such that
y = x \cdot z .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 10^9 ) —
the length of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output the position of 1 in the resulting array.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    4
    
    5
    
    120240229

Output

    1
    4
    4
    67108864
    
Note

In the first test case, the array is [1] and there are no operations
performed.

In the second test case, a changes as follows:

  * Initially, a is [1,2,3,4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(2) , a changes to [\underline{2},\underline{1},3,4] (the elements being swapped are underlined). 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(3) , a changes to [\underline{3},1,\underline{2},4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(4) , a changes to [3,\underline{4},2,\underline{1}] . 

Finally, the element 1 lies on index 4 (that is, a_4 = 1 ). Thus, the answer
is 4 .

- Program: 
from math import log2

def func():
    n_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(n_cases):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            power = 1
            n = log2(n)
            while power < n:
                power += 1
            if power == n:
                print(2 ** power)
            else:
                power -= 1
                print(2 ** power)



- Annotated Code: 
from math import log2

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    n_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(n_cases):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            power = 1
            n = log2(n)
            while power < n:
                power += 1
            if power == n:
                print(2 ** power)
            else:
                power -= 1
                print(2 ** power)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `n_cases` will be 0, and `i` will be equal to the final value it took after the last iteration. The variable `power` will either be equal to `n_cases` or `power - 1`, and `n` will be an input integer. If `n` equals 1, then `power` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `power` is set to `n_cases` and `i` is set to `n_cases + 1`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n_cases`.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n`.

2. **Special Case Handling**:
   - If `n` is 1, the program directly prints 1. This is correct because the array `[1]` has no swaps performed, and the element 1 is already at position 1.

3. **General Case Handling**:
   - The program calculates `power` using `log2(n)` and iterates to find the smallest integer greater than or equal to `log2(n)`.
   - It then checks if `power` equals `n` (which would mean `n` is a power of 2).
   - If `power` equals `n`, it prints `2 ** power`.
   - Otherwise, it decrements `power` by 1 and prints `2 ** power`.

### Issues with the Program

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Power**:
   - The logic for finding the largest divisor `d` of `k` and swapping `a_d` and `a_k` is missing.
   - The program does not actually perform the swaps as specified in the problem statement.
   - Instead, it attempts to find a power of 2 related to `n`, which is unrelated to the actual problem requirements.

2. **Swapping Logic Missing**:
   - The core requirement of the problem is to perform the `swap(k)` operation for each `k` from 2 to `n`. The program does not implement this logic at all.

3. **Output Mismatch**:
   - The examples provided show that the final position of 1 depends on the sequence of swaps, not just the power of 2 calculation.
   - For example, in the second test case, the element 1 ends up at position 4 after the swaps, but the program incorrectly outputs `2 ** power` values.

### Conclusion

Given that the program does not correctly implement the required `swap(k)` operations and instead performs unrelated calculations, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
