Output State: **`na_frente` is an input integer minus 1, `v` is `na_frente`, `c` is 2, `v` is -1 minus the length of `custo_pra_frente`, `total` is 0, `best` is `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, `na_frente` must be greater than or equal to -1, and the current value of `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `best` to be `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
