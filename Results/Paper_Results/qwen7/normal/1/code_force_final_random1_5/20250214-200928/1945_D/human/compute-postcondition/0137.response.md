Output State: **`na_frente` is an input integer minus 1, `pos_final` is now `pos_final` - 1, `c` is 2, `v` is -1 minus the length of `custo_pra_frente`, `total` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `total` to 0. No other changes are made to the existing variables. Therefore, the values of `na_frente`, `pos_final`, `c`, `v`, and `custo_pra_passar_b` remain unchanged from their initial states.
