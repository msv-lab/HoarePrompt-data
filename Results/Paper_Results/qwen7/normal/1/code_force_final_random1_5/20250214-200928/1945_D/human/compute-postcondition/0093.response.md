Output State: **`total` is now `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, `na_frente` must be greater than or equal to -1, `c` is 1, `pos_final` is an input integer minus 1, `v` is less than `pos_final`, and the current value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than the current value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.**

Explanation: The variable `total` is updated by adding the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` to its current value (which is 0). Since `total` was initially 0, after executing `total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, `total` becomes `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given conditions.
