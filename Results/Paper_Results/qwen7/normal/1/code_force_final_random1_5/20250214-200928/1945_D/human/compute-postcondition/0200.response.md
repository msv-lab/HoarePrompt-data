Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases, where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), two integers n and m (1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000), and two lists a and b of length n (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n). The function returns a result based on the given inputs for each test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing specific parameters and lists, and it processes these inputs to produce a result for each case without needing any parameters passed directly to it within its definition.
