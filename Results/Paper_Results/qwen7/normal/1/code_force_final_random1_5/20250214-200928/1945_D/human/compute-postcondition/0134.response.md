Output State: **`na_frente` is an input integer, `pos_final` is an input integer minus 1, `c` is 2, `v` is -1 minus the length of `custo_pra_frente`, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.**

Explanation: The code takes an input and splits it into a list of integers using `map(int, input().split())`. This input is assigned to the variable `custo_pra_passar_b`. The other variables (`na_frente`, `pos_final`, `c`, and `v`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
