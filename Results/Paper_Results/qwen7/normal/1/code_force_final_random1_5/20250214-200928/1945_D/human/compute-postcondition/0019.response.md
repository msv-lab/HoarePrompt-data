Postcondition: `total` is 0, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is `na_frente` - 1, `pos_final` is `pos_final` - 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from another input split and mapped to integers, `best` remains unchanged if `best` was not greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`.
