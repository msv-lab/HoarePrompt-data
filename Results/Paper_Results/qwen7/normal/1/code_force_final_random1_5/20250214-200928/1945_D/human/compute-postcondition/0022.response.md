Postcondition: `total`, `c`, `na_frente`, and `pos_final` are integers. If `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, then `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, `c` is reset to 0, `na_frente` and `pos_final` are each decremented by 1, and `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if it was greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` initially. Otherwise, `best` remains unchanged. If `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is not less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, then `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `c` is reset to 0, `na_frente` and `pos_final` are each decremented by 1, and `best` remains unchanged if `best` was not greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`.
