Output State: **`y` is 1, `a_values` is an empty list, `b_values` is an empty list, the current value of `custo` is `a_values[0] + b_values[0]`**.

Explanation: The value of `custo` was initially equal to `b_values[0]`. After executing `custo += a_values[0]`, `custo` now equals `b_values[0] + a_values[0]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
