Output State: **`cases` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, c is 0, `na_frente` is an input integer, `pos_final` is an input integer, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers**.

Explanation: The code reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer using `map(int, input().split())`. These integers are then stored in the list `custo_pra_trocar_a`. The other variables (`cases`, `c`, `na_frente`, and `pos_final`) remain unchanged.
