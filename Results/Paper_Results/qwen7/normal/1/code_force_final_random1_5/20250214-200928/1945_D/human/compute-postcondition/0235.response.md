Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for y in range(max_p - 1, 0, -1):`. The variable `y` is being iterated over in this range.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `y` is `max_p - 1`, `a_values` is an empty list, and `b_values` is an empty list. We also know that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

3. **Check the condition for the next iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `y` is greater than or equal to 0. Since `y` is currently `max_p - 1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `y` needs to be decremented by 1 (since the loop increments `y` by -1 each iteration).

4. **Adjust the state**: After decrementing `y` by 1, `y` will be `max_p - 2`. The lists `a_values` and `b_values` remain unchanged because no operations were mentioned that would modify them within the loop body. Additionally, since we break out of the loop, the loop will not continue beyond this point.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration (if it were to occur) would be:

State: **`y` is `max_p - 2`, `a_values` is an empty list, `b_values` is an empty list**.
