Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variable and its initial state:**
   - The loop variable is `y`.
   - The loop runs from `num_fila - 1` down to `max_p - 1` with a step of `-1`.

2. **Determine the current state of `y`:**
   - According to the postcondition, `y` is either within the range defined by `range(num_fila - 1, max_p - 1, -1)` and is decreased by 1 at the end of each iteration.

3. **Understand the loop condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `y` is within the specified range.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `y` was within the range and was decreased by 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `y` must still be within the range defined by `range(num_fila - 1, max_p - 1, -1)`.

5. **Formulate the new state:**
   - Since `y` is decreased by 1 at the end of each iteration, for the loop to continue, `y` must be greater than or equal to `max_p`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `a_values` is an empty list, `b_values` is an empty list, `custo` is increased by either `a_values[y]` if `a_values[y] < b_values[y]` or `b_values[y]` if `a_values[y] >= b_values[y]`, and `y` is within the range defined by `range(num_fila - 1, max_p - 1, -1)` with `y` decreased by 1.**

To explicitly state it:

State: **`a_values` is an empty list, `b_values` is an empty list, `custo` is increased by either `a_values[y]` if `a_values[y] < b_values[y]` or `b_values[y]` if `a_values[y] >= b_values[y]`, and `y` is within the range defined by `range(num_fila - 1, max_p - 1, -1)` with `y` decreased by 1.**
