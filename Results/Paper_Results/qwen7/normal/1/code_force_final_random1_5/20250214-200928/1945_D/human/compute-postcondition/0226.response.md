Output State: **`y` is `max_p - 1`, `a_values` is an empty list, `b_values` is an empty list, and `custo` is `b_values[0] + custo`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `custo` by adding `b_values[y]` to it. Given that `y` is `max_p - 1` and `b_values` is an empty list, `b_values[y]` is equivalent to `b_values[max_p - 1]`, which is `None` (since the list is empty). However, since the problem specifies to use specific values or expressions, and considering the initial state, we keep `custo` as `b_values[0] + custo`. Since `b_values` is empty, `b_values[0]` is not defined, but the structure of the output state remains as specified.
