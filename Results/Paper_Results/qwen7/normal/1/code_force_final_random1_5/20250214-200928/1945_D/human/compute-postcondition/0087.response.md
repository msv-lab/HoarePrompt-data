Output State: **`total` is now `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `na_frente` is greater than or equal to -1, `c` is 1, `pos_final` is an input integer minus 1, `v` is -1, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers entered by the user converted to integers, `best` is the minimum value between `best` (initially 1000000000) and `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, and `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is greater than or equal to `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `total` by adding `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to its current value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
