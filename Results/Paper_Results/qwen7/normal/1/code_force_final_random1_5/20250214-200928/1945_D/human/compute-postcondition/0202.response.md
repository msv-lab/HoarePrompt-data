Output State: **`a_values` is an empty list, `b_values` is an empty list, `custo` is increased by `b_values[y]`, `y` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `custo += b_values[y]` increments the value of `custo` by the value of `b_values[y]`. Since `y` is within the range defined by `range(num_fila - 1, max_p - 1, -1)` and is decreased by 1, the value of `y` is decreased by 1. The states of `a_values` and `b_values` remain unchanged.
