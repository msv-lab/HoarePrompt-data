Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop is defined as `for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1):`.
   - The variable `v` is being iterated over using the `range` function.

2. **Understand the Range Function:**
   - The `range` function takes three arguments: `start`, `stop`, and `step`.
   - In this case, `start` is `na_frente`, `stop` is `-1`, and `step` is `-1`.

3. **Determine the Initial Value of `v`:**
   - The loop starts with `v` equal to `na_frente`.
   - The loop continues until `v` is less than or equal to `-1`.

4. **Check the Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to start, `na_frente` must be greater than or equal to `-1`.
   - The initial value of `v` is `na_frente`.

5. **Adjust the States:**
   - We need to ensure that `v` (which is initially `na_frente`) is within the range specified by the `range` function.
   - Therefore, `na_frente` must be greater than or equal to `-1`.

6. **Other Variables:**
   - The other variables (`c`, `pos_final`, `v`, `custo_pra_passar_b`, and `best`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Based on the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `na_frente` must be greater than or equal to `-1`.

So, the final answer is:

**State: **`total` is 0, `na_frente` must be greater than or equal to -1, `c` is 1, `pos_final` is an input integer minus 1, `v` is -1, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers entered by the user converted to integers, `best` is 10000000000**
