Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `a_values` will be a list containing all the integer values of `y` from the start to the end of the loop, and `b_values` will also be a list containing the same integer values of `y` from the start to the end of the loop. The variable `y` will be set to the last element of the list `b` after the loop completes. The variable `custo` will be increased by either the value of `a_values[y]` or `b_values[y]` depending on whether `a_values[y]` is less than `b_values[y]` or not during each iteration of the loop.

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes, `a_values` and `b_values` will both contain a sequence of integers representing the values of `y` from the highest to the lowest value within the specified range (from `num_fila - 1` down to `max_p`). The variable `y` will hold the final value it took during the last iteration of the loop, which is the lowest value in the range. The variable `custo` will have been updated based on the conditions inside the loop, adding either `a_values[y]` or `b_values[y]` to its value during each iteration.
