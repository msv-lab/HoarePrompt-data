You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are positive integers satisfying 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000. a and b are lists of n positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n.

            if a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]:
                custo += b_values[y]
                if y == 1:
                    custo += a_values[0]
                    break
            else:
                custo += a_values[y]

    #State: `custos` is a list containing the total sum of `custo` values calculated for each iteration of the loop, and `y` is 0.
    for c in custos:
        print(c)
        
    #State: Output State: `custos` is a list containing the total sum of `custo` values calculated for each iteration of the loop, `y` remains 0, and `c` is the last element in the `custos` list after all iterations have completed.
    #
    #In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `custos` will contain the cumulative sum of `custo` values from all iterations, `y` will still be 0 (since it was not modified within the loop), and `c` will be the last element that was printed, which is the last value in the `custos` list.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple inputs: a positive integer `t`, followed by `t` test cases. Each test case includes two positive integers `n` and `m` (with 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000), and two lists `a` and `b` of length `n` containing positive integers (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9). For each test case, the function returns a result based on the given inputs.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
