Reasoning:
The provided program seems to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Variable Initialization**: For each test case, it initializes variables like `na_frente`, `pos_final`, `custo_pra_trocar_a`, and `custo_pra_passar_b`.
3. **Loop Through Queue**: It iterates through the queue from the last person to the first person (`v` from `na_frente` to `0`).
4. **Condition Checking**:
   - If the current position `v` is within the allowed final position `pos_final`, it updates the `best` value and adjusts the `total` cost based on whether swapping costs less than passing.
   - If the current position `v` is beyond the allowed final position, it directly adds the appropriate cost to `total`.
5. **Output**: Finally, it prints the `best` value for each test case.

Given the structure and the logic, the program appears to handle all the specified conditions and constraints correctly. Therefore, based on the provided execution summary and the problem description, the program is designed to solve the problem as intended.

Correctness: **True**
