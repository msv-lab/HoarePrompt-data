Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    s = input()
    a = set(s)
    if len(a) == 2:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        b = ''.join(sorted(s))
        c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
        if b == s:
            print(c)
        else:
            print(b)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 0, `s` is an input string, `a` is a set containing unique characters from `s`. If the length of the set `a` is 2, no changes are made to `b` and `c`. Otherwise, `b` is the sorted string of `s`, `c` is the string formed by sorting the characters of `s` in descending order, and if `b` is not equal to `s`, `b` is updated to the sorted string of `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `s` is the input string entered by the user, `a` is a set containing unique characters from `s`, `b` is a sorted string of `s`, and `c` is the sorted string of `s` in descending order.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `s` is the new string input by the user, `a` is a set containing unique characters from the new string input by the user, `b` is a sorted string of the new string input by the user, `c` is the sorted string of the new string input by the user in descending order. If the length of set `a` is 2, the function does not change the values of `t`, `n`, `i`, `s`, `a`, `b`, and `c`. Otherwise, the values of these variables remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
