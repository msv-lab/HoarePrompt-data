Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program fails to handle cases where the string consists of exactly two distinct characters. For example, in the input "aaaaa", the program incorrectly outputs "NO", which is not correct according to the problem description. The correct output should be "YES" followed by a rearrangement of the string that is different from the original string. The program only checks if the set of characters has exactly two elements, but it does not ensure that the output string is different from the input string in all cases.
