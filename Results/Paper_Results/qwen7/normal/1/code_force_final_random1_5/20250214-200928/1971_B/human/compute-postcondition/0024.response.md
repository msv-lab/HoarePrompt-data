Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `s` is the input string entered by the user, `a` is a set containing unique characters from `s`, `b` is a sorted string of `s`, `c` is the sorted string of `s` in descending order.**

Explanation: The code `c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))` sorts the string `s` in descending order and assigns the result to `c`. The original values of `t`, `n`, `i`, `s`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
