Reasoning:
- The program correctly handles the input format and processes each test case.
- It checks if the number of unique characters in the string `s` is exactly 2. If so, it prints 'NO', indicating that no valid rearrangement exists (since any rearrangement would still have the same two unique characters).
- If the number of unique characters is not exactly 2, it prints 'YES' and generates a rearranged string. 
  - It sorts the string in both ascending and descending order.
  - It then checks which of these sorted versions is different from the original string `s`.
  - If the ascending sort matches the original string, it outputs the descending sort.
  - Otherwise, it outputs the ascending sort.
- This approach ensures that the generated string `r` is different from the original string `s` when possible.
- The program correctly handles all given examples and edge cases as described in the execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
