Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 0, `s` is an input string, `a` is a set containing unique characters from `s`. If the length of the set `a` is 2, no changes are made to `b` and `c`. Otherwise, `b` is the sorted string of `s`, and `c` is the string formed by sorting the characters of `s` in descending order. If `b` is equal to `s`, no changes are made to `b` and `c`. Otherwise, `b` is not equal to `s`.
