Output State: **`tc` is `tc - 1`, `i` is `n`, `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1, and `dp` is a boolean value determined by `arr[n-1] - arr[n] > 1`.**

Explanation: The code `tc -= 1` decrements the value of `tc` by 1. The values of `i`, `n`, and `dp` remain unchanged from their initial state since the code does not modify them. Therefore, `i` is still equal to `n`, `n` is still the length of `arr` minus 1, and `dp` retains its boolean value based on the condition `arr[n-1] - arr[n] > 1`.
