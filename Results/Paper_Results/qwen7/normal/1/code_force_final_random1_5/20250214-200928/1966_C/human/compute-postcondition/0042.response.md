Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1, `dp` is `arr[2] - arr[3] > 1 or not dp`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `dp` to `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp`. Given that `i` is initially 2, `i + 1` becomes 3. So, `dp` is now set to `arr[2] - arr[3] > 1 or not dp`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
