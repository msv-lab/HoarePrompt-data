The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads a positive integer \( n \) and a list of \( n \) integers. It then sorts and modifies this list, checks a specific condition related to consecutive elements in the list, and prints either "Alice" or "Bob" based on the result of this condition. After processing all test cases, the function ensures that the number of remaining test cases (`tc`) is zero.
