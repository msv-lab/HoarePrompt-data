t is an integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, n is an integer representing the length of the array a, followed by a line containing n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n representing the elements of the array a. Each a_i is an integer such that 1 \le a_i \le 10^9, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
