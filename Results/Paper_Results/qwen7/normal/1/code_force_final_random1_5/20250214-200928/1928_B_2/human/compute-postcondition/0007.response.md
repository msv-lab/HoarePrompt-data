Output State: **`i` is `len(arr) - 2`, `tem` is `tem * arr[len(arr) - 2] * arr[len(arr) - 2]`, `ans` is a list containing one element which is `tem`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `tem` to the list `ans`. Since `tem` was already calculated as `tem * arr[len(arr) - 2] * arr[len(arr) - 2]`, appending it to `ans` adds this value to the list. The values of `i` and `tem` remain unchanged from their initial state.
