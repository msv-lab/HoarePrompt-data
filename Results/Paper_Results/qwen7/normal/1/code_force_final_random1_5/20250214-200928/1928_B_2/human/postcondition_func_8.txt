The function accepts a list of positive integers `arr` and calculates a list `ans` where each element is the product of all elements in `arr` except the current element, starting from the product of all elements and ending with the product of all but the first element. The function returns this list `ans`. Additionally, it sets `tem` to the product of all elements in `arr` and `i` to `-1`.
