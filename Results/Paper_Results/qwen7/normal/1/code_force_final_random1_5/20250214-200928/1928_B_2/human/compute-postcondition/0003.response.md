Output State: **`i` is `len(arr) - 1`; `tem` is `tem * arr[i]`**.

Initially, `i` is set to `len(arr) - 1`, meaning `i` points to the last index of the list `arr`. The line `tem *= arr[i]` multiplies the current value of `tem` by the element at index `i` in the list `arr`. Since `i` is the last index, `tem` is updated to its current value multiplied by `arr[len(arr) - 1]`.
