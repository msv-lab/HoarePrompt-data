Output State: **`i` is `len(arr) - 1`; `tem` is `tem * arr[i]`; `ans` contains the value of `tem` appended to it.**

Explanation: The line `ans.append(tem)` appends the current value of `tem` to the list `ans`. The values of `i` and `tem` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `i` is still `len(arr) - 1` and `tem` is still `tem * arr[i]`. The list `ans` now includes the value of `tem` appended to its existing contents.
