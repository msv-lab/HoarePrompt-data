Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of positive integers. It calculates a list `ans` where each element is the product of all elements in `arr` except the current element, starting from the product of all elements and ending with the product of all but the first element. The function also returns the product of all elements in `arr` as `tem` and `-1` as `i`.**
