You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of positive integers.
def func_9(arr):
    ans = []
    tem = 1
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1):
        tem *= arr[i]
        
        ans.append(tem)
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is `-1`; `tem` is the product of all elements in `arr`; `ans` is a list containing all intermediate values of `tem` in reverse order, starting from the product of all elements in `arr` down to the product of all but the last element.
    #
    #To explain further, after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will have decremented past the first index of the list, making it `-1`. The variable `tem` will hold the product of all elements in `arr` because it multiplies each element as the loop iterates backward through the list. The list `ans` will contain all the intermediate products calculated during each iteration of the loop, starting from the full product of the array and decrementing with each step until it reaches the product of all but the last element of the array.
    return ans
    #`ans` is a list containing the product of all elements in `arr`, then the product of all but the last element, and so on, ending with the product of all but the first element; `tem` is the product of all elements in `arr`, and `i` is -1.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of positive integers. It calculates a list `ans` where each element is the product of all elements in `arr` except the current element, starting from the product of all elements and ending with the product of all but the first element. The function also returns the product of all elements in `arr` as `tem` and `-1` as `i`.

```

Return Postconditions: `ans` is a list containing the product of all elements in `arr`, then the product of all but the last element, and so on, ending with the product of all but the first element; `tem` is the product of all elements in `arr`, and `i` is -1.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
