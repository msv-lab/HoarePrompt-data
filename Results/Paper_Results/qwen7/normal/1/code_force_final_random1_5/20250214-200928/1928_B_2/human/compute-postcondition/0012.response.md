Output State: `i` is `-1`; `tem` is the product of all elements in `arr`; `ans` is a list containing all intermediate values of `tem` in reverse order, starting from the product of all elements in `arr` down to the product of all but the last element.

To explain further, after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will have decremented past the first index of the list, making it `-1`. The variable `tem` will hold the product of all elements in `arr` because it multiplies each element as the loop iterates backward through the list. The list `ans` will contain all the intermediate products calculated during each iteration of the loop, starting from the full product of the array and decrementing with each step until it reaches the product of all but the last element of the array.
