Output State: `current_year` is equal to the final value of `next_year` after all iterations, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is the second element of `test_cases`, `a` is a list with one element which is `test`, `ai` is undefined.

In the final output state after all iterations of the loop, `current_year` will be the result of applying the loop's logic to `test` multiple times until there are no more elements in the list `a`. The value of `current_year` will be the last computed `next_year` after processing all elements in `a`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, and `ai`) will retain their values from the initial state since they are not modified within the loop.
