Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the year in which all signs will occur sequentially according to the given problem description. For each test case, the program iterates through the list of periodicities and calculates the next occurrence year for each sign, ensuring that the next sign only occurs after the previous one has occurred. This approach ensures that the signs occur in the correct sequential order without skipping any intermediate years. Given the examples and the nature of the problem, the program handles all potential cases correctly.
