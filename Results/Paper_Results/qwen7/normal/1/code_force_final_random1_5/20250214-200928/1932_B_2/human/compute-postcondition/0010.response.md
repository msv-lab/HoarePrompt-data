Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `a` is a list of integers that must have at least two elements.
   - `year` is `year + year % ai or ai`, where `ai` is the second element in the list `a`.

2. **Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over each element `ai` in the list `a`.

3. **Current State Before the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `ai` is the second element in the list `a`, the current value of `ai` is the second element of `a`.
   - The value of `year` is updated based on the formula `year + year % ai or ai`.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the next element in the list `a`.
   - The next element in the list `a` will be the third element (since the second element was used in the current iteration).
   - The value of `year` will be updated based on the new value of `ai` (which will be the third element).

5. **Updated State:**
   - `a` must still have at least two elements, but now the second element is the third element from the previous list.
   - `year` will be updated based on the new value of `ai` (the third element in the original list).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`a` is a list of integers that must have at least two elements, `year` is `year + year % (third element of a) or (third element of a)`**.
