Output State: **`current_year` is equal to `next_year`, `next_year` is equal to (`current_year // ai + 1) * ai`, `ai` is equal to `ai_next`.**

Explanation: The code updates `next_year` to be `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`. Since `ai` is equal to `ai_next`, and `next_year` is calculated based on `current_year` and `ai`, the new value of `next_year` is derived from the formula provided. The initial equality between `current_year` and `next_year` is maintained before the calculation, but after the calculation, `next_year` is updated to the new value based on the given formula.
