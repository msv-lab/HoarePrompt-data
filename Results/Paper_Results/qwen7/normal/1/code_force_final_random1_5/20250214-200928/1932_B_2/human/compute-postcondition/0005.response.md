Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop is iterating over each element in the list `a`, assigning each element to the variable `ai`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**: 
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces.
   - `year` is 0.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as there are elements in the list `a` to iterate over.

4. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over the list `a`, the initial state of `a` must be such that it contains at least one element for the loop to execute.
   - The variable `ai` will take the value of each element in `a` during each iteration, but its initial state is not relevant since it changes with each iteration.
   - The other variables (`t`, `n`, and `year`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted based on the loop itself.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the state of the list `a` to ensure it contains at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`a` is a list of integers that must have at least one element**
