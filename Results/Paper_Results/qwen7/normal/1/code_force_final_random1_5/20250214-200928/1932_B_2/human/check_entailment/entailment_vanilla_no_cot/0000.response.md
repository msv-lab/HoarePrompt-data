Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to find the year in which all \(n\) signs will occur according to the Chaya tribe's beliefs. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Initialization**: For each test case, it initializes the number of signs `n` and the periodicities `a`.
3. **Year Calculation**: The variable `year` is initialized to 0. For each sign with periodicity `ai`, the program updates `year` by adding the minimum value between `ai` and the remaining part of `year` when divided by `ai`. This ensures that the tribe waits for the next occurrence of the sign after the previous one has happened.
4. **Output**: The final value of `year` is printed for each test case, which represents the year in which all signs will occur sequentially.

The logic used in the program accurately reflects the problem statement, ensuring that the program will produce the correct output for any valid input within the specified constraints.
