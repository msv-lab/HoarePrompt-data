Output State: **`t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, and it is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, after executing the code, `t` is now assigned the value of the input integer, which still satisfies the condition 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. The other conditions and variables (n and a_i) remain unchanged in their initial state.
