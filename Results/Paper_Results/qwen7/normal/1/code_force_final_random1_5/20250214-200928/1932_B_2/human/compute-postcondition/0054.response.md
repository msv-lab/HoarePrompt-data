Output State: `current_year` is the value obtained after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is the second element of `test_cases`, `a` is a list with one element which is `test`, `ai` is undefined.

In this final state, `current_year` will be the result of repeatedly applying the logic inside the loop until there are no more elements in the list `a` to process. The value of `current_year` will be updated based on the conditions specified within the loop: either adding `ai` to `current_year` when `current_year` is divisible by `ai`, or setting `current_year` to the next multiple of `ai` otherwise. This process continues for each element in the list `a` until the list is exhausted.
