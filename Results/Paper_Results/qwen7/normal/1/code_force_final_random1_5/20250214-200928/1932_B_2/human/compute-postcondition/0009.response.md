Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `ai` and `a`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are more elements in the list `a`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` is a list of integers that must have at least two elements.
   - `year` is `year + year % ai or ai`.
   - `ai` is the second element in the list `a`.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over each element in `a`, at the end of the previous iteration, `ai` was the second element in `a`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `ai` must be the third element in `a`.
   - The list `a` must still have at least two elements (since it had at least two elements before the current iteration, and we are only advancing to the next element).

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `ai` changes to the third element in `a`.
   - `year` remains unchanged because its value is determined by the loop body, which is omitted here.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: `a` is a list of integers that must have at least two elements, `year` is `year + year % ai or ai`, `ai` is the third element in the list `a`.**
