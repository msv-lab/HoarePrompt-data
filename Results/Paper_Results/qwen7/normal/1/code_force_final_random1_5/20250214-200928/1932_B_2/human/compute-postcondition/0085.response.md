Output State: `results` is a list containing the final value of `current_year` for each test case after the loop has executed all iterations; `t` remains a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\); `n` is the last element of `test_cases`; `a` is a list of integers from the last test case; `ai` is the last element of `a`; `current_year` is the final computed year for the last test case.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `results` will contain the final `current_year` value calculated for each test case in the `test_cases` list. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `ai`, and `current_year`) will reflect the state of the last test case processed by the loop.
