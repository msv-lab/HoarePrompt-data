Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `ai` and `a`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each element in the list `a`. The loop continues as long as there are elements left in the list `a`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `year` is updated as `year + (year % ai or ai)`.
   - `a` is a non-empty list of integers obtained from input, split by spaces.
   - `ai` is the first element of the list `a`.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - After the previous iteration, `ai` was the first element of the list `a`.
   - For the next iteration, `ai` will be the next element in the list `a`.
   - The list `a` will be updated to remove the first element (the current `ai`).

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `t` remains unchanged.
   - `year` remains unchanged.
   - `a` is now the list without its first element.
   - `ai` is the new first element of the updated list `a`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`n` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `year` is `year + (year % ai or ai)`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces that must not be empty, `ai` is the second element of the list `a`**.
