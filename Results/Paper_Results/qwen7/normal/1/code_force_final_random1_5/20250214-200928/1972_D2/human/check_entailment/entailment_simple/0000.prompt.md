Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * b \cdot \gcd(a,b) is a multiple of a+b . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    0
    1
    1
    6
    423
    5933961
    
Note

In the first test case, no pair satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case, (2,2),(3,6),(4,4),(6,3),(6,6),(8,8) satisfy the
conditions.

# Annotated Program:
import math

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6 and n, m are within the limits specified in the problem description.
def func_1():
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        
        x += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `n` is less than 15, `m` is less than 10, `y` is 4, `x` is 4, and `cnt` remains unchanged.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the conditions in the loop head (`while x * x <= n`) and the inner loop head (`while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m`) dictate that the loop will stop when `x * x > n` or either `(x + y) * x > n` or `(x + y) * y > m`. Given the final state after 3 iterations, we know that `x` is 4, `n` is less than 15, and `m` is less than 10. Since `x` increments by 1 each iteration and starts at 1, the loop will stop when `x` reaches 4 because increasing `x` further would make `x * x > n`. The value of `y` remains 4 as it does not change within the loop once the outer loop's condition is met. The variable `cnt` remains unchanged because none of the conditions inside the loops would allow further increments of `x` or `y` that satisfy all the constraints.
    print(cnt)
    #This is printed: cnt (where cnt remains unchanged)

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
        
    #State: t is 0 and func_1() has been called exactly 3 times.
