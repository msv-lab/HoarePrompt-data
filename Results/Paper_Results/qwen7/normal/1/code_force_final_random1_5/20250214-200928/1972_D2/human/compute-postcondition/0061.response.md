Output State: **`n` must be less than 15, `m` must be less than 10, `y` is increased by 1, `cnt` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `y += 1` increments the value of `y` by 1. There is no change to `n`, `m`, or `cnt`. The condition for updating `cnt` (which involves `math.gcd(x, y) == 1`) is not evaluated because the code only modifies `y` and does not provide new values for `x` or check the gcd condition. Therefore, `cnt` remains unchanged.
