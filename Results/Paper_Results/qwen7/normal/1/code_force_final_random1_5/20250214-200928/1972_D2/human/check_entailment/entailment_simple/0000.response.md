Reasoning:
- The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy specific conditions.
- The given program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
- `func_2` reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.
- `func_1` iterates through possible values of \(x\) and \(y\) and checks if the conditions are satisfied.
- The conditions checked in `func_1` are:
  - \(1 \leq x \leq n\)
  - \(1 \leq y \leq m\)
  - \((x + y) \cdot \text{gcd}(x, y)\) is a multiple of \(x + y\).
- The logic in `func_1` seems to correctly iterate through possible values of \(x\) and \(y\) and count valid pairs.
- The provided example and the annotated program suggest that the logic is implemented correctly.

However, there is a critical issue with the logic in `func_1`:
- The condition \(\text{gcd}(x, y) == 1\) is checked, but this is not necessary for the problem. The problem does not specify that \(\text{gcd}(x, y)\) must be 1.
- The calculation `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` is incorrect. It should be checking if \((x + y) \cdot \text{gcd}(x, y)\) is a multiple of \(x + y\), which simplifies to checking if \(\text{gcd}(x, y)\) is a multiple of 1, which is always true.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **False**
