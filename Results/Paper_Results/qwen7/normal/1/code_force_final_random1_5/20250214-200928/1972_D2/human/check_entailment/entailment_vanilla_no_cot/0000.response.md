Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as stated. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Condition Check**: The condition `b \cdot \gcd(a,b)` being a multiple of `a + b` is not correctly checked in the inner loop. Specifically, the current implementation checks if `math.gcd(x, y) == 1`, which is not sufficient. It should check the condition `((x + y) * y) % (x * math.gcd(x, y)) == 0`.

2. **Bounds and Precision Issues**: The current approach uses floating-point division (`n / ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)`), which might lead to precision errors and incorrect results. It should use integer division to ensure accuracy.

3. **Efficiency**: The current implementation has a nested loop structure with potentially large bounds, which could be inefficient for larger values of `n` and `m`.

Here's a corrected version of the code:

```python
import math

def gcd(a, b):
    return math.gcd(a, b)

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    count = 0
    for x in range(1, n + 1):
        for y in range(1, m + 1):
            if ((x + y) * y) % (x * gcd(x, y)) == 0:
                count += 1
    print(count)

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()

func_2()
```

This corrected version ensures that the condition `b \cdot \gcd(a,b)` is a multiple of `a + b` is properly checked, and it avoids potential precision issues by using integer operations.
