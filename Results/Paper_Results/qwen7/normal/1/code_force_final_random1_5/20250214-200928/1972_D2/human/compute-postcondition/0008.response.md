Output State: **t is 0 and func_1() has been called exactly 3 times.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` will be 0 because the loop runs for `t` times and once `t` becomes 0, the loop stops. The function `func_1()` has been called exactly 3 times as specified by the output states after the first 3 iterations.
