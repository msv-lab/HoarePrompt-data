Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Problem Description
We need to calculate the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

#### Given Code
The code consists of two functions:
1. `func_1()`: This function calculates the number of valid pairs for a single test case.
2. `func_2()`: This function iterates over multiple test cases and calls `func_1()` for each test case.

#### `func_1()` Function
```python
def func_1():
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        x += 1
    print(cnt)
```

#### Analysis of `func_1()`
1. **Initialization**: `x` starts from 1 and `cnt` is initialized to 0.
2. **Outer Loop**: The loop runs while \(x^2 \le n\). This ensures that \(x\) does not exceed \(\sqrt{n}\).
3. **Inner Loop**: For each \(x\), the inner loop runs while \((x + y) \cdot x \le n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \le m\). This ensures that both \(a\) and \(b\) stay within their respective bounds.
4. **GCD Check**: If \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), it checks whether \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\). This is done by comparing \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) with \(a + b\).
5. **Count Calculation**: The count is updated using `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))`. This part seems to be an attempt to count valid pairs but is incorrect because it does not properly check the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \mod (a + b) == 0\).

#### Issues in `func_1()`
1. **Incorrect Counting Logic**: The use of `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` is incorrect. It does not properly count the number of valid pairs.
2. **Condition Check**: The condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \mod (a + b) == 0\) is not checked correctly. The current logic does not ensure that this condition holds true.

#### Correct Approach
To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check the condition directly:
```python
def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    cnt = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (b * math.gcd(a, b)) % (a + b) == 0:
                cnt += 1
    print(cnt)
```

### Conclusion
The given `func_1()` function is incorrect because it does not properly count the number of valid pairs and does not check the condition correctly. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

#### Final Answer
Correctness: **False**
