Output State: **`n` is at least 9, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 12, `y` is 2, `x` is 3, and `cnt` is the sum of all valid `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` values where `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` and `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`, and `cnt` has been incremented by `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` if `math.gcd(x, y) == 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `y` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state and the condition provided.
