Output State: **`n` must be less than 15, `m` must be less than 10, `y` is 4, `x` is 4, and `cnt` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The variable `x` was originally 3 and is incremented by 1, making `x` equal to 4. The values of `n`, `m`, `y`, and `cnt` remain unchanged as per the initial state and the given conditions.
