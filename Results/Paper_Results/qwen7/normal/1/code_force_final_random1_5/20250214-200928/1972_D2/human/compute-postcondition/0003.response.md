Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State
- `t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive.

### Loop Statement
```
for _ in range(t):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
- The loop variable `_` is used, which typically means it is not being used within the loop body (hence the underscore).
- The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the initial value of the variable `t`.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs as long as `t` is greater than 0.
   - After each iteration, `t` is decremented by 1.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive.

3. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0.
   - After the current iteration, `t` is decremented by 1.

### Updated State
- Since `t` is decremented by 1 after each iteration, if `t` was initially some value \( k \) (where \( 1 \leq k \leq 10^4 \)), then at the end of the previous iteration, `t` would be \( k - 1 \).
- For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0, so `t` must be at least 1.

### Final State
- Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `t` should be 1 (the smallest possible value for `t` to ensure the loop continues).

### Answer
State: **`t` is 1**
