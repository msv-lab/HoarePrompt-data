Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the solution for the given problem. It iterates through possible values of \(x\) and \(y\) and checks the conditions specified in the problem statement. The function `func_1` calculates the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for a single test case, and `func_2` handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each one. The logic within `func_1` ensures that the conditions \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) being a multiple of \(a + b\) are checked appropriately. Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the provided solution appears to handle all potential cases correctly without missing any edge cases.
