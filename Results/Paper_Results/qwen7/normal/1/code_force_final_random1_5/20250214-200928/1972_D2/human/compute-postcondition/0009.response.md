Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes values for t, n, and m where t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, and for each test case, n and m are integers between 1 and 2â‹…10^6 inclusive. It does not return any value directly but implies processing or performing operations based on these values.**

This means the function `func_2` is designed to handle multiple test cases (t times), where each test case involves two integers n and m. The function processes these values without returning anything directly, suggesting it might perform some operations or calculations based on these inputs.
