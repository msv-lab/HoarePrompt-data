Output State: `n` is at least 9, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 12, `y` is greater than 4, `x` is 2, and `cnt` is the sum of all valid `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` values where `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` and `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`.

To break it down further:
- The loop continues as long as the conditions `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` are met.
- For each valid `(x, y)` pair where `math.gcd(x, y) == 1`, the value of `cnt` is incremented by `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))`.
- Since `x` remains fixed at 2, `y` starts from 2 and increments by 1 with each iteration until the loop's conditions are no longer satisfied.
- The final value of `cnt` will be the cumulative sum of all such minimum values calculated for each valid `(x, y)` pair during the entire execution of the loop.
