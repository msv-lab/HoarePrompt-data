Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 1, `a[2]` is `a[1] + x[1]`, `a[3]` is `a[2] + x[2]`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `a[3]` to be the sum of `a[2]` and `x[2]`. Given that `a[2]` is initially `a[1] + x[1]`, we can express `a[3]` as `(a[1] + x[1]) + x[2]`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
