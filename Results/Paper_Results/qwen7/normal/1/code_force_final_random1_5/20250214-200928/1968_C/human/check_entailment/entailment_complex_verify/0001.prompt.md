You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = [0] * n
        a[0] = 1000
        for i in range(1, n):
            a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]
        print(*a)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, and x is a list of n-1 integers such that 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500 for all 2 ≤ i ≤ n.

        print(*a)
        
    #State: `i` is `n`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of length `n` where the first element is 1000, and each subsequent element is the sum of the previous element and the corresponding element from the list `x` (i.e., `a[i] = 1000 + sum(x[:i])`), `x` is a list of integers entered by the user.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \) (2 ≤ n ≤ 500) and a list \( x \) of \( n-1 \) integers (1 ≤ \( x_i \) ≤ 500 for all 2 ≤ i ≤ n). For each test case, it calculates a list \( a \) of length \( n \) where the first element is 1000, and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of the previous element and the corresponding element from the list \( x \). The function then prints the elements of the list \( a \) for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and the list `x` of length `n-1`.

2. **Array Initialization:**
   - An array `a` of size `n` is initialized with zeros.
   - The first element `a[0]` is set to `1000`.

3. **Filling the Array:**
   - For each subsequent element `a[i]` (where `i` ranges from 1 to `n-1`), the value is calculated as `a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the array `a`.

### Checking the Correctness

To verify the correctness, we need to ensure that the constructed array `a` satisfies the condition \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \) for all \( 2 \leq i \leq n \).

#### Example Verification

Given the example in the problem statement:
- Test Case 1: \( n = 4 \), \( x = [2, 4, 1] \)
  - The constructed array `a` should be checked:
    - \( a[0] = 1000 \)
    - \( a[1] = 1000 + 2 = 1002 \)
    - \( a[2] = 1002 + 4 = 1006 \)
    - \( a[3] = 1006 + 1 = 1007 \)

  - Verify the conditions:
    - \( 1002 \bmod 1000 = 2 \)
    - \( 1006 \bmod 1002 = 4 \)
    - \( 1007 \bmod 1006 = 1 \)

  All conditions are satisfied.

#### General Verification

For general \( x_i \):
- The construction ensures that \( a_i = a_{i-1} + x_{i-1} \).
- By definition, \( a_i \bmod a_{i-1} = x_{i-1} \).

Thus, the constructed array `a` will always satisfy the required condition \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \).

### Conclusion

The given program correctly constructs an array `a` that satisfies the given conditions for all test cases.

**Correctness:** **True**
