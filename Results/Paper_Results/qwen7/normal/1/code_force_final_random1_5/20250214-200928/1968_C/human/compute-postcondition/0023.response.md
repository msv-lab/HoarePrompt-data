Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` must be greater than 1
   - `a[2]` is `a[1] + x[1]`

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 3.
   - The condition `n > 1` remains unchanged because it is a requirement for the loop to start, not something that changes within the loop itself.
   - The value of `a[2]` does not change because it is outside the scope of the loop.

5. **Final state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` is 3
   - `n` must be greater than 1 (unchanged)
   - `a[2]` remains `a[1] + x[1]` (unchanged)

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 1, `a[2]` is `a[1] + x[1]`**
