Output State: `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `n`, `a[i]` is `a[i-1] + x[i-1]` for all `i` from 1 to `n-1`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be equal to `n`, meaning the loop has completed all its iterations. The list `a` will have been updated such that each element `a[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n-1`) is the cumulative sum of the first `i` elements of the list `x`, starting from `a[0] = 1000`.
