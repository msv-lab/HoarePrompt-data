Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of length `n` where the first element is 1000, and each subsequent element is the sum of the previous element and the corresponding element from the list `x` (i.e., `a[i] = 1000 + sum(x[:i])`), `x` is a list of integers entered by the user.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`. The list `a` will start with 1000 and each subsequent element will be the cumulative sum of the first element (1000) and all the elements in `x` up to that point. The list `x` remains unchanged as it is provided as input to the loop.
