Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` zeros with the first element being 1000, `x` is a list of integers obtained from input.**

Explanation: The code `a[0] = 1000` changes the value of the first element in the list `a` to 1000. All other elements remain as zeros since no other elements are modified. The values of `i`, `n`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states.
