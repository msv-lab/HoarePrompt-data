Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` must be greater than 2
   - `a[2]` is `a[1] + x[1]`

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented to 3.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than 3 (since `i` was 2 and now it is 3).

5. **Update the state**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 3.
   - `n` must be greater than 3.

Therefore, the updated state for the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3**
