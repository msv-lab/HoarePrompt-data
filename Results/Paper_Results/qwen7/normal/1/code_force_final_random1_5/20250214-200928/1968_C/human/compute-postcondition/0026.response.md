Output State: `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list where each element `a[i]` (for `i` from 0 to `n-1`) is calculated as `a[0] + sum(x[0] to x[i-1])`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, meaning the loop has run for every index from 1 to `n-1`. The list `a` will have been updated such that each element `a[i]` (starting from index 0) is the cumulative sum of the first `i+1` elements of the list `x`, starting from `x[0]`.
