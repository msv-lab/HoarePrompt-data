Output State: **`i` is `n+1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is now a list of length `n` filled with zeros, `x` is a list of integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `a = [0] * n` creates a new list `a` of length `n` and fills it with `n` zeros. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state, and `x` remains as a list of integers entered by the user.
