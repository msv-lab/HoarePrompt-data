Output State: **`i` is in the range 1 to n-1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros except for the first element which is 1000, `x` is a list of integers entered by the user, `a[i]` is `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`**.

This means that the value of `a[i]` is updated to be the sum of `a[i - 1]` and the corresponding value from the list `x`. All other variables remain in their initial state, with `i` still within its original range, `n` unchanged, `a` starting with 1000 at index 0 and zeros elsewhere, and `x` containing the user-entered integers.
