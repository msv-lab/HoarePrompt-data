Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is equal to `n`, where `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a list of length `n` where:
     - The first element (`a[0]`) is 1000.
     - Each subsequent element (`a[i]` for `i > 0`) is the sum of 1000 and the sum of all elements from the beginning of the list `x` up to the `(i-1)`-th element.

2. **List `a`:**
   - `a[0] = 1000`
   - For `i > 0`, `a[i] = 1000 + sum(x[:i])`

3. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(*a)
   ```

Given this information, let's construct the list `a`:

- Suppose `n = 5` and the list `x` is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

- `a[0] = 1000` (by definition).

- For `i = 1`:
  - `a[1] = 1000 + sum(x[:1]) = 1000 + 1 = 1001`

- For `i = 2`:
  - `a[2] = 1000 + sum(x[:2]) = 1000 + (1 + 2) = 1003`

- For `i = 3`:
  - `a[3] = 1000 + sum(x[:3]) = 1000 + (1 + 2 + 3) = 1006`

- For `i = 4`:
  - `a[4] = 1000 + sum(x[:4]) = 1000 + (1 + 2 + 3 + 4) = 1010`

So, the list `a` would be `[1000, 1001, 1003, 1006, 1010]`.

Therefore, when the `print(*a)` statement is executed, it will print the elements of the list `a` separated by spaces.

Output: **1000 1001 1003 1006 1010**
