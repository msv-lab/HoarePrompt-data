Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `n` is given as an input integer.
   - `i` is not explicitly defined in the initial state but will be initialized within the loop.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will run from `i = 1` to `i < n`. This means `i` starts at 1 and increments until it reaches `n-1`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `i` starts at 1, we need to ensure that `i` is set to 1.
   - The value of `n` must be such that the loop can execute, meaning `n` must be greater than 1 (since `i` starts at 1).

5. **Consider other variables**:
   - `x` is a list of integers and `a` is a list of `n` zeros with the first element being 1000. These variables are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
