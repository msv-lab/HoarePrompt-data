Output State: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 2, `n` is the integer value of the first input, `m` is the integer value of the second input and must be at least 2, `count` will be `m + 1`, `ans` will be `n + int((int(n / 2) - (m - 1)) / 2) + 1 + int((int(n / 3) - (m - 1) - 1) / 3) + 1 + int((int(n / 4) - (m - 1) - 2) / 4) + 1 + ... + int((int(n / (m + 1)) - (m - 1) - int(count - 2)) / (count - 1)) + 1`, `countmins` will be `int(count - 1)`.

This output state describes the final values of the variables after the loop has completed all its iterations. The `count` variable will be incremented to `m + 1` because the loop continues until `count` is less than or equal to `m`. The `ans` variable accumulates the sum based on the logic inside the loop, where `g` is updated and added to `ans` each iteration.
