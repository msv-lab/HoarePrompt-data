Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - `count` is initialized to 2.
   - `ans` is initialized to `n`. This seems to be an attempt to count valid pairs, but it might not be correct for all cases.

3. **Loop through possible values of `b`:**
   - The loop runs from `count = 2` to `count <= m`.
   - `countmins` is set to `count - 1`.
   - `g` is calculated as `int(n / count)`.
   - If `g` is less than `countmins`, the loop breaks.
   - Otherwise, `g` is adjusted by subtracting `countmins`.
   - `ans` is updated by adding `int(g / count) + 1` to itself.

4. **Output:**
   - The final value of `ans` is printed for each test case.

### Correctness Analysis

#### Problem Understanding
The problem requires counting the number of ordered pairs `(a, b)` such that:
- \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
- \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Given Code Implementation
- The code attempts to iterate over possible values of `b` and update `ans` based on some calculations.
- However, the logic inside the loop does not correctly implement the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Example Verification
Let's verify with the example provided:

- For the input `(10, 8)`, the expected output is `14`.

#### Debugging and Correct Implementation
The given code does not correctly handle the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). A more accurate approach would involve iterating over all possible pairs `(a, b)` and checking the condition directly.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the given code does not correctly solve the problem as stated. It does not properly check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

**Correctness: **False**
