Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 1, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` must be at least 2, `count` is 2, `ans` is `n`, `countmins` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Given the initial conditions and the fact that no variables are reassigned or modified by the `break` statement, all the variables retain their initial conditions except for indicating that we have broken out of the loop.
