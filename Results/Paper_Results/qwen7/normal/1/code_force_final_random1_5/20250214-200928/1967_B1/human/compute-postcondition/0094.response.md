Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 3, `n` is the integer value of the first input, `m` is the integer value of the second input and must be at least 2, `count` must be less than or equal to `m`, `ans` is `n + int(g / count) + 1 + int(g / count) + 1`, `countmins` is `int(count - 1)`, `g` is `int(n / count) - int(count - 1)`**.

Explanation: The line `ans += int(g / count) + 1` adds `int(g / count) + 1` to the current value of `ans`. Since `g` and `count` are defined as `int(n / count) - int(count - 1)` and `int(count - 1)` respectively, `ans` now includes this additional value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
