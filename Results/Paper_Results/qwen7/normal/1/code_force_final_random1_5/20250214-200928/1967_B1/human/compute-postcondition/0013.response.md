Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 1, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` must be at least 2, `count` is 2, `ans` is `n`, `countmins` is 1, `g` is 1.**

Explanation: The variable `g` is decremented by `countmins`, which is 1. Since `g` was initially unspecified but known to be greater than `countmins` (which is 1), after decrementing by 1, `g` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
