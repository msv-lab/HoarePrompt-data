Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 1, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` must be at least 2, `count` is 2, `ans` is `n`, `countmins` is 1**

Explanation: The code `countmins = int(count - 1)` calculates `countmins` as the integer value of `count - 1`. Given that `count` is initially 2, `countmins` is set to 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
