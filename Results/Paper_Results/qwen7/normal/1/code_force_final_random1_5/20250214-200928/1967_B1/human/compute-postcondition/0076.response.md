Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 3, `n` is the integer value of the first input, `m` is the integer value of the second input and must be at least 2, `count` is 2, `ans` is `n`, `countmins` is 1 and `n, m = map(int, input().split())` has been executed.**

Explanation: The line `ans = n` simply assigns the value of `n` to `ans`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. The precondition remains unchanged except for the assignment of `ans` to `n`.
