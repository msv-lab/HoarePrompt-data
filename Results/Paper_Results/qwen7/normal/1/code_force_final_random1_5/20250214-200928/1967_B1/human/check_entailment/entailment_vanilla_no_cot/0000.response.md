Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Let's analyze why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Valid Pairs**:
   - The program attempts to calculate the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) using a loop and some arithmetic operations, but it does not correctly follow the problem's constraints.
   - Specifically, the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is not properly handled.

2. **Incorrect Increment Logic**:
   - The increment logic inside the `while` loop is flawed. It does not correctly account for the gcd condition and the multiple condition.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled Properly**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases or boundary conditions effectively, which could lead to incorrect results.

### Correct Solution Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, we need to iterate through all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) within the given ranges and check if they satisfy the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
from math import gcd

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        print(count_valid_pairs(n, m))

func()
```

This solution iterates through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checks the condition directly, ensuring correctness.
