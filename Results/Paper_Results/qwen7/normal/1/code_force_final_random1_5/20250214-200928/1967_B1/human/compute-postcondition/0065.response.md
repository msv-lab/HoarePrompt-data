Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 2, `n` is the integer value of the first input, `m` is the integer value of the second input and must be at least 2, `count` is unchanged, `ans` is calculated based on `n`, `m`, `count`, and `g`, `countmins` is now `int(count - 1)`, `g` is equal to `int(n / count)` - (m - 1), if `g` is less than `countmins`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
