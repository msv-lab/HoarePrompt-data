Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is equal to `t`, `n` is the integer value of the first input, `m` is the integer value of the second input, `count` is `m + 1`, `ans` is the sum of `n` plus the result of `int(g / count) + 1` added `m` times, `countmins` is `int(m)`, `g` is `int(n / (m + 1)) - 1`**.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations:
- The variable `t` remains greater than 0 as it was not affected by the loop.
- The variable `i` will be equal to `t` because the loop runs from `0` to `t-1`, so after all iterations, `i` will be `t-1`.
- The variable `n` remains the same as it was an input and not modified by the loop.
- The variable `m` remains the same as it was an input and not modified by the loop.
- The variable `count` will be `m + 1` because the loop continues until `count` is less than or equal to `m`, and since the loop runs from `2` to `m+1`, `count` will be `m + 1`.
- The variable `ans` will be the initial value of `n` plus the sum of `int(g / count) + 1` for each iteration from `3` to `m + 1`.
- The variable `countmins` will be `m` because it is calculated as `count - 1` and `count` is now `m + 1`.
- The variable `g` will be `int(n / (m + 1)) - 1` because it is recalculated at the start of each iteration with the new value of `count`, and when `count` reaches `m + 1`, `g` will be `int(n / (m + 1)) - 1`.
