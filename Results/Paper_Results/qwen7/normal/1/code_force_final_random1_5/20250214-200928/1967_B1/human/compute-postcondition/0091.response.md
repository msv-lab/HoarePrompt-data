Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 3, `n` is the integer value of the first input, `m` is the integer value of the second input and must be at least 2, `count` must be less than or equal to `m`, `ans` is `n + int(g / count) + 1`, `countmins` is `int(count - 1)`, `g` is `int(n / count)`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it does not affect the values of any variables but simply exits the loop or conditional block. Therefore, the values of all variables remain unchanged.
