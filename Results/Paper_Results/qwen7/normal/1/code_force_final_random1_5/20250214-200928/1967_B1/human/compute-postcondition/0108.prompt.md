Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer, and it is within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    count = 2
    ans = n
    while count <= m:
        countmins = int(count - 1)
        g = int(n / count)
        if g < countmins:
            break
        g -= countmins
        ans += int(g / count) + 1
        count += 1
    print(int(ans))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 1, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` must be at least 3, `count` is `m + 1`, `ans` is `n` plus the sum of `int(g / count) + 1` for each iteration, `countmins` is `m`, `g` is `int(n / (m + 1)) - m`.

To explain this output state in simpler terms:
- The variable `t` remains greater than 0 and `i` remains 1 as they were not affected by the loop.
- `n` remains the same as it was an input and not modified by the loop.
- `m` must be at least 3 because the loop runs until `count` is less than or equal to `m`. Since the loop executed 3 times initially, `m` must be at least 2, and after 3 iterations, `count` would be `m + 1`, meaning `m` must be at least 3.
- `count` is now `m + 1` because the loop increments `count` by 1 each time it runs.
- `ans` is updated by adding `int(g / count) + 1` for each iteration of the loop. After 3 iterations, `ans` would be `n + (int(g / 2) + 1) + (int(g / 3) + 1) + ... + (int(g / (m + 1)) + 1)`.
- `countmins` is `m` because it is calculated as `count - 1` and `count` is now `m + 1`.
- `g` is `int(n / (m + 1)) - m` because it is recalculated at the start of each iteration with the new value of `count`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 2, `n` is the integer value of the first input, `m` is the integer value of the second input and must be at least 2, `count` will be `m + 1`, `ans` will be `n + int((int(n / 2) - (m - 1)) / 2) + 1 + int((int(n / 3) - (m - 1) - 1) / 3) + 1 + int((int(n / 4) - (m - 1) - 2) / 4) + 1 + ... + int((int(n / (m + 1)) - (m - 1) - int(count - 2)) / (count - 1)) + 1`, `countmins` will be `int(count - 1)`.

This output state describes the final values of the variables after the loop has completed all its iterations. The `count` variable will be incremented to `m + 1` because the loop continues until `count` is less than or equal to `m`. The `ans` variable accumulates the sum based on the logic inside the loop, where `g` is updated and added to `ans` each iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 3, `n` is the integer value of the first input, `m` is the integer value of the second input and must be at least 2, `count` is `m + 1`, `ans` is the sum of `n` plus the result of `int(g / count) + 1` added `m` times, `countmins` is `int(m)`, `g` is `int(n / (m + 1)) - 1`.

This means after the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `count` will be equal to `m + 1`. The variable `ans` will be updated to the initial value of `n` plus the sum of `int(g / count) + 1` for each iteration from 3 to `m + 1`. The variable `countmins` will be set to `m`, and `g` will be calculated as `int(n / (m + 1)) - 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
