Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 2, `n` is the integer value of the first input, `m` is the integer value of the second input, `count` is `m + 1`, `ans` is `n` plus the sum of `int(g / count) + 1` for each iteration, `countmins` is `m`, `g` is `int(n / (m + 1)) - m`.**

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two inputs, splits them, and converts them to integers. These values are assigned to `n` and `m` respectively. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `count`, `ans`, `countmins`, and `g`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
