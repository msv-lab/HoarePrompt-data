Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 1, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input**

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and converts them to integers, assigning the first integer to `n` and the second integer to `m`. The initial conditions for `t` and `i` remain unchanged.
