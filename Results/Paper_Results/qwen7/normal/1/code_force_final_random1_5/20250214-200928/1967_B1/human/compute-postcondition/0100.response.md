Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 3, `n` is the integer value of the first input, `m` is the integer value of the second input and must be at least 2, `count` is `count + 1`, `ans` is `n + int(g / count) + 1 + int(g / count) + 1`, `countmins` is `count - 1`, `g` is `int(n / (count + 1))`, and if `g` is less than `count - 1`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
