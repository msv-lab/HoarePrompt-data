Let's analyze the given `while` loop and the conditions under which it can execute the first time.

The `while` loop condition is:
```python
while count <= m:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

To determine which states need to be adjusted, we need to check the variables involved in the loop condition: `count` and `m`.

- The current state of `count` is 2.
- The current state of `m` is the integer value of the second input.

For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `count <= m` must be true. Since `count` is currently 2, `m` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute the first time.

Given that `m` is the integer value of the second input, there is no way to directly adjust `m` in the state description. However, we can ensure that `m` is at least 2 by stating this requirement.

Therefore, the state right before the loop should be adjusted to ensure that `m` is at least 2.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 2, `n` is the integer value of the first input, `m` is the integer value of the second input and must be at least 2, `count` is 2, `ans` is `n`, `countmins` is `m`, `g` is `int(n / (m + 1)) - m`**
