Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 2, `n` is the integer value of the first input, `m` is the integer value of the second input and must be at least 2, `count` must be less than or equal to `m`, `ans` is `n + int((int(n / 2) - (m - 1)) / 2) + 1`, `countmins` is `m - 1`, `countmins` is now `int(count - 1)`, `g` is `int(n / count)`**.

This means that the variable `g` has been assigned the value of `int(n / count)`. All other variables retain their previous states as described in the initial state.
