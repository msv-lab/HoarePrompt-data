Output State: **`a` is a list with one element `test`, `ai` is `test`, `next_year` is `current_year + test`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `current_year + ai` to `next_year`. Since `ai` is the first element of `a`, which is `test`, `next_year` is calculated as `current_year + test`. The values of `a`, `ai`, and `current_year` remain unchanged from the initial state.
