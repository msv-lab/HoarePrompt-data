Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `year` is the sum of `year` incremented by `year % ai or ai` for each element `ai` in the list `a`, `t` is decremented by 1, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. The values of `a`, `year`, and `t` remain unchanged from their initial states.
