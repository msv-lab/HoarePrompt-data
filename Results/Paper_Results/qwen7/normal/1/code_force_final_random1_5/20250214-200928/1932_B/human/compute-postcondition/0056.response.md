Output State: **`current_year` is the last computed `next_year` after processing all elements in `a`; `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\); `n` is the second element of `test_cases`; `a` is a list with one element which is `test`; `ai` is undefined.**

Explanation: The code snippet appends the final value of `current_year` to the `results` list after processing all elements in the list `a`. Since `a` contains only one element `test`, the loop will process `test` once, updating `current_year` to the final computed value of `next_year`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, and `ai`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
