Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `current_year` is equal to `next_year`.
- `next_year` is calculated as follows:
  - If `current_year % ai != 0`, then `next_year = (current_year // ai + 1) * ai`.
  - If `current_year % ai == 0`, then `next_year = next_year + test`.
- `ai` is equal to `test`.
- `test_cases` is unchanged.

### Loop Head
The loop head is defined by the variable `ai` in the `for` loop:
```python
for ai in a:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Adjusting the States
We need to determine how the states change as the loop progresses. Specifically, we need to adjust the states of the objects involved in the loop head (`ai`).

1. **Initial Values:**
   - `current_year` is equal to `next_year`.
   - `ai` is equal to `test`.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over each value of `ai` in the sequence `a`.
   - For each iteration, `ai` takes on the next value from the sequence `a`.

3. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since `ai` is the only variable in the loop head, we need to update its value for the next iteration.
   - `test_cases` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.

### Updated State
After the loop iterates once, `ai` will take on the next value from the sequence `a`. Therefore, the updated state should reflect this change.

### Final Answer
State: **`current_year` is equal to `next_year`, `next_year` is calculated based on the new value of `ai`, `ai` is the next value in the sequence `a`, `test_cases` is unchanged.**

Since the exact values of `current_year`, `next_year`, and `ai` depend on the specific sequence `a`, we can represent the updated state as:

State: **`current_year` is equal to `next_year`, `next_year` is calculated based on the new value of `ai`, `ai` is the next value in the sequence `a`, `test_cases` is unchanged.**

If we denote the next value of `ai` as `ai_next`, the final state would be:

State: **`current_year` is equal to `next_year`, `next_year` is calculated based on `ai_next`, `ai` is `ai_next`, `test_cases` is unchanged.**
