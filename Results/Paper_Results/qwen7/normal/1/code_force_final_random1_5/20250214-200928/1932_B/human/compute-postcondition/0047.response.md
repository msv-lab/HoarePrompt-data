Output State: **`current_year` is equal to `next_year`, `next_year` is \((current_year // ai + 1) * ai\) if `current_year % ai != 0`, or `next_year + test` if `current_year % ai == 0`, `ai` is `test`, `test_cases` is unchanged.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the value of `next_year` to `current_year`. The condition for `next_year` is either `next_year + test` if `current_year % ai == 0`, or `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai` otherwise. Since `ai` is equal to `test`, these conditions remain unchanged. The value of `test_cases` remains unchanged as no operation was performed on it.
