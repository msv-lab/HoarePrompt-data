Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop is iterating over the list `a`, and the loop variable is `ai`. Therefore, the objects in the loop head are `ai` and `a`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `year` is 0.
   - `t` is decremented by 1 (this is not relevant to the loop).
   - `n` is an input integer (this is not relevant to the loop).
   - `a` is a list of integers input by the user.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will iterate as long as there are elements in the list `a`. Each iteration assigns the next element of the list `a` to the variable `ai`.

4. **Adjust the state for the loop to execute**:
   - Since the loop iterates over the list `a`, the list `a` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute at least once.
   - The variable `ai` will take the value of each element in the list `a` during each iteration, starting from the first element.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is that the list `a` must have at least one element.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`year` is 0, `t` is decremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least one element**
