Output State: **The program returns a list `results` containing the final value of `current_year` for each test case in `test_cases` after processing all elements in `a`.**

This means that the code `return results` simply returns the list `results` which contains the final value of `current_year` for each test case processed. The exact values within `results` depend on the values of `test_cases` and `a`, but the code does not specify these values further, so we can only describe the structure and content of `results` as stated.
