The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t` and a string `s` of lowercase Latin letters. For each test case, it counts the occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in `s`, sums these counts, and prints the result. After processing all test cases, the variable `t` becomes non-positive, indicating the end of iterations.
