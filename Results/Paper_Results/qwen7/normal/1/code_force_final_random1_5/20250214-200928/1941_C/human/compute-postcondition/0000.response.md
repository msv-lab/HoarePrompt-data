Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `int(input())` returns a non-zero value. Since `_` is a throwaway variable, the actual value returned by `int(input())` determines whether the loop continues.

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**: We need to ensure that `int(input())` returns a non-zero value for the loop to execute. Given the state before the loop starts, we know that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This means that `t` itself can be used to determine if the loop should execute because `int(input())` will return `t`.

4. **Adjust the state**: Since `t` is the value that will be read from input, we need to ensure that `t` is within the specified range and is a valid input for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t`, ensuring it is within the given range.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
