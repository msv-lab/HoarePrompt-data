Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head**: The loop head is defined by the `for _ in range(int(input())):` statement. This means that the loop will run for as many times as the user inputs an integer.

2. **Determine the variables involved in the loop head**: The only variable directly involved in the loop head is the integer input from the user, which is used to determine the number of iterations.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `a` is an input integer.
   - `s` is an input string.
   - `x` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in `s`.
   - `y` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, the user needs to input another integer. Therefore, the state needs to be updated to reflect this new input.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `t` will now be the new input integer.
   - `a` remains unchanged.
   - `s` remains unchanged.
   - `x` remains unchanged.
   - `y` remains unchanged.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` is the new input integer, `a` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `x` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in `s`, `y` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`**.
