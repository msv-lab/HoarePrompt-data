Output State: **`t` is the new input integer, `a` is an input integer from the second input, `s` is an input string, `x` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in `s`, `y` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`.**

The code `a = int(input())` assigns the value of the second input (converted to an integer) to the variable `a`. The values of `t`, `s`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged from their initial state.
