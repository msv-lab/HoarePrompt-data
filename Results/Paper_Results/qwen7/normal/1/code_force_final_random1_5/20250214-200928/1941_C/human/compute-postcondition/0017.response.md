Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is the new input integer minus 1.
- `a` is an input integer from the second input.
- `s` is updated to the new input string.
- `x` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in `s`.
- `y` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`.
- `a` is an input integer from the current input.
- `s` is updated to the new input string.
- `y` is the count of 'pie' in the new string `s`.

From the initial state, we know that after updating `s` to the new input string, `y` is the count of 'pie' in this new string `s`. Since `x` was already calculated as the number of occurrences of 'map' in the previous version of `s`, it remains unchanged.

Therefore, the expression `x + y` will add the number of occurrences of 'map' in the new string `s` with the number of occurrences of 'pie' in the same new string `s`.

Output: **x (number of occurrences of 'map') + y (number of occurrences of 'pie') in the new string s**
