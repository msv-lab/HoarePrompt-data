Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This value is not relevant to the print statement.
- `a` is an input integer. This value is not relevant to the print statement.
- `s` is an input string. The number of occurrences of 'map' in `s` is stored in `x`, and the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s` is stored in `y`.

The print statement is `print(x + y)`, which means it will print the sum of the number of occurrences of 'map' and 'pie' in the string `s`.

Therefore, the output will be the sum of the occurrences of 'map' and 'pie' in the string `s`.

Output: **x + y (where x is the number of occurrences of 'map' in s and y is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in s)**
