Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the function `func()` simply counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" in the string `s` and prints their sum. This approach is incorrect because:

1. It does not account for overlapping substrings.
2. It does not minimize the number of deletions required to remove both "map" and "pie".

To solve this problem correctly, we need to iterate through the string and remove the minimum number of characters such that neither "map" nor "pie" appears in the string. Here's a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        s = input()
        i = 0
        deletions = 0
        
        while i < len(s):
            if "map" in s[i:]:
                start = s[i:].find("map")
                end = start + 3
                deletions += end
                i += end
            elif "pie" in s[i:]:
                start = s[i:].find("pie")
                end = start + 3
                deletions += end
                i += end
            else:
                i += 1
        
        print(deletions)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This solution iterates through the string and finds the earliest occurrence of either "map" or "pie". It then calculates the number of characters to delete to remove these substrings and continues until the entire string is processed.
