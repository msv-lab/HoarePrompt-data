Output State: The loop has executed `t` times, where `t` is the initial positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each iteration, `a` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `x` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in `s`, and `y` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`. After all iterations, `x` and `y` are the cumulative counts of 'map' and 'pie' across all input strings respectively. The final values of `x` and `y` are the sums of their respective counts from all the input strings provided during the loop executions.
