Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle cases where the string contains both "pie" and "map" substrings. According to the problem description, the program should remove the minimum number of characters to make the string beautiful. However, the current implementation simply counts the occurrences of "map" and "pie" and prints their sum, which is not the correct approach.

For example, consider the string "mappie":
- The program would count "map" as 1 and "pie" as 1, resulting in a deletion count of 2.
- However, the optimal solution is to delete the 'p' in "mappie" to make it "miae", which is beautiful. Thus, only 1 character needs to be deleted.

This shows that the program does not correctly implement the requirement to minimize deletions to make the string beautiful.
