Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the `range(int(input()))` part. This means the loop will run based on the integer input provided.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is the new input integer (this is the number of iterations left).
   - `a` is an input integer from the second input.
   - `s` is updated to the new input string.
   - `x` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in `s`.
   - `y` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`.

3. **Understand the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `t` (the remaining number of iterations) is greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `t` is the number of iterations left, it should be decremented by 1 for the next iteration.
   - `a`, `s`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head conditions.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `t` will be `t - 1`.
   - `a`, `s`, `x`, and `y` remain the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**`t` is the new input integer minus 1, `a` is an input integer from the second input, `s` is updated to the new input string, `x` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in `s`, `y` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`.**

State: **`t` is the new input integer minus 1, `a` is an input integer from the second input, `s` is updated to the new input string, `x` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in `s`, `y` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`**
