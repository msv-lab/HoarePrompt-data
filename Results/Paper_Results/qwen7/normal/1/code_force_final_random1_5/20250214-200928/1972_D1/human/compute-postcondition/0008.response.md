Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases where each test case includes an integer `t` such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each `t`, two integers `n` and `m` such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6, with the sum of n or m over all test cases not exceeding 2⋅10^6. For each test case, the function returns a specific value based on the given conditions.**

This means the function `func_16` is designed to handle a series of test cases, each containing an integer `t` and pairs of integers `n` and `m`. The function processes these inputs according to specified conditions and returns a result for each test case.
