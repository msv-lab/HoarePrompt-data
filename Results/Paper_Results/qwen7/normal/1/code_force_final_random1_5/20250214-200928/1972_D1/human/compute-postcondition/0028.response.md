Functionality: **The function accepts a dictionary `d` where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, a list `processing` of zeros and ones with the same length as the number of elements in the lists of `d`, an integer key `da` present in the dictionary `d`, and a list `rank` of integers with the same length as the number of keys in the dictionary `d`. It returns 1 if the length of `d[da]` is 1, otherwise, it recursively processes each element in `d[da]` to find the minimum value of `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)` for each `di` in `d[da]`, updates `tmp` with this minimum value, marks the corresponding indices in `processing` as processed, and finally sets `rank[da - 1]` to `tmp + 1` before returning `rank[da - 1]`.**
