Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

    func_16()

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    return int(sys.stdin.buffer.readline())
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function reads an integer from standard input and returns it.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return map(int, sys.stdin.buffer.readline().split())
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function reads integers from the standard input buffer, splits them by spaces, and returns a map object containing these integers.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, sys.stdin.buffer.readline().split()))
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function reads two integers, `n` and `m`, from the standard input and returns them as a list. These integers are constrained such that `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6`.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4(rows_number):
    return [func_3() for _ in range(rows_number)]
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function accepts a positive integer `rows_number` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it calls `func_3()` with two positive integers `n` and `m` (where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6), collects the results into a list, and returns this list.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5():
    return sys.stdin.buffer.readline().rstrip()
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  The function reads an integer from the standard input buffer, which is guaranteed to be within the range of 1 to 10^4, and returns this integer.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6():
    return sys.stdin.buffer.readline().rstrip().decode()
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  The function reads a line of input from the standard input, removes any trailing whitespace, and decodes it from UTF-8 before returning it as a string. This process is performed without requiring any input parameters, and the returned string represents the cleaned input received.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7():
    return [int(i) for i in input().split()]
''' 

 Output hints for function7:  The function reads a space-separated list of integers from standard input, splits the input string into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and returns a list of these integers.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_8(rows):
    return [func_7() for _ in range(rows)]
''' 

 Output hints for function8:  The function `func_8` accepts a non-negative integer `rows` and returns a list of length `rows`. Each element in the list is the result of calling another function `func_7()` with an index ranging from 0 to `rows-1`.
Function number 9 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_9():
    return input()
''' 

 Output hints for function9:  The function accepts multiple test cases as input, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `m`, and returns the input provided by the user for each test case.
Function number 10 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_10():
    return int(input())
''' 

 Output hints for function10:  The function `func_10()` accepts no parameters and returns an integer value entered by the user.
Function number 11 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_11():
    return input().split()
''' 

 Output hints for function11:  The function accepts no parameters and returns a list of strings obtained from splitting an input string at whitespace boundaries.
Function number 12 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_12(d, processing, da, rank):
    tmp = 10 ** 9
    if len(d[da]) == 1:
        return 1
    for di in d[da]:
        if processing[di - 1] == 0:
            processing[di - 1] = 1
            tmp = min(tmp, func_12(d, processing, di, rank))
            processing[di - 1] = 0
    rank[da - 1] = tmp + 1
    return tmp + 1
''' 

 Output hints for function12:  The function accepts a dictionary `d` where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, a list `processing` of zeros and ones with the same length as the number of elements in the lists of `d`, an integer key `da` present in the dictionary `d`, and a list `rank` of integers with the same length as the number of keys in the dictionary `d`. It returns 1 if the length of `d[da]` is 1, otherwise, it recursively processes each element in `d[da]` to find the minimum value of `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)` for each `di` in `d[da]`, updates `tmp` with this minimum value, marks the corresponding indices in `processing` as processed, and finally sets `rank[da - 1]` to `tmp + 1` before returning `rank[da - 1]`.
Function number 13 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_13(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        x = 1
        y = 0
        return (x, y, a)
    (x, y, g) = func_13(b, a % b)
    return (y, x - a // b * y, g)
''' 

 Output hints for function13:  The function `func_13` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` (where \(1 \leq a, b \leq 2 \times 10^6\) and \(b \neq 0\)). Depending on the value of `b`, it either directly returns `(1, 0, a)` or recursively computes and returns values `y`, `x - a // b * y`, and `g`. The final state of the program after the function concludes is one of these two possible return tuples, ensuring that the returned values satisfy the properties of the Extended Euclidean Algorithm.
Function number 14 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_14(a, n, m, k):
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] < m:
            k -= m - a[i]
    if k >= 0:
        return 1
    return -1
''' 

 Output hints for function14:  The function `func_14` accepts a list of integers `a`, two non-negative integers `n` and `m`, and an integer `k`. It iterates through the first `n` elements of the list `a`, adjusting the value of `k` by subtracting `(m - a[i])` for each element `a[i]` that is less than `m`. After the loop, if `k` is greater than or equal to 0, the function returns 1; otherwise, it returns -1.
Function number 15 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        i += 1
    return ans - 1
''' 

 Output hints for function15:  The function calculates the sum of \((n + i) // (i * i)\) for all valid \(i\) values, where \(i\) starts from 1 and increments until \(i^2 > n + i\). After the loop, it returns this sum minus 1, where \(n\) and \(m\) are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^6\).
Function number 16 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_16():
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')
''' 

 Output hints for function16:  The function processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and two integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6). For each test case, it writes the value returned by `func_15()` (decreasing by 1 with each iteration) to the standard output, followed by a newline character, a total of `func_10()` times. After completing all iterations, the value of `t` remains unchanged within its initial range, and `func_15()` has been called `func_10()` times, each time returning a decreasing integer value.
