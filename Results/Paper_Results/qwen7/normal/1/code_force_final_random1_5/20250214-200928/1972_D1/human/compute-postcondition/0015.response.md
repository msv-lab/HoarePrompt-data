Functionality: **The function calculates the sum of \((n + i) // (i * i)\) for all valid \(i\) values, minus 1, where \(i\) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to \(\sqrt{n + 1}\) and the loop continues as long as \(i^2 \leq n + i\).**

This means the function `func_15` accepts no parameters but uses the variables `n` and `m` internally, which are not provided as arguments but are assumed from the context. It calculates the sum of the expression \((n + i) // (i * i)\) for all valid \(i\) starting from the smallest integer greater than or equal to \(\sqrt{n + 1}\) and continuing until \(i^2 \leq n + i\), then subtracts 1 from this sum before returning the result.
