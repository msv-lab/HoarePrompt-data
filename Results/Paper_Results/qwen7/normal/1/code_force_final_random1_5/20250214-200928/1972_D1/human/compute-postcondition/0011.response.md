Output State: **`i` is increased by 1; `ans` is increased by `(n + i) // (i * i)`; `n` must satisfy the condition `i^2 + i <= n`**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. The other variables (`ans` and `n`) are not directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, their conditions remain unchanged. The precondition that `n` must satisfy the condition `i^2 + i <= n` also remains valid after the execution of the code.
