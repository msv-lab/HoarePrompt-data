Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `_`: This is a placeholder variable used in the `for` loop, typically used when the loop variable itself is not needed within the loop body.
   - `func_10()`: This is the function call that determines the number of iterations.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `func_10()` returns a positive integer. Since `_` is just a placeholder, it does not affect the loop condition.

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `func_10()` returns a positive integer, indicating the number of iterations the loop will perform.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - The loop will execute one more time if `func_10()` still returns a positive integer.
   - Since `_` is just a placeholder, no changes are needed for this variable.
   - The value returned by `func_10()` will decrease by 1 because one iteration has already occurred.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated value of `func_10()`.

**State:**
- `t` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration (since it is not involved in the loop condition).
- `func_10()` will return a value that is one less than what it returned at the end of the previous iteration.

Since the exact value of `func_10()` is not specified, we can only say that it will return a positive integer that is one less than its previous value.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and `func_10()` returns a positive integer that is one less than its previous value**.
