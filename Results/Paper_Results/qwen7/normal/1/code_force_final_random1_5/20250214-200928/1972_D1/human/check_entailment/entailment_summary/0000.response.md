Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to verify that the functions collectively meet the problem requirements. Let's break down the problem and the provided functions:

1. **Problem Description**: We need to calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that:
   - \(1 \le a \le n\)
   - \(1 \le b \le m\)
   - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Key Functions**:
   - `func_15()`: This function calculates the sum of \((n + i) // (i * i)\) for all valid \(i\) values, where \(i\) starts from 1 and increments until \(i^2 > n + i\). This seems to be a helper function used in the main logic.
   - `func_16()`: This function processes multiple test cases. It reads the number of test cases `t` using `func_10()`, and for each test case, it calculates the required value using `func_15()` and prints it.

3. **Execution Summary**:
   - `func_10()`: Reads an integer from the standard input, which is the number of test cases.
   - `func_15()`: Calculates the number of valid pairs for a given \(n\) and \(m\).
   - `func_16()`: Processes multiple test cases and prints the results.

4. **Verification**:
   - `func_16()` correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - `func_15()` appears to be a helper function that might not directly solve the problem but is used in the solution.
   - The problem requires calculating the number of valid pairs for each test case, which is done by `func_15()`.

Given the problem constraints and the provided functions, `func_15()` should be the core function solving the problem. The structure of `func_16()` is correct as it processes each test case appropriately.

Since `func_15()` is responsible for calculating the number of valid pairs, and `func_16()` correctly handles the test cases, the overall program meets the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
