You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

It returns 1 if the length of `d[da]` is 1, otherwise, it recursively processes each element in `d[da]` to find the minimum value of `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)` for each `di` in `d[da]`, updates `tmp` with this minimum value, marks the corresponding indices in `processing` as processed, and finally sets `rank[da - 1]` to `tmp + 1` before returning `rank[da - 1]`.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_13` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` (where \(1 \leq a, b \leq 2 \times 10^6\) and \(b \neq 0\)). Depending on the value of `b`, it either directly returns `(1, 0, a)` or recursively computes and returns values `y`, `x - a // b * y`, and `g`. The final state of the program after the function concludes is one of these two possible return tuples, ensuring that the returned values satisfy the properties of the Extended Euclidean Algorithm.

The list `a` and the integer `n` will remain as they were after the last iteration of the loop, and `m` will also remain unchanged.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, `k` will have been decreased by the difference `(m - a[i])` for each element `a[i]` that is less than `m`, and the list `a` and the integer `n` will retain their state from the last iteration of the loop.

    return -1
    #The program returns -1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_14` accepts a list of integers `a`, two non-negative integers `n` and `m`, and an integer `k`. It iterates through the first `n` elements of the list `a`, adjusting the value of `k` by subtracting `(m - a[i])` for each element `a[i]` that is less than `m`. After the loop, if `k` is greater than or equal to 0, the function returns 1; otherwise, it returns -1.

#Function 15:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6.

    #
    #To break it down further:
    #- The loop continues as long as \(i^2 \leq n + i\).
    #- For each iteration, `ans` is incremented by \((n + i) // (i * i)\).
    #- The loop increments `i` by 1 after each iteration.
    #- Once \(i^2 > n + i\), the loop terminates.
    #- Therefore, the final value of `ans` is the sum of \((n + i) // (i * i)\) for all valid `i` values, and `i` will be the smallest integer satisfying \(i^2 > n + i\).
    return ans - 1
    #The program returns the sum of \((n + i) // (i * i)\) for all valid \(i\) values, minus 1, where \(i\) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to \(\sqrt{n + 1}\) and the loop continues as long as \(i^2 \leq n + i\).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates the sum of \((n + i) // (i * i)\) for all valid \(i\) values, where \(i\) starts from 1 and increments until \(i^2 > n + i\). After the loop, it returns this sum minus 1, where \(n\) and \(m\) are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^6\).

#Function 16:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6, and the sum of n or m over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^6.
def func_16():

    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `sys.stdout.write` has written the value of `func_15()` plus a newline character for each iteration from 1 to \(func_10() - 1\).
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will still be within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and `sys.stdout.write` will have been called `func_10()` times, each time writing the value returned by `func_15()` followed by a newline character. The value returned by `func_15()` decreases by 1 with each iteration, starting from some positive integer value down to 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and two integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6). For each test case, it writes the value returned by `func_15()` (decreasing by 1 with each iteration) to the standard output, followed by a newline character, a total of `func_10()` times. After completing all iterations, the value of `t` remains unchanged within its initial range, and `func_15()` has been called `func_10()` times, each time returning a decreasing integer value.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not implement the logic required to solve the given problem. The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). However, the provided functions do not contain any implementation that addresses this specific logic.

The functions defined in the program are mostly utility functions for reading input, and none of them implement the core logic needed to solve the problem. For instance, `func_15` attempts to solve a different problem and does not handle the conditions specified in the problem statement.

Since the program does not contain any implementation that correctly calculates the number of valid pairs according to the given conditions, it is incorrect.
