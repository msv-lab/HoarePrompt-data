You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6, and the sum of n or m over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^6.
def func_16():
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `sys.stdout.write` has written the value of `func_15()` plus a newline character for each iteration from 1 to \(func_10() - 1\).
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will still be within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and `sys.stdout.write` will have been called `func_10()` times, each time writing the value returned by `func_15()` followed by a newline character. The value returned by `func_15()` decreases by 1 with each iteration, starting from some positive integer value down to 1.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases where each test case includes an integer `t` such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each `t`, two integers `n` and `m` such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6, with the sum of n or m over all test cases not exceeding 2⋅10^6. For each test case, the function returns a specific value based on the given conditions.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
