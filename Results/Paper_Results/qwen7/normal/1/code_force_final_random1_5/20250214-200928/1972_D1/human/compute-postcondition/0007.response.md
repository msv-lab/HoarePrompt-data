Output State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `sys.stdout.write` has written the value of `func_15()` plus a newline character for each iteration from 1 to \(func_10() - 1\).

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will still be within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and `sys.stdout.write` will have been called `func_10()` times, each time writing the value returned by `func_15()` followed by a newline character. The value returned by `func_15()` decreases by 1 with each iteration, starting from some positive integer value down to 1.
