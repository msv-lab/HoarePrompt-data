Output State: `ans` is the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for all `i` from 1 until `i * i > n + i`, `i` is the last value it takes which is greater than `sqrt(n + i)`, and `n` must be non-negative.

This means that `ans` will contain the cumulative sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for each `i` starting from 1 up to the point where `i * i` exceeds `n + i`. The variable `i` will be set to the smallest integer such that `i * i > n + i`. The value of `n` must be non-negative for the loop to execute as intended.
