Output State: **`i` is 200003, `j` is "2", `pd[i]` is 200007**

Explanation: The value of `pd[i]` is incremented by the integer value of `j`. Since `j` is a string "2", `int(j)` converts it to the integer 2. Initially, `pd[i]` is 200005. After adding 2 to 200005, `pd[i]` becomes 200007. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged.
