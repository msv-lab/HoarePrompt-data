Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for j in str(i):`. This means the loop variable `j` is derived from converting `i` to a string.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `i` is 200002
   - `j` is "2"
   - `pd[i]` is `int(j)`, which is 2

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are characters left in the string representation of `i`.

4. **Calculate the next value of `j`**: Since `j` is derived from converting `i` to a string, the next value of `j` will be the next character in the string representation of `i`.

5. **Update the state**: 
   - `i` remains the same because it is not modified within the loop body.
   - `j` will be the next character in the string representation of `i`.
   - `pd[i]` will be updated to the integer value of the next character in the string representation of `i`.

Given that `i` is currently 200002 and `j` is "2", the next character in the string representation of `i` (which is "200002") is "0".

So, the updated state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `i` is still 200002
- `j` will be "0"
- `pd[i]` will be `int("0")`, which is 0

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is 200002, `j` is "0", `pd[i]` is 0**
