Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for j in str(i):`. This means the loop variable `j` is derived from the string representation of `i`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 200003
   - `j` is "2"
   - `pd[i]` is 200007

3. **Determine the Next Value of `j`**:
   - The loop iterates over each character in the string representation of `i`.
   - In the previous iteration, `j` was "2".
   - The next character in the string representation of `i` (which is "200003") after "2" is "0".

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - The value of `i` remains unchanged because the loop variable `j` is derived from `i` and does not affect `i` directly.
   - The value of `j` changes to "0".
   - The value of `pd[i]` remains unchanged because it is not affected by the loop.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

State: **`i` is 200003, `j` is "0", `pd[i]` is 200007**
