Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `t` (which is used as the range parameter) and the loop counter `_` (which is typically an underscore indicating that the loop variable itself is not used within the loop body).

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0. This is because the loop runs `t` times.

3. **Adjust the States**: At the end of the previous iteration, `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to continue. Since `t` is the only variable in the loop head that affects the loop's continuation, we need to ensure that `t` is decremented by 1 but still remains greater than 0.

Given the initial condition that `t` must be greater than 0, after one iteration, `t` will be `t - 1`. Therefore, `t` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute one more time.

**Final State**:
- `t` must be greater than 1 (since it was greater than 0 before and is now decremented by 1).

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` must be greater than 1**
