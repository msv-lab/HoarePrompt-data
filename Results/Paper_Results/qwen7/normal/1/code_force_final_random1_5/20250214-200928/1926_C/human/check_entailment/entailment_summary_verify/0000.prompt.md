You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Please note that the time limit for this problem is only 0.5 seconds per test.

Vladislav wrote the integers from 1 to n , inclusive, on the board. Then he
replaced each integer with the sum of its digits.

What is the sum of the numbers on the board now?

For example, if n=12 then initially the numbers on the board are:

Then after the replacement, the numbers become:

The sum of these numbers is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+1+2+3=51 . Thus, for n=12 the
answer is 51 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the largest number Vladislav writes.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of the numbers at the
end of the process.

- Program:
A = []
sum = 0
for i in range(1, 200001):
    a = func_1(i)
    sum = sum + a
    A.append(sum)
for t in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    print(A[n - 1])

def func_1(num):
    a = 0
    while num != 0:
        a = a + num % 10
        num = int(num / 10)
    return a



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a positive integer `num` within the range of 1 to 2 * 10^5. It calculates the sum of all digits of `num` and returns this sum. Additionally, it modifies `num` to become 0 after performing these operations.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. The main issues are:

1. **Pre-computation**: The program pre-computes the sum of digit sums for all numbers up to 200,000 and stores them in the `A` list. This is unnecessary and inefficient, especially since the input `n` can be much smaller than 200,000. 

2. **Incorrect Logic**: The program uses a fixed upper limit of 200,000 for pre-computation, which means it will always compute the sum of digit sums up to 200,000, regardless of the actual value of `n`. This leads to incorrect results for inputs larger than 200,000.

3. **Test Case Analysis**:
   - For `n = 12`, the program computes the sum of digit sums up to 200,000, which is incorrect.
   - For `n = 200000`, the program also computes the sum of digit sums up to 200,000, which is incorrect.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should dynamically compute the sum of digit sums for the numbers from 1 to `n` without pre-computing values for a fixed upper limit. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def sum_of_digit_sums(n):
    total_sum = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        total_sum += sum_of_digits(i)
    return total_sum

def sum_of_digits(num):
    sum_digits = 0
    while num != 0:
        sum_digits += num % 10
        num //= 10
    return sum_digits

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    print(sum_of_digit_sums(n))
```

This corrected version dynamically computes the sum of digit sums for the numbers from 1 to `n` for each test case, ensuring correctness for any valid input within the constraints.
