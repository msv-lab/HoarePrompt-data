Output State: **`i` is 200002; `j` is "0"; `pd[i]` is 2**

Explanation: The code `pd[i] += int(j)` increments the value of `pd[i]` by the integer value of `j`. Given that `j` is "0", `int(j)` results in 0. Since `pd[i]` was initially 0, adding 0 to it does not change its value. Therefore, `pd[i]` remains 0 + 0 = 0. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged.
