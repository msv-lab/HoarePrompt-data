Output State: **`i` is 200003, `j` is "0", `pd[i]` is 200005**

Explanation: The code `pd[i] += pd[i - 1]` updates the value of `pd[i]` by adding the value of `pd[i - 1]` to it. Given that `pd[i]` was initially 200004, and `i` is 200003, the new value of `pd[i]` becomes 200004 + 200004 = 200005. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged.
