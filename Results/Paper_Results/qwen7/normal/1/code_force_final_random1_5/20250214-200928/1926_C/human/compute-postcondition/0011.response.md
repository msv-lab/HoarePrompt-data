Output State: `a` will be equal to the sum of all digits of the initial value of `num`, and `num` will be reduced to 0.

Explanation: The loop continues to extract the last digit of `num` and add it to `a` until `num` becomes 0. Therefore, after all iterations, `a` contains the sum of all digits of the original `num`, and `num` itself will be 0 since the loop terminates when `num` equals 0.
