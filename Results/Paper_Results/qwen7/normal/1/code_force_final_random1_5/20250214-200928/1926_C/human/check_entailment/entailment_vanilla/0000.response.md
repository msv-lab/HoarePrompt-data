Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization and Pre-calculation:**
   ```python
   A = []
   sum = 0
   for i in range(1, 200001):
       a = func_1(i)
       sum = sum + a
       A.append(sum)
   ```
   - The program initializes an empty list `A` and a variable `sum` set to 0.
   - It then iterates through all numbers from 1 to 200000 (inclusive).
   - For each number `i`, it calls `func_1(i)` to get the sum of the digits of `i`.
   - It adds this sum to `sum` and appends the updated `sum` to the list `A`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   ```python
   def func_1(num):
       a = 0
       while num != 0:
           a = a + num % 10
           num = int(num / 10)
       return a
   ```
   - This function correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a given number `num`.

3. **Main Loop for Test Cases:**
   ```python
   for t in range(int(input())):
       n = int(input())
       print(A[n - 1])
   ```
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n`.
   - It prints the value at index `n - 1` of the list `A`.

### Correctness Check:

1. **Pre-calculation Logic:**
   - The pre-calculation part calculates the sum of the digit sums for all numbers from 1 to 200000.
   - However, the problem statement does not specify that the solution must be pre-calculated for all possible values up to 200000. Instead, it should dynamically calculate the sum for each `n` as requested.

2. **Dynamic Calculation:**
   - The main loop should dynamically calculate the sum of the digit sums for numbers from 1 to `n` for each test case.
   - The current implementation uses pre-calculated results stored in `A`, which is not efficient and unnecessary.

3. **Efficiency Consideration:**
   - The time complexity of the current approach is O(t * 200000) due to the pre-calculation and subsequent lookups.
   - Given the constraint of 0.5 seconds per test case, this approach might exceed the time limit for large `t` or large `n`.

### Conclusion:

The provided program is incorrect because it performs unnecessary pre-calculation and uses a less efficient approach. The correct approach would involve dynamically calculating the sum of digit sums for each `n` as requested in the input.

**Correctness: **False**
