Output State: t must be equal to or greater than 3, `n` is an input integer for each iteration.

This means that the loop will continue to execute as long as `t` (the number of iterations) is greater than or equal to 3. For each iteration, `n` is an integer input that determines the index used to access `pd[n]`, which is then printed. After all iterations of the loop have finished, the value of `t` must be at least 3, and `n` will have been an input integer for each of those iterations.
