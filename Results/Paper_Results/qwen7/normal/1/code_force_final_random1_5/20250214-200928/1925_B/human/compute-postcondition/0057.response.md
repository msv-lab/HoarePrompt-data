Output State: **`ans` is the maximum of 2 and `x // i`, and `ans` is also the maximum of `ans` and `int(sqrt(x)) + 1` if `x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0` holds true.**

Explanation: The code updates `ans` to be the maximum of its current value and `x // i`. The conditions for updating `ans` to be the maximum of `ans` and `int(sqrt(x)) + 1` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes both conditions for updating `ans`.
