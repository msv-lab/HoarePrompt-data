You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

- Program: 
from math import sqrt

def func():
    for q in range(int(input())):
        (x, n) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        ans = 1
        for i in range(1, int(sqrt(x)) + 1):
            if x % i == 0:
                if x - n * i >= 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0:
                    ans = max(ans, i)
                if x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and ((x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0):
                    ans = max(ans, x // i)
        print(ans)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each test case, x is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8 and n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ x.
def func():
    for q in range(int(input())):
        x, n = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        
        ans = 1
        
        for i in range(1, int(sqrt(x)) + 1):
            if x % i == 0:
                if x - n * i >= 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0:
                    ans = max(ans, i)
                if x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and (x - n * (x // i)) % (x //
                    i) == 0:
                    ans = max(ans, x // i)
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: Output State: The final value of `ans` will be the maximum value among all possible values of `i` and `x // i` that satisfy the conditions within the loop for all iterations of `q` from 1 to the total number of test cases.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `ans` will hold the highest value of `i` or `x // i` that meets the specified conditions for every test case provided. This means `ans` will be updated in each iteration of the outer loop (`for q in range(int(input()))`) with the maximum valid value found for `i` or `x // i` based on the conditions given in the inner loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the maximum GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of `n` sub-problems whose difficulties sum up to `x`.
   - The GCD of the difficulties should be maximized.

2. **Approach Analysis:**
   - The given solution iterates over possible divisors of `x` up to `sqrt(x)`.
   - For each divisor `i`, it checks if splitting `x` into `n` parts where each part has a difficulty of `i` results in a valid configuration.
   - It also checks the complementary divisor `x // i` to ensure all conditions are met.

3. **Key Points:**
   - The solution correctly identifies potential divisors of `x` and checks if they can form valid sub-problems.
   - It ensures that the remaining difficulty after forming `n-1` sub-problems with the current divisor `i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The solution handles the case where `x` is not perfectly divisible by `n` by checking both `i` and `x // i`.
   - It ensures the maximum GCD is found by comparing against the current best (`ans`).

5. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The logic for finding the maximum GCD is sound.
   - The iteration up to `sqrt(x)` is efficient.
   - The checks for valid configurations are correctly implemented.

Given the analysis, the provided solution appears to be correct and follows the problem's requirements accurately.
