Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variables `i` and `n`.
2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.
3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ans` is the maximum of 2 and `x // i`.
   - `x` is an input integer.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `sqrt(x)` must be an integer or a float that allows the range to include integers from 1 up to and including the integer part of the square root of `x` + 1.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is one less than its current value because the loop increments `i` at each step.
   - `n` remains unchanged unless modified within the loop body, but since no modification is mentioned, it stays the same.
   - The loop will continue if `i` is less than `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.

Given that `i` starts at 1 and is incremented, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would be `int(sqrt(x))`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect this change:

- `i` will be incremented to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.
- `n` remains unchanged.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`ans` is the maximum of 2 and `x // i`, `x` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `sqrt(x)` must be an integer or a float that allows the range to include integers from 1 up to and including the integer part of the square root of `x` + 1, `i` is `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`**.
