Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is `int(sqrt(x))`, and `ans` is the maximum of `ans` and 2.**

Explanation: The line `ans = max(ans, i)` updates the value of `ans` to be the maximum between its current value and the value of `i`. Given that `i` is initially 2, `ans` will be updated to 2 if `ans` was less than 2 before this line of code. The other variables (`x`, `n`) remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by this line of code. The conditions mentioned in the initial state are not directly impacted by this line of code, so they remain valid.
