Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for q in range(int(input())):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `q` and the input value that determines the range.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `q` is less than the input value (which is an integer obtained from user input).

3. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `ans` is the maximum value found during the loop execution. However, the current state that needs to be adjusted for the next iteration is related to the loop head, which involves `q` and the input value.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - `q` will be incremented by 1 at the start of each new iteration.
   - For the loop to execute again, `q` must be less than the input value.

Given these points, let's formulate the state for the next iteration:

- `ans` remains the same because it is not directly affected by the loop head.
- `q` will be incremented by 1.
- The input value remains the same because it is determined at the start of the loop and does not change within the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`ans` is the maximum value found during the loop execution, `q` is 1 more than its value at the end of the previous iteration, and the input value remains the same**.

To provide a concrete example, if `q` was 5 at the end of the previous iteration, then for the next iteration:

State: **`ans` is the maximum value found during the loop execution, `q` is 6, and the input value remains the same**.

However, since the exact value of `q` and the input value are not provided, the general answer is:

State: **`ans` is the maximum value found during the loop execution, `q` is 1 more than its value at the end of the previous iteration, and the input value remains the same**.
