Output State: **`ans` is 1, `q` is 1 more than its value at the end of the previous iteration, `x` is an input integer, and `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code sets `ans` to 1, which overrides its previous value as the maximum value found during the loop execution. The values of `q`, `x`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
