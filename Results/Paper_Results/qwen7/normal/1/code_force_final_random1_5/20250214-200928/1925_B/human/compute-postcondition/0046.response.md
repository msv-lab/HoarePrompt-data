Postcondition: `ans` is 2, `x` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `i` is 2, `sqrt(x)` must be an integer or a float that allows the range to include integers from 1 up to and including the integer part of the square root of `x` + 1, and `x % i == 0`. Additionally, the current value of `x - n * (x // i)` is greater than or equal to 0, and the current value of `x // i` is greater than 0, and the current value of `((x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i))` is equal to 0.
