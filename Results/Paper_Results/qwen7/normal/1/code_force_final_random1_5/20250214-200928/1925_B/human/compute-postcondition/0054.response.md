Output State: **`ans` is the maximum of `ans` and `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`, `x` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `sqrt(x)` must be an integer or a float that allows the range to include integers from 1 up to and including the integer part of the square root of `x` + 1, `i` is `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`**.

Explanation: The code updates `ans` to be the maximum of its current value (`ans`) and the new value of `i`, which is `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
