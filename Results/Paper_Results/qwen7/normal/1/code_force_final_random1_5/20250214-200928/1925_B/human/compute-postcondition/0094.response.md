Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is `int(sqrt(x))`, `ans` is the maximum of `ans` and `x // i` if the condition `x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0` is met, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged.**

This means that the value of `i` remains 2, `n` remains `int(sqrt(x))`, and `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `x // i` only if the specified conditions are satisfied. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged from its previous value.
