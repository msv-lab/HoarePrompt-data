Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and the expression `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.

2. **Determine the initial state**:
   - `x` is an integer.
   - `i` is set to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.
   - `ans` is the maximum value between the previous value of `ans` and `x // i`.
   - Additional conditions for updating `ans` if certain criteria are met.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from `1` to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.

4. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1, so it becomes `int(sqrt(x)) + 2`.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `x` remains unchanged.
   - `i` is now `int(sqrt(x)) + 2`.
   - `ans` remains unchanged unless the conditions are met during the loop execution.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`x` is an integer, `i` is `int(sqrt(x)) + 2`, and `ans` is the maximum value between the previous value of `ans` and `x // i`.**
