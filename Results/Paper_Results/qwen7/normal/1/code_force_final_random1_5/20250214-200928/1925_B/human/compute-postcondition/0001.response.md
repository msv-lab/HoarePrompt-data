Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `q` is 0, `x` is the first integer input split from the user's input, and `n` is the second integer input split from the user's input.**

Explanation: The initial state had `t` as a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `q` as 0, and `t` was supposed to be the value of `int(input())`. The code then takes another input from the user, splits it into two integers using `map(int, input().split(' '))`, and assigns these integers to `x` and `n` respectively. The value of `t` remains unchanged, `q` remains 0, and now `x` and `n` hold the values of the split integers.
