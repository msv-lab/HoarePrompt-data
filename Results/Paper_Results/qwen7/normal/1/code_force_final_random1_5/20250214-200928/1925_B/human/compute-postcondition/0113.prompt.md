You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each test case, x is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8 and n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ x.
def func():
    for q in range(int(input())):
        x, n = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        
        ans = 1
        
        for i in range(1, int(sqrt(x)) + 1):
            if x % i == 0:
                if x - n * i >= 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0:
                    ans = max(ans, i)
                if x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and (x - n * (x // i)) % (x //
                    i) == 0:
                    ans = max(ans, x // i)
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: Output State: The final value of `ans` will be the maximum value among all possible values of `i` and `x // i` that satisfy the conditions within the loop for all iterations of `q` from 1 to the total number of test cases.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `ans` will hold the highest value of `i` or `x // i` that meets the specified conditions for every test case provided. This means `ans` will be updated in each iteration of the outer loop (`for q in range(int(input()))`) with the maximum valid value found for `i` or `x // i` based on the conditions given in the inner loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes three variables t, x, and n where t is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^3, x is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^8, and n is a positive integer within the range 1 to x. It returns a value based on the relationship between these variables.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
