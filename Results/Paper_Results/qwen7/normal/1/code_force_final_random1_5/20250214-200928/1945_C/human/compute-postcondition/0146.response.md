Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for elem in lst:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `elem` and `lst`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements left in `lst`. At the end of the previous iteration, `lst` must have at least 3 elements.

3. **Update the State**: For the loop to execute one more time, `lst` must still contain at least one element. Since `elem` is set to the first element of `lst` in each iteration, removing `elem` from `lst` means `lst` will have one less element.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `lst`: After the previous iteration, `lst` had at least 3 elements. For the loop to continue, `lst` must now have at least 2 elements (since one element has been processed).
   - `elem`: `elem` is the first element of `lst` at the start of each iteration. After processing the first element, the new `elem` will be the second element of the updated `lst`.
   - `mini`: This variable is not directly affected by the loop head, so it remains unchanged.
   - `final`: This variable contains the first element of `lst` from the start of the loop, so it remains unchanged.

5. **Final State**: After processing one more element, `lst` must have at least 2 elements, `elem` will be the second element of `lst`, `mini` remains unchanged, and `final` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`lst` must have at least 2 elements, `elem` is the second element of `lst`, `mini` is the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem`, and `final` contains the first element of `lst`**.
