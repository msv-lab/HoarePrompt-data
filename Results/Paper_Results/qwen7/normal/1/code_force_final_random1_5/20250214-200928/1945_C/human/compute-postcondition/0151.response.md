Output State: **`lst` must have at least 2 elements, `elem` is the third element of `lst`, `mini` is the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem`, `final` is a list containing the first element of `lst`, `elem`, and `elem` is appended to `final`.**

Explanation: The code appends the `elem` (which is the third element of `lst`) to the `final` list. Initially, `final` contains the first element of `lst` and `elem`. After appending, `final` now contains the first element of `lst`, `elem`, and `elem` itself.
