Output State: **`final` is a sorted list with length 1 and contains 0, `c1` is 50 or greater.**

Explanation: The code appends the value `0` to the list `final`. Since `final` was initially a sorted list with length 0, after appending `0`, `final` becomes a sorted list with length 1 containing the value `0`. The value of `c1` remains unchanged and is still 50 or greater.
