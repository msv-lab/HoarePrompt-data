Output State: **`lst` is an empty list, `mini` remains unchanged, and `final` contains all elements from the original `lst` that had the same absolute difference with `pk` as the initial value of `mini`.**

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `lst` will be empty because each element in `lst` is processed exactly once. The variable `mini` remains unchanged because the loop does not modify it. The `final` list will contain all elements from the original `lst` that had the exact same absolute difference with `pk` as the initial value of `mini`. This is because the loop appends an element to `final` only when the absolute difference between `pk` and the current element `elem` is equal to `mini`.
