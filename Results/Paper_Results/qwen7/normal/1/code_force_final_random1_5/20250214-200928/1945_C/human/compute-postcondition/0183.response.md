Output State: **`mini` is 100000000, `final` is sorted, `c1` is less than 50, `t` is `t-1`, `n` must be greater than 1, `s` is the input string, `pk` is `n / 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `o` is the count of '1' in the list `sl`, `z` is the count of '0' in the list `sl`, `zero` is 0, `one` is 1, `lst` is an empty list, `s[i]` is not '0'**.

Explanation: The line `one += 1` increments the value of `one` by 1. Initially, `one` was 0, so after this operation, `one` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
