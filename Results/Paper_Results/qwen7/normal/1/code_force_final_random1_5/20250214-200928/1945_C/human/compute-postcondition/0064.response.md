Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `elem` from the list `lst`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each element in the list `lst`, assigning each element to the variable `elem` in turn.

3. **Determine the State Adjustments**:
   - The variable `pk` is not mentioned in the loop head, so it should not be adjusted here.
   - The variable `mini` is not mentioned in the loop head, so it should not be adjusted here.
   - The variable `final` is not directly modified within the loop head, but its value depends on the loop's execution. Since the loop is iterating over `lst`, the value of `final` could change based on the comparison inside the loop body.

4. **Postcondition Analysis**: The postcondition states that if the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` equals `mini`, then `final` remains unchanged (containing one element which is `elem`). Otherwise, `final` remains unchanged. This means that the value of `final` might remain the same or get updated based on the current `elem`.

5. **State at the Start of the Next Iteration**:
   - `pk` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `mini` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `final` remains unchanged unless the condition is met, but since we don't know the exact state of `final` after the previous iteration, we can only say that it remains unchanged based on the given information.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop would be:

State: **`pk` remains unchanged, `mini` remains unchanged, `final` remains unchanged**.

However, since we need to provide a specific state, we can infer that the state of `final` will remain the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration. Therefore, the state can be described as:

State: **`pk` is as before, `mini` is as before, `final` is as before**.

Since the exact values of `pk`, `mini`, and `final` are not specified, we can generalize the answer as:

State: **`pk` is as before, `mini` is as before, `final` is as before**.
