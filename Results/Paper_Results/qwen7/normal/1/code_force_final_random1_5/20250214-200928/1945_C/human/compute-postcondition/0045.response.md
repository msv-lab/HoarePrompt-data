Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is an input integer such that `i < n - 1` (so `n > 4`), `zero` is either 1 or 2, `one` is either 2 or 3, `zero_perc` is 100, `one_perc` is -100, and `lst` is [3]**.

Explanation: The code updates `zero_perc` to be `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`. Given that `i` is 3, the expression becomes `zero * 100 // (3 + 1)`, which simplifies to `zero * 25`. Since `zero` is either 1 or 2, `zero * 25` results in either 25 or 50. However, since the initial value of `zero_perc` is 50, and there's no indication that `zero` changes from its initial value, `zero_perc` is updated to 100 (as `zero` must be 2 to match the initial condition). All other variables remain unchanged.
