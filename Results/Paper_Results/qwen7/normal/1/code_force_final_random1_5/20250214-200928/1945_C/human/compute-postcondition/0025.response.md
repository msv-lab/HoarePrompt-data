Output State: **`i` is either 1 or `n` is an input integer such that `i < n - 1`, and the first element of `s` is not '0'; `zero_perc` is calculated as `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`, `one_perc` is calculated as `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`**.

Explanation: The code calculates two percentages: `zero_perc` and `one_perc`. 

- `zero_perc` is calculated using the formula `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`, which uses the current values of `zero` and `i`.
- `one_perc` is calculated using the formula `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`, which uses the current values of `o`, `one`, `i`, and `n`.

The conditions for `i` and the first element of `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes these updated calculations along with the unchanged conditions.
