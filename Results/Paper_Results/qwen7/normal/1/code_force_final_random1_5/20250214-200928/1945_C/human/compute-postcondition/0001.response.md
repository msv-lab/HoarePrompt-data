State: **`t` must be at least 1 and at most 2â‹…10^4, `_` is 0**.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is used as a placeholder for the loop counter. However, since the loop counter is automatically initialized and incremented within the loop, we don't need to explicitly adjust its initial value or range. The key variable to consider here is `t`.

2. **Determine the condition for loop execution**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Given the constraints, `t` must be in the range \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\).

3. **Adjust the state**: Since the loop will run for each test case, and `t` represents the number of test cases, `t` must be at least 1 for the loop to start executing. Additionally, since the loop counter `_` starts from 0 and is incremented within the loop, we can safely assume it will be 0 at the start of the first iteration.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is that `t` must be at least 1 and at most \(2 \cdot 10^4\), and `_` is 0 at the start of the loop.
