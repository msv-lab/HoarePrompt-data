Postcondition: `pk` remains unchanged, `mini` remains unchanged, `final` is now a list containing all elements of the original `final` list plus the element `elem` from `lst`. If the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`, then the function continues with the updated `final` list. Otherwise, the function also continues with the updated `final` list.
