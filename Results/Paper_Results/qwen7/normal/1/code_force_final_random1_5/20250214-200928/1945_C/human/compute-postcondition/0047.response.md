Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is an input integer such that `i < n - 1` (so `n > 4`), `zero` is either 1 or 2, `one` is either 2 or 3, `zero_perc` is 100, `one_perc` is -100, and `lst` is [3, 4]**.

Explanation: The code appends `i + 1` to the list `lst`. Since `i` is 3, `i + 1` is 4. The updated list `lst` is therefore `[3, 4]`. The values of `n`, `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, and `one_perc` remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
