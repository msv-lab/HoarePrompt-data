Output State: **`i` is either 1, `n` is an input integer such that `i < n - 1`, and the first element of `s` is not '0'; `zero_perc` is calculated as `zero * 100 // (i + 1)` and is greater than or equal to 50, `one_perc` is calculated as `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)` and is greater than or equal to 50, `lst` contains `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The code appends `i + 1` to the list `lst`. Since `i` is either 1, the appended value will be `2`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged from the initial state.
