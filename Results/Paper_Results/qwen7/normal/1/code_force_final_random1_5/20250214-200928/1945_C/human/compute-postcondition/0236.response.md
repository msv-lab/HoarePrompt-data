Output State: **`lst` is an empty list, `mini` remains unchanged, `final` is an empty list, and final is sorted.**

Explanation: The code `final.sort()` sorts the list `final`. Since `final` was initially an empty list, sorting an empty list does not change its state. Therefore, `final` remains an empty list after the sort operation. The other variables (`lst` and `mini`) remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
