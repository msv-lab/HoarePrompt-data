Output State: **The list `final` contains all elements from `lst` that have the smallest absolute difference with `pk`.**

In this final output state, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `final` will contain every element from the original list `lst` that has the smallest absolute difference with the value `pk`. This means that `final` will include all elements from `lst` which are closest to `pk` based on the condition specified in the loop.
