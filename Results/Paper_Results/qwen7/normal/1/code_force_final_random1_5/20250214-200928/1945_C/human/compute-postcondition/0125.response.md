Postcondition: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, `zero` is either 0, 1, or 2, `zero_perc` is either 0, 100, or 50, `one` is 3, and `one_perc` is -200.**

Explanation: 
- If `s[i]` equals '0', then `zero` becomes 1, and `zero_perc` remains either 0, 100, or 50.
- If `s[i]` does not equal '0', then `zero` remains either 0, 1, or 2, and `one` becomes 3, making `one_perc` equal to -200.
