Postcondition: **`i` is either 0 or 1, `n` is greater than 0, `zero` is either 0 or 1, `zero_perc` is either 0 or 50 depending on the value of `zero`, `one_perc` is calculated as `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`. The current value of `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, and the current value of `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50.**
