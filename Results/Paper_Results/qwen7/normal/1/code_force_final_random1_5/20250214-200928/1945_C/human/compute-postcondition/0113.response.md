Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `zero` is either 1 or 2, `zero_perc` is either 0 or 50 depending on the new value of `zero`, `one_perc` is calculated as `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`**

Explanation: The variable `zero` is incremented by 1. Initially, `zero` was either 0 or 1. After incrementing, `zero` will now be either 1 or 2. The values of `n`, `i`, `one_perc`, and the calculation for `zero_perc` remain unchanged based on the new value of `zero`.
