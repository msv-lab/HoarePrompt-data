Output State: **The list `final` is sorted.**

Explanation: The code `final.sort()` sorts the list `final` in ascending order. Since the initial state only mentions that `final` contains all elements from `lst` that have the smallest absolute difference with `pk`, the sorting operation does not change which elements are in the list, but it changes their order. Therefore, the output state indicates that the list `final` is now sorted.
