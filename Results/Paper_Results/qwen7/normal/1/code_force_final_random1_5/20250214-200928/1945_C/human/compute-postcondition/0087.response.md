Output State: **`pk` remains unchanged, `mini` remains unchanged, `final` is a list containing all elements of the original `lst` list sorted in ascending order, if the current value of `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` now contains an additional element `0` at the end, otherwise `final` contains an additional element `n` appended to it, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the integer value of the user's input to the variable `n`. All other variables (`pk`, `mini`, `final`, `c1`, `t`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `n` is specifically the integer input by the user.
