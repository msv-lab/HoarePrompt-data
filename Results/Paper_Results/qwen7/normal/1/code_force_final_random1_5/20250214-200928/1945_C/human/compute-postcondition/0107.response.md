Output State: **`i` is either 0 or 1, `n` is greater than 0, `zero` is either 0 or 1, `zero_perc` is either 0 or 50 depending on the value of `zero`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `zero` remains unchanged unless `s[0]` is '0', in which case it is set to 1.
- The value of `i` remains unchanged, as the code does not modify it.
- The value of `n` remains unchanged, as the code does not modify it.
- The value of `zero_perc` is calculated as `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`.
  - If `zero` is 0, then `zero_perc` is 0.
  - If `zero` is 1, then `zero_perc` is 50 because `i` is either 0 or 1, making `(i + 1)` either 1 or 2. Therefore, `zero * 100 // (i + 1)` results in 0 or 50.
