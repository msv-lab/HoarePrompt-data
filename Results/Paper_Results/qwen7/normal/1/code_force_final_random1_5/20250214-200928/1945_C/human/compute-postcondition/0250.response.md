Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `t` (number of cases), an integer `n` (length of binary string), and a binary string `s`. For each test case, it calculates the percentage of '0's and '1's up to each position in the string. If at any point both percentages reach 50%, it records the position. After identifying all such positions, it selects the one closest to half the length of the string (`pk`). If no such position exists, it returns either the start or end of the string based on the majority count of '0's or '1's. Finally, it prints the selected position.**
