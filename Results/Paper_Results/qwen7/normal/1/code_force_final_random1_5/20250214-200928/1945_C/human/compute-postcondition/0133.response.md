Output State: **`lst` must have at least one element; `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `mini` to be the minimum value between its current value and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`. The list `lst` remains unchanged, and the exact value of `mini` depends on the current value of `mini`, the value of `pk`, and the value of `ele` from the list `lst`.
