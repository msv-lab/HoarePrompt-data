Output State: **`mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`, `i` is equal to `n-2`, `n` is an input integer greater than 4, zero is either 1, 2, or 3, one is either 2, 3, or 4, zero_perc is 100, one_perc is -100, and `lst` must contain at least one more element.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `mini` to be the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, and `lst`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
