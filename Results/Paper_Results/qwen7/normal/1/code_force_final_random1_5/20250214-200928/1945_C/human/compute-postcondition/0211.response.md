Output State: **`lst` must contain at least one element; `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and the absolute difference between `pk` and each element in `lst`.**

Explanation: The line of code updates the variable `mini` to be the minimum value between its current value and the absolute difference between `pk` and each element (`ele`) in the list `lst`. The initial state of `lst` containing at least one element remains unchanged, but `mini` is now updated to reflect the minimum absolute difference found.
