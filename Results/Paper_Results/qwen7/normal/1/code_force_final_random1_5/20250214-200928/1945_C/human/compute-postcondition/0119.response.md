Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `zero` is either 0, 1, or 2, `zero_perc` is either 0, 100, or 50, `one` is 2, `one_perc` is -200 * (o - 2) // (n - 1)**

Explanation: The code appends `i + 1` to the list `lst`. Since `i` is initially 1, `i + 1` equals 2. However, the list `lst` is not defined in the initial state, so it cannot be updated here. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, making it 2. All other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.
