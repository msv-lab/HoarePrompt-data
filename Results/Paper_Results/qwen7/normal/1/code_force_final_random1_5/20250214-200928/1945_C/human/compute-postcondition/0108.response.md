Output State: **`i` is either 0 or 1, `n` is greater than 0, `zero` is either 0 or 1, `zero_perc` is either 0 or 50 depending on the value of `zero`, `one_perc` is calculated as `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`**

Explanation: The code calculates `one_perc` using the formula `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`. However, since the initial values of `o` and `one` are not provided, `one_perc` cannot be determined precisely. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
