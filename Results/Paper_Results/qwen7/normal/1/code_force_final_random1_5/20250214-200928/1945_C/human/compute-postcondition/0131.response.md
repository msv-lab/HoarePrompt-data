Output State: **The loop has executed all iterations. The variable `i` is equal to `n-2`. The variable `n` is greater than 0. The variable `zero` is either 0, 1, 2, ..., or `i`. The variable `one` is equal to `i + 1`. The variable `zero_perc` is calculated as `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`. The variable `one_perc` is calculated as `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`. If `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, then the list `lst` will contain the value `i + 2`. Otherwise, `lst` will remain unchanged. The variables `t`, `s`, `sl`, `o`, `z`, `zero`, `one`, and `lst` will retain their final values from the last iteration.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop, the variable `i` will be `n-2`, and the conditions for appending to `lst` based on `zero_perc` and `one_perc` will be checked with these final values. The list `lst` will be updated if both percentages meet the criteria, otherwise, it will stay as it was in the last iteration. The other variables (`t`, `s`, `sl`, `o`, `z`, `zero`, `one`) will hold their values from the last iteration of the loop.
