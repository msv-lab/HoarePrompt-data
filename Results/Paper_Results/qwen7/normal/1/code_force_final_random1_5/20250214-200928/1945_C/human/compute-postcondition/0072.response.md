Output State: **`pk` remains unchanged, `mini` remains unchanged, `final` contains all elements of the original `lst` list.**

Explanation: The loop iterates over each element in the list `lst`. For each element `elem` in `lst`, it checks if the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`. If the condition is met, `elem` is appended to the `final` list. Since `mini` is only updated with the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)` during the initialization phase and not within the loop, `mini` remains unchanged throughout the loop. Similarly, `pk` is not modified within the loop, so it also remains unchanged. After all iterations, `lst` becomes empty as stated, and `final` contains all the elements that satisfied the condition `abs(pk - elem) == mini` during the loop's execution.
