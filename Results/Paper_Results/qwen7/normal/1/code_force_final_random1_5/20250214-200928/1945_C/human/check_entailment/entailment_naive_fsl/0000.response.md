Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the percentage of residents satisfied on each side of the road. Specifically, the program uses `zero * 100 // (i + 1)` and `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)` to calculate the percentages, which is incorrect because it does not account for rounding up as required by the problem statement.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
011001
```

The program should check if at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied. However, the current implementation does not correctly handle the rounding up requirement. For instance, when checking the position after the second house, the program calculates the percentage of zeros and ones without rounding up, leading to incorrect results.

A correct approach would involve using `math.ceil` to ensure that the conditions are met correctly. Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        sl = list(s)
        o = sl.count('1')
        z = sl.count('0')
        (zero, one) = (0, 0)
        lst = []
        mini = pow(10, 8)
        
        for i in range(n - 1):
            if s[i] == '0':
                zero += 1
            else:
                one += 1
            
            if math.ceil(zero * 1.0 / (i + 1)) >= math.ceil(o * 1.0 / 2) and \
               math.ceil(one * 1.0 / (n - i - 1)) >= math.ceil((z - one) * 1.0 / 2):
                lst.append(i + 1)
        
        for ele in lst:
            mini = min(mini, abs(n // 2 - ele))
        
        final = []
        for elem in lst:
            if abs(n // 2 - elem) == mini:
                final.append(elem)
        
        final.sort()
        if len(final) == 0:
            c1 = o * 1.0 / n
            if c1 >= 0.5:
                final.append(0)
            else:
                final.append(n)
        
        print(final[0])
```

This corrected version ensures that the conditions for the number of satisfied residents on each side are checked correctly by using `math.ceil` for rounding up.
