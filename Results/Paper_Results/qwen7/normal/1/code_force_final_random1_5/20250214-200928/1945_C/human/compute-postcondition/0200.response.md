Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial conditions**:
   - `zero_perc` is updated based on some calculation involving `zero`, `i`, and `n`.
   - `one_perc` is updated based on some calculation involving `o`, `one`, `n`, and `i`.
   - `mini`, `final`, `c1`, `t`, `s`, `pk`, `sl`, `o`, `z`, `zero`, and `one` remain unchanged.
   - `lst` is updated based on the conditions involving `zero_perc` and `one_perc`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `0` to `n-1`. Therefore, the loop will continue to execute as long as `i < n-1`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1, so the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged.

Given the above points, we can conclude that the only variables that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

Here is the modified state for the next iteration of the loop:

**State: **`zero_perc` is updated to `zero * 100 // (i + 2)`, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 2)`, `mini` remains unchanged, `final` remains unchanged, `c1` remains unchanged, `t` is `t-1`, `n` remains unchanged, `s` remains unchanged, `pk` remains unchanged, `sl` remains unchanged, `o` remains unchanged, `z` remains unchanged, `zero` remains unchanged, `one` remains unchanged, and `lst` remains as it was before the if statement.**
