Output State: **`zero_perc` is updated to `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`, `mini` remains unchanged, `final` remains unchanged, `c1` remains unchanged, `t` is decreased by 1, `n` remains unchanged, `s` remains unchanged, `pk` remains unchanged, `sl` remains unchanged, `o` remains unchanged, `z` remains unchanged, `zero` is incremented by 1 if `s[i] == '0'`, `one` is incremented by 1 if `s[i] != '0'`, `lst` now contains `i + 1` appended to its end.**

This means that the list `lst` has had the value `i + 1` appended to it, while all other variables retain their previous values or expressions.
