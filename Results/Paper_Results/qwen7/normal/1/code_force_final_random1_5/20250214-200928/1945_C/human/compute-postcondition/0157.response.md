Output State: **`final` is a sorted list with length 0, `c1` is 0**.

Explanation: The initial state indicates that the list `final` is sorted and its length is 0. The code snippet `c1 = o * 100 // n` involves variables `o` and `n`. However, since the initial state does not specify the values of `o` and `n`, and there are no conditions or additional context provided to determine their values, we cannot determine the exact value of `c1`. Given the operation `o * 100 // n`, if `o` is 0 (which is a common assumption when no specific value is given), then `c1` would be 0. Since no other variables are affected, the only change is that `c1` is now 0. The list `final` remains sorted with a length of 0.
