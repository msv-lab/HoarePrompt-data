Output State: `zero` will hold the total count of '0' in the string `s`; `one` will hold the total count of '1' in the string `s`; `lst` will contain all positions `i + 1` where both `zero * 100 // (i + 1)` and `(one - one) * 100 // (len(s) - i - 1)` are greater than or equal to 50; `mini` will be the minimum value between its initial value (or any value it might have before the loop starts) and the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst` after all iterations of the loop.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, `zero` and `one` will reflect the counts of '0's and '1's in the string `s`, respectively. The list `lst` will include indices where the conditions related to the counts of '0's and '1's are met, and `mini` will be the smallest difference found between `pk` and any index in `lst` during the loop's execution.
