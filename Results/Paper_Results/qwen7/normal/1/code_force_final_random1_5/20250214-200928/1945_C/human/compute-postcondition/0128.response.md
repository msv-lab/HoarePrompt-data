Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, `zero` is either 0, 1, or 2, `one` is 3, `one_perc` is -200, `zero_perc` is 0, and `lst` is [4]**.

Explanation: The code appends `i + 1` to the list `lst`. Given that `i` is 3, `i + 1` equals 4. Therefore, `lst` becomes `[4]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
