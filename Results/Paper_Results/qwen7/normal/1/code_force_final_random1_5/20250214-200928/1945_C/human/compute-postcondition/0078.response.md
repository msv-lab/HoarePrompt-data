Output State: **`pk` remains unchanged, `mini` remains unchanged, `final` is a list containing all elements of the original `lst` list sorted in ascending order, `c1` is the value of `o * 100 // n` and the current value of `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` now contains an additional element `0` at the end.**

Explanation: The code `final.append(0)` adds the value `0` to the list `final`. Since `final` was originally a list containing all elements of the original `lst` list sorted in ascending order, after appending `0`, it will contain all those elements plus the new element `0`. All other variables (`pk`, `mini`, `c1`) remain unchanged according to the initial conditions.
