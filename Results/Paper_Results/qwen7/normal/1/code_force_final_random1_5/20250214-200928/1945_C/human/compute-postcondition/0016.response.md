Output State: **`mini` is 100000000, `o` is the count of '1' in `sl`, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n / 2`, `sl` is a list containing all characters from the string `s`, `z` is the count of '0' in `sl`, `zero` is 0, `one` is 0; `lst` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The line `mini = pow(10, 8)` assigns the value `100000000` (which is \(10^8\)) to the variable `mini`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
