Output State: **`pk` remains unchanged, `mini` remains unchanged, `final` is a list containing all elements of the original `lst` list sorted in ascending order, if the current value of `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` now contains an additional element `0` at the end, otherwise `final` contains an additional element `n` appended to it, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the input string.**

Explanation: The code `s = input()` reads an input string from the user and assigns it to the variable `s`. The values of `pk`, `mini`, `final`, `c1`, `t`, and `n` remain unchanged from their previous states. The variable `s` is now assigned the value of the input string.
