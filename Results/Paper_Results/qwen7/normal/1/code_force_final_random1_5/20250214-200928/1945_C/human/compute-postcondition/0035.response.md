Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer such that `i < n - 1`, if `s[i]` equals '0', then `zero` is 1, otherwise `one` is 2; `zero_perc` is calculated as `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`**

Explanation: The code calculates `zero_perc` as `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`. Given that `i` is 2, `i + 1` is 3. If `s[i]` equals '0', then `zero` is 1, so `zero_perc` would be `1 * 100 // 3`, which is approximately 33. If `s[i]` does not equal '0', then `one` is 2, but since `zero_perc` is only dependent on `zero`, the value of `one` does not affect the calculation here. The other variables remain unchanged.
