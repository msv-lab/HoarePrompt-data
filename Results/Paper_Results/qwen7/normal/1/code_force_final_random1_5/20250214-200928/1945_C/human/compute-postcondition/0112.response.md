Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n - 1):`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < n - 1`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is either 0 or 1.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `zero` is either 0 or 1.
   - `zero_perc` is either 0 or 50 depending on the value of `zero`.
   - `one_perc` is calculated as `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`.
   - If `zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50`, then `lst` is a list containing the value of `i + 1`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues based on the value of `i` and `n`, we need to update these values.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is either 0 or 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n - 1`.
   - Given that `n` is greater than 0, if `i` is currently 0, the next value of `i` would be 1. If `i` is currently 1, the next value of `i` would be 2.

5. **Update the state**:
   - If `i` was 0, it will become 1.
   - If `i` was 1, it will become 2.
   - `n` remains unchanged since it is not modified within the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `zero` is either 0 or 1, `zero_perc` is either 0 or 50 depending on the value of `zero`, `one_perc` is calculated as `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`**.

If `i` was 1, then:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `zero` is either 0 or 1, `zero_perc` is either 0 or 50 depending on the value of `zero`, `one_perc` is calculated as `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`**.

In summary, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `zero` is either 0 or 1, `zero_perc` is either 0 or 50 depending on the value of `zero`, `one_perc` is calculated as `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`**.
