Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `mini` will be updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)` for every element `ele` in the list `lst`. The variable `i` remains equal to `n-2`, `n` is an input integer greater than 4, `zero` is either 1, 2, or 3, `one` is either 2, 3, or 4, `zero_perc` is 100, `one_perc` is -100, and `lst` is initially [3, 4, ..., n-1] and will be empty after the loop completes.**

This means that `mini` will hold the smallest absolute difference between `pk` and any element in the original list `lst` after the loop has run through all elements. All other given variables will retain their initial values, with `lst` being completely processed and thus empty at the end of the loop.
