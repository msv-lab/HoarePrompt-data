Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `elem`, which iterates over the elements in `lst`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `elem`**: Since the loop starts iterating over `lst`, the initial value of `elem` should be the first element in `lst`.

3. **Determine the State of `lst`**: The state of `lst` itself is crucial because it determines how many times the loop will run. `lst` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.

4. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`mini` and `final`) are not directly involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `lst` must contain at least one element.
- `elem` must be set to the first element in `lst`.

Therefore, the final answer is:

State: **`lst` must contain at least one element, `elem` is the first element in `lst`**
