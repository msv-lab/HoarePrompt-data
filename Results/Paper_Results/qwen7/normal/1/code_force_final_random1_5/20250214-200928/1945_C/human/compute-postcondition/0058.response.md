Output State: **`mini` will be updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)` for every element `ele` in the list `lst`; `i` is `n-2`; `n` is an input integer greater than 4; `zero` is either 1, 2, or 3; `one` is either 2, 3, or 4; `zero_perc` is 100; `one_perc` is -100; `lst` is initially [3, 4, ..., n-1] and will be empty after the loop completes; `final` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `final`. Since no operations are performed on any of the variables, their states remain unchanged from the initial state. The list `lst` will be empty after the loop completes, and `mini` will be updated according to the described condition within the loop.
