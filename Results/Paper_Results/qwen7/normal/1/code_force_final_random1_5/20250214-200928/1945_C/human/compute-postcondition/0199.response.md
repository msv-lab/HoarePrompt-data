Postcondition: **`zero_perc` is updated to `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`, `mini` remains unchanged, `final` remains unchanged, `c1` remains unchanged, `t` is `t-1`, `n` remains unchanged, `s` remains unchanged, `pk` remains unchanged, `sl` remains unchanged, `o` remains unchanged, `z` remains unchanged, `zero` remains unchanged, `one` remains unchanged, and `lst` is now `[i + 1]` if `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50. Otherwise, these variables remain as they were before the if statement.**
