Postcondition: `pk` remains unchanged, `mini` remains unchanged, `final` is a list containing all elements of the original `lst` list sorted in ascending order. If the current value of `c1` (which is `o * 100 // n`) is greater than or equal to 50, `final` now contains an additional element `0` at the end. Otherwise, `final` contains an additional element `n` appended to it.
