Output State: **`pk` is as before, `mini` is as before, `final` is now a list containing all elements of `final` plus `elem`.**

Explanation: The code `final.append(elem)` appends the element `elem` to the list `final`. Since `pk` and `mini` are not affected by this operation, their states remain unchanged. The only change is that `final` now includes the new element `elem`.
