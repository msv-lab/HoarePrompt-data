Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, `zero` is either 0, 1, or 2, `one` is 3, `one_perc` is -200, `zero_perc` is 0, and `one_perc` is calculated as ((o - 3) * 100) // (n - 3 - 1)**

Explanation: The value of `one_perc` is updated to the result of the expression `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`. Since `one` is 3, the expression simplifies to `(o - 3) * 100 // (n - 3 - 1)`. The other variables remain unchanged.
