Output State: **`lst` must contain at least three elements, `elem` is now the third element of `lst`, `mini` remains unchanged, and `final` contains the first four elements of `lst`.**

Explanation: The code `final.append(elem)` appends the value of `elem` to the list `final`. Since `elem` is the third element of `lst`, after appending, `final` will contain the first four elements of `lst`. The other variables remain unchanged.
