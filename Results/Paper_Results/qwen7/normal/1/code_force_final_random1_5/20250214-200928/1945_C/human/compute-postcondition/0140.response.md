Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `elem`, which iterates over each element in the list `lst`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `elem`**: Since `elem` is being assigned the value of each element in `lst` during each iteration, the initial state of `elem` should be set to the first element of `lst`.

3. **Determine the State of `lst`**: The problem states that `lst` remains unchanged from its final state after the third iteration. This means that the list `lst` must have at least three elements for the loop to complete three iterations.

4. **Understand the Update Mechanism**: The variable `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and the absolute difference between `pk` and each element in `lst`. However, since we are only asked to adjust the state before the loop starts, we do not need to consider the exact value of `mini` or `pk` at this stage.

Given these points, we need to ensure that the list `lst` has at least three elements and that `elem` is set to the first element of `lst`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`lst` must have at least 3 elements, `elem` is the first element of `lst`**
