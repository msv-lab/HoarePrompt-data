Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `zero` is either 0 or 1, `zero_perc` is either 0 or 50 depending on the value of `zero`, `one` is 2**.

Explanation: The code `one += 1` increments the value of `one` by 1. Given that `one` was initially assumed to be 1 (since no specific initial value was provided other than it being an integer), after executing `one += 1`, the value of `one` becomes 2. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `zero`, `zero_perc`) remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code snippet.
