Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Percentages**: The code calculates `zero_perc` and `one_perc` using percentages instead of checking if the conditions for at least \(\lceil \frac{x}{2} \rceil\) residents being satisfied are met. This is incorrect because the problem requires counting the number of residents satisfying the condition, not their percentage.

2. **Handling of Ties**: The code does not correctly handle ties when determining the optimal position \(i\). Specifically, it should choose the smallest \(i\) when the minimum absolute difference is achieved.

3. **Edge Cases**: The code does not handle edge cases properly, such as when all residents want to live on the same side or when the road can be placed before the first house.

### Corrected Solution:
Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        left_zeros = [0]
        right_ones = [0]
        
        # Count zeros on the left and ones on the right
        zero_count = 0
        one_count = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            if s[i] == '0':
                zero_count += 1
            else:
                one_count += 1
            left_zeros.append(zero_count)
            right_ones.append(one_count)
        
        # Calculate the minimum distance from the center
        min_distance = float('inf')
        optimal_position = None
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            left_satisfied = left_zeros[i] >= (i + 1) // 2
            right_satisfied = right_ones[n] - right_ones[i] >= (n - i) // 2
            
            if left_satisfied and right_satisfied:
                distance = abs((n - 1) // 2 - i)
                if distance < min_distance:
                    min_distance = distance
                    optimal_position = i
                elif distance == min_distance:
                    optimal_position = min(optimal_position, i)
        
        print(optimal_position)

func()
```

This corrected solution:
- Counts the number of zeros on the left and ones on the right dynamically.
- Checks if the conditions for satisfaction are met.
- Finds the optimal position \(i\) that minimizes the absolute difference from the center of the village.
