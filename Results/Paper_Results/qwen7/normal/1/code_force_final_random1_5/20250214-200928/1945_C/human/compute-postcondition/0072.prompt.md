Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `mini` will be updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)` for every element `ele` in the list `lst`; `i` is `n-2`; `n` is an input integer greater than 4; `zero` is either 1, 2, or 3; `one` is either 2, 3, or 4; `zero_perc` is 100; `one_perc` is -100; `lst` is initially [3, 4, ..., n-1] and will be empty after the loop completes; `final` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for elem in lst:
    if abs(pk - elem) == mini:
        final.append(elem)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `pk`, `elem`, `mini`, and `final` are as follows: if the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` equals `mini`, then `final` remains unchanged (containing one element which is `elem`). If the condition is not met, `final` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `pk`, `mini`, and `final` are as follows: `mini` remains unchanged, `pk` remains unchanged, and `final` is now a list containing all elements of the original `final` list plus `elem`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `pk` remains unchanged, `mini` remains unchanged, `final` is now a list containing all elements of the original `final` list plus the element `elem` from `lst`. If the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` equals `mini`, then the function does nothing additional to `final`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
