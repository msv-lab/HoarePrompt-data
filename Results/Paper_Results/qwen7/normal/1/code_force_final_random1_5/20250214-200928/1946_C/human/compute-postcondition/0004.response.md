The only object in the loop head is the value read from `sys.stdin.readline()`, which is converted to an integer using `int()`. Therefore, we need to adjust this state.

At the end of the previous iteration, the value read from `sys.stdin.readline()` must be greater than the current value. For the loop to execute one more time, this value must be incremented by 1.

Let's denote the initial value read from `sys.stdin.readline()` as `N`. After the first iteration, the value must be `N + 1` for the loop to continue.

State: **The value read from `sys.stdin.readline()` must be greater than the current value, so it should be `N + 1`**
