You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5, and v and u are integers such that 1 ≤ v, u ≤ n.
def func_1():
    for _ in range(int(sys.stdin.readline())):
        solve()
        
    #State: Output State: The function `solve()` has been called three times. The value read from `sys.stdin.readline()` is `N + 1`, where `N` is the number of iterations the loop will execute. All other variables in their initial states remain unchanged.
    #
    #This means that the loop will continue to execute until the value read from `sys.stdin.readline()` is equal to the total number of iterations, which is `N + 1`. After that, the loop will terminate, and `solve()` will have been called `N + 1` times.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but seems to imply that it should work within a context where variables t, n, k, v, and u are defined, with t being an integer between 1 and 10^4, n and k being integers between 1 and 10^5 with k < n, and v and u being integers between 1 and n. The function does not return anything explicitly mentioned in the provided code snippet.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
