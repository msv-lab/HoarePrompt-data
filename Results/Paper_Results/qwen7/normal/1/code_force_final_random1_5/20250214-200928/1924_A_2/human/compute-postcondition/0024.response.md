Output State: **`cur` is 2 raised to the power of `cur_ss` and then 1 is added, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers obtained from the input split, `s` must have at least one less character, `cnt` is 2, `ans` is equal to `ss`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` - 97, and the condition `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0` is satisfied.**

Explanation: The line `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. Since `cnt` was initially 1, it is now 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
