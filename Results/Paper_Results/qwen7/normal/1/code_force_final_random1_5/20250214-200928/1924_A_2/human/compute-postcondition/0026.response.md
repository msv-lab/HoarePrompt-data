Output State: **`cur` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers obtained from the input split, `s` must have at least one less character, `cnt` is 2, `ans` is equal to `ss` + `ss`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` - 97, and the condition `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0` is no longer satisfied.**

Explanation: The code `ans += ss` adds the value of `ss` to `ans`. Since `ss` is a string, adding `ss` to `ans` concatenates `ss` to `ans`. The other variables remain unchanged.
