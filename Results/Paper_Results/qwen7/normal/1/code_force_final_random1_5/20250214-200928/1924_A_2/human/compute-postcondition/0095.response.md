Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `ss` (the character being iterated over) and `s` (the remaining substring).

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are characters left in `s`.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `cur` is 0.
   - `ans` is the current `ans` concatenated with the next character `ss`.
   - `s` is the remaining substring of `s` after removing the first character.
   - `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of `'a'`.

4. **Determine the Next Iteration States**:
   - `ss` will be the next character in the string `s`.
   - `s` will be the remaining substring of `s` after removing the first character.
   - `cur` will remain 0 if `cur & 1 << cur_ss` is 0; otherwise, it will remain unchanged.
   - `ans` will be updated by concatenating `ss` to it if `cur & 1 << cur_ss` is 0.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `cur` will remain 0 because the condition `cur & 1 << cur_ss` was not met in the previous iteration.
   - `ans` will be updated by concatenating `ss` to it.
   - `s` will be the remaining substring of `s` after removing the first character.
   - `cur_ss` will be the ASCII value of the new `ss` minus the ASCII value of `'a'`.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted for the next iteration are:

- `ss` will be the next character in `s`.
- `s` will be the remaining substring of `s` after removing the first character.
- `cur` will remain 0.
- `ans` will be updated by concatenating `ss` to it.
- `cur_ss` will be the ASCII value of the new `ss` minus the ASCII value of `'a'`.

So, the final state for the next iteration is:

State: **`cur` is 0, `ans` is the current `ans` concatenated with the next character `ss`, `s` is the remaining substring of `s` after removing the first character, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the new `ss` minus the ASCII value of `'a'`**.
