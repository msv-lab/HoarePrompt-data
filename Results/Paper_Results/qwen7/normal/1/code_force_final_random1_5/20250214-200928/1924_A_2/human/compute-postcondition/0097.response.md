Output State: **`cur` is 2 raised to the power of `cur_ss`, `ans` is the current `ans` concatenated with the next character `ss`, `s` is the remaining substring of `s` after removing the first character, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the new `ss` minus the ASCII value of `'a'`.**

Explanation: The line `cur += 1 << cur_ss` shifts the value `1` left by `cur_ss` positions and adds it to `cur`. Here, `1 << cur_ss` is equivalent to `2 ** cur_ss`. So, `cur` is updated to its current value plus `2 ** cur_ss`. The other variables (`ans`, `s`, and `cur_ss`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
