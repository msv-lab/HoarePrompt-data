Output State: **`cur` is 2 raised to the power of `cur_ss` and then 1 is added, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers obtained from the input split, `s` must have at least one less character, `cnt` is 1, `ans` is equal to `ss`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` - 97**.

Explanation: The line `cur += 1 << cur_ss` increments the value of `cur` by `2^cur_ss`. Here, `1 << cur_ss` is equivalent to `2^cur_ss`. The other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.
