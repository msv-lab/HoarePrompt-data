Postcondition: `cur` is 2 raised to the power of `cur_ss` and then 1 is added, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers obtained from the input split, `s` must have at least one less character, `cnt` is 1, `ans` is equal to `ss`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` - 97. This is because if the condition `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0` is true, `cur` becomes 2 raised to the power of `cur_ss` and then 1 is added. If the condition is false, `cur` remains as 2 raised to the power of `cur_ss` minus 1, which is the initial state, and no changes occur to other variables.
