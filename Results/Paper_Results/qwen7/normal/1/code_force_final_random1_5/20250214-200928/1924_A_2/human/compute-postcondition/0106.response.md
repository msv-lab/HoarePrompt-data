Based on the initial state provided:

- `cur` is 0.
- `ans` is the entire string `s` concatenated in some order based on certain conditions.
- `cnt` is the number of times `cur` reached `(1 << k) - 1` during the loop execution.
- `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`.

The `print('YES')` statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
