Based on the initial state provided:

- `cnt` is either 0, 1, or 2.
- `cur` is 0.
- `s` is a non-empty string.
- `ans` is a concatenation of characters from `s` based on the conditions met during the loop execution.
- `cnt` has incremented to a value greater than or equal to `n`.

The print statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`. Since no other variables or objects are being printed and the value of the string is explicitly given, we can directly state what will be printed.

Output: **YES**
