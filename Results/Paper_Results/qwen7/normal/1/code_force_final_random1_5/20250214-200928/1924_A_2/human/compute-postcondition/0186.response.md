Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` must be at least 1, `cur` is 0, `s` is a non-empty string, `ans` is a concatenation of characters from `s` based on the conditions met during the loop execution, and `tmp` is 'a', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block immediately preceding the `break` statement, the only effect is that the program will exit the most internal loop or conditional structure it was in. All other variables retain their initial or previously calculated values.
