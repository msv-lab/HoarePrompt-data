Output State: **`cur` is 1 shifted left by `cur_ss`, `ans` is the current `ans` concatenated with the next character `ss`, `s` is the remaining substring of `s` after removing the first character, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of `'a'`.**

Explanation: The value of `cur` is updated by performing a bitwise left shift operation on its current value by `cur_ss` positions. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
