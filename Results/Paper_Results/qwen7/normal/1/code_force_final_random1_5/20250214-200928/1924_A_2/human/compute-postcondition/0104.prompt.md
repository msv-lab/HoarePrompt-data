Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cur` is 0; `ans` is an empty string
Code of the loop:
for ss in s:
    cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
    if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
        cur += 1 << cur_ss
    if cur == (1 << k) - 1:
        cnt += 1
        cur = 0
        ans += ss


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `cur` is 0, `ans` is the string `ss` concatenated to the original `ans`, and `s` is a non-empty string with its first character `ss` processed as described.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `cur` is 0, `ans` is the current `ans` concatenated with the next character `ss`, `s` is the remaining substring of `s` after removing the first character, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of `'a'`. If `cur & 1 << cur_ss` is 0, then `cur` remains 0 and `ans` is updated by concatenating `ss` to it. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `cur` remains unchanged, `ans` is the current `ans` concatenated with the next character `ss`, `s` is the remaining substring of `s` after removing the first character, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the new `ss` minus the ASCII value of `'a'`, and `cnt` is 1 if `cur` does not have the bit corresponding to `cur_ss` set, otherwise no change occurs to `cur` and `ans` remains as per the if part.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
