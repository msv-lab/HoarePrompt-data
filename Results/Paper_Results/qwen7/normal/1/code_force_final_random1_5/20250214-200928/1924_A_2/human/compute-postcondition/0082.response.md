Output State: **`cur` is 0; `ans` is increased by `ss`**

Explanation: The code `ans += ss` increments the value of `ans` by the value of `ss`. Since `cur` was initially 0 and was not affected by the code, its value remains unchanged. The value of `ans` is updated to be its original value plus `ss`.
