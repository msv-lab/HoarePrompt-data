Postcondition: `cnt` is either 0 or 1, `cur` is an updated value, `s` is a non-empty string, `ss` is the second character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of `'a'`, and `ans` is equal to `ss` if `cur` does not have the bit corresponding to `cur_ss` set, and `ans` is equal to `ord(ss) - ord('a')` otherwise.
