Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m` followed by the string `s`. This part is handled correctly.

2. **Subsequence Check**: The program uses a bitmask (`cur`) to track the presence of each character from the alphabet in the string `s`. It iterates through each character in `s` and updates the bitmask accordingly. If the bitmask reaches `(1 << k) - 1`, it means all `k` characters have been found in the current sequence, and it increments the count `cnt`.

3. **Output Determination**: 
   - If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, it prints "YES". This is correct because it means all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of `s`.
   - If `cnt` is less than `n`, it prints "NO" and constructs a string `ans` that includes characters not found in the current sequence to ensure `cnt` meets the requirement. This is also correct as it identifies a missing character and appends it to the result string.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases well, such as when `cnt` is less than `n`, ensuring that the constructed string `ans` is of length `n` and includes a character not present in the current sequence.

5. **Final State**: The final state of the variables is consistent with the logic implemented. The bitmask `cur` is reset to 0 at the start of each test case, and the loop completes all iterations as expected.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
