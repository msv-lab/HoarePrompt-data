Output State: **`cur` is 2 raised to the power of `cur_ss` - 1, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers obtained from the input split, `s` must have at least one less character, `cnt` is 1, `ans` is equal to `ss`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` - 97**

Explanation: The code updates `cur_ss` to be the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of 'a'. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
