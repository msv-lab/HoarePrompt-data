Postcondition: **`cnt` is either 0, 1, or 2, `cur` is 0, `k` must be at least 1, `s` is a non-empty string, `ans` is a concatenation of characters from `s` based on the conditions met during the loop execution, `tmp` is an empty string, and the current value of `cur` and 1 shifted left by `i` bits has a result of 0**
