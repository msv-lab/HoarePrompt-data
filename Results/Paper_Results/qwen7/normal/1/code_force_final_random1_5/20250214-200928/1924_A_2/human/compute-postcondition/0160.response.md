Postcondition: `cnt` is either 0 or 1, `cur` is an updated value (either unchanged or incremented by \(1 << cur_ss\)), `s` is a non-empty string, `ss` is the second character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of `'a'`, and `ans` is equal to `ss` plus the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of `'a'` if `cur` equals \((1 << k) - 1\). Otherwise, `ans` is equal to `ss` if `cur` does not equal \(1 << k - 1\).
