Output State: **`cnt` is 1, `cur` is 0, `ans` is the current `ans` concatenated with the next character `ss`, `s` is the remaining substring of `s` after removing the first character, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of `'a'`.**

Explanation: The code `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. Initially, `cnt` was 0, so after executing this line, `cnt` becomes 1. The values of `cur`, `ans`, `s`, and `cur_ss` remain unchanged as the code does not affect them.
