Output State: **`cur` is 0, `ans` is the current `ans` concatenated with the next character `ss`, `s` is the remaining substring of `s` after removing the first character, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of `'a'`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the ASCII value of the character `ss` relative to `'a'` (i.e., `ord(ss) - ord('a')`) and assigns it to the variable `cur_ss`. The other variables (`cur`, `ans`, and `s`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
