Output State: **`cnt` is 0, `cur` is 1 shifted left by `cur_ss`, `s` is a non-empty string, `ss` is the first character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of 'a', and `(cur & 1 << cur_ss)` evaluates to 0.**

Explanation: The value of `cur` is updated by adding `1 << cur_ss` to its current value. Here, `1 << cur_ss` shifts the binary number 1 to the left by `cur_ss` positions, which is equivalent to multiplying 1 by \(2^{cur_ss}\). The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
