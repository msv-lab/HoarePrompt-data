Output State: **`cnt` is 1, `cur` is 0, `ans` is the current `ans` concatenated with the next character `ss`, `s` is the remaining substring of `s` after removing the first character, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of `'a'`**.

The code `cur = 0` simply assigns the value `0` to the variable `cur`. The other variables (`cnt`, `ans`, `s`, and `cur_ss`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
