Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` must be at least 1, `cur` is 0, `s` is a non-empty string, `ans` is a concatenation of characters from `s` based on the conditions met during the loop execution, and `tmp` is 'b', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead exits the loop or the most internal if statement. Therefore, the values of `i`, `k`, `cur`, `s`, `ans`, and `tmp` remain unchanged, and the program breaks out of the loop or if statement it was in.
