Output State: **`cnt` is 1, `cur` is 0, `s` is a non-empty string, `ss` is the first character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of 'a', and \((cur & 1 << cur_ss)\) evaluates to 0.**

Explanation: The line `cur = 0` sets the variable `cur` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
