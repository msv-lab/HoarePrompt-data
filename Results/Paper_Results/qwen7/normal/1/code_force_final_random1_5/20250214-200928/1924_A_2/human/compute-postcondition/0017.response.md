Output State: **`cur` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers obtained from the input split, `s` must have at least one character, `cnt` is 1, `ans` is equal to `ss`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += ss` appends the string `ss` to the existing value of `ans`. Since `ans` was initially an empty string, after executing this line, `ans` will be equal to `ss`. All other variables remain unchanged.
