Based on the initial state provided:

- `cnt` is either 0, 1, or 2.
- `cur` is 0.
- `k` is exactly 3.
- `s` is a non-empty string.
- `ans` is "abba" (since `ans` was "abb" and `'a' * (n - cnt - 1)` adds 'a' three times, where `n` is the length of `ans` which is 4, so `n - cnt - 1 = 4 - cnt - 1 = 3 - cnt`, and since `cnt` can only be 0, 1, or 2, it adds 3 'a's).
- `tmp` is 'b'.

The print statement is `print(ans)`, and since `ans` is explicitly stated to be "abba", the output will be:

Output: **abba**
