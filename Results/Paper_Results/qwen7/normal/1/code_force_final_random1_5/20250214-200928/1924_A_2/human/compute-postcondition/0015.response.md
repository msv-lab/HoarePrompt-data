Output State: **`cur` is 2 raised to the power of `cur_ss`, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers obtained from the input split, `s` must have at least one character, `cnt` is 1, `ans` is an empty string, and `cur` is equal to \(1\) left-shifted by `k` and then subtracted by 1.**

Explanation: The line `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. Initially, `cnt` was 0, so now it is 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state description.
