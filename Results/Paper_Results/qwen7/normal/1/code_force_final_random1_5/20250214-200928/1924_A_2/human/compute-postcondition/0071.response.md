Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head contains the variable `ss`, which is being assigned values from the string `s` using the `enumerate` function. However, since the loop head only mentions `ss` directly, we focus on `ss`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `ss`**: The variable `ss` is being assigned characters from the string `s` one by one during each iteration of the loop. For the loop to start, `ss` must be assigned the first character of the string `s`.

3. **Initial State of `s`**: Since `ss` is derived from `s`, the string `s` must contain at least one character for the loop to execute.

4. **Current States**: We know that `cur` is 0 (which might be used as an index or counter) and `ans` is an empty string (which might be used to accumulate results).

5. **Adjusting the States**: To ensure the loop can execute, we need to ensure that `ss` is assigned the first character of `s`. This means `s` must not be an empty string.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `s` must not be an empty string.
- `ss` should be the first character of `s`.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`cur` is 0, `ans` is an empty string, `s` is a non-empty string, `ss` is the first character of `s`**.
