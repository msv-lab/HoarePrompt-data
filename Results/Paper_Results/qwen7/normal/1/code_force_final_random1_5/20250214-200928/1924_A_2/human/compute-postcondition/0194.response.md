Output State: **Postcondition: `cnt` is either 0, 1, or 2, `cur` is 0, `k` is exactly 3, `s` is a non-empty string, `ans` is "ab", and `tmp` is 'b'.**

Explanation: After the loop executes all three iterations, the variable `i` will have the value 2 (since the loop runs from 0 to 2 inclusive). The condition `cur & 1 << i == 0` evaluates to true for `i = 0` and `i = 1`, causing `tmp` to be set to 'a' and 'b' respectively. Since `cur` starts as 0, it remains 0 after the loop, meaning both conditions were met. Therefore, `tmp` ends up being 'b' after the third iteration, and `ans` accumulates "ab". The value of `k` is exactly 3 because the loop ran for 3 iterations.
