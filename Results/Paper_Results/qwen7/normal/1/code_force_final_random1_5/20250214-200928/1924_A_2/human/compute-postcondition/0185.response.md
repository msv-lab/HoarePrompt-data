Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` must be at least 1, `cur` is 0, `s` is a non-empty string, `ans` is a concatenation of characters from `s` based on the conditions met during the loop execution, and `tmp` is 'a'.**

Explanation: The code `tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)` changes the value of `tmp` to the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `'a'` plus the value of `i`. Given that `i` is initially 1, `ord('a')` returns 97 (the ASCII value of 'a'), and adding 1 results in 98, which corresponds to the character 'b'. However, since `i` is 1, `tmp` becomes 'b'. All other variables remain unchanged.
