Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`.**

Explanation: The code initializes a `defaultdict` named `d1` with an integer factory function. This means that `d1` can hold key-value pairs where the values are integers by default. The values of `i`, `n`, and `l` remain unchanged from their initial states.
