Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `x` and `y` are input integers, `j` is `m + 1`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`, `n` is an integer greater than `m + 1`, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.**

The code `d2 = defaultdict(int)` does not change the values of any existing variables but instead assigns a new `defaultdict` object to `d2`. This new `defaultdict` has an integer factory function as its default factory, meaning it will default to zero when accessing non-existent keys. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
