Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, and the difference between `l[i+1]` and `l[i]` is equal to `d2[i+1] + l[i-1] - l[i]`.**

Explanation: The code updates `d2[i]` to the value of `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`. Given the initial conditions, `i` remains `n-2`, `n` remains greater than or equal to 3, and the difference between `l[i+1]` and `l[i]` is now expressed as `d2[i+1] + l[i-1] - l[i]`.
