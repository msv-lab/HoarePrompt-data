Output State: **`j` is 1, `m` is a positive integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, the values of `x` and `y` are integers obtained from the input split by space.**

Explanation: The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes a line of input, splits it into two parts based on spaces, and converts these parts into integers. These integers are then assigned to `x` and `y`. The values of `j` and `m` remain unchanged from their initial states.
