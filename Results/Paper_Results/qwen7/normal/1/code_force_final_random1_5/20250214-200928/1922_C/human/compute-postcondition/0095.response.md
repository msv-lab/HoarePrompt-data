Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `n-2` to `0` (exclusive) with a step of `-1`. This means the loop will run as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `1`.

3. **Determine the initial value of `i`**: According to the given state, `i` is initially `n-2`.

4. **Check if the loop can execute**: For the loop to execute, `i` must be greater than or equal to `1`. Given that `i` starts at `n-2`, the loop will execute as long as `n-2 >= 1` or equivalently `n >= 3`.

5. **Adjust the required states**: The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. We need to ensure that `i` is within the range `[1, 0)` (inclusive of 1 and exclusive of 0). Since `i` starts at `n-2`, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 3.

6. **Consider other states**: The states of `d1` and `d2` are not part of the loop head and do not affect the loop's execution directly. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Based on the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is `n-2`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3**
