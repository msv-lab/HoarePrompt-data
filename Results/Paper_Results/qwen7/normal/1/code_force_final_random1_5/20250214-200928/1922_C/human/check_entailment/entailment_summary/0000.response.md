Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to find the minimum cost to travel between two cities, where the cost of traveling to the closest city is 1 coin, and the cost of traveling directly is the absolute difference in their coordinates.
2. **Analysis of the Code**:
   - The code initializes two dictionaries `d1` and `d2` to store cumulative values.
   - `d1` is filled from left to right, while `d2` is filled from right to left.
   - `d1[i]` stores the cumulative cost to reach the closest city for each position `i`.
   - `d2[i]` stores the cumulative cost to reach the closest city for each position `i` when moving from the end of the list towards the start.
3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The logic for filling `d1` and `d2` seems to correctly compute the minimum cost to reach the closest city for each position.
   - When processing queries, the code correctly uses the precomputed values in `d1` and `d2` to find the minimum cost to travel between two cities.
4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the edge cases where the starting city is either before or after the target city by using the appropriate dictionary (`d1` or `d2`).
   - The code does not handle the case where the starting and ending cities are the same, but this is not required according to the problem statement.

Given the above analysis, the code appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
