Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `i` is 1
- `n` is at least 3
- The postcondition involves a list `l` and another list `d1`.

### Loop Head
The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(1, n - 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
- The loop variable `i` ranges from 1 to `n-2` (inclusive).
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2.
- Since `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, the condition for the next iteration is that `i` should be less than `n-1`.

### Adjusting the States
- `i` will be incremented to 2.
- `n` remains unchanged because the loop condition does not depend on `n` changing; it only depends on `i` being less than `n-1`.

### Updated State
- `i` is now 2.
- `n` is still at least 3.

### Final State
State: **`i` is 2, `n` is at least 3**
