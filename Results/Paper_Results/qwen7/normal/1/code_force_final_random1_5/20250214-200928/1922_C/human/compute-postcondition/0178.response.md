Output State: **`i` is `n-4`, `n` must be greater than 4, `d2[n-1]` is 1, `d2[i]` is 1 + `d2[i + 1]`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `d2[i]` to be `1 + d2[i + 1]`. Given that `i` is `n-4`, the updated state of `d2[i]` is `1 + d2[i + 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
