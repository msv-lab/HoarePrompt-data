#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, a is a list of n non-negative integers in strictly increasing order (0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9), m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, and x_i and y_i are integers such that 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i.

    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `m` must be greater than 0, `j` will be equal to the total number of iterations (`m`), `x` and `y` are integers from the input for each iteration, and both `d1` and `d2` dictionaries will contain values calculated based on the input list `l`. If `y` is greater than `x` during any iteration, the difference `d1[y] - d1[x]` is printed; otherwise, the difference `d2[y] - d2[x]` is printed. The values of `m` and `j` do not change regardless of the conditions inside the loop. The dictionaries `d1` and `d2` will store the cumulative differences as described in the loop body, and these values will be used to compute the outputs for each query provided in the input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads a positive integer \( t \), an integer \( n \), a list \( a \) of \( n \) non-negative integers in strictly increasing order, an integer \( m \), and a series of pairs \( (x_i, y_i) \). It then calculates and prints the difference between certain values stored in two dictionaries, \( d1 \) and \( d2 \), based on the positions \( x_i \) and \( y_i \) in the list \( a \). The dictionaries \( d1 \) and \( d2 \) store cumulative differences derived from the list \( a \). The function does not return any value but prints the results for each query.
