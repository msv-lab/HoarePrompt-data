Based on the initial state provided:

- `m` must be greater than 0.
- `j` is 1.
- `x` is an integer from the input.
- `y` is an integer from the input.

The code snippet is:
```python
print(d1[y] - d1[x])
```

Here, `d1` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we need to assume it is a dictionary. Since no specific values for `d1` are provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical result of `d1[y] - d1[x]`. However, we can describe what will be printed.

Output: **d1[y] - d1[x]** (where `d1` is a dictionary, and `y` and `x` are integers from the input)
