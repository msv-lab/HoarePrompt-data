Based on the initial state provided:

- `m` must be greater than 0 (though `m` itself is not used in the code snippet).
- `x` is an input integer.
- `y` is an input integer.
- `x` is updated to the first integer from the input.
- `y` is updated to the second integer from the input.

The code snippet is:
```python
print(d1[y] - d1[x])
```

Here, `d1` is a dictionary, and `d1[y]` and `d1[x]` refer to the values associated with keys `y` and `x` in the dictionary `d1`.

Given that `x` and `y` are the first and second integers from the input respectively, the print statement will subtract the value associated with key `x` from the value associated with key `y` in the dictionary `d1`.

Therefore, the output will be the result of this subtraction.

Output: **d1[y] - d1[x]**
