Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `x` and `y` are input integers, `j` is `m + 1`, `d1` and `d2` remain unchanged from their initial states, and `n` is an integer greater than `m + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of `int(input())` to `n`. Since the precondition states that `int(input())` must be greater than `m + 1`, `n` will be an integer greater than `m + 1`. All other variables (`m`, `x`, `y`, `j`, `d1`, `d2`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
