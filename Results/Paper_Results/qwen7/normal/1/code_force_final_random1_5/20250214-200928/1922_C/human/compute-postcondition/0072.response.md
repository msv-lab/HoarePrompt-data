Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `j` is equal to `m-1`, `i` is equal to `m`, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers entered by the user split from a single input string, `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory `int` where `d1[2] = 1`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`.**

Explanation: The code `d1[2] = 1` assigns the value `1` to the key `2` in the dictionary `d1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
