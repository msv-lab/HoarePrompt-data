Output State: **`j` is 2, `m` is a positive integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated inputs from the user and converts them into integers. These integers are then assigned to the variables `x` and `y`. The variables `j` and `m` remain unchanged from their initial states.
