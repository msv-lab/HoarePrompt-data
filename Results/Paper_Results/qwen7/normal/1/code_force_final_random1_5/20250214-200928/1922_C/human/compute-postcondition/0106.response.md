Output State: **`i` is `n-3`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, the length of list `l` is at least `n-1`, `d2[i]` is updated to `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`**.

This means that the value of `d2[i]` has been updated to the expression `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`, while the values of `i`, `n`, and the length condition of list `l` remain unchanged from the initial state.
