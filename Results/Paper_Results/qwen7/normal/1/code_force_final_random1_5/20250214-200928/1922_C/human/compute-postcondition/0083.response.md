Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `d1[4]` is 2**

Explanation: The code updates the dictionary `d1` such that `d1[i + 2]` is set to `1 + d1[i + 1]`. Given that `i` is initially 2, `i + 2` equals 4. Since `i` was incremented from 1 to 2, `i + 1` would be 3. However, the value of `d1[3]` is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine its exact value. But we know that `d1[4]` is now `1 + d1[3]`. Given that `d1[3]` is not defined, we can only say that `d1[4]` is 2 assuming `d1[3]` was 1 (a common default if not specified). The conditions for `n` and the value of `i` remain unchanged.
