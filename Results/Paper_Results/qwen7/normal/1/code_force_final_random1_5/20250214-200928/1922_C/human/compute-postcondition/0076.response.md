Output State: **`i` is at least 1 and less than `n`, `n` is an input integer, the difference between `l[i + 1]` and `l[i]` is less than the difference between `l[i]` and `l[i - 1]`, `d1[i + 2]` is set to `1 + d1[i + 1]`**.

This means that the variable `d1[i + 2]` has been updated to be `1 + d1[i + 1]`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged from the initial state.
