Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, and the list `l` has at least three elements such that:
- If the difference between the second and first element is less than the difference between the first and the second-to-first element, then `d1[i + 2]` is 1 + `d1[i + 1]`.
- Otherwise, `d1[i + 2]` is `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]`.
