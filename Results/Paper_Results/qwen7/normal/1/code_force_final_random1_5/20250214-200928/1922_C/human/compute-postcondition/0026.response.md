Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial value of `i`**: The state before the loop starts is given as `i` is `n-1`.

3. **Determine the range of the loop**: The loop runs from `i = n-2` to `i = 1` (since `i` is decremented by 1 each time).

4. **Initial value of `i` within the loop range**: Since the loop starts with `i = n-1` and the loop runs until `i = 1`, the initial value of `i` should be set to `n-2` for the loop to start its first iteration.

5. **Check the condition for the loop to run**: The loop runs as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, `i` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Given these points, we need to adjust the state such that `i` is set to `n-2` for the loop to start its first iteration and continue running.

**State:**
- `i` must be `n-2` for the loop to start its first iteration and continue running.

Since `d2[n-1]` and `d1[n+1]` are not directly involved in the loop condition, they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is `n-2`**.
