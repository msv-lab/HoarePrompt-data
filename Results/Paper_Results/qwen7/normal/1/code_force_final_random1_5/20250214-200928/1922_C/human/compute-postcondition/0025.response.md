Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `d2[n-1]` is 1, and `d1[n+1]` is the cumulative effect of the updates based on the conditions in the loop.**

Explanation: 
- The variable `i` is set to `n-1` after the loop completes all its iterations.
- The variable `d2[n-1]` is explicitly set to 1.
- The value of `d1[n+1]` is determined by the loop's conditions, which update `d1[i+2]` based on the differences between consecutive elements in list `l`. The exact value of `d1[n+1]` depends on the specific values in `l` and the conditions met during each iteration of the loop.
