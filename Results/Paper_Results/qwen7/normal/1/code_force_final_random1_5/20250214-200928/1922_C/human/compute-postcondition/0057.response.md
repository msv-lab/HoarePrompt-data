Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0; `j` is 1; `x` is an integer from the input; `y` is an integer from the input**

Explanation: The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and converts them to integers, assigning the first integer to `x` and the second integer to `y`. The initial values of `m` and `j` remain unchanged.
