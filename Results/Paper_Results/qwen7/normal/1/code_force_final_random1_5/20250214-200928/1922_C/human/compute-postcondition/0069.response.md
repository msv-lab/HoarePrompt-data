Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `j` is equal to `m-1`, `i` is equal to `m`, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers entered by the user split from a single input string.**

Explanation: The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a single line of space-separated integers as input, converts each integer to a string, splits the string into individual elements, maps each element to an integer, and stores the resulting list in `l`. The values of `m`, `j`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
