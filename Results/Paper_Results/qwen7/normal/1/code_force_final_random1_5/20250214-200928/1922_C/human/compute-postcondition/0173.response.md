Output State: **`i` is `n-3`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2 and greater than `m+1`, `d2[n-1]` is 1, and `d2[i]` is `2 + d2[i + 1]`.**

Explanation: The code `d2[i] = 1 + d2[i + 1]` updates the value of `d2[i]` to be one more than the value of `d2[i + 1]`. Given the initial state, `d2[i]` was either `1 + d2[i + 1]` if `l[i] - l[i - 1]` is less than `l[i + 1] - l[i]`, or `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]` otherwise. After executing the code, `d2[i]` is now `1 + d2[i + 1]`, which simplifies to `2 + d2[i + 1]` given the initial condition. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
