Output State: **`i` is 2; `n` is at least 3; `d1[i + 2]` is `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]`**

Explanation: The code updates the dictionary `d1` such that the key `i + 2` (which is 4 since `i` is 2) is assigned the value `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `d1` are updated accordingly. The precondition that `n` is at least 3 remains valid, but no specific value for `n` is used in the calculation. The values of `l` and `d1` are used in the expression, but their specific values are not provided, so they remain as part of the output state.
