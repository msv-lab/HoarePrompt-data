Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `d1[i + 2]` is `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]`**

Explanation: The code updates the dictionary `d1` such that the key `i + 2` (which is `2 + 2` or `4`) is assigned the value `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]` (which is `l[3] - l[2] + d1[3]`). The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
