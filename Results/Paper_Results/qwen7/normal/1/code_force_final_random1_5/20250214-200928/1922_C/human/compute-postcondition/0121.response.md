Based on the initial state provided:

- `m` must be greater than 0.
- `x` is an input integer.
- `y` is an input integer and `y` is less than or equal to `x`.

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(d2[y] - d2[x])`.

However, the initial state does not provide any information about `d2`. Since `d2` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its contents. Therefore, we can only describe the expression that will be evaluated but not the exact value.

Output: **d2[y] - d2[x]**
