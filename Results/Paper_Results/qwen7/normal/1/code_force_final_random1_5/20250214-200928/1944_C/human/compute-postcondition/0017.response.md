Output State: **`start` is 1; `vis` is a set containing 0 and 1; `nums[1]` is a truthy value - 1.**

Explanation: The code `nums[start] -= 1` decrements the value of `nums[start]` by 1. Given that `start` is 1 and `nums[1]` must be truthy, let's assume `nums[1]` was initially some truthy value (e.g., 1). After decrementing by 1, `nums[1]` becomes 0, which is still considered truthy in a boolean context. The values of `start` and `vis` remain unchanged.
