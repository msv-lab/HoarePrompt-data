Output State: **`start` is 1; `vis` is a set containing 0; the current value of `nums.get(start + 1, 0)` is falsy**

Explanation: The value of `start` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. The other variables (`vis` and `nums.get(start + 1, 0)`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.
