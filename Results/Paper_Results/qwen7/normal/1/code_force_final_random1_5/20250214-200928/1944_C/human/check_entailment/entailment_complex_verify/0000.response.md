### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and its behavior step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the game rules and computes the MEX as expected.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- Alice and Bob play a game on an array `a` of size `n`.
- Alice starts by picking an element from `a`, appending it to her array `c`, and removing it from `a`.
- Bob then picks an element from `a` and removes it.
- The game continues until `a` is empty.
- The score of the game is the MEX of `c`.

#### Given Program Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function takes an array `arr` as input.
   - It uses a `Counter` to count the frequency of each number in `arr`.
   - It initializes `start` to 0 and a set `vis` to keep track of visited numbers.
   - It enters a loop that continues as long as `nums.get(start, 0)` is truthy.
   - Inside the loop:
     - It marks `start` as visited.
     - It decrements the count of `start` in `nums`.
     - If the next number (`start + 1`) exists and is not visited, it moves to the next number.
     - If no such number exists, it prints `start + 1` and returns.

2. **Behavior Analysis**:
   - The loop in `func_1` does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob.
   - Instead, it tries to find the smallest number that is not present in the counter of the input array, which is not aligned with the game rules.
   - The logic inside the loop does not ensure that Alice and Bob follow their respective strategies (Alice maximizes MEX, Bob minimizes MEX).

3. **Example Test Case**:
   - Consider the test case provided in the problem description:
     ```
     Input:
     1
     4
     0 0 1 1
     ```
   - Expected output:
     ```
     2
     ```
   - However, the program outputs:
     ```
     1
     ```

   - Explanation:
     - The program does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob.
     - It simply tries to find the smallest number that is not present in the counter, which is not the correct approach.

4. **Correct Implementation Outline**:
   - Alice should pick the smallest available number.
   - Bob should pick the largest available number.
   - This ensures that Alice maximizes the MEX and Bob minimizes it.

Given the above analysis, the provided program does not correctly simulate the game's turns and compute the MEX as required. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob as required by the game rules.
