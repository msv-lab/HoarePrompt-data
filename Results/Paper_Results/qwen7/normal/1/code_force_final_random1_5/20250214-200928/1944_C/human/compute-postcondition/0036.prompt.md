You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of non-negative integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \le a_i < n\) and the length of the list is \(n\), with \(1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5\).
def func_1(arr):
    nums = c.Counter(arr)
    start = 0
    vis = set()
    while nums.get(start, 0):
        vis.add(start)
        
        nums[start] -= 1
        
        if nums.get(start + 1, 0):
            nums[start + 1] -= 1
            start += 1
        else:
            print(start + 1)
            return
        
    #State: Output State: `start` is 4; `vis` is a set containing 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4; `nums[4]` is decreased by 1.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `nums.get(start, 0)` is truthy. After the third iteration, `start` is 3, `vis` contains 0, 1, 2, and 3, and `nums[3]` has been decremented. For the fourth iteration, `start` is incremented to 4. Since the problem does not specify the exact values in `nums`, we assume that `nums[4]` is truthy (otherwise, the loop would terminate). Therefore, `nums[4]` is decremented, and `start` is incremented to 5. However, since the problem asks for the state after all iterations and we know the loop will terminate when `nums.get(start, 0)` is falsy, the final state is with `start` being 4, `vis` containing 0 through 4, and `nums[4]` having been decremented once.
    print(start)
    #This is printed: 4
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter arr, which is a list of non-negative integers. Each integer in the list satisfies \(0 \le a_i < n\) and the length of the list is \(n\), with \(1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5\). The function does not return any value since there is no return statement in the provided code.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program does not return any value.

Case_2: The program does not return any value since there is no return statement in the provided code.

Case_3: The program does not return anything since there is no return statement in the provided code.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
