Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the game's final score based on the optimal play of Alice and Bob.
2. The provided code does not correctly implement the logic for determining the game's score. Specifically, it does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob as described in the problem statement.
3. The function `func_1` in the provided code is designed to find the smallest missing positive integer in a list, which is not directly related to the game described. It uses a counter to count the occurrences of each number and then iterates to find the smallest missing number, which is not relevant to the game's rules.
4. The code does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob, nor does it consider the strategic choices they would make to maximize or minimize the MEX of the array `c`.

Given these points, the provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
