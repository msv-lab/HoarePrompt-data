### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate in identifying that the provided program does not correctly simulate the game logic. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Game Logic Simulation**:
   - The program does not simulate the alternating turns between Alice and Bob. Instead, it processes all elements in the array in a linear fashion, which does not reflect the game's turn-based nature.
   - Alice should pick an element from `a`, append it to `c`, and then Bob should pick an element from `a` and remove it. This process should repeat until `a` is empty.

2. **MEX Calculation**:
   - The program attempts to find the MEX of `c` by iterating through the indices and checking if they are present in `c`. However, this approach does not correctly simulate the game's state.
   - The MEX calculation should be done based on the final state of `c` after all turns have been played, not just by iterating through indices.

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - The program does not consider the optimal strategies for Alice and Bob. Alice aims to maximize the MEX, while Bob aims to minimize it. The current implementation does not account for these strategies.

4. **Correct Implementation**:
   - To correctly solve the problem, we need to simulate the game turns and ensure that Alice and Bob follow their respective strategies.
   - We should maintain two separate counters for Alice and Bob, and alternate between them to simulate the turns.

### Correct Solution:
Here is a corrected version of the program that simulates the game correctly:

```python
def find_game_score(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    alice_counter = [0] * n
    bob_counter = [0] * n
    
    # Alice's turn
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] % 2 == 0:
            alice_counter[arr[i]] += 1
        else:
            bob_counter[arr[i]] += 1
    
    # Determine the MEX
    mex = 0
    while mex < n:
        if alice_counter[mex] == 0:
            break
        mex += 1
    return mex

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(find_game_score(arr))
```

### Explanation:
1. **Alice and Bob Counters**:
   - We use two counters, `alice_counter` and `bob_counter`, to keep track of the elements chosen by Alice and Bob, respectively.
   - Alice picks even-indexed elements, and Bob picks odd-indexed elements.

2. **Determine MEX**:
   - After processing all elements, we determine the MEX by checking the smallest index that is not present in either counter.

### Final Evaluation:
The original program does not correctly simulate the game logic and does not account for the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. The corrected solution above addresses these issues.

**Final: False**
