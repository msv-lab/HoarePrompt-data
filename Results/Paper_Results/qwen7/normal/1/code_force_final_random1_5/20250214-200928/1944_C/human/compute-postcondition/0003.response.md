Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `nums.get(start, 0)`. This means the loop will continue as long as `nums.get(start, 0)` returns a non-zero value.

2. **Current State Before the Loop**: 
   - `start` is 0.
   - `vis` is an empty set.

3. **Determine the Required Condition**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `nums.get(start, 0)` must return a non-zero value.
   - Given that `start` is 0, the expression `nums.get(0, 0)` will return the value at index 0 of the `nums` dictionary (or 0 if the key does not exist).

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - We need to ensure that `nums.get(0, 0)` is non-zero for the loop to execute the first time.
   - Since `vis` is an empty set, it doesn't directly affect the loop condition unless `nums` is somehow influenced by `vis`.

5. **Final State**:
   - The only state that needs to be adjusted is the value at `nums[0]` to ensure it is non-zero.

Therefore, the final state right before the loop should be:

**State: `start` is 0, `nums` must have a non-zero value at index 0**
