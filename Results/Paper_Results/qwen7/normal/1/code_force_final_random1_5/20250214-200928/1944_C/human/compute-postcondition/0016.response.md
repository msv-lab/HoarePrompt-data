Output State: **`start` is 1; `vis` is a set containing 0 and 1; `nums[1]` must be truthy**

Explanation: The code `vis.add(start)` adds the value of `start`, which is 1, to the set `vis`. Initially, `vis` contains the value 0. After executing the code, `vis` will contain both 0 and 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
