Postcondition: `test_cases` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `i` is 1, `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `n` must be greater than 1, `f` is the second element of the list `feat`, `a` is the third element of the list `feat`, `b` is the last element of the list `feat`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `array2` is an empty list, and the condition `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a` is true.
