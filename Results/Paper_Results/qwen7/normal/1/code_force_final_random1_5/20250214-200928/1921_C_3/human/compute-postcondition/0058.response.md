Postcondition: `i` is `n-1`, `n` is `feat[0]`, and `array2` contains elements `(arr[i+1] - arr[i]) * a` for each `i` where `arr[i+1] - arr[i] < b / a` starting from `i = 1` up to `i = n-1`. Additionally, if the sum of `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is less than `f`, then the sum of `array2` remains as calculated. Otherwise, `array2` contains elements `(arr[i+1] - arr[i]) * a` for each `i` where `arr[i+1] - arr[i] >= b / a` starting from `i = 1` up to `i = n-1`.
