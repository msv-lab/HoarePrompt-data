Output State: The output state after the loop executes all its iterations is determined by the final evaluation of the condition `sum(array2) + (n - len(array2)) * b < f`. If this condition evaluates to `True`, the output will be 'Yes' printed for each iteration. If the condition evaluates to `False`, the output will be 'No' printed for each iteration. 

In more detail, after all iterations of the loop, `array2` will contain all the elements `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` for every index `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1` (inclusive) where the condition `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a` is satisfied across all inputs processed by the loop. The variable `n` will hold the value of `feat[0]` for each input, and `f`, `a`, and `b` will retain their respective values from the last input processed. The final output will consist of 'Yes' or 'No' based on whether the sum of elements in `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is less than `f` or not, respectively, for each input processed by the loop.
