Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `arr` and `array2` will be such that `array2` contains all the elements `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` for every index `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1` (inclusive) where the condition `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a` is satisfied. The variable `arr` remains unchanged from its initial state, while `array2` is updated with new elements based on the specified condition for each iteration of the loop.
