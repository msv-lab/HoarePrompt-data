Output State: **`feat` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is `feat[1]`, `n` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, and `array2` is empty.**

Explanation: The code assigns the last element of the list `feat` to the variable `b`. The other variables (`feat`, `i`, `n`, `a`, and `array2`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
