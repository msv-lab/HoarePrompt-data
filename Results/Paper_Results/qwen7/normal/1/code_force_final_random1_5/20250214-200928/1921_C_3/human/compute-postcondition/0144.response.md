Postcondition: **The final state of `array2` will contain elements based on the conditions met during the loop execution. If the sum of elements in `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is less than `f`, the condition holds. Otherwise, if the sum is greater than or equal to `f`, the condition still holds and `array2` contains elements based on the conditions met during the loop execution.**
