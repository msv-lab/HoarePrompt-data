Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `arr` and `array2` will be such that for every pair of consecutive elements in `arr` (from index 1 to n-1), if the difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[i - 1]` is less than `b / a`, then `array2` will contain an additional element `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`. Otherwise, `array2` remains unchanged. This process is repeated for each pair of consecutive elements in `arr` from the start to the end of the list.

In simpler terms, `array2` will contain the product of the difference between each pair of consecutive elements in `arr` and the ratio `a`, but only if that difference is smaller than `b / a`.
