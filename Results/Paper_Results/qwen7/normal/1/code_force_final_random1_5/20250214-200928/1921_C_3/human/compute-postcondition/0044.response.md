Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is `feat[0]`, and `array2` has an additional element which is `(arr[3] - arr[2]) * a`.**

Explanation: The code appends a new element to `array2`. The element is calculated as `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`. Given that `i` is 3, the expression simplifies to `(arr[3] - arr[2]) * a`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `array2` (other than the newly added element) remain unchanged from the initial state.
