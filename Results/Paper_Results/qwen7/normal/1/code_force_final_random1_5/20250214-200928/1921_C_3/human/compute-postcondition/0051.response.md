Output State: **Postcondition: `i` is `n-1`, `n` is `feat[0]`, and `array2` contains elements `(arr[i+1] - arr[i]) * a` for each `i` where `arr[i+1] - arr[i] < b / a` starting from `i = 1` up to `i = n-1`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be `n-1` (since the loop runs from `1` to `n-1`). The variable `n` remains unchanged as it was initialized from `feat[0]`. The list `array2` will contain the product of the difference between consecutive elements of `arr` and `a`, but only if that difference is less than `b/a`. This means `array2` will include `(arr[i+1] - arr[i]) * a` for every index `i` from `1` to `n-1` where the condition `arr[i+1] - arr[i] < b / a` is satisfied.
