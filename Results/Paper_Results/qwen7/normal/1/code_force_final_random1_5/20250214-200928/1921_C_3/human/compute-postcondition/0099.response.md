Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(test_cases)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `test_cases`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < test_cases`.

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is `n-1`
   - `n` is the first element of `feat`
   - `array2` contains elements based on the specified conditions
   - The sum of `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` will be either less than `f` or greater than or equal to `f`

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently `n-1`, for the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become `n`.
   - `test_cases` remains unchanged because it is the upper limit of the range.

5. **Formulate the New State**:
   - `i` will be `n`
   - `test_cases` remains the same (let's denote it as `tc`)
   - `n` remains the first element of `feat`
   - `array2` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration

Therefore, the new state for the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is `n`, `test_cases` is `tc`, `n` is the first element of `feat`, `array2` contains elements based on the specified conditions**.
