State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `i` is 1**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains two variables: `i` and `test_cases`.
2. For the loop to execute, the condition `test_cases` must be greater than 0 (since `range(test_cases)` will not include 0).
3. Additionally, `test_cases` must be less than or equal to \(10^4\) as per the given constraint.
4. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 by the `range(test_cases)` function, but the loop body starts with `i` being 1 (the first iteration).

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect these conditions for the loop to execute properly.
