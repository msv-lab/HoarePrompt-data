Output State: **`p` is equal to `j`, `i` is the last element of the list `s`, `j` is equal to the length of the list `s` minus 2, `ans1` is 0, `s[p]` and `s[k - 1]` have swapped values.**

Explanation: The code swaps the elements at indices `p` and `k - 1` in the list `s`. Since `p` is equal to `j` and `j` is the length of the list `s` minus 2, `p` is also the length of the list `s` minus 2. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it is the last element of the list `s`. The value of `ans1` remains 0 as it was not affected by the code. The values of `s[p]` and `s[k - 1]` have swapped, but the exact values are not specified in the initial state, so they are described in terms of their new positions.
