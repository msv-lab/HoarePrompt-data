Output State: **`ind` contains the value `i`, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` remains the same, and `c` is increased by 1.**

This means that the variable `c` has been incremented by 1, while `ind` still holds the value of `i`, `i` has been incremented by 1, and `n` remains unchanged from its previous state.
