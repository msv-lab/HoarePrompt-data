Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the value `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `i` is not initialized in the loop head; it will be set to 0 initially.
   - `n` is derived from the length of the list `a`, which is a list of `n` distinct integers.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `i` will start at 0, no adjustment is needed for `i`.
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1 because `i` starts at 0 and the loop continues while `i < n`.

Given the initial state:
- `ind` is an empty list.
- `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers.
- `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= n`.
- `x` is the `k`-th element of list `a`.
- `c` is 0.

We need to ensure that the loop can start executing, which means `n` must be at least 1.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:

**State: **`ind` is an empty list, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= n`, `x` is the `k`-th element of list `a`, `c` is 0**.
