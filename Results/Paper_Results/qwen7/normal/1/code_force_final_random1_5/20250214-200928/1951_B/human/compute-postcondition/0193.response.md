Output State: **`i` is the next value in the sequence `s` after the previous value of `i`; variable `j` is increased by 1**.

This means that the value of `i` remains the same as its previous state (being the next value in the sequence `s` after the previous value of `i`), and the value of `j` is incremented by 1.
