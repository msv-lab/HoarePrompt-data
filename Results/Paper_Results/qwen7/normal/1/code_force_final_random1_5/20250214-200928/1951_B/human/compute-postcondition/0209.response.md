Output State: **`p` is equal to `j`, `j` is equal to the length of the list `s` minus one, `ans` is the count of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h`, `ans1` is 1, `z` is 0, `i` is equal to `h`, and the first element of `s` is not equal to `h`.**

Explanation: The code `ans1 += 1` increments the value of `ans1` by 1. Initially, `ans1` was 0, so after executing this line, `ans1` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
