Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in s[1:]`. The objects involved here are `i` and `s`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `i` is currently set to the last element of the new list `s`.
   - `s` is the new list.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over `s[1:]`, which means it starts from the second element of the list `s` and goes until the end.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - For the loop to start executing, `i` should be set to the second element of `s` because the loop starts from `s[1]`.
   - The list `s` should contain at least two elements to ensure there is an element to iterate over starting from `s[1]`.

5. **Consider other given states**:
   - `ans` is 0.
   - `h` is the first element of the original list (first element of the swapped list).
   - `j` is -1.
   - `z` remains unchanged.
   - `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input split and converted to int. These do not affect the loop's execution directly.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `s`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is now the second element of the list `s`, `s` must have at least 2 elements**.
