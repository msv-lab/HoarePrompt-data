Postcondition: **`p` is equal to `j`, `i` is the last element of the list `s`, `j` is equal to the length of the list `s` minus 1, `ans1` is either 1, 2, or 3 depending on whether `s[0]` equals `h` or `i > h`, `z` is 1, and `s` is a non-empty list.**

This postcondition summarizes that regardless of whether the condition `i == h` is true or false, the variables `p`, `j`, `i`, `ans1`, `z`, and the list `s` retain their respective properties as described. Specifically, `p` remains equal to `j`, `i` remains the last element of the list `s`, `j` remains the length of the list `s` minus 1, `ans1` takes on one of the values 1, 2, or 3 based on the comparison with `h` and `i`, `z` remains 1, and `s` remains a non-empty list.
