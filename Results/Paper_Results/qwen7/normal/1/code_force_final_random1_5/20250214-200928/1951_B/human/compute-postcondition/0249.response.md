Postcondition: `p` is equal to the length of the list `s` minus one, `ans` is the count of elements in `s` that are less than or equal to `h`, `z` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether the condition `i_next > h` is true or false. If `i > h`, then we break out of the loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `z` is 1, then `ans` is incremented by 1.
