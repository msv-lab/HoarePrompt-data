Output State: **`i` is the third element of the list `s`, `j` is increased by 2**.

Explanation: The variable `j` was previously increased by 1, and the code snippet increments `j` by 1 again, making `j` increased by 2 in total. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it is the third element of the list `s`.
