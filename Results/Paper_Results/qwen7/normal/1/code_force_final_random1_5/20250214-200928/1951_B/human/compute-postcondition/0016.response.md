Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`; `ind` is a list containing the value of `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `ind.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` to the list `ind`. Since `i` is initially `i + 1`, appending `i` to the list `ind` means that `ind` now contains the value of `i + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
