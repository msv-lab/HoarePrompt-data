Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `n` remains the same, `ind` contains the value `i`, and `c` is increased by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This means that the `break` statement causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is currently in. The values of `i`, `n`, `ind`, and `c` are updated according to the conditions specified before the `break` statement was encountered, but no further changes occur to these variables after the `break`.
