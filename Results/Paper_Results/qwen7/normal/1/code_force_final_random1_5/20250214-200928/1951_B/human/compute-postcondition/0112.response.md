Output State: **`p` is equal to `j`, `i` is the last element of the list `s`, `j` is equal to the length of the list `s` minus 2, `ans1` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `ans1 = 0` initializes `ans1` to 0. This assignment does not affect the values of `p`, `i`, `j`, or the list `s`. Therefore, their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
