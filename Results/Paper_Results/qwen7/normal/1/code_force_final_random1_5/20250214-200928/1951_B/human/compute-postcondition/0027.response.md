Postcondition: `i` is incremented by 1, `n` remains the same, `ind` contains the value `i`, and `c` is increased by 1. If `a[i]` is greater than `x`, then `ind` contains the value `i`, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` remains the same, and `c` is increased by 1. If `a[i]` is not greater than `x`, then no changes occur to `ind`, `i`, `n`, and `c` remain as they were before the if statement.
