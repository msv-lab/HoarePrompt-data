Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
   - `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers assigned the values from the input split by spaces.
   - `mn` is the sum of `min(a, b)` and `m`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(mn // a + mn // b)
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - Since `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers assigned from the input split by spaces, let's denote them as `a`, `b`, and `m` respectively.
   - `mn` is calculated as `min(a, b) + m`.

4. **Expression Evaluation:**
   - The expression inside the `print` function is `mn // a + mn // b`.
   - This means we need to evaluate `min(a, b) + m` and then divide it by `a` and `b` separately, and finally add the results.

Given the initial state, the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are not specified, but we know they are integers. Let's assume some example values to illustrate the calculation:

- Suppose `a = 4`, `b = 6`, and `m = 2`.
- Then `mn = min(4, 6) + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6`.
- Now, `mn // a + mn // b = 6 // 4 + 6 // 6 = 1 + 1 = 2`.

However, since the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are not provided, we can express the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **min(a, b) // a + min(a, b) // b + m // a + m // b**
