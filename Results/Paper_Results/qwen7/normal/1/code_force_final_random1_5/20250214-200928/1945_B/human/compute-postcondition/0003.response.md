Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `mn` is the sum of `min(a, b)` and `m`.**

The code calculates the minimum of `a` and `b` and adds `m` to it, storing the result in `mn`. The values of `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `m` remain unchanged.
