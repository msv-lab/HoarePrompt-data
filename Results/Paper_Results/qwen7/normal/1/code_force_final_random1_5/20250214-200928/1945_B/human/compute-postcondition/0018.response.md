Output State: **`i` is 2, `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers obtained from the input split.**

Explanation: The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `m`. The values of `i` and `t` remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` is still 2, and `t` is still an integer between 1 and \(10^4\). The values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are the integers obtained from the input split.
