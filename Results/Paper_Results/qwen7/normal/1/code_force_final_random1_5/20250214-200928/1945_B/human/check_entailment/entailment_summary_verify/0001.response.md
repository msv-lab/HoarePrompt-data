### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.
   - Fireworks from the first installation are launched every `a` minutes.
   - Fireworks from the second installation are launched every `b` minutes.
   - Each firework is visible for `m + 1` minutes after launch.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - The critical point is to understand when fireworks from both installations overlap in visibility.
   - If `m` is a multiple of both `a` and `b`, then the overlaps occur more frequently.

3. **Analysis of the Given Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `a`, `b`, and `m`.
   - It calculates `mn = min(a, b) + m`.
   - It checks if `m` is a common multiple of `a` and `b` and if `a` and `b` are not 1.
     - If true, it prints `(mn // a) + (mn // b) + 1`.
     - Otherwise, it prints `(mn // a) + (mn // b)`.

4. **Issues in the Code:**
   - The logic for checking if `m` is a common multiple of `a` and `b` is flawed.
   - The condition `if m % a == 0 and m % b == 0` does not correctly determine if `m` is a common multiple of `a` and `b`.
   - The formula `(mn // a) + (mn // b) + 1` and `(mn // a) + (mn // b)` do not account for the overlapping intervals correctly.

5. **Correct Approach:**
   - To find the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously, we should use the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`.
   - The LCM of `a` and `b` gives the interval where both installations launch fireworks simultaneously.
   - We then calculate how many such intervals fit into the visibility period `m`.

6. **Function Summary Analysis:**
   - The provided function summary incorrectly describes the logic of the code.
   - The summary suggests that the code calculates the minimum number of times two fireworks need to be launched so that they are visible simultaneously, which is not accurate.

7. **Corrected Code:**
   - The corrected code uses the LCM of `a` and `b` to determine the intervals where both installations launch fireworks simultaneously.
   - It calculates the number of such intervals within the visibility period `m` and adds the initial simultaneous launch.

### Conclusion:
The original code has logical errors in determining the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously. The provided function summary also incorrectly describes the logic of the code. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Final: False**
