Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `t`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < t`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\)
   - `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers assigned from the input split by spaces
   - `mn` is the sum of `min(a, b)` and `m`

4. **Check the loop continuation condition**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `t`.

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 2.
   - `t` remains unchanged because it is the number of iterations specified by the user/input.

6. **Conditions for `t`**:
   - `t` must still be an integer between 1 and \(10^4\).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 2, `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\)**
