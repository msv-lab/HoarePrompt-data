Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the input is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4, the value of `t` is updated to this input integer. All other variables remain unchanged, specifically maintaining their initial state where they can hold any values, but since no other variables are mentioned or modified, they are not included in the output state.
