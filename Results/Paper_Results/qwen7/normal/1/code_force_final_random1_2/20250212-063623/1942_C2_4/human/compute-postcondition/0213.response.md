Postcondition: `ans` is increased by the sum of all elements in the `odd` list plus 2 times the initial value of `y`, `y` is 0, `even` is a non-empty list, and `gap` is the first element of `even`. If `y < gap // 2`, then `ans` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged as well since there is no else part provided.
