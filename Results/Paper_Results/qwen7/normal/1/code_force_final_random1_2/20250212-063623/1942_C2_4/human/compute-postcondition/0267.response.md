Output State: **`x` must be greater than 0; `next_elem` is `a[0] + n` if `i` equals `x - 1`, otherwise `next_elem` is `a[i + 1]`**.

This means that the value of `x` remains greater than 0, and `next_elem` is determined based on the condition given. If `i` equals `x - 1`, then `next_elem` is the sum of `a[0]` and `n`. Otherwise, `next_elem` is the element at index `i + 1` in the list `a`.
