Postcondition: `len(a)` is at least 2, `i` is 1. If the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is 2, then `ans` is increased by 1. If the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is not 2 but is even, then `tmp` is a list containing the value `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`, and `ans` is increased by `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`. In both cases, the values of `a`, `i`, `y`, `tmp`, and `ans` satisfy these conditions, and if the difference is neither 2 nor an even number, the values of `a`, `i`, `y`, `tmp`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
