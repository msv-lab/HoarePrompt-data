Output State: **`ans` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `x` is an integer, `ii` is `tt`, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `n, x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated inputs from the user and converts them into integers, assigning them to the variables `n`, `x`, and `y` respectively. The variables `ans`, `a`, `x`, `ii` remain unchanged from their initial state.
