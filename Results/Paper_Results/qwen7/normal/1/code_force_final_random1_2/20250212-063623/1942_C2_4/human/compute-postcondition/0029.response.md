Output State: **`ans` is the value of `ans` after the previous iteration, `a` is the list `a` with its original values, `i` is the value of `i` after the previous iteration incremented by 1, `tmp` is a list containing the value `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` to the list `tmp`. Here, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, so `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` refer to the current and previous elements of the list `a`, respectively. Since the exact values of `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` are not given, we express the appended value in terms of these elements. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
