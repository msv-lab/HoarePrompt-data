Postcondition: `ans` is the value of `ans` after the previous iteration, `a` is the list `a` with its original values, `i` is the value of `i` after the previous iteration incremented by 1. If `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0` and `y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, then `ans` is updated by adding `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` to its previous value, `y` is decreased by `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, and a temporary list `tmp` is created containing the value `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `ans`, `y` remains unchanged, and `tmp` is not created.
