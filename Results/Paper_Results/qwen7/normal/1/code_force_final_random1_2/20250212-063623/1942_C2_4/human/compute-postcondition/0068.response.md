Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `a`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `len(a)` is at least 2.
   - `i` is 1.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `len(a) - 1`. This means `i` starts at 1 and will increment until it reaches `len(a) - 1`.

4. **Analyze the loop body**:
   - The loop checks the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]`.
   - Depending on the difference, it updates `ans` and `tmp` accordingly.

5. **Determine the new state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, the next value of `i` will be `2`.
   - We need to ensure that `len(a)` remains at least 2 (which it should, as no operation in the loop changes its length).

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `i` will be 2.
- `len(a)` will still be at least 2.

Therefore, the updated state is:

**State: **`len(a)` is at least 2, `i` is 2**
