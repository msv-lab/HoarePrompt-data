Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the chosen vertices are consecutive. For example, consider the following input:

```
4 2 2
1 3
```

In this case, the chosen vertices are 1 and 3. According to the problem description, we can choose up to 2 additional vertices. However, the current implementation does not account for the possibility of choosing the vertices 2 and 4, which would allow us to form 2 triangles (1-2-3 and 3-4-1). 

The program currently calculates the number of triangles based on the gaps between the chosen vertices, but it does not consider the full potential of forming triangles by including additional vertices. This leads to an incorrect count of the maximum number of triangles that can be formed.
