Output State: **`tmp` contains an additional element which is `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`, `ans` is increased by `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, `a` and `i` retain their original values.**

Explanation: The code subtracts `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1` from `y`. This operation does not affect `tmp`, `ans`, `a`, or `i`. Therefore, these variables retain their original values. The only change is that `y` is updated by subtracting the specified value.
