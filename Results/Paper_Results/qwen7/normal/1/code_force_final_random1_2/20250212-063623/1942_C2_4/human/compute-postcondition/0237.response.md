Output State: **`ans` is increased by the sum of all elements in the `odd` list plus 4, `y` is 0, `t` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers input by the user.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of space-separated integers from the user input and converts them into a list of integers using `map(int, input().split())`. This list is assigned to the variable `a`. The values of `ans`, `y`, `t`, `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged from their initial state.
