Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers n, x, and y, followed by x distinct integers from 1 to n. For each test case, it calculates a value based on specific conditions involving these integers and the provided list of integers. Finally, it prints a result for each test case, which is determined by the given logic and constraints.**
