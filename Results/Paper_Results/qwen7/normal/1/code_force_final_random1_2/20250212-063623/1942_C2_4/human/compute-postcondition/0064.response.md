Postcondition: `len(a)` is at least 2, `i` is 1, the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is not equal to 2, and the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is even; if the current value of `y` is greater than the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` divided by 2 minus 1, then `tmp` is a list containing the value `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`, `ans` is increased by `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`; otherwise, `tmp` and `ans` remain unchanged.
