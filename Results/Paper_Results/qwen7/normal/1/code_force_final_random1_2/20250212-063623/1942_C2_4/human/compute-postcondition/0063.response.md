Output State: **`len(a)` is at least 2, `i` is 1, the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is not equal to 2, the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is even, and the current value of `y` is greater than the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` divided by 2 minus 2; `tmp` is a list containing the value `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`; `ans` is increased by `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1**.

Explanation: The value of `y` is decreased by the value of `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`. Since the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is even and not equal to 2, and given that `y` was initially greater than the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` divided by 2 minus 1, the new value of `y` is now greater than the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` divided by 2 minus 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
