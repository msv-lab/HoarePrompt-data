Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `ii` and `tt`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `ii` is less than `tt`.

3. **Initial State**: The initial state is given as `tt` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq tt \leq 10^4\).

4. **Adjusting the State**: For the loop to execute, `ii` must start from 0 (the default starting point for the `range` function) and `tt` must be greater than 0.

Given this information, we need to adjust the state to ensure the loop can execute. Specifically, we need to set `ii` to 0 and ensure `tt` is greater than 0.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`tt` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq tt \leq 10^4\), `ii` is 0**
