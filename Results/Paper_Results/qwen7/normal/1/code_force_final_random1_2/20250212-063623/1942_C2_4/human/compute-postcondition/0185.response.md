Output State: **`ans` is increased by 2 times the value of `y`, `gap` is the first element in the `odd` list, `y` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `ans`, `gap`, or `y`. It only breaks out of the innermost loop or if statement it is inside. Since no changes are made to the variables, their previous values remain the same.
