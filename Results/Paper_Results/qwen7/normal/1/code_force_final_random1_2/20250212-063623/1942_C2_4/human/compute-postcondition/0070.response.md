Output State: **`len(a)` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `tmp` contains an element which is (a[2] - a[1]) // 2**

Explanation: The code appends to `tmp` a tuple containing half the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i-1]`. Given `i` is 2, this translates to appending `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2` to `tmp`. The length of `a` and the value of `i` remain unchanged.
