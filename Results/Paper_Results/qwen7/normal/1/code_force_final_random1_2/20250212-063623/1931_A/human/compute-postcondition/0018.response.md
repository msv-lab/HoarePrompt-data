To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the conditions for the variable `word`.

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is an integer between 1 and 100.
   - `word` is defined based on the value of `n`:
     - If `n > 52`, then `word` is "zz" followed by the character from the `alphabet` list at index `n - 53`.
     - If `n` is between 27 and 52, then `word` is 'az'.
     - If `n` is between 1 and 26, then `word` is 'aaa'.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement simply outputs the value of `word`.

Given these conditions, let's consider the possible values of `word`:

- If `n` is between 1 and 26, `word` is 'aaa'.
- If `n` is between 27 and 52, `word` is 'az'.
- If `n` is greater than 52, `word` is "zz" followed by the character from the `alphabet` list at index `n - 53`.

Since the exact value of `n` is not specified, we need to consider the general cases:

- If `n` is between 1 and 26, `word` is 'aaa'.
- If `n` is between 27 and 52, `word` is 'az'.
- If `n` is greater than 52, `word` is "zz" followed by a specific character from the alphabet.

Therefore, the output depends on the value of `n`:

- If `n` is between 1 and 26, the output is: **'aaa'**.
- If `n` is between 27 and 52, the output is: **'az'**.
- If `n` is greater than 52, the output is: **"zz" followed by the character from the alphabet list at index (n - 53)**.

Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we can only describe the possible outputs based on the given ranges.

Output: **'aaa', 'az', or "zz" followed by the character from the alphabet list at index (n - 53) depending on the value of n**
