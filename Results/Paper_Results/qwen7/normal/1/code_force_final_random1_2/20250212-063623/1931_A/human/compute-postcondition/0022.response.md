Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `word` is 'zz' plus the character corresponding to `n - 53` in the alphabet followed by 'zz', `i` is incremented by 1**.

Explanation: The code appends the character from the alphabet corresponding to `n - 53` followed by 'zz' to the variable `word`. Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `n - 53` will range from -52 to 47. However, since the alphabet starts from 0 (assuming a zero-indexed alphabet), the valid range for `n - 53` is from 0 to 25, which corresponds to the lowercase English alphabet. The values outside this range are not relevant as they would not contribute a valid character. The variable `i` is incremented by 1, and the initial state of `word` is an empty string, which is updated to include 'zz' plus the character from the alphabet.
