Reasoning:
Let's analyze the logic of the provided program to see if it correctly generates the lexicographically smallest three-letter word for each given encoded value \( n \).

1. **Case Analysis**:
   - If \( n > 52 \):
     - The program appends 'zz' to the character at position \( n - 53 \). This means the third character is 'z', and the second character is 'z'. The first character is determined by the character at position \( n - 53 \).
   - If \( n > 26 \) and \( n \leq 52 \):
     - The program appends 'z' to the character at position \( n - 28 \) and 'a' before it. This means the third character is 'z', the second character is 'z', and the first character is 'a'.
   - If \( n \leq 26 \):
     - The program appends 'zz' to the character at position \( n - 3 \) and 'aa' before it. This means the third character is 'z', the second character is 'z', and the first character is 'a'.

2. **Correctness Check**:
   - For \( n > 52 \): 
     - The character at position \( n - 53 \) should be the largest possible character to minimize the word lexicographically, which is 'z'. So, the word should be of the form 'z' + 'z' + character at position \( n - 53 \). This matches the logic.
   - For \( n > 26 \) and \( n \leq 52 \):
     - The character at position \( n - 28 \) should be the largest possible character to minimize the word lexicographically, which is 'z'. So, the word should be of the form 'a' + 'z' + 'z'. This matches the logic.
   - For \( n \leq 26 \):
     - The character at position \( n - 3 \) should be the smallest possible character to minimize the word lexicographically, which is 'a'. So, the word should be of the form 'a' + 'a' + 'z'. This matches the logic.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to generate the lexicographically smallest three-letter word for each encoded value \( n \).

Correctness: **True**
