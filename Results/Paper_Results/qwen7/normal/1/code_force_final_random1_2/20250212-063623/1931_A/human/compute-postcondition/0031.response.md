Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (input integer), `word` is either 'zz' plus the character corresponding to `n - 53` in the alphabet followed by 'zz' or 'az' or 'aaa', `i` is incremented by 1, and the input value remains the same.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input to `n`. Since the input can be any integer between 1 and 100, `n` is updated to the input integer. The other variables (`word` and `i`) remain unchanged as per the initial state.
