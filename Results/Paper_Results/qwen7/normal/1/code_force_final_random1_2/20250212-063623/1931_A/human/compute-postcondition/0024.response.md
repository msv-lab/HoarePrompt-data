Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `word` is 'aaa', `i` is incremented by 1**.

Explanation: The code appends `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]` to the variable `word`. Given that `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `n - 3` will be an integer between -2 and 97. Assuming `alphabet` is a list or dictionary of alphabets starting from 'a', `alphabet[n - 3]` will be a character corresponding to the index `n - 3`. For simplicity, if we assume `alphabet` is a standard English alphabet list, `alphabet[0]` is 'a', `alphabet[1]` is 'b', and so on. Therefore, `alphabet[n - 3]` will be a character, and appending `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]` to `word` results in `word` becoming `'aaa'`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged except that `i` is incremented by 1.
