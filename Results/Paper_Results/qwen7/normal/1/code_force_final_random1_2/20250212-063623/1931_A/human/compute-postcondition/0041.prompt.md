Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 78; alphabet is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z'.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    word = ''
    if n > 52:
        word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'
    elif n > 26:
        word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'
    else:
        word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]
    print(word)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, and `word` is either "zz" followed by the character from the `alphabet` list at index `n - 53` if `n` is greater than 52, or 'az' if `n` is between 27 and 52, or 'aaa' if `n` is between 1 and 26.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `word` is either 'zz' plus the character corresponding to `n - 53` in the alphabet followed by 'zz' or 'az' or 'aaa', `i` is incremented by 1, and the input value remains the same.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `word` is either a string containing the character from `alphabet` at index `n - 53` followed by 'zz', or a string containing 'az' followed by the character corresponding to `alphabet[n - 28]` or 'aaa', and `i` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
