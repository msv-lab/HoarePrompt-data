Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head is `for i in range(int(input())):`. The only variable here is `i`.

2. **Understand the Current State:**
   - `n` is an integer between 1 and 100.
   - `word` is either 'zz' plus the character corresponding to `n - 53` in the alphabet followed by 'zz' or 'az' or 'aaa'.
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
   - The input value remains the same.

3. **Determine the New State:**
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - The input value remains the same, so `n` will still be the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - The value of `word` does not change within the loop, so it remains the same.

Given these points, let's construct the new state:

- `n` remains the same.
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `word` remains the same.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `word` is either 'zz' plus the character corresponding to `n - 53` in the alphabet followed by 'zz' or 'az' or 'aaa', `i` is incremented by 1, and the input value remains the same**.
