Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `word` is a string containing 'az' followed by the character corresponding to `alphabet[n - 28]`, `i` is incremented by 1**.

Explanation: The code appends `'a'`, the character from `alphabet` at index `n - 28`, and `'z'` to the string `word`. Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `n - 28` will be an integer between -27 and 72. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but its exact value is not specified in the initial state, so we only know it has been incremented. The initial state of `word` being an empty string means it now contains `'az'` followed by the character from `alphabet` at index `n - 28`.
