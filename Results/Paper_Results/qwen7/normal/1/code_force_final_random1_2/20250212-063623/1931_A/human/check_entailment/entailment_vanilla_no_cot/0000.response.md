Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly handle all possible encodings for the given constraints. Let's analyze why:

1. **Case Analysis**:
   - If `n > 52`, the solution incorrectly assumes that the word will be of the form `[n-53]zz`. This is incorrect because `n` can be up to 78, and the correct form should be `[n-53]zz` only if `n-53 <= 26`.
   - If `n > 26`, the solution incorrectly assumes that the word will be of the form `a[n-28]z`. This is incorrect because `n` can be up to 52, and the correct form should be `a[n-28]z` only if `n-28 <= 26`.

2. **General Case**:
   - For any `n` in the range 3 to 78, the correct approach is to find the lexicographically smallest word by breaking down `n` into the sum of positions of three letters.
   - Specifically, we need to find three letters such that their positions sum up to `n` and the word is lexicographically smallest.

### Correct Solution:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import string

def func():
    alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        word = ''
        # Find the largest letter first
        for i in range(25, -1, -1):
            if n >= i + 1:
                word += alphabet[i]
                n -= i + 1
        # Ensure the word is three letters long
        while len(word) < 3:
            word += 'a'
        print(word)

# Example usage
func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Solution:
1. **Finding the Largest Letter First**: We start by finding the largest possible letter (from 'z' to 'a') that can fit into the remaining sum `n`. We subtract the position of this letter from `n` and append it to the word.
2. **Ensuring Three Letters**: After finding the largest possible letter, we ensure that the word is exactly three letters long by appending 'a' to the end if necessary.
3. **Output**: Finally, we print the constructed word.

This approach ensures that the word is lexicographically smallest and correctly handles all possible encodings within the given constraints.
