Output State: **i is equal to `n-1`, `a` is a list of `n` elements where each element `a[j]` (for `j` from 0 to `n-1`) is calculated as `a[j] = 1000 + sum(x[k] for k in range(j+1))`, and `n` retains its value as it was last updated via user input.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations:
- The variable `i` will be equal to `n-1`, indicating the last index of the list `a` that was processed.
- The list `a` will contain `n` elements, where each element `a[j]` (for `j` from 0 to `n-1`) is the sum of 1000 and the first `j+1` elements from the list `x`.
- The variable `n` will retain its value as it was last updated via user input.
