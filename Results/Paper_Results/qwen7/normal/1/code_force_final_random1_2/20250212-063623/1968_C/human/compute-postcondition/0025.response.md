Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop runs from `1` to `n-1`, so the loop continues as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` is updated to the value of `int(input())`.
   - `i` is in the range `[1, n-1]`.
   - `a[i]` is assigned the value `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from `1` and goes up to `n-1`, at the end of each iteration, `i` is incremented by `1`.
   - Therefore, if `i` was in the range `[1, n-1]` before the iteration, after the iteration, `i` will be in the range `[2, n]`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `i` will be incremented by `1` from its previous value.
   - `n` remains the same as it is updated only once per input.

Given these points, let's update the state:

- `i` will be incremented by `1` from its previous value, so if `i` was in the range `[1, n-1]`, after the increment, `i` will be in the range `[2, n]`.
- `n` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the new state should reflect `i` being incremented by `1` and still within the range `[1, n-1]` but now starting from `2`.

**Final State**:
State: **`n` is updated to the value of `int(input())`, `i` is in the range `[2, n-1]`, and `a[i]` is assigned the value `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`**.
