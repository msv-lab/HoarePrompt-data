Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `n` is updated to the value of `int(input())`, `i` is in the range `[n-1]`, and `a[i]` is assigned the value `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`. The list `a` will have a length of `n`, with `a[0]` being 1000 and each subsequent element `a[i]` (for `i` in the range `[1, n-1]`) being the cumulative sum of the elements in the list `x` up to index `i`.

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes, the list `a` will contain the cumulative sums of the elements in the list `x`, starting with `a[0]` as 1000. Each element `a[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n-1`) will be the sum of `a[0]` and the sum of the first `i` elements of `x`.
