Output State: **`n` is updated to the value of `int(input())`, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `a[i]` is `a[0] + sum(x)`, `x` is a list of integers obtained from `input().split()` converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of space-separated integers using `input().split()`, converts them to integers using `map(int, ...)` and assigns the resulting list to the variable `x`. The values of `n`, `i`, and `a[i]` are not directly modified by this code, but `x` is now a list of integers based on the user's input. The precondition that `n` must be at least 2 remains valid, but since the code does not check this condition, we assume it holds true.
