Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `t` (number of test cases), an integer `n` (length of the list `x` + 1), and a list `x` of `n-1` integers. It then calculates a list `a` of length `n` where each element `a[j]` is the sum of 1000 and the first `j+1` elements of `x`. Finally, it prints the list `a` for each test case.**
