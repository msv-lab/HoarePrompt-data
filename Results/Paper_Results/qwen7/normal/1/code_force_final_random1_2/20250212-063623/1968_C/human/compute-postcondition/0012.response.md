Output State: `i` is equal to `n-1`, `a[i]` is `a[0] + sum(x)`, `n` must be at least 2.

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be one less than `n` (i.e., `n-1`). The value of `a[i]` will be the initial value of `a[0]` plus the sum of all elements in the list `x`. Additionally, `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to have executed even once.
