Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `n`. Since the input is taken from the user, the exact value of `n` cannot be determined without additional information. However, we know that `t` remains unchanged and is still a positive integer within the specified range.
