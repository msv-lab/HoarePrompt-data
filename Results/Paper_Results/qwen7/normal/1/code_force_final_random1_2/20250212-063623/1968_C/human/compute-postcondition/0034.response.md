Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `a` is a list of `n` zeros with the first element being 1000.**

Explanation: The code sets `a[0]` to 1000, which changes the value of the first element in the list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial state.
