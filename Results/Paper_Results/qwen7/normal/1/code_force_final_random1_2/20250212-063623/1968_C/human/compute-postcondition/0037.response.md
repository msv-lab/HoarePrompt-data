Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is less than `n`
   - `x` is a list of integers
   - `a` is a list of `n` zeros with the first element being 1000
   - `a[i]` is updated to `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`

2. **Loop Head Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `n-1`.
   - The loop variable `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 each iteration.

3. **Conditions for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Since the loop starts at `i = 1`, the next value of `i` would be `i + 1`.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so if `i` was previously `k`, it will become `k + 1`.
   - `a[i]` will be updated based on the new value of `i`.

5. **New States:**
   - `i` will be `i + 1` (since it starts at 1 and increments by 1).
   - `a[i]` will be updated to `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]` with the new `i`.

Given these points, the new state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` will be `2` (since it starts at 1 and increments by 1).
- `a[2]` will be updated to `a[1] + x[1]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 2, `a` is a list of `n` zeros with the first element being 1000, and `a[2]` is updated to `a[1] + x[1]`**
