Output State: `n` is updated to the value of `int(input())`, `i` is in the range `[n-1]`, and `a[i]` is assigned the value `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`.

In this final output state, after all iterations of the loop have completed:
- The variable `n` retains its value as it was last updated via user input.
- The variable `i` is set to `n-1`, indicating the last index of the list `a` that was processed.
- The list `a` has been fully populated according to the loop logic: starting with `a[0] = 1000`, each subsequent element `a[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n-1`) is calculated as `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`.
