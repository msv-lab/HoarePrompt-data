Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `a` is a list of `n` zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `a` with `n` elements, each set to 0. The values of `t` and `x` remain unchanged from their initial state.
