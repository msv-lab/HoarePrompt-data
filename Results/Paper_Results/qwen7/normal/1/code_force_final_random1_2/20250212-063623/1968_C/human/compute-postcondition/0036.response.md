Output State: **`i` is less than `n`, `x` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of `n` zeros with the first element being 1000, and `a[i]` is updated to `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `a[i]` to be the sum of `a[i - 1]` and `x[i - 1]`. Since `i` must be less than `n`, the precondition that `i` is less than `n` remains valid. The value of `a` is updated at index `i` to reflect this calculation, while the rest of the list and other variables remain unchanged.
