Output State: **`n` is updated to the value of `int(input())`, `i` is in the range `[2, n-1]`, and `a[i]` is assigned the value `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`.**

This means that the value of `n` has been updated to the integer input provided by the user. The variable `i` remains in the range `[2, n-1]` as specified in the initial state. The variable `a[i]` is now assigned the value of `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`, which means it has been updated based on the previous value of `a[i - 1]` and the corresponding value of `x[i - 1]`.
