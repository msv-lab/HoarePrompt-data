Output State: **`n` is an input integer from the second input, `i` is `n-1`.**

Explanation: The first `n = int(input())` sets `n` to the value of the first input integer. The second `n = int(input())` sets `n` to the value of the second input integer, and `i` is updated to `n-1` based on the initial state.
