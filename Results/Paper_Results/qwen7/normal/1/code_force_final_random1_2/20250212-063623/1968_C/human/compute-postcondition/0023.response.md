Output State: **`n` is updated to the value of `int(input())`, `i` is in the range `[1, n-1]`, and `a[i]` is assigned the value `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`.**

This means that the value of `i` is updated to `i + 1`, and the list `a` at index `i` is set to the sum of the value at index `i-1` of list `a` and the value at index `i-1` of list `x`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
