Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1 or 2.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `l` is a list of integers.
   - `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory `int` where `d1[2] = 1`.
   - `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`.

4. **Analyze the loop body**:
   - If `i` is 2 and `l[i + 1] - l[i]` is less than `l[i] - l[i - 1]`, then `d1[i + 2] = 2`.
   - Otherwise, if `i` is 1, `d1[i + 2] = l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]`.

5. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1 or 2, for the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will become 2 if it was 1, or 3 if it was 2.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged.
   - The list `l` and the defaultdicts `d1` and `d2` remain unchanged.

Given these points, let's update the states accordingly:

- If `i` was 1, it will become 2.
- If `i` was 2, it will become 3.
- `n` remains greater than 1.
- `l`, `d1`, and `d2` remain unchanged.

So, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 2 or 3, `n` must be greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory `int` where `d1[2] = 1`, and `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`.**
