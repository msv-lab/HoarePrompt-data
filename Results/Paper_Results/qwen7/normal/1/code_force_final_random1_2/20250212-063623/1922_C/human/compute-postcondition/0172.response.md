Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `n-2` down to `1` (exclusive), decrementing by 1 each time. This means `i` starts at `n-2` and decreases until it reaches `1`.

3. **Determine the new value of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `n - 2`. Since the loop decrements `i` by 1, the new value of `i` will be `n - 3`.

4. **Determine the new condition for `n`**: The value of `n` remains unchanged because the loop does not modify `n`. It only modifies `i`.

5. **Adjust the postcondition**: We need to ensure that the postcondition holds for the new value of `i`. The postcondition at the end of the previous iteration was:
   - `i` is `n - 2`
   - `n` is at least 3
   - `d2[i]` is either `1 + d2[i + 1]` if the difference between `l[i + 1]` and `l[i]` is greater than the difference between `l[i]` and `l[i - 1]`, or `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]` if the difference between `l[i]` and `l[i - 1]` is greater than or equal to the difference between `l[i + 1]` and `l[i]`.

   For the new value of `i` (`n - 3`), the postcondition should hold with `i` updated to `n - 3`.

6. **Formulate the new state**: The new state should reflect the updated value of `i` and maintain the condition that `n` is at least 3.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is `n - 3`, `n` is at least 3, and `d2[i]` is either `1 + d2[i + 1]` if the difference between `l[i + 1]` and `l[i]` is greater than the difference between `l[i]` and `l[i - 1]`, or `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]` if the difference between `l[i]` and `l[i - 1]` is greater than or equal to the difference between `l[i + 1]` and `l[i]`.**
