Output State: **`i` is `n-2`; `d2[i]` is `1 + d2[i + 1]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `d2[i]` to be `1 + d2[i + 1]`. Given that `i` is initially `n-2` and must be greater than or equal to 0, the value of `i` remains unchanged. The value of `d2[i]` is now set to `1 + d2[i + 1]`, assuming `d2[i + 1]` has a defined value. The precondition that `i` must be greater than or equal to 0 is also preserved, but since `i` is `n-2`, this condition is inherently satisfied as long as `n >= 2`.
