Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is explicitly given as 1.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `x` and `y` are integers from the input split.

The code snippet is:
```python
print(d2[y] - d2[x])
```

Here, `d2` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it is assumed to be a dictionary or a list where the keys or indices correspond to the integers `x` and `y`. Since `x` and `y` are integers from the input split, they represent specific indices or keys in `d2`.

Given this, the expression `d2[y] - d2[x]` calculates the difference between the values at indices `y` and `x` in `d2`.

Since the exact values of `d2[y]` and `d2[x]` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these values.

Output: **d2[y] - d2[x]**
