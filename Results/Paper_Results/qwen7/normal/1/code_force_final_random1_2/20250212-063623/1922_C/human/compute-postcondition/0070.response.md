Output State: **`j` is equal to `m-1`, `m` is greater than `m-1`, `x` and `y` are input integers, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`**.

The code initializes `d2` as a defaultdict with the default factory set to `int`. This means `d2` can hold integer values by default. However, no operations are performed on `d2` that would change its contents or the values of the other variables listed in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `j`, `m`, `x`, `y`, `i`, `n`, `l`, and `d1` remain unchanged from their initial states.
