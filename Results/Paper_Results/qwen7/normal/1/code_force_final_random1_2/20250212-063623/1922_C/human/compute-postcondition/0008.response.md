Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory `int` where `d1[2] = 1`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`. The current value of `l[i + 1] - l[i]` is less than the current value of `l[i] - l[i - 1]`.
