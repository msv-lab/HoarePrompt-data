Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 4, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `d1[i + 2]` is updated to `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]`, `d2` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The code updates `d1[i + 2]` to the value of `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]`.
- Given that `i` is 3, `i + 2` is 5, so `d1[5]` is updated to `l[4] - l[3] + d1[4]`.
- The values of `i`, `n`, `l`, and `d2` remain unchanged from their previous states, except for the update to `d1[5]`.
