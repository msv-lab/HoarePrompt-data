Given the initial state:
- `j` is 1
- `m` is greater than 1
- `x` is an input integer
- `y` is an input integer

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(d1[y] - d1[x])`.

However, the initial state does not provide any information about `d1`, which is a required variable for the expression `d1[y] - d1[x]`. Since `d1` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its contents or the specific values of `d1[y]` and `d1[x]`.

Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot provide a precise value for what will be printed.

Output: **d1[y] - d1[x]**
