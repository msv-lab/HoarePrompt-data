Output State: **`j` is equal to `m-1`, `m` is greater than `m-1`, `x` and `y` are input integers, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory `int` where `d1[2] = 1`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`.**

In this step, the code `d1[2] = 1` assigns the value `1` to the key `2` in the dictionary `d1`. All other variables and their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
