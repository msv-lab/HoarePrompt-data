Output State: **`d1[i + 2]` is `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers**

Explanation: The code updates the dictionary `d1` such that the key `i + 2` is assigned the value `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, and `l`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
