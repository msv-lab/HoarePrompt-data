Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 2, and the difference between `l[i + 1] - l[i]` is greater than or equal to `l[i] - l[i - 1]`; `d1[i + 2]` is `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `d1[i + 2]` to be the sum of `l[i + 1] - l[i]` and `d1[i + 1]`. Since `i` is initially 1, `i + 2` becomes 3. Therefore, `d1[3]` is updated to be `l[2] - l[1] + d1[2]`. The conditions for `n` and the difference between `l[i + 1] - l[i]` and `l[i] - l[i - 1]` remain unchanged.
