Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is explicitly given as 1.
- `m` is greater than 1 but no specific value is provided.
- `x` is an input integer.
- `y` is an input integer.

The `print(d2[y] - d2[x])` statement involves accessing two elements from the dictionary `d2` with keys `y` and `x`, respectively, and then subtracting the value at key `x` from the value at key `y`.

Since the values of `d2[y]` and `d2[x]` are not specified in the initial state, we cannot determine their exact numerical values. However, we know they are values associated with keys `y` and `x` in the dictionary `d2`.

Therefore, the output will be a subtraction operation between the values of `d2[y]` and `d2[x]`.

Output: **d2[y] - d2[x]**
