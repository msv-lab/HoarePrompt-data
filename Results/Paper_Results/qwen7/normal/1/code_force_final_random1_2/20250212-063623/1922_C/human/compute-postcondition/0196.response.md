Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is explicitly set to 1.
- `m` is greater than or equal to 1 but no specific value is given.
- `x` is an input integer.
- `y` is an integer obtained from splitting the input and converting it to an integer.

Given this information, let's break down the print statement:

- `d1` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its contents directly.
- `d1[y]` refers to an element in the dictionary `d1` at the key `y`.
- `d1[x]` refers to an element in the dictionary `d1` at the key `x`.

Since `y` is obtained from splitting the input and converting it to an integer, and `x` is the input integer itself, `y` and `x` will be the same integer. Therefore, the expression `d1[y] - d1[x]` simplifies to `d1[y] - d1[y]`, which is 0.

Output: **0**
