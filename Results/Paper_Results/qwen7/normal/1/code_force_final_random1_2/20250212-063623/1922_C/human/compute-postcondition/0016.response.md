Output State: **`i` is 2 or 3, `n` must be greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory `int` where `d1[4] = l[3] - l[2] + d1[3]`, and `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`.**

Explanation:
- The code updates the value of `d1[i + 2]` to `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]`.
- Given `i` is either 2 or 3, we need to consider both cases:
  - If `i` is 2, then `d1[4] = l[3] - l[2] + d1[3]`.
  - If `i` is 3, then `d1[5] = l[4] - l[3] + d1[4]`.
- Other variables remain unchanged: `n` must be greater than 1, `l` remains a list of integers, and `d2` remains a defaultdict with default factory `int`.

Since the exact values of `l` and `d1` are not specified, we only update `d1` based on the given conditions.
