Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is `i`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: The `range(int(input()))` function will generate a sequence of numbers starting from 0 up to but not including the value of `int(input())`. Therefore, `i` will start from 0 and increment by 1 in each iteration.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the value of `int(input())`. 

4. **Adjust the state**: Since `t` is given as an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the value of `int(input())` will be between 1 and \(10^4\). Therefore, `i` will start from 0 and the loop will execute until `i` is less than this value.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `i` starts from 0 and the value of `int(input())` is within the specified range.

**State:**
- `i` is 0
- The value of `int(input())` must be an integer between 1 and \(10^4\)

So, the final state is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `int(input())` must be an integer between 1 and \(10^4\)**
