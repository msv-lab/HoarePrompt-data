Postcondition: `i` is an integer, `n` must be greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory `int` where `d1[2] = 1`. If `i` is 2 and the condition `l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]` is true, then `d1[i + 2] = 2`. Otherwise, if `i` is 1, `d1[i + 2]` is updated to `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]`.
