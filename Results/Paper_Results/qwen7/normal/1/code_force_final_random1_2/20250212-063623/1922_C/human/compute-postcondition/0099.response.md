Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` must be greater than 3, and `(l[i] - l[i - 1]) >= (l[i + 1] - l[i])`; `d2[i]` is `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `d2[i]` to be `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`. The values of `i`, `n`, and the condition involving `l[i]`, `l[i - 1]`, and `l[i + 1]` remain unchanged from the initial state.
