Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is 0
- `m` must be greater than or equal to 1
- `x` is an input integer
- `y` is an input integer
- The current value of `y` is greater than the current value of `x`

The print statement is `print(d1[y] - d1[x])`.

Here, `d1` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it is implied to be a dictionary. Since `y` is greater than `x`, and assuming `d1` contains keys corresponding to `x` and `y`, the expression `d1[y] - d1[x]` will subtract the value associated with `y` from the value associated with `x`.

Therefore, the output will be the difference between the values in the dictionary `d1` at keys `y` and `x`.

Output: **d1[y] - d1[x] (where d1 is a dictionary, y > x, and the values are the entries in the dictionary at keys y and x)**
