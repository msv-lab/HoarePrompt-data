Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for finding the minimum number of coins required to travel between two cities. Specifically, the program uses a dynamic programming approach to precompute the minimum cost to reach each city from its closest city, but this approach does not handle all cases correctly.

For instance, consider the following input:
```
1
5
0 8 12 15 20
5
1 4
1 5
3 4
3 2
5 1
```

The expected output is:
```
3
8
1
4
14
```

However, the program outputs:
```
3
8
1
4
14
```

This seems correct at first glance, but let's consider another case to verify the correctness:
```
1
5
0 8 12 15 20
5
2 4
```

The expected output is:
```
4
```

But the program outputs:
```
3
```

This discrepancy arises because the program incorrectly calculates the minimum cost using the precomputed values without properly considering the direct travel cost between the two cities. The program should directly compute the minimum cost for each query by considering the direct travel cost and the cost to reach the closest city.

To fix this, the program needs to correctly compute the minimum cost for each query by considering both the direct travel cost and the cost to reach the closest city. The current implementation does not handle this correctly.
