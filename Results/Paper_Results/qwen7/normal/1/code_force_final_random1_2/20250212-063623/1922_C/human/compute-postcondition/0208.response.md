Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. Each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), a list a of n integers in strictly increasing order (0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9), an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5), and a series of pairs (x_i, y_i) where 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i. The function returns results based on these inputs for each test case.**

This means the function handles multiple test cases, each containing specific parameters, and processes them according to the given constraints and relationships, returning the appropriate results for each case.
