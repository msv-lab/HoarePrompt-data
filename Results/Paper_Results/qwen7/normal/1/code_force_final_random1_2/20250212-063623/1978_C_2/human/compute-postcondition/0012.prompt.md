You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l is a list of integers where each integer represents a permutation of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^{5}) that has been determined to have a Manhattan value equal to k (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^{12}). Each integer in the list is a valid permutation and is distinct.
def func_5(l):
    print('YES')
    #This is printed: YES
    for i in l:
        print(i, end=' ')
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will have printed all elements of the list `l` separated by spaces.
    #
    #Explanation: Given that the loop iterates over each element in the list `l` and prints them one by one using `print(i, end=' ')`, after all iterations of the loop have finished, it means every integer (permutation) in the list `l` has been printed exactly once, with no newline character (`\n`) added between them due to the `end=' '` parameter in the `print` function. Therefore, the output will be a single line containing all the elements of `l` in the order they were originally listed, separated by spaces.
    print()
    #This is printed: \n
    return
    #The program returns nothing
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter l, which is a list of integers. Each integer in the list is a permutation of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^{5}), and all permutations have a Manhattan value equal to k (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^{12}). The function does not return any value.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns nothing


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
