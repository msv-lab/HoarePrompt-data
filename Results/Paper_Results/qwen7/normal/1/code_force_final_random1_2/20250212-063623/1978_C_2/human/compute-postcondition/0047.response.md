Output State: The list `l` is reversed, `k` is `0`, and `i` is `-1`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the list `l` will be completely reversed because each element is moved from the end to the beginning until `k` reaches `0`. The loop starts from `i = n-1` and decrements `i` until it becomes `-1`. During each iteration, the last element of `l` is moved to the position determined by the value of `k`, which decreases as `i` decreases. Once `k` reaches `0`, the function returns the modified list `l`, which is now fully reversed.
