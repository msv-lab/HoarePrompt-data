The function reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \) from input, where \( 1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5 \) and \( 0 \leq k \leq 10^{12} \). It then checks if \( k \) is divisible by 2. If \( k \) is not divisible by 2, it returns two zeros (0, 0). If \( k \) is divisible by 2, it calculates \( max_k \) based on whether \( n \) is odd or even. If \( max_k \) is less than \( k \), it returns two zeros (0, 0). Otherwise, it returns \( n \) and \( k \).
