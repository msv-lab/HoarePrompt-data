Output State: **`l` is the result of `func_1(n, k)`, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12, and `n` is not equal to 0.**

In this case, the function `func_1(n, k)` is called with the arguments `n` and `k`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state, and a new variable `l` is assigned the result of the function call. The precondition that `n` is not equal to 0 remains valid.
