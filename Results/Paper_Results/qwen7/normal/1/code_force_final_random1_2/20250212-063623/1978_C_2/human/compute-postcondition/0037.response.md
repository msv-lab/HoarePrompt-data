Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, and `k` is an integer between 0 and 10^12. It may return an undefined value, call `func_2` with specific arguments, call `func_3` with specific arguments, return the value of `l`, return `i - 2`, or call `func_2` with the current values of `c`, `k`, and `l` based on certain conditions involving `c`, `i`, and `k`. The function iteratively updates `k` and `l` by calling `func_3` and adjusts `i` by decrementing it by 2 in each iteration. The loop continues until `i` is no longer less than or equal to -1.**
