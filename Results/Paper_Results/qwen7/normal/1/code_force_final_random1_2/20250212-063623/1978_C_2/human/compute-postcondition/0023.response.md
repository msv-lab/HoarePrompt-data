Output State: **`l` is the return value of `func_3(c, l)`, `c` is increased by 2, `i` is `i - 2`, and `k` is equal to `k - (i - 2) + 1`. Additionally, `k` is not equal to 0 and is greater than or equal to `i - 1`; `k` is now `k - i + 1`**.

This means that `k` has been updated according to the new expression `k - i + 1`, while all other conditions and relationships remain unchanged.
