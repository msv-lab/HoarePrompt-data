Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `j` is 9, `p` is 9, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `i` is the tenth element of the list `s` after swapping the first and the `k-1`th elements, `z` is 0, `ans1` is 0, the first and the `k-1`th elements of the list `s` are swapped, `ans` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `h` is less than the tenth element of the list `s`, and `h` is the first element of the list `s` before the swap.
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    if i == h:
        if s[0] != h:
            ans1 += 1
        z = 1
    elif i > h:
        break
    elif z == 1:
        ans1 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` and `h` are integers. If `i` is equal to `h`, then `s[0]` is not equal to `h`, `ans1` is equal to `1`, and `z` is `1`. If `i` is not equal to `h`, then `i` is either greater than `h` in which case we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or `i` is less than or equal to `h` and if `z` is `1`, then `ans1` remains `1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is the next element in `s`, `h` is an integer, `s[0]` is an integer, `ans1` is either 2 if `i` equals `h`, or 1 or 2 depending on whether `i` is greater than `h`, and `z` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is the next element in `s`, `h` is an integer, `s[0]` is an integer, `ans1` is either 2 if `i` equals `h`, or 2 or 3 depending on whether `i` is greater than `h`, and `z` is 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
