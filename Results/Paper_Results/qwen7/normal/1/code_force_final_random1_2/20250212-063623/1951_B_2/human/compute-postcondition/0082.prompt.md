Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ans1` is 0, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer obtained from the first input split by space, `k` is an integer obtained from the second input split by space, `s` is a list of integers obtained from the third input split by space, the elements at indices `k-1` and `p` in `s` are swapped, `ans` is the total number of times the condition `h < i` was false during the loop, `h` is the first element of `s`, `j` is the total number of iterations minus one, `i` is the last element in `s` that was compared against `h`, `p` is equal to `j`, `z` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    if i == h:
        if s[0] != h:
            ans1 += 1
        z = 1
    elif i > h:
        break
    elif z == 1:
        ans1 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `s` is a list of integers with at least one element, `i` is the first element in `s`, `z` is 1, and if the current value of `i` is not equal to `h`, then `ans1` is incremented by 1. If `i` is greater than `h`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. If `i` is not equal to `h` but is less than or equal to `h`, `z` remains 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `s` is a list of integers with at least one element, `i` is the second element in `s`, `z` is 1, and if `s[0]` is not equal to `h`, then `ans1` is 1. If `s[0]` equals `h`, then either `ans1` remains 1 (if `i` is not greater than `h`) or the most internal loop or if statement is exited (if `i` is greater than `h`).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `s` is a list of integers with at least one element, `i` is the third element in `s`, `z` is 1, and `ans1` is 2. If `s[0]` is not equal to `h`, `ans1` remains 2. If `s[0]` equals `h`, `ans1` remains 2 regardless of whether `i` is greater than `h` or not.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
