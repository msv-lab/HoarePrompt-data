Output State: **`j` is 9, `p` is 9, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `i` is the tenth element of the list `s` after swapping the first and the `k-1`th elements, `z` is 1 if the tenth element of the list `s` is not equal to `h`, `ans1` is 0, the first and the `k-1`th elements of the list `s` are swapped, `ans` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `h` is less than the tenth element of the list `s`, and `h` is the first element of the list `s` before the swap.**

Explanation: The line `ans1 = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `ans1`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `j`, `p`, `n`, `k`, `i`, `z`, `ans`, and `h` remain unchanged from their initial states.
