Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ans` is 0, `ans1` is the total number of elements in the list `s` that are not equal to `h` and do not cause the loop to break when found to be greater than `h`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `h` is the first element of the list `s`, the first and the last elements of the list `s` have been swapped, `j` is -1.
Code of the loop:
for i in s[1:]:
    j += 1
    if h < i:
        break
    else:
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is the second element of the list `s`, `s[1:]` is the list starting from the second element of the list `s` with the first and last elements swapped, `j` is increased by 1, and if `h` is less than `i`, `ans` remains unchanged; otherwise, `ans` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is the third element of the list `s`, `s[1:]` is the list starting from the second element of the list `s` with the first and last elements swapped, `j` is increased by 1, and `ans` is increased by 1 if `h` is less than `i`; otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is the fourth element of the list `s`, `s[1:]` is the list starting from the second element of the list `s` with the first and last elements swapped, `j` is incremented by 1, and `ans` is increased by 1 if `h` is less than `i`; otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
