Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `j` is -1, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `i` is now the first element of the list `s`, `z` is 1 if `s[0]` is not equal to `h`, `ans1` is incremented each time `z` is 1 and `i` is not equal to `h`, `s` is updated such that the first and the k-1th elements are swapped, `ans` is 0, `h` is the first element of the list `s` before the swap.
Code of the loop:
for i in s[1:]:
    j += 1
    if h < i:
        break
    else:
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `j` is 0, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `i` is the first element of the list `s` after swapping the first and the `k-1`th elements, `z` is 1 if `s[0]` is not equal to `h`, `ans1` is incremented each time `z` is 1 and `i` is not equal to `h`, `s` is updated such that the first and the `k-1`th elements are swapped, `ans` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `h` is less than `i`, `h` is the first element of the list `s` before the swap, and `s[0]` is different from `h`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `j` is 1, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `i` is the second element of the list `s` after swapping the first and the `k-1`th elements, `z` is 1 if `s[0]` is not equal to `h`, `ans1` is incremented each time `z` is 1 and `i` is not equal to `h`, `s` is updated such that the first and the `k-1`th elements are swapped, `ans` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `h` is less than `i`, `h` is the first element of the list `s` before the swap, and `s[0]` is different from `h`. If `h < i`, then `ans` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `ans` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `j` is 2, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `i` is the third element of the list `s` after swapping the first and the `k-1`th elements, `z` is 1 if the third element of the list `s` is not equal to `h`, `ans1` is incremented by 1 each time `z` is 1 and the third element of the list `s` is not equal to `h`, `s` is updated such that the first and the `k-1`th elements are swapped, `ans` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `h` is less than the third element of the list `s`, and `h` is the first element of the list `s` before the swap. If `h` is less than the third element of the list `s`, `ans` is 0; otherwise, `ans` is 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
