Postcondition: **`i` is the first element of the list `s`, `s` is a list, and `z` is 1 if `s[0]` is not equal to `h`. If `s[0]` equals `h`, then `z` remains 1. If `i` is greater than `h`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is less than or equal to `h`, then `i` remains less than or equal to `h`, and `ans1` is set to 1 if `z` equals 1.**
