Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. Therefore, `t` retains its initial state as a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and `n` is assigned the value of the input provided by the user.
