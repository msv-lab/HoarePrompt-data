Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an input integer
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    s = input()
    a = set(s)
    if len(a) == 2:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        b = ''.join(sorted(s))
        c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
        if b == s:
            print(c)
        else:
            print(b)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 0, `s` is an input string, `a` is a set containing unique characters from `s`. If the length of the set `a` is equal to 2, the program does not change `a`. Otherwise, `a` is not equal to 2, and `b` is a string which is the sorted version of `s`, while `c` is a string which is the sorted version of `s` but in descending order. After the execution of the if-else block, `b` is either equal to `s` or not equal to `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `s` is an updated input string, `a` is a set containing unique characters from the updated `s`. If `len(a) == 2`, then the postcondition remains the same as the precondition. Otherwise, `b` is a sorted string of the updated `s`, and `c` is a string which is the sorted version of `s` but in descending order.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `s` is the input string entered by the user, `a` is a set containing unique characters from the input string `s`, `b` is a sorted string of the input string `s`, and `c` is the string which is the sorted version of `s` but in descending order. The postcondition remains the same regardless of whether the if condition is met or not.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
