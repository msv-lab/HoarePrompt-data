Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `s` is the input string entered by the user, `a` is a set containing unique characters from the input string `s`, `b` is a sorted string of the input string `s`, and `c` is a string which is the sorted version of `s` but in descending order; `a` is now a set of unique characters from the input string `s`.**

The code `a = set(s)` creates a set `a` containing all unique characters from the input string `s`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
