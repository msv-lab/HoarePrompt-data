Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `s` is an updated input string, `a` is a set containing unique characters from the updated `s`. If `len(a) == 2`, then the postcondition remains the same as the precondition. Otherwise, `b` is a sorted string of the updated `s`, and `c` is a string which is the sorted version of `s` but in descending order.**
