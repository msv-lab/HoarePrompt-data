Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `s` is the input string entered by the user, `a` is a set containing unique characters from the input string `s`, `b` is a sorted string of the input string `s`, `c` is a string which is the sorted version of `s` but in descending order, `b` is the sorted string of `s`.**

Explanation: The code `b = ''.join(sorted(s))` sorts the string `s` alphabetically and joins the characters back into a string, assigning the result to `b`. The other variables remain unchanged.
