Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 0, `s` is an input string, `a` is a set containing unique characters from `s`, and the length of `a` is not equal to 2; `b` is a string which is the sorted version of `s`, `c` is a string which is the sorted version of `s` but in descending order, and after the execution of the if-else block, `b` is either equal to `s` or not equal to `s`.
