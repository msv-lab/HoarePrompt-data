You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        a = set(s)
        if len(a) == 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)



- Annotated Code:

    #State: The loop has executed all its iterations, with `t` being a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` being the total number of iterations the loop was set to run, `i` being equal to `n - 1` (since the loop runs from `0` to `n-1`), `s` being the last input string provided, `a` being a set containing the unique characters from `s`, and `b` and `c` being strings representing the sorted and reverse-sorted versions of `s`, respectively.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading a string `s`.

2. **Checking for Unique Characters:**
   - For each string `s`, it converts the string into a set `a`. 
   - If the set `a` has exactly 2 unique characters, it prints 'NO'. This is because if there are only 2 unique characters, no rearrangement of `s` will produce a different string from `s`.

3. **Generating a Different String:**
   - If the set `a` does not have exactly 2 unique characters, it prints 'YES'.
   - It then sorts the string `s` in both ascending and descending order.
   - If the sorted string in ascending order (`b`) is equal to the original string `s`, it prints the sorted string in descending order (`c`).
   - Otherwise, it prints the sorted string in ascending order (`b`).

### Testing the Program with Examples:

1. **Test Case: "codeforces"**
   - Set `a` = {'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'o', 'r', 's', 't'}
   - Since the set has more than 2 unique characters, the program prints 'YES' and sorts the string in ascending order to get "ccdeforst".
   - This is correct as it is a different string from the original.

2. **Test Case: "aaaaa"**
   - Set `a` = {'a'}
   - Since the set has only 1 unique character, the program prints 'NO'.
   - This is correct as no rearrangement of "aaaaa" can produce a different string.

3. **Test Case: "co"**
   - Set `a` = {'c', 'o'}
   - Since the set has 2 unique characters, the program prints 'NO'.
   - This is correct as no rearrangement of "co" can produce a different string.

4. **Test Case: "d"**
   - Set `a` = {'d'}
   - Since the set has only 1 unique character, the program prints 'NO'.
   - This is correct as no rearrangement of "d" can produce a different string.

5. **Test Case: "nutdealer"**
   - Set `a` = {'a', 'd', 'e', 'l', 'n', 'r', 't'}
   - Since the set has more than 2 unique characters, the program prints 'YES' and sorts the string in ascending order to get "aaeldeelnrt".
   - This is correct as it is a different string from the original.

6. **Test Case: "mwistht"**
   - Set `a` = {'h', 'i', 'm', 't', 'w'}
   - Since the set has more than 2 unique characters, the program prints 'YES' and sorts the string in ascending order to get "hhimsttw".
   - This is correct as it is a different string from the original.

7. **Test Case: "hhhhhhhhhh"**
   - Set `a` = {'h'}
   - Since the set has only 1 unique character, the program prints 'NO'.
   - This is correct as no rearrangement of "hhhhhhhhhh" can produce a different string.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the test cases according to the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
