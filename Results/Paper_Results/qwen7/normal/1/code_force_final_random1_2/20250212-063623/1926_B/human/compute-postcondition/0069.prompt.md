Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `k` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `a` remains the same, and each input string `b` is greater than or equal to 1 and contains the character '1'.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    b = input()
    if '1' in b:
        k.append(b.count('1'))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `k` is an empty list, `i` is 1, and `b` is an input string greater than or equal to 1 and contains the character '1', with the additional condition that if the string `b` contains the character '1', then `k` becomes `[1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in `b`, `i` is 2, and `b` is an input string greater than or equal to 1 and contains the character '1'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `k` is a list containing the count of '1's in the new input string `b` plus the count of '1's in the original list, `i` is 2, `b` is the new input string, and `num_iterations` must be greater than 0. If '1' is found in `b`, the count of '1's is incremented by the count of '1's in `b`; otherwise, the count remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
