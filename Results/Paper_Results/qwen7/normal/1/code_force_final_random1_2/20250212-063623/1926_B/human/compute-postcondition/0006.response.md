Output State: **`k` is a list containing the value 1, `b` is an input string containing the character '1'**.

Explanation: The code `k.append(b.count('1'))` appends the count of the character '1' in the string `b` to the list `k`. Since `b` is an input string containing the character '1', `b.count('1')` returns 1. Therefore, `k` becomes a list containing the value 1. The value of `b` remains unchanged as it was an input string containing the character '1'.
