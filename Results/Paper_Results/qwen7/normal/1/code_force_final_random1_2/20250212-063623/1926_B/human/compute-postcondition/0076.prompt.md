Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `a` is an integer representing the number of test cases where 2 ≤ a ≤ 10.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(a):
    k = []
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        b = input()
        if '1' in b:
            k.append(b.count('1'))
    if k[0] == k[1]:
        print('SQUARE')
    else:
        print('TRIANGLE')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `k` is a list that contains the count of '1's from each input string `b` that contained '1'. If an input string `b` did not contain '1', it is not included in the list `k`. If `k[0]` is equal to `k[1]`, the condition holds as is. If `k[0]` is not equal to `k[1]`, the condition also holds as is.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `k` is a list containing the total count of '1's from all input strings `b`, `i` is incremented by the number of times the loop executed, `a` remains the same, and each input string `b` is greater than or equal to 1 and contains the character '1'. If `k[0]` is equal to `k[1]`, the program does not change these values. If `k[0]` is not equal to `k[1]`, the program also does not change these values.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `k` is a list containing the total count of '1's from all input strings provided, `i` is the number of times the loop has executed, and `b` is the last input string received. If the first element of `k` is equal to the second element of `k`, the condition holds as is. If the first element of `k` is not equal to the second element of `k`, the condition also holds as is.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
