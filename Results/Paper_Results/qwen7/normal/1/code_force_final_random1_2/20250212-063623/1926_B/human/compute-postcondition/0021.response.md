Based on the initial state provided:

- `k` is a list that contains the count of '1's from each input string `b` that contained '1'.
- If an input string `b` did not contain '1', it is not included in the list `k`.
- The current value of `k[0]` is equal to the current value of `k[1]`.

The `print('SQUARE')` statement will print the string 'SQUARE'.

Output: **SQUARE**
