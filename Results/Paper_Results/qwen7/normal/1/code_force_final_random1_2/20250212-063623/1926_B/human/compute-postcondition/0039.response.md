Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head**: The loop head is defined by the `for` statement: `for _ in range(int(input())):`. This means the loop will iterate based on the integer value obtained from the `input()` function.

2. **Determine the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `k` is a list containing 2.
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
   - `a` remains the same.
   - `b` is an input string greater than or equal to 1 and contains the character '1'.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as the integer value obtained from `input()` is greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `_` is a dummy variable, it does not affect the state directly.
   - The loop will execute again if the integer value from `input()` is greater than 0.
   - Therefore, the integer value from `input()` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again.

Given the above points, the state at the start of the next iteration should include:
- `k` remains a list containing 2.
- `i` is incremented by 1 (so if it was `i = x` before, now it is `i = x + 1`).
- `a` remains the same.
- `b` is an input string greater than or equal to 1 and contains the character '1'.
- The integer value from `input()` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`k` is a list containing 2, `i` is incremented by 1, `a` remains the same, `b` is an input string greater than or equal to 1 and contains the character '1', and the integer value from `input()` must be greater than 0**.
