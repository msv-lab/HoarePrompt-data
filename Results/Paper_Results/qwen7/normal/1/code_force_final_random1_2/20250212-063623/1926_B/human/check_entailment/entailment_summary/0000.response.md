Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining if the '1's in the grid form a square or a triangle.
2. The provided program `func()` reads the number of test cases and processes each grid individually.
3. For each grid, it reads the number of rows and then reads each row, counting the number of '1's in each row.
4. It then checks if the count of '1's in the first two rows is the same. If they are the same, it prints 'SQUARE'; otherwise, it prints 'TRIANGLE'.
5. This logic is incorrect because:
   - For a square, the count of '1's in each row should be the same.
   - For a triangle, the count of '1's in each row should increase by 2 for each subsequent row until the middle row, and then decrease symmetrically.
6. The current implementation only checks the first two rows, which is insufficient to correctly identify the shape.

Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly identify whether the shape is a square or a triangle based on the given criteria.
