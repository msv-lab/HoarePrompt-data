Output State: **`k` is a list containing 2, `i` is incremented by 1, `a` remains the same, and `b` is an input string greater than or equal to 1 and contains the character '1'**.

Explanation: The code `k.append(b.count('1'))` appends the count of the character '1' in the string `b` to the list `k`. Since `b` is an input string that contains at least one '1', `b.count('1')` returns 1. Initially, `k` contains 1, so after appending 1, `k` becomes a list containing 2. The values of `i` and `a` remain unchanged, and `b` is still an input string greater than or equal to 1 and contains the character '1'.
