Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes a grid consisting of n lines, each containing n characters ('0' or '1'). The grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all the '1's, with the size of the shape being greater than 1. The function identifies whether the shape is a triangle or a square and returns which shape it is.**
