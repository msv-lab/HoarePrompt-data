Output State: **`k` is an empty list, `i` is 1, and `b` is an input string greater than or equal to 1 and contains the character '1'.**

The code `b = input()` assigns the value of the user's input to the variable `b`. Since the initial state specifies that each input string `b` is greater than or equal to 1 and contains the character '1', the output state reflects this condition. The other variables (`k` and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
