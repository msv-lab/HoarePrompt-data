Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly identify whether the grid contains a triangle or a square. The logic in the program checks if the first two rows contain the same number of '1's, which is insufficient to determine the shape. For example, consider the following grid:

```
5

00000

00000

01110

01110

01110
```

This grid contains a triangle but the program will incorrectly identify it as a square because the first two rows both contain 1 '1'. The program needs to check the structure of the entire grid to determine if it forms a triangle or a square.
