Output State: **`freq` is a list of 7 zeros, `missing` is the sum of the maximum of 0 and the difference between `m` and each value in `freq`, `results` is a list with three elements, the first two are equal to the final value of `missing`, and the third element is also equal to the final value of `missing`, `n`, `m`, and `a` are assigned the values from `test_cases[_]`.**

Explanation: The code initializes `freq` as a list of 7 zeros. It does not modify `freq`, `missing`, `results`, `n`, `m`, or `a`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states. The value of `freq` is explicitly set to `[0] * 7`, which means `freq` is a list containing seven zeros. The calculation for `missing` and `results` depends on the values of `m` and `freq`, but since `freq` is all zeros, the calculation for `missing` would be the sum of the maximum of 0 and the difference between `m` and 0 for each element in `freq`. This calculation is stored in `missing` and then used to populate the `results` list. The values of `n`, `m`, and `a` are assigned from `test_cases[_]`, but their specific values are not provided in the initial state, so they remain as assigned from `test_cases[_]`.
