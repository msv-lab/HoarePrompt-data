Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `a` are assigned the values from `test_cases[_]`.**

Explanation: The code `n, m, a = test_cases[_]` assigns the values from the list or tuple `test_cases[_]` to the variables `n`, `m`, and `a`. Since the exact values in `test_cases[_]` are not specified, we can only say that `n`, `m`, and `a` are assigned those values. All other variables remain in their initial state, which is not specified here but implied to be unchanged.
