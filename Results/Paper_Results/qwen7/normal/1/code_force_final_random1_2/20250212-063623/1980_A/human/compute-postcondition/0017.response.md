Output State: **`freq` is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], `missing` is the sum of the maximum of 0 and the difference between `m` and each value in `freq`, `results` is a list with two additional elements which are the value of `missing`.**

Explanation: The code initializes the list `freq` with seven zeros. The values of `n`, `m`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial state. The variable `missing` is calculated as the sum of the maximum of 0 and the difference between `m` and each value in `freq`. Since `freq` is initialized to all zeros, the difference between `m` and each value in `freq` is simply `m` (since `m - 0 = m`). The `max(0, m)` will be `m` if `m` is positive and 0 if `m` is non-positive. The `results` list gains two additional elements, both of which are the value of `missing`.
