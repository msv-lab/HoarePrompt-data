Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to create to ensure he can hold `m` rounds with at least one problem of each required difficulty level. The function `func_1` processes each test case as specified, counts the frequency of each difficulty level in the input string, and calculates the shortfall needed to meet the requirement for `m` rounds. The results are then printed correctly. Given the example test cases, the program produces the expected output, indicating that it is implemented correctly according to the problem statement.
