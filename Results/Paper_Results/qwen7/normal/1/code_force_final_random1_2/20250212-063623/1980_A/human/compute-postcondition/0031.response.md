Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variables `prob` and `a`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `freq` is a list of 7 zeros.
   - `missing` is the sum of the maximum of 0 and the difference between `m` and each value in `freq`.
   - `results` is a list with three elements, the first two are equal to the final value of `missing`, and the third element is also equal to the final value of `missing`.
   - `n`, `m`, and `a` are assigned the values from `test_cases[_]`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will iterate over each element in `a`. Therefore, `a` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.

4. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - Since `a` is the list being iterated over, it must have at least one element for the loop to execute.
   - The other variables (`prob`, `freq`, `missing`, `results`, `n`, `m`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and their initial states do not affect whether the loop will execute or not.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `a` having at least one element.

**State:**
**`a` must have at least one element**
