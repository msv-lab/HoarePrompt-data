Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `a` are assigned the values from `test_cases[_]`; `freq` is a list of 7 zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `freq` with 7 elements, all set to 0. This operation does not affect the values of `n`, `m`, and `a`. Therefore, their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
