Output State: **`x` must be greater than 2, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `rev[b]` now contains the value of `a` appended to a list, `lst[a]` now contains the value `b`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `a` to the list stored in `rev[b]`. Since `rev[b]` initially contained the value of `a`, after executing `rev[b].append(a)`, the list at `rev[b]` will contain both the original value of `a` and the new value of `a`, effectively doubling the value of `a` in the list. The other variables remain unchanged.
