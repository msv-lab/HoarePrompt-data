Output State: **`queue` now contains an additional tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`, `tree[current]` must still contain at least one element, `neighbor` is the next element in `tree[current]` that is not in `visited`, and `visited` now includes the element `neighbor`.**

Explanation: The code appends a new tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` to the `queue`. The value of `neighbor` remains unchanged, and `dist` is incremented by 1. The conditions about `tree[current]`, `neighbor`, and `visited` remain valid as per the initial state.
