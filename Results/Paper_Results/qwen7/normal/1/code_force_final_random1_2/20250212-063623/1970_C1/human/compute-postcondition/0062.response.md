Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `neighbor` and `current`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each `neighbor` in `tree[current]`.

3. **Analyze the postconditions from the previous iteration**:
   - `queue` now contains an additional tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`.
   - `tree[current]` must still contain at least one element.
   - `neighbor` is the next element in `tree[current]`.
   - The current value of `neighbor` is not in `visited`.
   - `visited` now includes the element `neighbor`.

4. **Determine the state adjustments needed for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `tree[current]` must still contain at least one element.
   - `neighbor` must be the next element in `tree[current]` that is not in `visited`.
   - `visited` must include the current `neighbor`.

Given these points, let's adjust the states accordingly:

- `tree[current]` must still contain at least one element.
- `neighbor` must be the next element in `tree[current]` that is not in `visited`.
- `visited` must include the current `neighbor`.

Since we don't know the exact values of `neighbor` and `tree[current]` from the previous iteration, we can only ensure that the conditions are met for the next iteration.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`queue` now contains an additional tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`, `tree[current]` must still contain at least one element, `neighbor` is the next element in `tree[current]` that is not in `visited`, and `visited` now includes the element `neighbor`.**
