Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `rev[tmp] != []`.

2. **Analyze the variables involved in the loop condition**:
   - `tmp`: This variable is directly involved in the loop condition.

3. **Determine the current state**:
   - `z` is an input integer.
   - `tmp` is equal to `z`.
   - `one` is `False`.
   - `two` is `True`.

4. **Understand the loop condition**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `rev[tmp]` must not be an empty list (`[]`).

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `tmp` is equal to `z`, the loop condition depends on `rev[z]`.
   - We need to ensure that `rev[z]` is not an empty list.

Given the current state, no adjustments are needed for `one` and `two` as they do not affect the loop condition. The only variable that affects the loop condition is `tmp`, which is equal to `z`.

Therefore, the state right before the loop should be adjusted to ensure that `rev[z]` is not an empty list.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`z` is an input integer and `rev[z]` must not be an empty list**
