Functionality: **The function reads a graph structure from standard input, where nodes are connected through edges. It then checks two paths from a given starting node, one following the original edges and the other following the reversed edges. Based on the alternation of visiting nodes in both paths, it determines whether to return 'Hermione' or 'Ron'.**
