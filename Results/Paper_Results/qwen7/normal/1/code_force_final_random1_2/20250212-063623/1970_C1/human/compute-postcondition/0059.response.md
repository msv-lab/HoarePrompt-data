Output State: **`queue` now contains an additional tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`, `tree[current]` must still contain at least one element, `neighbor` is the next element in `tree[current]`, and the current value of `neighbor` is not in `visited`; `visited` now includes the element `neighbor`.**

Explanation: The code appends a new tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` to the `queue`. This means that `queue` now contains one more element than before. The `neighbor` remains the next element in `tree[current]`, and it is not in `visited`. After executing the code, `visited` now includes the `neighbor`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
