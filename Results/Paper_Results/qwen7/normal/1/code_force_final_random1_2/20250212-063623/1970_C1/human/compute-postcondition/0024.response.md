Output State: **`z` is an input integer, `tmp` is equal to `lst[z].pop()`, `one` is `True`, and `lst[tmp]` is not empty**

Explanation: Initially, `one` is `False`. The line `one = not one` changes the value of `one` to the opposite of its current value. Since `one` was initially `False`, after executing `one = not one`, `one` becomes `True`. The values of `z`, `tmp`, and `lst[tmp]` remain unchanged.
