Output State: **`x` must be greater than 3, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `rev[b]` now contains the value of `a` appended to a list, `lst[a]` now contains the value `b`, `a` is the first input integer, `b` is the second input integer.**

Explanation: The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to variables `a` and `b`. The initial conditions for `x`, `rev[b]`, and `lst[a]` remain unchanged. Therefore, `x` must still be greater than 3, `a` now holds the value of the first input integer, `b` now holds the value of the second input integer, `rev[b]` contains the value of `a` appended to a list, and `lst[a]` contains the value `b`.
