Output State: **`x` is an integer input from the user, `y` is an integer input from the user, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer such that t = 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and `lst` is a defaultdict where all values are lists; `rev` is a defaultdict where all values are lists.**

The code initializes a new defaultdict named `rev` where all values are lists. This does not affect the values of the existing variables (`x`, `y`, `n`, `t`, `u`, `v`, and `lst`). Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions plus the new definition of `rev`.
