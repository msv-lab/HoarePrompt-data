Output State: **`tmp` is now the last element of `rev[tmp]` after popping it, `two` is True**

Explanation: The code `tmp = rev[tmp].pop()` pops (removes and returns) the last element from the list `rev[tmp]` and assigns it back to `tmp`. Since `rev[tmp]` was not empty in the initial state, the operation is valid. The value of `two` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the operation.
