Output State: **`z` is an input integer; `tmp` is equal to `z`; `one` is `False`**.

Explanation: The initial state includes that `z` is an input integer, `tmp` is equal to `z`, and `lst[z]` is not an empty list. The line `one = not one` changes the value of `one`. Since `one` was not defined before and the context does not specify its initial value, we assume it to be `True` (as it is common in such cases to start with `True`). After executing `one = not one`, `one` becomes `False`. The other variables remain unchanged.
