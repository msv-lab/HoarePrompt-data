Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `start` and `target`, both of which are integers representing the starting node and one of the two leaves in the tree, respectively. The function returns 0 if the queue is empty and the initial value of `dist` is 0. If the target node is found during the breadth-first search, it returns the distance to the target node. If the target node is not found, it returns -1.**
