To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop head and the conditions under which the loop can continue.

The loop head is:
```python
while lst[tmp] != []:
```

This means the loop continues as long as `lst[tmp]` is not empty.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
- `z` is an input integer
- `tmp` is equal to `lst[z].pop()`
- `one` is `False`

The only variable in the loop head is `lst[tmp]`, so we can only adjust `lst[tmp]`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `lst[tmp]` must not be empty. Therefore, we need to ensure that `lst[tmp]` is not empty.

State: **`z` is an input integer, `tmp` is equal to `lst[z].pop()`, `one` is `False`, and `lst[tmp]` is not empty**
