Output State: All iterations of the loop have been executed, resulting in `tot` being the sum of all elements in the list `L` (which is 3), `k` remaining unchanged as an integer, `a` being the last integer in the list `L` (which is 1), and `pow` being multiplied by 2 three times (resulting in `pow` equal to 8).

In natural language: After all iterations of the loop, `tot` will be 3 (the sum of all elements in the list `L`), `k` will remain as an unchanged integer, `a` will be the last integer in the list `L` which is 1, and `pow` will be 8 since it gets multiplied by 2 in each iteration of the loop.
