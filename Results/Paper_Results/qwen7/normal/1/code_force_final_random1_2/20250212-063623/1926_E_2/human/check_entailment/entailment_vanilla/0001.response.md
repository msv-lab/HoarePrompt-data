Let's reason through the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.

2. **Odd Number Count Calculation:**
   - The program calculates how many odd-numbered cards can be placed in the sequence.
   - Specifically, it computes `m = (n + 1) // 2`, which gives the count of odd numbers up to `n`.
   - It then subtracts this count from `n` and appends `m` to the list `L`.

3. **Binary Search-Like Approach:**
   - The program initializes `tot` to 0 and `pow` to 1.
   - It iterates over the list `L` (which contains counts of cards at different multiples of odd numbers).
   - For each element `a` in `L`, it checks if `k` falls within the range `[tot, tot + a]`.
   - If it does, it calculates the card number using the formula `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)`.

4. **Card Number Calculation:**
   - The formula `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)` correctly maps the position `k` to the corresponding card number.
   - Here, `pow` keeps track of the current multiple (starting from 1), and `(2 * (k - tot) - 1)` ensures the correct odd number is selected.

5. **Updating Totals:**
   - After determining the card number, it updates `tot` by adding `a` to it.
   - `pow` is updated by multiplying it with 2 to move to the next multiple.

### Verification:

To verify the correctness, let's consider the example provided:

- **Test Case 1:** `n = 7`, `k = 1`
  - Odd numbers: 1, 3, 5, 7
  - First card is 1.
- **Test Case 2:** `n = 7`, `k = 2`
  - Odd numbers: 1, 3, 5, 7
  - Second card is 3.
- **Test Case 3:** `n = 7`, `k = 3`
  - Odd numbers: 1, 3, 5, 7
  - Third card is 5.
- **Test Case 4:** `n = 7`, `k = 4`
  - Odd numbers: 1, 3, 5, 7
  - Fourth card is 7.
- **Test Case 5:** `n = 7`, `k = 5`
  - Twice the odd numbers: 2, 6
  - Fifth card is 2.
- **Test Case 6:** `n = 7`, `k = 6`
  - Twice the odd numbers: 2, 6
  - Sixth card is 6.
- **Test Case 7:** `n = 7`, `k = 7`
  - Four times the odd numbers: 4
  - Seventh card is 4.

The program correctly identifies the positions of the cards as per the rules described.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the `k`-th card laid down by Vladislav. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
