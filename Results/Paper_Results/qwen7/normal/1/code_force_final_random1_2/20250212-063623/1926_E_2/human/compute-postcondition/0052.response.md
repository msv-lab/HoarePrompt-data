Output State: **`n` is now `n - (n + 1) // 2`, `k` is an integer equal to the second input value, `L` is a list containing `m` and `m`, where `m` is equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, and `L.append(m)` has been executed.**

Explanation:
- `n` remains unchanged from its initial state as it is only referenced but not reassigned.
- `k` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code.
- `L` initially contains the element `m`, where `m` is equal to `(n + 1) // 2`. After executing `L.append(m)`, `L` now contains `m` twice.
- The action `L.append(m)` has been executed, indicating that `m` has been added to the list `L`.
