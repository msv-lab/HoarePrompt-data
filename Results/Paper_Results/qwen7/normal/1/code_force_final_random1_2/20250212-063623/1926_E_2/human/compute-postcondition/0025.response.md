Output State: **`tot` is an integer, `k` is an integer, and `a` is an integer; `tot` is now `tot + a`.**

Explanation: The code `tot += a` increments the value of `tot` by `a`. Since the initial conditions specified that `tot` is an integer, `k` is an integer, and `a` is an integer, these remain unchanged. The only change is that `tot` is now equal to its original value plus `a`.
