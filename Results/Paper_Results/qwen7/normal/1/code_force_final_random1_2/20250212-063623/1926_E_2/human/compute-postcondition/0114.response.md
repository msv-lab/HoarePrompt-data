Output State: **`a` is 3, `L` is [3, 2], `tot` is 6**.

Explanation: The initial value of `a` is 3, and `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot + 3`. The code `tot += a` increments `tot` by the value of `a`, which is 3. Therefore, `tot` becomes 6. The list `L` and the value of `a` remain unchanged.
