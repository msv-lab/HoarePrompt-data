Output State: `n` is now `0`, `k` is an integer equal to the second input value, `L` is a list containing three elements all equal to `1`.

Explanation: After each iteration of the loop, `n` is updated to `n - (n + 1) // 2`. The expression `(n + 1) // 2` always results in 1 when `n` is positive because `n + 1` is always even for positive `n`. Therefore, `n` decreases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0. Since the loop appends the value of `m`, which is `(n + 1) // 2` and equals 1, to the list `L` in each iteration, `L` will contain three 1s after three iterations.
