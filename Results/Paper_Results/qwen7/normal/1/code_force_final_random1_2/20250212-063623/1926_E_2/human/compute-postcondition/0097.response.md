Output State: **`a` is 1, `L` is [1, 3, 2], `pow` is 2, `tot` is 3, `m` is 2, `n` is 0**

Explanation: The code `L.append(m)` appends the value of `m` (which is 2) to the list `L`. Initially, `L` is `[1, 3]`. After appending `m`, `L` becomes `[1, 3, 2]`. The values of `a`, `pow`, `tot`, `m`, and `n` remain unchanged.
