Output State: **`tot` is now `tot + a`, `k` is unchanged, `a` is the next integer in the list `L`, `pow` is `pow * 2 * 2`**

Explanation: The code `pow *= 2` multiplies the current value of `pow` by 2. Since `pow` was previously `pow * 2`, after executing this line, `pow` becomes `pow * 2 * 2`. The values of `tot`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged.
