Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is now (`n + 1) // 2`, `k` is an input integer, `L` is a list containing (`n + 1) // 2, `m` is (`n + 1) // 2, `L` is appended with `m`**.

This means that the list `L` now contains one additional element, which is the value of `m`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
