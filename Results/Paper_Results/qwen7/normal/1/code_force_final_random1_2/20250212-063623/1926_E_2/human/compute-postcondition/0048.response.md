Output State: **`n` is now (n - (n + 1) // 2), `k` is an integer equal to the second input value, `L` is a list containing `m`, `m` is equal to (n + 1) // 2**.

Explanation:
- Initially, `n` is a non-zero integer, `k` is an integer equal to the second input value, `L` is an empty list, `m` is equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, and `n` is now `(n - (n + 1) // 2)`.
- The code `L.append(m)` appends the value of `m` to the list `L`.
- Since `m` is equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, `L` now contains `m`.
- The value of `n` is updated to `(n - (n + 1) // 2)`, which simplifies to `-1` because `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`.
- The values of `k` and `L` remain unchanged except for the addition of `m` to `L`.
