Based on the initial state provided:

- `tot` is an integer whose current value is less than `k`.
- `k` is an integer whose current value is less than or equal to `tot` plus `a`.

We need to determine the value of the expression `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)`.

However, there is no explicit value given for `pow`, and it is not defined in the initial state. Since `pow` is not specified, we cannot determine its value. Therefore, we will leave it as `pow` in the expression.

Given the values of `tot` and `k`, let's break down the expression:

1. Calculate `(k - tot)`: This will be a positive integer because `k` is greater than `tot`.
2. Multiply the result by 2: This doubles the difference between `k` and `tot`.
3. Subtract 1 from the result: This reduces the doubled difference by 1.

So, the expression `2 * (k - tot) - 1` will give us a specific integer value based on the current values of `k` and `tot`.

Since `pow` is not defined, the final expression remains as `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)`.

Output: **pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)**
