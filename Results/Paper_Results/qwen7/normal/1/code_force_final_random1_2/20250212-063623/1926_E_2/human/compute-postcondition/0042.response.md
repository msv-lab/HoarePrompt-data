Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input value, `k` is an integer equal to the second input value**.

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated inputs from the user, converts them to integers, and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k` respectively. The initial state of other variables remains unchanged, but now `n` and `k` hold the integer values of the inputs.
