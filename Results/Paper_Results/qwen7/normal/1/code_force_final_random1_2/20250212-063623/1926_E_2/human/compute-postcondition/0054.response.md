Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an integer equal to the second input value, `L` is a list containing two elements both equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, and `m` is equal to `(n + 1) // 2`.**

Explanation: The code `m = (n + 1) // 2` assigns the value of `(n + 1) // 2` to the variable `m`. Since `L.append(m)` has already been executed, `L` now contains two elements, both equal to `(n + 1) // 2`. The values of `n`, `k`, and `L` are updated accordingly, while `k` remains unchanged as it was defined as an integer equal to the second input value.
