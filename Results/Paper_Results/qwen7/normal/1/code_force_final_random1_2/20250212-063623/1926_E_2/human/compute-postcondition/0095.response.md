Output State: **`a` is 1, `L` is [1, 3], `pow` is 2, `tot` is 3, `m` is 2, `n` must be non-zero**

Explanation: The value of `m` is updated to `(n + 1) // 2`. Since `n` must be non-zero, `m` will be `(n + 1) // 2`. The other variables (`a`, `L`, `pow`, `tot`, and `n`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
