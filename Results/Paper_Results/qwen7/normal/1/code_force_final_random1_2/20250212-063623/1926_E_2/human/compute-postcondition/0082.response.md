Output State: `a` is 1, `L` is [1, 1, 1], `pow` is 2, `tot` is 3.

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `a` remains 1 because it is the only element in the list `L`. The list `L` itself does not change during the loop. The variable `pow` is multiplied by 2 in each iteration of the loop, but since the loop only iterates 3 times, `pow` becomes 2 (2^3 / 2^2 = 2). The variable `tot` is updated in each iteration by adding the value of `a`, so after 3 iterations, `tot` is 2 + 1 = 3.
