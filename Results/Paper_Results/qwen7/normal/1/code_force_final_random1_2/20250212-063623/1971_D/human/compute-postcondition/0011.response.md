Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `i` is 0, `s` is an input string with a length of at least 2, `count` is 2, `flag` is True, `j` is 0, if the first two characters of `s` are '01'. Otherwise, `flag` remains False, `t`, `i`, `s`, `count`, and `j` keep their original values.
