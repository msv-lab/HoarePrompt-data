You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 1
        flag = False
        j = 0
        while j < len(s) - 1:
            if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
                count += 1
                if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                    flag = True
            j += 1
        if flag:
            count -= 1
        print(count)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `t` and a binary string `s`. For each test case, it counts the total number of transitions between different characters in the string `s`, adjusting the count by subtracting one if a '0' is immediately followed by a '1'. It also checks if there was at least one instance where a '0' was immediately followed by a '1'. The function prints the adjusted count for each test case and does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle cases where the binary string has multiple segments of '0's followed by '1's. For example, consider the input "010101". The program will count this as needing 3 pieces, but it can actually be rearranged into a sorted binary string with just 2 pieces: "010" and "101".

To fix this, the program needs to count the number of transitions from '0' to '1' and ensure that each segment of '0's and '1's is treated appropriately. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 1
        last_char = s[0]
        for j in range(1, len(s)):
            if s[j] != last_char:
                if last_char == '0' and s[j] == '1':
                    count += 1
                last_char = s[j]
        print(count)
```

This version correctly counts the minimum number of pieces needed to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.
