Postcondition: `j` is 2, `count` is 3, `flag` is True, `i` is `i + 1`, the character at index `j` of `s` is '1', the character at index `j + 1` of `s` is '0'. Since the condition `s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1'` is false (as per the if part postcondition, `s[j]` is '1' and `s[j + 1]` is '0'), the else part does not execute, and the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.
