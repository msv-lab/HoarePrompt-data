Postcondition: **`j` is 2, `count` is 2, `flag` is True, `i` is `i + 1`, the character at index `j` of `s` is '1', the character at index `j + 1` of `s` is '0'.** 

This postcondition remains the same as the precondition because the condition `s[j] != s[j + 1]` evaluates to false (since `s[j]` is '1' and `s[j + 1]` is '0'), and thus the else part does not execute. Therefore, no changes are made to the variables, and the postcondition is identical to the precondition.
