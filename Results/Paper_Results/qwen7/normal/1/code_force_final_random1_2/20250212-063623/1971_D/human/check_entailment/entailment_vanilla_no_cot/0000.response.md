Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Logic for Counting Pieces**: The logic for counting the number of pieces is flawed. The current implementation increments `count` every time there is a change in consecutive characters. However, this approach does not account for the requirement that all zeros must come before all ones.

2. **Handling Sorted Strings**: The program does not handle strings that are already sorted correctly. For example, for the input `"00000000"`, the program should output `1`, but it might not do so correctly due to the current logic.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program fails to handle edge cases properly. For instance, for the input `"11111111"`, the program should output `1`, but it might incorrectly output a higher number because of the way changes are counted.

To fix this, we need to identify the positions where the sequence transitions from `0` to `1` and count these transitions plus one additional piece for the remaining part of the string. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 0
        last_char = '0'
        for char in s:
            if char != last_char:
                count += 1
                last_char = char
        # If the string ends with '0', we need an extra piece
        if last_char == '0':
            count += 1
        print(count)
```

This corrected version correctly counts the number of pieces needed by identifying transitions from `0` to `1` and ensuring the final piece accounts for any trailing zeros.
