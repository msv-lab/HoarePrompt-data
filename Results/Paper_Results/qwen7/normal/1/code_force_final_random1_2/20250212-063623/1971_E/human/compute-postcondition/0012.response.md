Output State: **`i` is 3; `ad` is a list containing the values `a[1] - a[0]`, `a[2] - a[1]`, and `a[3] - a[2]`**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `a[i] - a[i - 1]` to the list `ad`. Given that `i` is 3, `a[i]` is `a[3]` and `a[i - 1]` is `a[2]`. Therefore, the new value appended to `ad` is `a[3] - a[2]`. The original values in `ad` remain unchanged.
