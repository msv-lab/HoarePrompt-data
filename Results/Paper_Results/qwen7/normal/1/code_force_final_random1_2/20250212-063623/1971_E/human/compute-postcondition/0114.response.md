Output State: **`l` is an input integer, `q` must be at least 1, `m` is 0, `i` is 1, `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted to keep the list `a` sorted, and the current value of `a[s]` is equal to `ql`, and we continue the loop.**

The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables; it simply moves the control flow to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, all the previous conditions and values remain unchanged.
