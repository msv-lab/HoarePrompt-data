Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `i`: This variable is used as the loop counter.
   - `len(b)`: This is the upper limit of the loop, which determines how many times the loop will run.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` being 1 and increments by 1 until `i` is less than `len(b)`. Therefore, before the loop starts, `i` should be set to 1.

3. **Determine the State of `b`**: The value of `b` itself does not directly affect the loop's execution but is used to determine the number of iterations (`len(b)`). However, since we are focusing on the initial state before the loop, we don't need to adjust `b` itself.

4. **Determine the State of `ad`**: The list `ad` is defined as containing the differences between consecutive elements of `a`, starting from `a[1] - a[0]` up to `a[len(a)-1] - a[len(a)-2]`. Since the loop has not yet executed, `ad` should be an empty list or not yet initialized.

Based on these points, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

- `i` should be set to 1.
- `b` should be present but its exact contents are not specified.
- `ad` should be an empty list or not yet initialized.

Therefore, the final state before the loop starts is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `b` is a list, `ad` is an empty list**.
