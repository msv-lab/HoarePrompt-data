Output State: **`i` is 2, `ad` is a list containing the value `a[1] - a[0]`.**

Explanation: The code `ad.append(a[i] - a[i - 1])` appends the difference between the current element `a[i]` and the previous element `a[i - 1]` to the list `ad`. Given that `i` is initially 1 and must be less than `len(a)`, `i` is incremented to 2 (since `i += 1` is implied by the context), and `ad` now contains the value `a[1] - a[0]`.
