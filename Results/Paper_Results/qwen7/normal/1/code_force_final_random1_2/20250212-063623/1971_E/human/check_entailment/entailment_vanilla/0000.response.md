Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the input values for `t`, `n`, `k`, `q`, `a`, and `b` as specified.
2. **Distance Calculation**: It calculates the distances between consecutive points in arrays `ad` and `bd` correctly.
3. **Speed Calculation**: The speeds between consecutive points are calculated correctly and stored in array `v`.
4. **Query Handling**: For each query, the program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the appropriate segment where the queried point `ql` lies.
5. **Time Calculation**:
   - If the queried point exactly matches one of the known points, it directly prints the corresponding time.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the additional time taken to travel from the previous known point to the queried point using the speed for that segment.
6. **Output Formatting**: The program formats the output correctly, printing the time for each query on the same line separated by spaces.

Given the detailed analysis, the provided program appears to handle all aspects of the problem correctly according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
