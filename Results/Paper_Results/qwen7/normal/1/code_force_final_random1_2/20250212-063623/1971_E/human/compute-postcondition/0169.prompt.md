Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `ad` is a list containing the differences between each consecutive element in `a` from index 1 to `len(a) - 1`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to the length of the list `a`. The list `ad` will contain the differences between each pair of consecutive elements in `a`, starting from the second element (`a[1]`) down to the last element (`a[len(a) - 1]`).
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(b)):
    bd.append(b[i] - b[i - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 1; `b` is a list or iterable with at least one element; `bd` is a list with an additional element equal to `b[1] - b[0]`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is now 3; `bd` includes the new element `b[3] - b[2]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 4; `bd` includes the new element `b[4] - b[3]` and the updated list is `[b[4] - b[3]]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
