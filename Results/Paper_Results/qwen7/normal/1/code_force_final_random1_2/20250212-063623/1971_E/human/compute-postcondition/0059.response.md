Output State: **`q` is an input integer, `l` is 0, `m` is `bd[s] * ql / ad[s] + b[s - 1]`, `i` is 2, `ql` is an input integer decreased by `a[s - 1]`, and `s` is the index returned by `bisect_left(a, ql)`**.

Explanation: The value of `m` is updated to `m + bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`. Here, `bd[s]`, `ql`, and `ad[s]` are specific values from the initial state, so `m` is updated accordingly. The value of `ql` is decreased by `a[s - 1]`, and `s` remains the index returned by `bisect_left(a, ql)`. The other variables (`q`, `l`, `i`) remain unchanged.
