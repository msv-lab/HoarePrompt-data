Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(1, len(b)):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `b`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(b)`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `b` is a list
   - `ad` is an empty list
   - `bd` is a list containing the value `b[1] - b[0]`

4. **Update the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, the loop will check if `i < len(b)`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1 (since it starts from 1 and increments by 1 each time).
   - Therefore, `i` will become 3.
   - The value of `bd` will be updated to contain the value `b[2] - b[1]`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is 3
- `b` remains a list
- `ad` remains an empty list
- `bd` is updated to contain the value `b[2] - b[1]`

So, the final state is:

**State: **`i` is 3, `b` is a list, `ad` is an empty list, `bd` is a list containing the value `b[2] - b[1]`**
