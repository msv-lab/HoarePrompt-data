Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, k, and q are integers such that k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k, q ≤ 10^5, and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. a is a strictly increasing list of k integers where each a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n and a_k = n. b is a strictly increasing list of k integers where each b_i satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9 and b_i < b_{i+1} for every 1 ≤ i ≤ k-1. d is an integer such that 0 ≤ d ≤ n.**
