Output State: **`i` is 2; `ad` is a list containing the values `a[1] - a[0]` and `a[2] - a[1]`**

Explanation: The initial state has `i` as 2 and `ad` as a list containing the value `a[1] - a[0]`. The code snippet appends `a[i] - a[i - 1]` to the list `ad`. Given that `i` is 2, `a[i]` refers to `a[2]` and `a[i - 1]` refers to `a[1]`. Therefore, `ad` now contains both `a[1] - a[0]` and `a[2] - a[1]`. The value of `i` remains unchanged.
