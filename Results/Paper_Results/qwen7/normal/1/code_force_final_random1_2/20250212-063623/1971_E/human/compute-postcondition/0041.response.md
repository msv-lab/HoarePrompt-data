Output State: **`q` is an input integer, `m` is 0, `i` is 1, `s` is the index returned by bisect_left(a, q), and the current value of `a[s]` is equal to `q`.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by the `continue` statement, the values of `q`, `m`, `i`, `s`, and the condition `a[s] == q` remain unchanged from their initial states.
