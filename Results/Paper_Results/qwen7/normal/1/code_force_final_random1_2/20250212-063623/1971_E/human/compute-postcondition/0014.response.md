Output State: `i` is equal to `len(a) - 1`; `ad` is a list containing the differences between consecutive elements of `a`, starting from `a[1] - a[0]` up to `a[len(a)-1] - a[len(a)-2]`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to the length of the list `a` minus one, because the loop runs from `1` to `len(a) - 1`. The list `ad` will contain all the differences between consecutive elements of the list `a`, starting from the second element to the last element of `a`.
