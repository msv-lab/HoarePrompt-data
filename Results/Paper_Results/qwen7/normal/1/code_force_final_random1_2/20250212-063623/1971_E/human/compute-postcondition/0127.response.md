The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`ql` is an input integer, `m` is 0, `i` is 2, `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted to keep the list `a` sorted using bisect_left, `l` is 2.**
