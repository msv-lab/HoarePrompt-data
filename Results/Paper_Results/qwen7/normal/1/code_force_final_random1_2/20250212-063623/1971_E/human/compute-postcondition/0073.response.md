Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `q` is an input integer.
   - `l` is explicitly defined as 1.
   - `m` is defined as `bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s] + b[s - 1]`.
   - `i` is explicitly defined as 1.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(int(m), end=' ')
   ```

From the initial state, we know:
- `l` is 1.
- `m` is computed using the formula `bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s] + b[s - 1]`.

However, the values of `bd`, `a`, `ad`, `b`, and `s` are not explicitly provided. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `m`. We can only describe it based on the given formula.

So, the output will be the integer part of `m` followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

Output: **int(bd[s] * (q - a[s - 1]) / ad[s] + b[s - 1]), end=' '**
