Output State: **`i` is 1; `b` is a list; `ad` is an empty list; `bd` is a list containing the value `b[1] - b[0]`**.

Explanation: The code appends the value of `b[i] - b[i - 1]` to the list `bd`. Given that `i` is initially 1, the expression `b[i] - b[i - 1]` translates to `b[1] - b[0]`. Since `b` is a list, `b[0]` and `b[1]` are elements of the list, and the result of the subtraction is appended to `bd`. The other variables (`i`, `b`, and `ad`) remain unchanged.
