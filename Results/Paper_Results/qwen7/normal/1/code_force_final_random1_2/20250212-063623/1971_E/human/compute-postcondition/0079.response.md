Output State: **`q` is an input integer, `l` is 2, `m` is `bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s] + b[s - 1]`, `i` is 1, `s` is the index returned by `bisect_left(a, ql)`, `ql` is an input integer decreased by `a[s - 1]`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list where the first element is 0 and the rest are integers inputted from the user, `b` is a list where the first element is 0 and the rest are integers inputted from the user.**

Explanation: The code `b = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))` creates a new list `b` by taking the input as a space-separated string, converting each element to an integer using `map(int, ...)` and then adding a leading zero to the beginning of the list. This operation does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the values of `q`, `l`, `m`, `i`, `s`, `ql`, `n`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged, while `b` is updated as described.
