Output State: **`m` is `m` (which was `0 + b[s - 1]`) plus `(bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1])) / ad[s]`, `i` is 1, `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted to keep the list `a` sorted using `bisect_left`, `l` is 3, `ql` is an input integer - `a[s - 1]**.

Explanation: The value of `m` is updated by adding the expression `(bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1])) / ad[s]` to its current value. The other variables (`i`, `s`, `l`, and `ql`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
