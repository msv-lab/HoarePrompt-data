Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `len(a)`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `len(a)`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: `i` is 2, `ad` is a list containing the value `a[1] - a[0]`.

Given that `i` is currently 2, the loop will continue if `i` is less than `len(a)`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3.

Therefore, the only variable that needs to be adjusted is `i`. The length of the list `a` does not change within the loop, so it remains the same.

**Adjusted state**:
- `i` is now 3.
- `ad` remains the same: a list containing the value `a[1] - a[0]`.

So, the final state is:

State: **`i` is 3, `ad` is a list containing the value `a[1] - a[0]`**.
