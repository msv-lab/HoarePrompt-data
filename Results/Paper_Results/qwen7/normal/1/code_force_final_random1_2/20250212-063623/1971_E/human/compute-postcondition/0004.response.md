Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n`, `k`, and `q` are integers obtained from the input split, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers obtained from the input split, `b` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers obtained from the input split.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `b` with a leading zero and appends to it a list of integers obtained from the input split. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `q`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial state. The new list `b` starts with 0 and is followed by the integers from the input split.
