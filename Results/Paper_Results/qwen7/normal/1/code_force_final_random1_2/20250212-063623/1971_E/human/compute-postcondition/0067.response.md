The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since no loop was specified in the given code snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged. The `continue` statement does not affect the values of `q`, `l`, `m`, `i`, `ql`, `s`, or `ql`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`q` is an input integer, `l` is 1, `m` is 0, `i` is 1, `ql` is an input integer, `s` is the index returned by `bisect_left(a, ql)`, and `ql` is assigned the value of `int(input())`**
