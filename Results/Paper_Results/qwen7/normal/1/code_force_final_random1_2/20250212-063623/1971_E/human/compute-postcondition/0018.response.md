Output State: **`i` is 2, `b` is a list, `ad` is an empty list, `bd` is a list containing the value `b[1] - b[0]`, `bd` is updated to contain the value `b[2] - b[1]`**.

Explanation: The code `bd.append(b[i] - b[i - 1])` appends the value of `b[i] - b[i - 1]` to the list `bd`. Given that `i` is initially 2, `b[i]` refers to `b[2]` and `b[i - 1]` refers to `b[1]`. Since `bd` was initially a list containing the value `b[1] - b[0]`, after executing the code, `bd` will now contain two elements: `b[1] - b[0]` and `b[2] - b[1]`.
