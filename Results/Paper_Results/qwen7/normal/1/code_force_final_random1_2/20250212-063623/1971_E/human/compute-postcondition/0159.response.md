Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head is `for i in range(1, len(a)):`. The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `len(a)`.

2. **Determine the Current State:**
   - `i` is currently 3.
   - `ad` is a list containing the values `[a[1] - a[0], a[3] - a[2]]`.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   The loop condition is `range(1, len(a))`. This means the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(a)`.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `i` is currently 3, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 4.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` (which is now 4) must still be less than `len(a)`. Therefore, `len(a)` must be greater than 4.

5. **State Adjustment:**
   - `i` needs to be adjusted to 4.
   - `len(a)` must be greater than 4.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 4, `ad` is a list containing the values `[a[1] - a[0], a[3] - a[2]]`, `len(a)` must be greater than 4**
