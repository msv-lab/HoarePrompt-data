Output State: **`q` is an input integer, `l` is 0, `m` is 0, `i` is 2, `s` is the index returned by `bisect_left(a, ql)`, `ql` is an input integer and we continue the loop.**

The `continue` statement causes the flow of execution to skip any remaining code in the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by the `continue` statement itself, the values of `q`, `l`, `m`, `i`, `s`, and `ql` remain unchanged.
