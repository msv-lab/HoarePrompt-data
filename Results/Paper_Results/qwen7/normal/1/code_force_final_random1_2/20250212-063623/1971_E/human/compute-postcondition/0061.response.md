Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is `for l in range(q)`. The variables involved in this loop are `l` and `q`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `q` is an input integer.
   - `l` is 0.
   - `m` is `bd[s] * ql / ad[s] + b[s - 1]`.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `ql` is an input integer decreased by `a[s - 1]`.
   - `s` is the index returned by `bisect_left(a, ql)`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `l < q`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `l` is 0.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `l` needs to be incremented by 1, making `l` equal to 1.
   - `q` remains unchanged as it is the upper limit of the range.

5. **Final state after adjusting for the next iteration**:
   - `q` is still the input integer.
   - `l` is now 1.
   - `m` remains `bd[s] * ql / ad[s] + b[s - 1]`.
   - `i` remains 2.
   - `ql` remains the input integer decreased by `a[s - 1]`.
   - `s` remains the index returned by `bisect_left(a, ql)`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`q` is an input integer, `l` is 1, `m` is `bd[s] * ql / ad[s] + b[s - 1]`, `i` is 2, `ql` is an input integer decreased by `a[s - 1]`, and `s` is the index returned by `bisect_left(a, ql)`**.
