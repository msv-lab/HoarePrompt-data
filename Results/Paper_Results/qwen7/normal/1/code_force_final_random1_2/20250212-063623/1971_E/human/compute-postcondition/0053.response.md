Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `q` is an input integer.
   - `l` is 0.
   - `m` is 0.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `s` is the index returned by `bisect_left(a, ql)`.
   - `ql` is an input integer.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(b[s], end=' ')
   ```

To determine what will be printed, we need to understand the role of `b` and `s`.

- `b` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we assume it is a list.
- `s` is the index returned by `bisect_left(a, ql)`, where `a` is another list and `ql` is an input integer.

The function `bisect_left` returns the index where the value `ql` would be inserted into the sorted list `a` to maintain the sorted order. This means `s` is the position in `a` where `ql` fits.

However, the code snippet prints `b[s]`, which means we need to know what `b[s]` is. Since `b` is not defined, we cannot determine the exact value of `b[s]` without more information about `b`.

Given the information provided, we can only say that `b[s]` will be the element at the index `s` in the list `b`.

Output: **b[s]**
