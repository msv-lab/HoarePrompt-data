Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `v` is a list containing elements calculated as `ad[i] / bd[i]` for each `i` from 2 to `len(a) - 1`.

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to the length of list `a`. The list `v` will contain the results of dividing each element in list `ad` starting from index 1 (i.e., `ad[1]`, `ad[2]`, ..., `ad[len(a) - 1]`) by the corresponding element in list `bd` (i.e., `bd[1]`, `bd[2]`, ..., `bd[len(a) - 2]`).
Code of the loop:
for l in range(q):
    m = 0
    i = 1
    ql = int(input())
    s = bisect_left(a, ql)
    if a[s] == ql:
        print(b[s], end=' ')
        continue
    ql -= a[s - 1]
    m += b[s - 1]
    m += bd[s] * ql / ad[s]
    print(int(m), end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 1, `v` is a list containing elements calculated as `ad[i] / bd[i]` for each `i` from 2 to `len(ad) - 1`, `l` is 0, `m` is `bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`, `q` is greater than 0, `s` is the index where `ql - a[s - 1]` would be inserted to keep the list `a` sorted, and if `a[s]` is equal to `ql - a[s - 1]`, no changes are made. If `a[s]` is not equal to `ql - a[s - 1]`, no changes are made either since there is no else part.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 1, `m` is `m` + `bd[s]` * (`m` + `b[s - 1]`) / `ad[s]`, `ql` is reduced by `a[s - 1]`, `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted to keep the list `a` sorted.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 1, `m` is `b[s - 1] + (bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s])`, `ql` is `ql - a[s - 1]`, `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted to keep the list `a` sorted, `l` is 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
