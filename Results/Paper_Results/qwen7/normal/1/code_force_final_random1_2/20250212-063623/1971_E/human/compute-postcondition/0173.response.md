Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop runs from `1` to `len(a) - 1`. This means the loop will continue as long as `i < len(a)`.

3. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**: 
   - `i` is currently `2`.
   - `v` contains a value equal to `ad[1] / bd[1]`.

4. **Next Iteration Analysis**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by `1` (since the loop increments `i` by default).
   - Therefore, `i` will become `3` in the next iteration.
   - The condition `i < len(a)` must still hold true for the loop to continue.

5. **Adjusting the States**:
   - `i` will be updated to `3`.
   - `v` does not change within the loop body based on the given information, so it remains `ad[1] / bd[1]`.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 3, `v` contains a value equal to `ad[1] / bd[1]`**
