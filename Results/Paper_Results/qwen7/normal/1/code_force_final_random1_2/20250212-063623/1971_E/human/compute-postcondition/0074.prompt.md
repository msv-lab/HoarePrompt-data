Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `i` is `len(a)`, `b` is a list, `ad` is an empty list, `bd` is a list containing the differences between consecutive elements of `b`, `v` is a list containing the single element 0, `v[0]` is undefined (or an error since `i` is out of bounds).

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = len(a) - 1`. After all iterations, `i` will be equal to `len(a)`, which means the loop has completed all its executions. Since the loop appends values to `v` based on `ad[i] / bd[i]`, and `ad` remains an empty list throughout, `v` will still contain only the initial value of 0. However, since `i` exceeds the bounds of both `ad` and `bd`, attempting to access `ad[i]` or `bd[i]` results in an error or undefined behavior. Therefore, `v[0]` remains 0, but any further attempts to append values to `v` using the loop logic would result in errors due to index out of bounds.
Code of the loop:
for l in range(q):
    m = 0
    i = 1
    ql = int(input())
    s = bisect_left(a, ql)
    if a[s] == ql:
        print(b[s], end=' ')
        continue
    ql -= a[s - 1]
    m += b[s - 1]
    m += bd[s] * ql / ad[s]
    print(int(m), end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `q` is an input integer, `m` is `bd[s] * (ql / ad[s]) + b[s - 1]`, `i` is 1, `s` is the index returned by `bisect_left(a, q)`, `ql` is `ql - a[s - 1]`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `q` is an input integer, `l` is 0, `m` is `bd[s] * ql / ad[s] + b[s - 1]`, `i` is 2, `ql` is an input integer decreased by `a[s - 1]`, and `s` is the index returned by `bisect_left(a, ql)`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `q` is an input integer, `l` is 1, `m` is `bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s] + b[s - 1]`, `i` is 1




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
