Postcondition: `i` is 1, `v` is a list containing elements calculated as `ad[i] / bd[i]` for each `i` from 2 to `len(ad) - 1`, `l` is 0, `m` is 0, `q` is greater than 0, `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted to keep the list `a` sorted, and if `a[s]` is equal to `ql`, no changes are made. If `a[s]` is not equal to `ql`, no changes are made either since there is no else part.
