Output State: `v` contains the list of values `[ad[1] / bd[1], ad[3] / bd[3], ad[5] / bd[5], ..., ad[len(a)-1] / bd[len(a)-1]]`, `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `len(b)` must be at least 1, and `len(a)` must be greater than or equal to the original length of `a` minus one.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `v` will contain the result of dividing each element in `ad` (from the 1st to the second last but one) by the corresponding element in `bd`, `i` will be equal to the length of `a`, `len(b)` must still be at least 1, and the length of `a` must be at least 2 more than its original length when the loop started.
