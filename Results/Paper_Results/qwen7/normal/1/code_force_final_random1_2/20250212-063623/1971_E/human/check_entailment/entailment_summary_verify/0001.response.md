### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly parses the input values for `t`, `n`, `k`, `q`, `a`, and `b` as specified. This part is handled accurately.

2. **Distance Calculation**:
   - The distances between consecutive points in arrays `ad` and `bd` are calculated correctly. This step is also handled accurately.

3. **Speed Calculation**:
   - The speeds between consecutive points are calculated correctly and stored in array `v`. However, there is a potential issue here. The speed calculation should be done using the formula \( v_i = \frac{ad[i]}{bd[i]} \). The program does this correctly, but let's ensure it is done properly.

4. **Query Handling**:
   - For each query, the program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the appropriate segment where the queried point `ql` lies. This step is handled correctly.

5. **Time Calculation**:
   - If the queried point exactly matches one of the known points, it directly prints the corresponding time. This is correct.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the additional time taken to travel from the previous known point to the queried point using the speed for that segment. This step is also handled correctly.

6. **Output Formatting**:
   - The program formats the output correctly, printing the time for each query on the same line separated by spaces. This part is also handled accurately.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Speed Calculation**:
  - The speed calculation \( v_i = \frac{ad[i]}{bd[i]} \) is correct. However, we need to ensure that the speed is consistent within each segment. The program assumes that the speed is constant between the points, which is correct based on the problem statement.

- **Binary Search**:
  - The use of `bisect_left` to find the appropriate segment is correct. This ensures that the program can quickly determine which segment the queried point falls into.

- **Time Calculation**:
  - The time calculation for the segment is correct. The program calculates the additional time required to travel from the previous known point to the queried point using the speed for that segment. This is done correctly.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles edge cases where the queried point exactly matches one of the known points correctly by directly printing the corresponding time.

### Conclusion:

Based on the detailed analysis, the provided program correctly handles all aspects of the problem as described in the problem statement. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**
