To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the expression for `m`.

1. **Initial State:**
   - `q` is an input integer.
   - `m` is defined as `bd[s] * (ql / ad[s]) + b[s - 1]`.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `s` is the index returned by `bisect_left(a, q)`.
   - `ql` is `ql - a[s - 1]`.

2. **Expression for `m`:**
   - `m = bd[s] * (ql / ad[s]) + b[s - 1]`.
   - Here, `bd[s]` and `ad[s]` are elements from the lists `bd` and `ad` respectively, indexed by `s`.
   - `b[s - 1]` is an element from the list `b`, indexed by `s - 1`.
   - `ql` is a variable that is being updated, but its exact value is not provided. We need to focus on the expression for `m`.

3. **Values to be Printed:**
   - The `print` statement outputs `int(m)`, which means the integer part of `m` will be printed.

Given the expression for `m`, we need to understand the values of `bd[s]`, `ad[s]`, and `b[s - 1]`. However, since these values are not explicitly provided, we can only describe them in terms of their indices.

- `bd[s]` is the `s`-th element of the list `bd`.
- `ad[s]` is the `s`-th element of the list `ad`.
- `b[s - 1]` is the `(s - 1)`-th element of the list `b`.

Thus, the expression for `m` becomes:

\[ m = \text{bd}[s] \times \left(\frac{\text{ql} - \text{a}[s - 1]}{\text{ad}[s]}\right) + \text{b}[s - 1] \]

Since the exact values of `bd[s]`, `ad[s]`, `b[s - 1]`, and `ql` are not provided, we can only describe the form of the output.

Output: **int(bd[s] * ((ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s]) + b[s - 1])**
