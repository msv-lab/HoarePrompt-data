Output State: **`q` is an input integer, `l` is 2, `m` is `bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s] + b[s - 1]`, `i` is 1, `s` is the index returned by `bisect_left(a, ql)`, `ql` is an input integer decreased by `a[s - 1]`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n, k, q = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, and `q`. The values of the other variables (`l`, `m`, `i`, `s`, and `ql`) remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, these variables retain their previous values and relationships.
