To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `ql` is an input integer.
   - `m` is 0.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted into the list `a` to keep it sorted using `bisect_left`.
   - `l` is 2.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(b[s], end=' ')
   ```

From the initial state, we know that `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted into the list `a` to keep it sorted. However, the list `a` and the list `b` are not explicitly defined in the initial state. Therefore, we need to focus on the value of `b[s]`.

Given that `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted to keep the list `a` sorted, and without knowing the exact content of `a` and `b`, we can infer that `b[s]` must be a value that corresponds to the position where `ql` would be inserted.

Since no specific values for `b` are provided, and the exact position `s` is not directly calculable from the given information, we can only describe the output in terms of the variable `b[s]`.

Output: **b[s]**
