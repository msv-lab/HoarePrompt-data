Output State: **`bd` is updated with the value of `b[i] - b[i - 1]`, and `b` and `i` retain their previous values.**

Explanation: The code appends the difference between `b[i]` and `b[i - 1]` to the list `bd`. However, since the initial values of `b` and `i` are not specified, they remain unchanged. The list `bd` is updated with the new value, which is the difference between `b[i]` and `b[i - 1]`.
