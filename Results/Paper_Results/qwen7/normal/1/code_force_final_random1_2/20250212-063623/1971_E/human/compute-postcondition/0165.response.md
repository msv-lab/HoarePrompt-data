Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `b` is a list or iterable with at least one element
   - `bd` is a list with an additional element equal to `b[1] - b[0]`

2. **Loop Head Analysis:**
   - The loop is defined as `for i in range(1, len(b)):`

3. **Understanding the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop starts with `i = 1` and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration.
   - The loop continues as long as `i < len(b)`.

4. **Current State of Variables:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` (which is now 2) must still be less than `len(b)`.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `i` must be incremented from 1 to 2.
   - `bd` should be updated to include the new element, which is `b[2] - b[1]`.

6. **Final State:**
   - `i` is now 2.
   - `bd` should include the new element `b[2] - b[1]`.
   - `b` remains unchanged since it is an external list and not modified within the loop.

Therefore, the final state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 2, `bd` is a list with elements including `b[1] - b[0]` and `b[2] - b[1]`, `b` is a list or iterable with at least two elements**
