Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- **State at the end of the previous iteration:**
  - `i` is 3
  - `ad` is a list containing the values `a[1] - a[0]` and `a[3] - a[2]`

- **For Loop Statement:**
  ```python
  for i in range(1, len(a)):
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables:**
   - The loop head variables are `i` and `len(a)`.

2. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop condition is `1 <= i < len(a)`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3.

3. **Next Iteration Check:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will become 4.
   - The loop will continue if `4 < len(a)`.

4. **List `ad`:**
   - The list `ad` contains specific values based on the list `a`.
   - These values do not change within the loop, so they remain the same.

### Updated State:
- `i` will be incremented to 4.
- `ad` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is 4, `ad` is a list containing the values `a[1] - a[0]` and `a[3] - a[2]`**
