Output State: **`i` is 1, `v` is a list containing elements calculated as `ad[i] / bd[i]` for each `i` from 2 to `len(ad) - 1`, `l` is 0, `m` is 0, `q` is greater than 0, `ql` is an input integer.**

The code `ql = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (converted to an integer) to the variable `ql`. The other variables (`i`, `v`, `l`, `m`, and `q`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
