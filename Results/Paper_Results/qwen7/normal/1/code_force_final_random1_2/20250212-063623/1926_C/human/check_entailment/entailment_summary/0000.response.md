Reasoning:
- The provided program has a few issues that need to be addressed:
  1. The array `A` is precomputed and filled up to `200000`, which means it will have values for all numbers from 1 to 200000. This is unnecessary because the program only needs to compute the required sums for the specific `n` values provided in the input.
  2. The logic to compute the sum of digits in `func_1` is correct.
  3. The main loop in the program should directly compute the sum for each `n` without precomputing all values up to 200000.
  4. The program does not handle the case where `t` (the number of test cases) is greater than the precomputed size (200000), although the problem constraints guarantee that `t` is less than or equal to 10^4 and `n` is less than or equal to 2 * 10^5, so this is not a concern here.

Given these points, the program can be simplified to directly compute the required sums for each `n` without precomputing all values.

Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect due to the unnecessary precomputation of sums for all numbers up to 200000. It should instead compute the sum of digits for each `n` as needed.
