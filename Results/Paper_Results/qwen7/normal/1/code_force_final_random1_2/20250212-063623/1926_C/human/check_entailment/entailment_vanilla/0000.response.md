Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization and Pre-calculation:**
   ```python
   A = []
   sum = 0
   for i in range(1, 200001):
       a = func_1(i)
       sum = sum + a
       A.append(sum)
   ```
   - This loop calculates the sum of digits for each number from 1 to 200,000 and stores the cumulative sums in list `A`.
   - The function `func_1` is used to compute the sum of digits of a number.
   - However, this pre-computation is unnecessary and inefficient since it recalculates the same values multiple times for different test cases.

2. **Reading Test Cases:**
   ```python
   for t in range(int(input())):
       n = int(input())
       print(A[n - 1])
   ```
   - This part reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by printing the pre-calculated cumulative sum at index `n-1`.

3. **Function Definition:**
   ```python
   def func_1(num):
       a = 0
       while num != 0:
           a = a + num % 10
           num = int(num / 10)
       return a
   ```
   - This function correctly computes the sum of digits of a given number.

### Issues and Correctness:

1. **Unnecessary Pre-calculation:**
   - The program pre-calculates the sum of digits for all numbers from 1 to 200,000 and stores them in `A`. This is not necessary because the sum of digits can be computed directly for each test case without storing intermediate results.
   
2. **Time Complexity:**
   - The pre-calculation step has a time complexity of \(O(n)\) where \(n = 200,000\). For each test case, the program still needs to access an element in `A`, which is efficient but not optimal.
   - Given the time constraint of 0.5 seconds per test case, this approach might exceed the time limit for large inputs.

3. **Efficient Solution:**
   - A more efficient solution would be to directly calculate the sum of digits for each number in each test case without pre-calculation.

### Conclusion:

The given program is incorrect due to the unnecessary pre-calculation and potential time complexity issues. A more efficient approach would be to directly compute the sum of digits for each number in each test case.

**Correctness: **False**
