Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: The initial state at the end of the previous iteration is given as:
   - `pd['400001']` is reduced to `pd['400000']`
   - `pd['400000']` is further reduced to the sum of its digits
   - This process continues until `i` becomes a single-digit number

2. **Loop Head**: The loop head is defined as:
   ```python
   for i in range(1, N):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `N`.

4. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is within the range `(1, N)`. This means `i` must be between 1 and `N-1` (inclusive).

5. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `pd['400001']` has been reduced to `pd['400000']`
   - `pd['400000']` has been reduced to the sum of its digits
   - `i` has been reduced to a value such that it is still within the range `(1, N)` but closer to being a single-digit number.

6. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 and must still be within the range `(1, N)`.

7. **Adjusting States**: The only states that need to be adjusted are those related to `i` and `N`.

Given that `i` is currently a multi-digit number and needs to be reduced to a single-digit number through the loop, let's assume `i` is currently `400000` (as an example). The next value of `i` would be `400001`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `pd['400001']` is reduced to `pd['400000']`
- `pd['400000']` is further reduced to the sum of its digits
- `i` is now `400001`
- `N` remains unchanged

State: **`pd['400001']` is reduced to `pd['400000']`, `pd['400000']` is further reduced to the sum of its digits, `i` is 400001, and `N` must be greater than 400001**
