Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `j`, which is iterating over each character in the string representation of `i`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `j`**: Since `j` is iterating over each character in the string representation of `i`, the initial value of `j` will be the first character of the string representation of `i`.

3. **Determine the initial value of `i`**: The initial value of `i` is given as `"400001"`.

4. **Calculate the initial value of `j`**: The first character of the string `"400001"` is `'4'`.

5. **Adjust the state**: We need to ensure that `j` is set to the first character of the string representation of `i`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `j` is `'4'`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `"400001"`
- `pd['400000']` is increased by 1 (since '400000' has one non-zero digit)
- `pd['400001']` is equal to `pd['400000']`

The only object in the loop head that needs adjustment is `j`, which should be set to the first character of the string representation of `i`.

**State:**
**`j` is `'4'`**
