Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `j` and `i`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each character in the string representation of `i`.

3. **Determine the initial state needed for the loop to execute**:
   - The variable `i` is currently set to `400002`.
   - The loop will convert `i` to a string and iterate over each character.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since the loop depends on the string representation of `i`, we need to ensure that `i` is correctly set to `400002`.
   - The variable `j` will take on each character of the string representation of `i` during each iteration, starting from the first character.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is `i` being set to `400002`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`pd['400001']` is the sum of digits of `pd['400000']`, `pd['400000']` is the sum of its digits, `i` is 400002, and `N` must be greater than 400002** (Note: The other states related to `pd['400001']` and `pd['400000']` are not directly relevant to the loop execution and remain unchanged).
