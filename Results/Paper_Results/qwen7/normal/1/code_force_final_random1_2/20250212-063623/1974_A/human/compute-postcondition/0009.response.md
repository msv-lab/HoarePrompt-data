Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is an input integer, `i` is 0, `x` is the first integer entered, `y` is the second integer entered, `z` is equal to \((y + 1) // 2\), `m` is \(15 * z - y * 4\), and if \(m < a\), then the current value of `m` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `z` is updated to \((y + 1) // 2 + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15\) and `m` is recalculated as \(15 * z - y * 4\).
