Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `a`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `a`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
   - `a` is an input integer
   - `i` is 0
   - `x` is the first integer entered
   - `y` is the second integer entered
   - `z` is equal to \((y + 1) // 2\)
   - `m` is \(15 * z - y * 4\)
   - If \(m < a\), then the current value of `m` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `z` is updated to \((y + 1) // 2 + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15\) and `m` is recalculated as \(15 * z - y * 4\)

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 0, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1.
   - The value of `a` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an input integer, `i` is 1, `x` is the first integer entered, `y` is the second integer entered, `z` is equal to \((y + 1) // 2\), `m` is \(15 * z - y * 4\)**.
