Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an input integer, `i` is 1, `x` is the first integer entered, `y` is the second integer entered, `z` is \((y + 1) // 2 + (x - m + 14) // 15\), `m` is \(15 * z - y * 4\). If `m < a`, then the values of `x`, `y`, `z`, and `m` are updated according to the if part. If `m >= a`, no changes are made to these variables.
