Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `a` is an input integer.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `x` is the first integer entered.
   - `y` is the second integer entered.
   - `z` is calculated as \((y + 1) // 2 + (x - m + 14) // 15\), where \(m = 15 \cdot ((y + 1) // 2) - y \cdot 4\).

2. **Calculation of `m`**:
   - First, calculate \((y + 1) // 2\). This is the integer division of \((y + 1)\) by 2.
   - Then, calculate \(15 \cdot ((y + 1) // 2)\), which is 15 times the result of the previous step.
   - Next, calculate \(y \cdot 4\), which is 4 times the value of `y`.
   - Finally, calculate \(m = 15 \cdot ((y + 1) // 2) - y \cdot 4\).

3. **Calculation of `z`**:
   - Calculate \((y + 1) // 2\), which is the same as the first part of the calculation for `m`.
   - Calculate \((x - m + 14) // 15\), which involves subtracting `m` from `x + 14` and then performing integer division by 15.
   - Combine these results to get \(z = (y + 1) // 2 + (x - m + 14) // 15\).

4. **Condition Check**:
   - If `m < a`, then `z` is updated to \((y + 1) // 2 + (x - m + 14) // 15\). Since there is no else part, the value of `z` remains unchanged if `m` is not less than `a`.

Given that the value of `z` does not change based on the condition check (since there is no else part), the value of `z` is simply the result of the formula \((y + 1) // 2 + (x - m + 14) // 15\).

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **(y + 1) // 2 + (x - m + 14) // 15 (where m = 15 * ((y + 1) // 2) - y * 4)**
