Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an input integer, `i` is 1, `x` is the first integer entered, `y` is the second integer entered, `z` is equal to \((y + 1) // 2\), `m` is \(15 * z - y * 4\), `x` is the first integer entered from input, `y` is the second integer entered from input.**

Explanation: The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input and assigns them to `x` and `y` respectively. The values of `t`, `a`, `i`, `z`, and `m` remain unchanged from their initial states.
