State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is an input integer, `i` is 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variables `i` and `a`.
2. For the loop to execute, `a` must be at least 1 because `range(a)` generates numbers from 0 to `a-1`.
3. Before the loop starts, `i` is initialized to 0.
4. The initial value of `t` (which is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\)) does not affect the loop's execution condition directly.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `a` to ensure it is at least 1, and `i` to be initialized to 0.
