Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `a` is an input integer, `i` is 0, `x` is the first integer entered, `y` is the second integer entered.**

Explanation: The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `y`. The variables `t` and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states. The variable `i` is also unchanged and remains at 0.
