Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `a` from the input.
   - It then processes each test case in a loop.

2. **Variables Initialization**:
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y`, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.
   - It calculates `z` as `(y + 1) // 2`. This is the minimum number of 2x2 icons that can fit into the screens, considering each 2x2 icon takes up 2 cells vertically and 2 cells horizontally, thus occupying 4 cells.

3. **Space Calculation**:
   - It calculates `m` as `15 * z - y * 4`. This formula seems to be an attempt to calculate the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons, but it does not seem to directly relate to the total number of cells available on the screens.

4. **Condition Check**:
   - The condition `if m < a:` checks if the remaining space (`m`) is less than the number of test cases (`a`). This condition is not relevant to the problem since `a` is the number of test cases and not related to the number of cells.

5. **Final Calculation**:
   - If the condition is true, it updates `z` as `z + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15`. This part seems to be an attempt to adjust `z` based on the remaining 1x1 icons, but the logic here is flawed because `m` was calculated incorrectly and `a` is not relevant.

6. **Output**:
   - Finally, it prints `z`, which should be the number of screens needed.

### Correctness Analysis

The main issues with the program are:
- The calculation of `m` is incorrect and irrelevant.
- The condition `if m < a:` does not make sense in this context.
- The final adjustment of `z` is based on an incorrect calculation of `m`.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed.

### Conclusion

The given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
