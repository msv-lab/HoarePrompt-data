Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an input integer, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the new input string split on spaces and converted to integers, `num` is the previous value of `num` minus 1, `a` is assigned the value of the new input integer, `b` is updated with the new list of integers.** 

This postcondition remains the same for both the if and else parts since both parts do not change the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, or `num` beyond what is already described in the precondition. Therefore, the overall postcondition is simply the precondition itself, as no additional constraints or changes are introduced by the if-else block.
