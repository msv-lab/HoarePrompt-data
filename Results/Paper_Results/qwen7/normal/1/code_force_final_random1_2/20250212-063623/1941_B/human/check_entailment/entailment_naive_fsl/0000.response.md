Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program checks only the first and last elements of the array for specific conditions and prints 'NO' if these conditions are met. However, the problem requires checking whether it is possible to make all elements of the array zero using the specified operations, not just the first and last elements.

For example, consider the following input:
```
5
2 4 4 5 1
```
The program will incorrectly output 'NO' because the first element (2) is not odd and the second element (4) is not equal to 2 + 2. However, it is possible to make all elements zero using the operations. For instance:
- Apply the operation at i=3: [2, 4, 3, 3, 1]
- Apply the operation at i=2: [2, 2, 2, 2, 1]
- Apply the operation at i=4: [2, 2, 2, 0, 1]
- Apply the operation at i=3: [2, 2, 1, 0, 1]
- Apply the operation at i=2: [2, 0, 0, 0, 1]
- Apply the operation at i=3: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
- Apply the operation at i=4: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the solution for all cases.
