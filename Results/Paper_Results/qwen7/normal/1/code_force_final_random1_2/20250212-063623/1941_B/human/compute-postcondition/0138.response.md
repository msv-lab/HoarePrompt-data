Functionality: **The function accepts a list `a` of `n` non-negative integers where each integer `a_j` satisfies 0 ≤ a_j ≤ 10^9, and an integer `n` such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5. Additionally, there is a positive integer `t` (not directly passed as a parameter) such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. The function returns a value based on the input list `a` and integer `n` for each test case.**

This means the function processes a list of integers and an integer indicating the size of the list, and it does so for up to 10^4 test cases, with the total size of `n` across all test cases not exceeding 2 * 10^5.
