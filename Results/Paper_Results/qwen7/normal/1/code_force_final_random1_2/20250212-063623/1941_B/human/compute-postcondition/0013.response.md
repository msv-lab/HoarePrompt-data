Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an input integer, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the new input string split on spaces and converted to integers, `num` is the previous value of `num` minus 1, `a` is assigned the value of the new input integer.**

Explanation: The code `b = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a new input string, splits it into individual elements based on spaces, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `b`. The values of `t`, `a`, `num`, and the original `a` (which is now reassigned) remain unchanged except that `a` is now set to the new input integer. The previous value of `num` is reduced by 1.
