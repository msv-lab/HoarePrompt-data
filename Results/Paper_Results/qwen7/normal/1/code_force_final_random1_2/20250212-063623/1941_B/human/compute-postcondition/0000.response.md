Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `_`: This is a placeholder variable used in the `for` loop to iterate over the input values.

2. **Determine the Input Source**: The loop body processes input from `input()` function, which means the loop will execute based on the number of inputs provided.

3. **Initial State**: The initial state before the loop starts is given as follows:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - For each test case, `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
   - The array `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(0 \leq a_j \leq 10^9\) for each element \(a_j\) in the array.
   - The sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\).

4. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. Each test case will have its own `n` and `a`.

5. **Adjusting the State**: To ensure the loop can execute, we need to set up the initial conditions for the loop:
   - We need to set `t` to a value within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - For each test case, we need to read the value of `n` and initialize the array `a` with `n` elements.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

- `t` should be set to a value within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

Therefore, the final state is:

**State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**.
