Postcondition: ***`numTest` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers where the (i+1)-th element is decreased by 2 * `opNum`, `stop` is `True`, and `a[i + 2]` is decreased by `opNum`, and `i` is `n-3`. If `a[i]` is less than 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
