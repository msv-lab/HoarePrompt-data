Output State: **`stop` is `True`, `i` is `n-3`, `opNum` is equal to `a[i] - opNum', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no variables are reassigned or altered by the `break` statement itself, their previous states remain unchanged. Therefore, `stop` remains `True`, `i` remains `n-3`, and `opNum` remains `a[i] - opNum`. We also note that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
