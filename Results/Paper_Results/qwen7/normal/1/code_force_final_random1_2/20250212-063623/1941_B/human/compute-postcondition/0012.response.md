Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an input integer, `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer, `num` is the previous value of `num` minus 1, `a` is assigned the value of the new input integer.**

Explanation: The code `a = int(input())` takes an input integer and assigns it to the variable `a`. The values of `t`, `b`, and `num` remain unchanged from their initial states.
