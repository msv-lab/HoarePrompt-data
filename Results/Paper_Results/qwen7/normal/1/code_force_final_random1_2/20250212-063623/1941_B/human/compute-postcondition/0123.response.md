Output State: **`a[i]` is 0, `a[i + 1]` is decremented by `4 * opNum`, `a[i + 2]` is decremented by `4 * opNum`, `stop` is `True`, `i` is `0`, `n` is `3`, `opNum` is `a[i]`.**

Explanation: The code sets `opNum` to the value of `a[i]`, which is decremented by `opNum`. Since `a[i]` was originally decremented by `opNum`, setting `opNum` to its value means `opNum` is now the amount by which `a[i]` was already decremented. The values of `a[i + 1]` and `a[i + 2]` are further decremented by `2 * opNum`, which is `2 * (a[i] - opNum)`. However, since `a[i]` is now 0, the decrement operations on `a[i + 1]` and `a[i + 2]` will be by `4 * opNum`. The other variables remain unchanged.
