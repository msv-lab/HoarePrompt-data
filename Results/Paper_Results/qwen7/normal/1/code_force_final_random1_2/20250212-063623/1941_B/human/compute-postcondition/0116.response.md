Output State: **`a[i]` is decremented by `opNum`, `a[i + 1]` is decremented by `2 * opNum`, `a[i + 2]` is decremented by `2 * opNum`, `stop` is True.**

Explanation: The code `a[i + 2] -= opNum` decrements the value of `a[i + 2]` by `opNum`. Since `a[i + 2]` was already decremented by `opNum` before this line of code, it is now decremented by an additional `opNum`, making the total decrement for `a[i + 2]` equal to `2 * opNum`. The values of `a[i]`, `a[i + 1]`, and `stop` remain unchanged.
