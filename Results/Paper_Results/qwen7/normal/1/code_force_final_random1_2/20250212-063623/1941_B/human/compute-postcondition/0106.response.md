Output State: **`a` is a list of integers where each element is decremented by `opNum`, `stop` is True, and `a[i + 1]` is decremented by `2 * opNum`.**

Explanation: The code decrements the element at index `i + 1` in the list `a` by `2 * opNum`. The value of `opNum` is equal to the original value of `a[i]` which was less than 0, so the decrement operation affects `a[i + 1]` specifically. The other conditions (`a` being a list of integers where each element is decremented by `opNum`, and `stop` being True) remain unchanged.
