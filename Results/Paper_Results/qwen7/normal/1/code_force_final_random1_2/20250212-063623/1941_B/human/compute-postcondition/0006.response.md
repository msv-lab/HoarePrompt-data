Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an input integer, `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer. `b[0]` is even or `b[1]` equals `b[0] + 2` and `b[-1]` is even or `b[-2]` equals `b[-1] + 2`.
