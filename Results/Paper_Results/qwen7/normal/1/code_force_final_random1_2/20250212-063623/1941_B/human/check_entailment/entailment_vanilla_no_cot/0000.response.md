Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution is incorrect because it only checks the first and last elements of the array for specific conditions and does not fully consider the constraints and requirements of the problem. The solution should check if the sum of the array is divisible by 3, as each operation reduces the sum of the array by 3. Additionally, it should ensure that the array can be reduced to all zeros through the specified operations.

Here's a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Check if the sum of the array is divisible by 3
        if sum(b) % 3 != 0:
            print('NO')
        else:
            # Check if the array can be reduced to all zeros
            # This is true if we can always find a valid i to perform the operation
            # such that the array can eventually become all zeros
            valid = True
            for i in range(1, n-1):
                if b[i-1] < b[i] + 2 or b[i+1] < b[i] + 2:
                    valid = False
                    break
            
            if valid:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')

func()
```

This corrected solution checks if the sum of the array is divisible by 3 and then ensures that the array can be reduced to all zeros by verifying that for every element \(a_i\), the adjacent elements \(a_{i-1}\) and \(a_{i+1}\) can support the required reduction.
