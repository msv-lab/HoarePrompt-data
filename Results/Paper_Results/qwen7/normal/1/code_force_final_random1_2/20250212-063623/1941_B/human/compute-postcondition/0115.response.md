Output State: **`a[i]` is decremented by `opNum`, `a[i + 1]` is decremented by `2 * opNum`, `a[i + 2]` is decremented by `opNum`, `stop` is True.**

This means that the value of `a[i + 1]` has been specifically decremented by `2 * opNum`, while `a[i]` and `a[i + 2]` have been decremented by `opNum`. The variable `stop` remains `True`.
