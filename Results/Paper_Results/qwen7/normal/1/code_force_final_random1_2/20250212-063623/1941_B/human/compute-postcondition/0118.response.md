Output: **NO**

Explanation: The initial state provides us with the following information:
- `a[i]` is decremented by `opNum`. Since `i` is `0`, this means `a[0]` is decremented by `opNum`.
- `a[i + 1]` is decremented by `2 * opNum`. Since `i` is `0`, this means `a[1]` is decremented by `2 * opNum`.
- `a[i + 2]` is decremented by `2 * opNum`. Since `i` is `0`, this means `a[2]` is decremented by `2 * opNum`.
- `stop` is `False`.
- `i` is `0`.
- `n` is `3`.

The `print('NO')` statement simply prints the string `'NO'`. There are no variables or objects whose values need to be substituted into the output since the print statement does not reference any variables other than the string itself.
