Reasoning:
The annotated program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the conditions checked in the `if` statement are incorrect. The problem requires checking if it's possible to make all elements of the array zero using the specified operations. The current implementation only checks the first and last elements of the array for specific parity conditions, which is insufficient to determine if the entire array can be made zero.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to check if the sum of all elements in the array is even. This is because each operation reduces the sum of the array by exactly 4 (since \(1 + 2 + 1 = 4\)). If the sum of the array is odd, it is impossible to make all elements zero. Additionally, we need to ensure that no element in the array is greater than the sum of the remaining elements after applying the operation, which is inherently satisfied by the nature of the operation.

Here's the corrected logic:
1. Calculate the sum of the array.
2. Check if the sum is even.
3. If the sum is even, check if there exists any element that cannot be reduced to zero by the operations (which would imply the array cannot be made entirely zero).

However, the provided code does not perform these necessary checks. It only checks the parity of the first and last elements, which is not sufficient.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
