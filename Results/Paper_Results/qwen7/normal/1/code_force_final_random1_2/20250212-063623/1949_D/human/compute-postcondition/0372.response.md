Postcondition: `nx` is either 'S' or 'F', `j` is either `n + 2` or `n + 1`. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', then `nx` is increased by `xx[i][j - 1]`, `j` is `n + 1`. If `i` is in the first quarter of `sb` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`, then `nx` is 'S' and `j` is `n + 2`. Otherwise, `nx` is 'F' and `j` is `n + 1`.
