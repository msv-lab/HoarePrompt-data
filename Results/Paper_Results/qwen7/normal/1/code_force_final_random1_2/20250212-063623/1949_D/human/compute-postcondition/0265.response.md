Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers where each `a[i]` (for `1 ≤ i ≤ n+1`) represents the total number of times the character `'F'` appeared at position `i-1` across all inputs, and `b` is a list of integers where each `b[i]` (for `1 ≤ i ≤ n+1`) represents the total number of times the character `'S'` appeared at position `i-1` across all inputs, `sa` will include all positions where `'F'` appeared without any preceding `'S'`, and `sb` will contain the number `1`, but the length of `sa` will be less than the length of `sb`. The current value of `a[i]` is 0 and the current value of `b[i]` is 0.**
