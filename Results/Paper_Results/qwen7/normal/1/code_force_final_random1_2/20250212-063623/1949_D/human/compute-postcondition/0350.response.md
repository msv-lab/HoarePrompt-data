Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for j in range(1, n + 1):`. The variables involved in this loop head are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `j` is initialized to `n`.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`. Initially, `j` is set to `n`, so the loop will run exactly once if `n` is greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the required states**: Since the loop depends on the values of `j` and `n`, we need to ensure that these values are correct for the loop to execute. Specifically:
   - `j` should be initialized to `n`.
   - `n` must be greater than 0 to ensure the loop runs at least once.

Given the initial state:
- `j` is equal to `n`.
- `nx` is an empty string (not relevant to the loop).
- `i` is `n` (not relevant to the loop).
- `n` must be greater than 0.

We need to ensure that `j` is initialized to `n` and `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:
State: **`j` is equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than 0**
