Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` will be `n+1`, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers where each `a[i]` (for `1 ≤ i ≤ n+1`) represents the total number of times the character `'F'` appeared at position `i-1` across all inputs, and `b` is a list of integers where each `b[i]` (for `1 ≤ i ≤ n+1`) represents the total number of times the character `'S'` appeared at position `i-1` across all inputs. `sa` will include all positions where `'F'` appeared without any preceding `'S'`, and `sb` will contain the number `1`, but the length of `sa` will be less than the length of `sb`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    if a[i] == 0 and b[i] == 0:
        sb.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers where each `a[i]` (for `1 ≤ i ≤ n+1`) represents the total number of times the character `'F'` appeared at position `i-1` across all inputs, and `b` is a list of integers where each `b[i]` (for `1 ≤ i ≤ n+1`) represents the total number of times the character `'S'` appeared at position `i-1` across all inputs, `sa` will include all positions where `'F'` appeared without any preceding `'S'`, and `sb` will contain the number `1` appended with the value of `i` if `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`. If the condition `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0` is not met, `sa` and `sb` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers where each `a[i]` (for `1 ≤ i ≤ n+1`) represents the total number of times the character `'F'` appeared at position `i-1` across all inputs, and `b` is a list of integers where each `b[i]` (for `1 ≤ i ≤ n+1`) represents the total number of times the character `'S'` appeared at position `i-1` across all inputs, `sa` will include all positions where `'F'` appeared without any preceding `'S'`, and `sb` will contain the number `1` appended with the value of `i` if `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`. If `a[i]` is not equal to 0 or `b[i]` is not equal to 0, `sa` and `sb` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `sa` will include all positions where `'F'` appeared without any preceding `'S'`, and `sb` contains the number `1` appended with the value of `i` if `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`. If `a[i]` is not equal to 0 or `b[i] == 0`, `sb` remains unchanged. Since the `if` condition is met (`a[i] == 0 and b[i] == 0`), `sb` now includes the value `3`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
