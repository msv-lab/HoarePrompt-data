Output State: **`xx` contains the list `[x]`, all other variables and their states remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `xx.append(x)` appends the value of `x` to the list `xx`. This means that `xx` now contains a single element, which is the value of `x`. No other variables are affected by this operation, so their states remain as they were initially.
