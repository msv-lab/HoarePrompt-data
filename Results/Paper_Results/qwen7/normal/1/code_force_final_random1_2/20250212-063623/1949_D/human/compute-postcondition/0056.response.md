Output State: **`j` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, an error occurs because `i` is not defined**.

The code `b[i] += 1` tries to increment the value at index `i` of the list `b` by 1. However, since `i` is not defined in the given initial state, this will result in an error (specifically, a NameError). The values of `j` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
