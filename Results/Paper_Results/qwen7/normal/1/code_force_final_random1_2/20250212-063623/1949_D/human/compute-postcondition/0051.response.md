Postcondition: `j` is 1, `n` is a positive integer. If the element at index `j-1` (which is `x[0]`) in the list `x` is 'F', then the value of `a[j]` is incremented by 1 and the value of `a[i]` is also incremented by 1. If the element at index `j-1` in the list `x` is not 'F', and specifically is 'S', then `b[j]` is incremented by 1.
