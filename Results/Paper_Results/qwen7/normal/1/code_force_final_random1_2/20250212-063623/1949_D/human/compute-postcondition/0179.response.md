Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop is defined as follows:
   ```python
   for j in range(1, n + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```
   The loop variable here is `j`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is a positive integer
   - `nx` is either 'FF' or 'FSS'
   - `j` is 2

3. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = n`.
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must be less than `n + 1`.

4. **Update the state**:
   - Since `j` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented to 3.
   - `n` remains the same because it is not modified within the loop.
   - `i` and `nx` are not part of the loop head, so they remain unchanged.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `nx` is either 'FF' or 'FSS', `j` is 3**
