Output State: `xx` is a list containing `n+1` strings, which are the inputs received in each iteration of the loop. The lists `a` and `b` are of length `n+1` and contain integers that represent the total counts of 'F' and 'S' respectively for each index `i` from 1 to `n` across all iterations. The variable `j` will be equal to `n + 1` after the loop completes.
