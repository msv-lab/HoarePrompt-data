State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be a positive integer, `nx` is an empty string, `j` is 1**

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop head contains the variables `j` and `n`.
2. The loop condition `range(1, n + 1)` means that the loop will start with `j` equal to 1 and continue as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`.
3. Since `j` starts at 1, we need to ensure that `j` is initially set to 1.
4. The value of `n` must be a positive integer for the loop to execute at least once.
5. The variable `nx` is not used in the loop head, so its current state (being an empty string) does not affect the loop's execution.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i`, `n`, and `j`. Specifically, `i` should remain 1, `n` must be a positive integer, and `j` should be initialized to 1.
