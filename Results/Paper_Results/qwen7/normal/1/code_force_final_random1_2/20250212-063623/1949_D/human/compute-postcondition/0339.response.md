Output State: **`j` is 3, `nx` is 'S', `n` is greater than 0**

The code `nx += 'S'` appends the string `'S'` to the variable `nx`. Since the initial state does not specify what `nx` is, it is assumed to be an empty string or non-existent before this line of code. After appending `'S'`, `nx` becomes `'S'`. The values of `j` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
