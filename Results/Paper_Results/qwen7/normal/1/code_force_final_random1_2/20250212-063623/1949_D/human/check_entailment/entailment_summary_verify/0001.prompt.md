You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are designing a new video game. It has n scenarios, which the player may
play in any order, but each scenario must be played exactly once. When a
player switches from a scenario to another scenario, the game shows a
specially crafted transition video to make it all feel part of one big story.
This video is specific to a pair of scenarios, but not to their order, in
other words, the video playing when switching from scenario a to scenario b is
the same as the video playing when switching from scenario b to scenario a .
Therefore, you need to create \frac{n(n-1)}{2} different transition videos,
one for each possible pair of different scenarios.

Each transition video can be either funny or scary. It is boring to see too
many funny videos or too many scary videos in a row. Therefore, your goal is
to create the videos in such a way that no matter in which order does the
player approach the scenarios, they will never see more than \lceil
\frac{3n}{4} \rceil transition videos of the same type in a row.

You have already come up with ideas for at most \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor of
the transition videos, and therefore already know if those will be funny or
scary. Now you need to choose funny or scary for all other transition videos
in such a way that the above requirement is satisfied.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 24 ) — the number of
scenarios in the game.

The next n lines describe the partial transition video plan. Each of those
lines contains n characters. The j -th character of the i -th line corresponds
to the transition video between the i -th and the j -th scenarios. It will be
F if the corresponding transition video will be funny, S if the corresponding
transition video will be scary, ? if the corresponding transition video is
still undecided, or . if i=j .

It is guaranteed that the i -th character of the j -th line and the j -th
character of the i -th line will be the same for all i and j . It is
guaranteed that at most \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor (n divided by 2, rounded
down) transition videos will already be decided, in other words, that at most
2\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor characters in the input will be F or S.

Output

Print n lines describing the full transition video plan in the same format as
the input. Each of those lines must contain n characters. The j -th character
of the i -th line must be F if the corresponding transition video is funny, S
if the corresponding transition video is scary, or . if i=j .

Each ? character from the input must be replaced with either F or S, and all
other characters from the input must remain unchanged. It must still hold that
the i -th character of the j -th line and the j -th character of the i -th
line are the same for all i and j .

For each permutation of the n scenarios, it must hold that the transition
videos corresponding to playing the scenarios in this order do not have more
than \lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil (3n divided by 4, rounded up) videos of the
same type consecutively.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them. It can be proven that for
all inputs satisfying the constraints of this problem a solution always
exists.

    SSSSFFSSSSF.
    
Note

In the first sample: We are allowed \lceil \frac{3\cdot 5}{4} \rceil=4
transition videos of the same type in a row, but for any permutation of the 5
scenarios the player will see only 4 transition videos in total, therefore we
can choose funny or scary freely. We must still respect the already chosen
types.

In the second sample: One of the 479001600 possible permutations of scenarios
is 1, 7, 4, 12, 9, 8, 2, 6, 10, 3, 11, 5. The player will get the following
sequence of transition videos for this permutation: SSSSSSSSSFS. Even though
this sequence has 10 scary transition videos in total, it has only 9 scary
transition videos in a row, which is the maximum allowed amount (\lceil
\frac{3\cdot 12}{4} \rceil=9 ).

- Function Summary: 
The function processes an input consisting of n lines, each containing n characters representing a partial transition video plan. These characters can be 'F' (funny), 'S' (scary), '?', or '.' (no transition video). The function updates two lists, `a` and `b`, to count the occurrences of 'F' and 'S' at each position across all inputs. It then determines two lists, `sa` and `sb`, based on these counts. Depending on the lengths of `sa` and `sb`, the function constructs and prints a new string for each line, replacing '?' with either 'F' or 'S' based on specific conditions. If `sa` is longer than or equal to `sb`, it prioritizes 'F'; otherwise, it prioritizes 'S'. Finally, the function outputs these constructed strings.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads an integer `n` and a matrix of strings representing the initial state of the transition videos.
   - It correctly initializes two arrays `a` and `b` to count the number of funny (`F`) and scary (`S`) transition videos for each scenario.
   - It iterates through the input to populate these arrays and store the original input in `xx`.

2. **Counting Initial Videos:**
   - The program correctly counts the number of `F` and `S` videos for each scenario.
   - It identifies scenarios where only one type of video is decided and stores them in `sa` and `sb`.

3. **Deciding Remaining Videos:**
   - If the number of scenarios with only `F` videos is greater than or equal to the number of scenarios with only `S` videos, it tries to fill the remaining `?` with `F`.
   - Otherwise, it tries to fill the remaining `?` with `S`.

4. **Generating Final Output:**
   - For each scenario, it constructs the final output string by checking the original input and deciding the value for `?` based on the logic applied.
   - It ensures that the resulting matrix respects the constraints and produces a valid solution.

### Analysis:

1. **Initial Parsing and Counting:**
   - The parsing and counting logic is correct and handles the input as specified.

2. **Decision Logic:**
   - The decision logic to fill `?` with `F` or `S` is sound. It ensures that the number of consecutive `F` or `S` videos does not exceed the allowed limit.
   - The logic of filling `F` or `S` based on the majority of `F` or `S` scenarios is correct.

3. **Output Generation:**
   - The output generation logic correctly fills the `?` values while respecting the constraints.
   - The logic ensures that the resulting matrix is valid and meets the requirements.

Given the analysis, the program appears to handle all aspects of the problem correctly and generates a valid solution.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to generate the transition video plan according to the problem statement.
