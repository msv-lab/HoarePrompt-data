Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `nx` is equal to `xx[i][0]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `nx` by adding the value of `xx[i][j-1]` to it. Given that `j` is 1, `xx[i][j-1]` is equivalent to `xx[i][0]`. Since `j` is 1, no change is made to `j`, and the condition that `n` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged.
