To determine what will be printed, let's break down the process step by step based on the initial state provided:

1. **Initial State Description**:
   - `nx` is an empty string initially.
   - `xx` is a 2D list where each row corresponds to a specific pattern based on the conditions described.
   - `sb` is a string that defines the quarters for the condition check.
   - The loop iterates over `j` from 1 to `n`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each `j` from 1 to `n`, the code checks `xx[i][j-1]`.
   - If `xx[i][j-1]` is not '?', `nx` appends this character.
   - If `xx[i][j-1]` is '?', `nx` appends 'S' if either `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb` (i.e., `sb[0:n//4]`), otherwise it appends 'F'.

3. **Conditions for Appending 'S' or 'F'**:
   - `i` and `j` are indices into the string `sb`.
   - The first quarter of `sb` is `sb[0:n//4]`.

Given the initial state, let's assume a concrete example to illustrate the process:

Suppose:
- `sb = "ABCD"` (so the first quarter is `A`)
- `xx = [["?", "?", "C", "?"], ["?", "D", "?", "?"]]`

Let's go through the loop iterations:

- **First Iteration (j=1)**:
  - `xx[i][0]` is '?', so we check if `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`.
  - `i` is 0 (not in the first quarter) and `j` is 1 (in the first quarter).
  - Therefore, `nx` becomes `'S'`.

- **Second Iteration (j=2)**:
  - `xx[i][1]` is '?', so we check if `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`.
  - `i` is 0 (not in the first quarter) and `j` is 2 (not in the first quarter).
  - Therefore, `nx` remains `'S'`.

- **Third Iteration (j=3)**:
  - `xx[i][2]` is 'C', so we append 'C'.
  - `nx` becomes `'SC'`.

- **Fourth Iteration (j=4)**:
  - `xx[i][3]` is '?', so we check if `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`.
  - `i` is 0 (not in the first quarter) and `j` is 4 (not in the first quarter).
  - Therefore, `nx` remains `'SC'`.

After the loop completes, `nx` is `'SC'`.

Output: **'SC'**
