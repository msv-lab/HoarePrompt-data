Postcondition: `j` is 2 if it was 1, otherwise 1, `n` is greater than 0, the element at index `i-1` in the list `xx[i]` is either 'S' or 'F', if `i` is in the first quarter of `sb` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`, then `nx` is 'S', otherwise `nx` is 'F'. If the element at index `i-1` in the list `xx[i]` is 'F', then `nx` becomes 'SF' when `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`, and 'FF' otherwise.
