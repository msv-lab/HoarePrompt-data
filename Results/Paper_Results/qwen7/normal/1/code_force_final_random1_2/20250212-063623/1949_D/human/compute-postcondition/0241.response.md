Postcondition: `i` is 3, `j` is 2, `nx` is either 'F' or 'S', and `n` must be at least 1. If `i` is in the range `sa[:n // 4]` or `j` is in the range `sa[:n // 4]`, then `nx` is 'F'. Otherwise, `nx` is 'S', and `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?'.

This postcondition summarizes the possible states of the variables after the execution of the if-else block, considering both the if and else parts.
