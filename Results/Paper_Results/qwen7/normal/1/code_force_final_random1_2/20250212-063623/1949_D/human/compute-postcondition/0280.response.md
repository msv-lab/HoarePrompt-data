Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variables `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `j` is initialized to 1.
   - `n` is a positive integer.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `j` is initialized to 1, it will start the loop.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `j` must be less than or equal to `n`. Given that `j` starts at 1, the loop will definitely execute if `n` is greater than or equal to 1 (since `n` is stated to be a positive integer, this condition is already met).

5. **List the necessary adjustments**:
   - `j` should be set to 1.
   - `n` should be a positive integer (which is already given).

Given these points, the necessary adjustments are:

State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `sa` is an empty list, `sb` is a list containing 1 appended with the value of `i`, `j` is 1**.

However, since we are only adjusting the states of the objects in the loop head, we focus on `j` and `n`.

Final State: **`j` is 1, `n` is a positive integer**.
