Output State: The loop will continue to execute until `j` reaches `n + 1`. After all iterations, `j` will be `n + 1`. For every 'F' in the string `x`, the corresponding index in array `a` will be incremented. For every 'S' in the string `x`, the corresponding index in both arrays `b` and `a` will be incremented. If a character in `x` is neither 'F' nor 'S', no changes will be made to `a` and `b`. The final state of `a` and `b` will depend on the occurrences of 'F' and 'S' in the string `x` respectively, up to index `n`.
