Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop variable in this case is `j`. The other relevant variables are `nx`, `i`, and `sb`.

2. **Understand the conditions inside the loop**:
   - If `xx[i][j - 1] != '?'`, then `nx` is increased by `xx[i][j - 1]` and `j` is set to `n + 1`.
   - If `i` is in the first quarter of `sb` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`, then `nx` is set to 'S' and `j` is set to `n + 2`.
   - Otherwise, `nx` is set to 'F' and `j` is set to `n + 1`.

3. **Determine the initial state at the start of the loop**:
   - `nx` is either 'S' or 'F'.
   - `j` is either `n + 2` or `n + 1`.

4. **Analyze the loop condition**:
   - The loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = n`.

5. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop starts with `j = 1` and increments `j` by 1 each iteration, the next value of `j` will be `2`.
   - We need to consider the possible changes to `nx` based on the conditions inside the loop.

Given the initial state:
- `nx` is either 'S' or 'F'.
- `j` is either `n + 2` or `n + 1`.

Let's analyze the possible scenarios for the next iteration:

### Scenario 1: `j` is `n + 1`
- If `j` is `n + 1`, it means the loop has just started or the previous value of `j` was `n + 1`.
- The next value of `j` will be `2`.

### Scenario 2: `j` is `n + 2`
- If `j` is `n + 2`, it means the loop has just started or the previous value of `j` was `n + 2`.
- The next value of `j` will be `3`.

Since the loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = n`, the next value of `j` will be `2` if it was `n + 1` in the previous iteration, and `3` if it was `n + 2` in the previous iteration.

### Conclusion:
- `nx` remains unchanged unless the conditions inside the loop change it.
- `j` will be `2` if it was `n + 1` in the previous iteration, and `3` if it was `n + 2` in the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`nx` is either 'S' or 'F', `j` is 2** (if the previous `j` was `n + 1`) or **`j` is 3** (if the previous `j` was `n + 2`).
