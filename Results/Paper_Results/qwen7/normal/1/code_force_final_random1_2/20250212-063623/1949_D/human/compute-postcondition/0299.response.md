Postcondition: `j` is 2 or 3, `n` is a positive integer, and `nx` is determined as follows:
- If `i` is in the range `sb[0:n//4]` or `j` is in the range `sb[0:n//4]`, then `nx` is 'SS' if `xx[i][j-1]` is not '?', and 'S' if `xx[i][j-1]` is '?'.
- Otherwise, if `i` is not in the range `sb[0:n//4]` and `j` is not in the range `sb[0:n//4]`, then `nx` is 'FF'.
