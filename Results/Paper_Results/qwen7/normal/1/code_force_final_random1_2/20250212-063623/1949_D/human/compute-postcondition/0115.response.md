Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers where the current value of `a[i]` is greater than 0, `b` is a list of integers where the current value of `b[i]` is 0, `sa` is a list containing the integer 1. If `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, then the condition is met and no changes are made to the lists. If the condition is not met, the lists remain unchanged.
