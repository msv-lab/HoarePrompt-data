### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the integer \( n \) and initializes two arrays `a` and `b` to count the occurrences of 'F' and 'S' respectively.
   - It also initializes an empty list `xx` to store the input strings.

2. **Counting 'F' and 'S':**
   - For each input string, the program counts the occurrences of 'F' and 'S' and updates the `a` and `b` arrays accordingly.
   - This ensures that `a[i]` and `b[i]` represent the total number of times 'F' and 'S' appear at position `i-1` across all inputs.

3. **Identifying Positions with Only 'F' or 'S':**
   - The program identifies positions where only 'F' or 'S' appears and stores these positions in `sa` and `sb` respectively.
   - If the number of positions with only 'F' is greater than or equal to the number of positions with only 'S', it appends additional positions to `sa` until the lengths of `sa` and `sb` are balanced.

4. **Constructing the Final Transition Video Plan:**
   - The program constructs the final transition video plan by iterating over the input strings and filling in '?' with either 'F' or 'S' based on the conditions:
     - If the current position is in `sa[:n//4]` or `sb[:n//4]`, it fills '?' with 'F'.
     - Otherwise, it fills '?' with 'S'.

### Analysis:

1. **Correctness of Counting and Identification:**
   - The counting and identification steps are correct and ensure that `a` and `b` accurately represent the total occurrences of 'F' and 'S' at each position.

2. **Balancing `sa` and `sb`:**
   - The logic to balance `sa` and `sb` ensures that the number of positions with only 'F' is at least as large as the number of positions with only 'S'. This is crucial for ensuring that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transition videos of the same type can occur for any permutation of scenarios.

3. **Constructing the Final Plan:**
   - The construction logic ensures that '?' is filled with 'F' or 'S' in a way that satisfies the requirement of no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transition videos of the same type. By placing 'F' or 'S' in `sa[:n//4]` or `sb[:n//4]`, the program ensures that the maximum consecutive count is respected.

Given the detailed analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to construct the final transition video plan while respecting the constraints.

### Conclusion:

**Correctness: True**

The given program is correct based on the problem description and the provided execution states.
