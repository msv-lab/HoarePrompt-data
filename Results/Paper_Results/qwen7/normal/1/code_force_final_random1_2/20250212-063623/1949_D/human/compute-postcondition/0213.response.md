Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `nx` is either 'FF' or 'FS' or 'SF', `n` must be at least 1, `j` is `n + 1`, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?'. Depending on whether `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of the list `sa`, `nx` is 'FF' or 'FS'.**

This postcondition summarizes that regardless of the condition in the if statement, `i` remains 2, `nx` can be 'FF', 'FS', or 'SF', `n` is at least 1, `j` is `n + 1`, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?'. Additionally, the value of `nx` depends on whether `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of the list `sa`, which can result in `nx` being either 'FF' or 'FS'.
