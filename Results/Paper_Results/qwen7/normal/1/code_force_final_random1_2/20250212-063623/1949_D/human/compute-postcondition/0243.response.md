Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `j` and `n`.
   - `j` starts from 1 and goes up to `n + 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged within the loop.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 3.
   - `j` is 2.
   - `nx` is either 'F' or 'S'.
   - `n` must be at least 1.
   - If `i` is in the range `sa[:n // 4]` or `j` is in the range `sa[:n // 4]`, then `nx` is 'F'. Otherwise, `nx` is 'S', and `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?'.

3. **Determine the Next Value of `j`**:
   - Since `j` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `j` will be `2 + 1 = 3`.

4. **Check the Condition for the Next Iteration**:
   - We need to ensure that `j` is still within the range `[1, n + 1)`.
   - Given that `j` is now 3, the condition `1 <= j < n + 1` must hold true.
   - This means `n` must be at least 2 (since `j` is 3).

5. **Update the State**:
   - `i` remains 3.
   - `j` becomes 3.
   - `nx` can be either 'F' or 'S' based on the conditions given.
   - `n` must be at least 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is 3, `j` is 3, `nx` is either 'F' or 'S', and `n` must be at least 2**.
