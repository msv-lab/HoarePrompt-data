Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variables `j` and `n`.
2. **Determine the initial values of these variables**:
   - The variable `j` is initialized to `n` outside the loop.
   - The variable `n` is a positive integer.
3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `j` in the range from 1 to `n + 1`.

Given this information, let's analyze the necessary adjustments:

- **Variable `j`**: Initially, `j` is set to `n`. For the loop to start, `j` must be within the range `[1, n + 1)`. Since `j` is set to `n`, it should be checked if `n` is within the valid range for the loop to start.
- **Variable `n`**: It is given that `n` is a positive integer. This means `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the loop can start. Specifically, `n` must be at least 1, and `j` (which is initially set to `n`) should be within the range `[1, n + 1)`.

State: **`i` is 2, `nx` is an empty string, `n` must be at least 1, `j` is `n`**
