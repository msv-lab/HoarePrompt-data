Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(1, n + 1):`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is currently 1.
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `nx` is a string composed of 'F' and 'S' characters.
   - `j` is equal to `n`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 2.
   - Therefore, `i` will become 2.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop head.

5. **Adjust other variables**:
   - `nx` and `j` are not part of the loop head, so their values remain the same.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, `nx` is a string composed of 'F' and 'S' characters, `j` is `n`**
