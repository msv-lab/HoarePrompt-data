Output State: **`i` is 2, `nx` is the string `xx[2][j - 1]`, `n` must be at least 1, `j` is `n`, and the current value of `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?'**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `xx[i][j - 1]` to the string `nx`. Given the initial conditions, `i` is 2, so `xx[2][j - 1]` is appended to `nx`. The other variables remain unchanged.
