Output State: **`nx` is equal to `xx[3][1]`, `i` is 3, `j` is 2, and the current value of `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?'**

Explanation: The code snippet `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` appends the value of `xx[i][j - 1]` to the end of the string `nx`. Given the initial state, `i` is 3, `j` is 2, and the value of `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?'. Therefore, `nx` will now contain the value of `xx[3][1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
