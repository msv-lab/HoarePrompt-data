Output State: **`nx` is 'F', `j` is equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, and `(xx[i][j - 1] != '?')`, and neither `i` nor `j` is in the first quarter of the list `sb`.**

Explanation: The code appends the character 'F' to the string `nx`. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged from the initial state.
