Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `sa` is an empty list, `sb` is a list containing 1 appended with the value of `i`.**

Explanation: The line `nx = ''` initializes an empty string variable `nx`. However, since `nx` was not previously defined in the initial state, its value does not affect the existing variables `i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `sa`, and `sb`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial values, and `nx` is introduced as a new variable with an empty string value. Since `i` is 1, appending 1 to `i` results in a list containing the value 1.
