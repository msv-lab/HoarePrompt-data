Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Transition Videos**:
   - The code attempts to count the number of 'F' and 'S' transitions for each scenario, but this information alone is not sufficient to ensure that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type will be shown for any permutation of scenarios.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Assigning Types**:
   - The logic for assigning 'F' or 'S' to undecided transitions (`?`) is flawed. The code tries to assign 'F' or 'S' based on whether the scenario index is in the first quarter of `sa` or `sb`, which does not guarantee the required constraint.

3. **Handling Undecided Transitions**:
   - The code should consider all permutations of scenarios and ensure that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type are shown. This cannot be achieved simply by assigning types based on the index.

4. **Output Format**:
   - The output format should match the input format, with `.` representing no transition video, and `F` or `S` representing the type of transition video.

To correctly solve this problem, you would need to use a more sophisticated approach, possibly involving graph theory or dynamic programming to ensure the constraint is met for all permutations of scenarios. The provided code does not address these requirements adequately.
