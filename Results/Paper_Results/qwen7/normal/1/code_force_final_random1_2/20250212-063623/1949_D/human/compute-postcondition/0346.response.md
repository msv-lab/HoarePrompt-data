To determine what will be printed, let's break down the information provided:

1. **After the loop executes all iterations, `j` will be equal to `n`:**
   - This means that `j` and `n` have the same value after the loop completes.

2. **`nx` will be a string constructed based on the conditions inside the loop:**
   - Since no specific conditions or loop details are provided, we cannot determine the exact content of `nx`. However, we know that `nx` is a string constructed during the loop.

3. **`n` will be greater than 0:**
   - This tells us that `n` is a positive integer.

Given these points, we can conclude that `nx` is a string that was built within the loop, and it does not depend on the value of `n` or `j` directly in the provided information.

Therefore, the output of the `print(nx)` statement will simply be the string `nx`.

Output: **nx**
