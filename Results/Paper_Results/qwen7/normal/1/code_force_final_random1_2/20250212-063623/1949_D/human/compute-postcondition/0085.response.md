Postcondition: `x` is a list of strings, `j` is an index within the list `x`, and `a` and `b` are lists of integers. If the character at index `j-1` in `x` is 'F', then `a[i]` is increased by 1 and `a[j]` is increased by 1. If the character at index `j-1` in `x` is 'S', then `b[j]` is incremented by 1.
