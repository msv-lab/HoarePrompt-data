Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 2.
- `nx` is constructed by appending 'F' or 'S' based on certain conditions during a loop from 1 to `n`.
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `j` is `n + 1`.
- `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?' for all iterations.

The key point here is that `nx` is built by appending 'F' or 'S' depending on whether `i` or `j` (which is `n + 1`) is in the first quarter of the list `sa` or if `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?'. Since `i` is 2 and `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', the condition for appending 'F' or 'S' will be determined by the position of `i` and `j` relative to the first quarter of `sa`.

Given that `i` is 2, it is not in the first quarter of any list unless the list `sa` is very short. However, since `j` is `n + 1`, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', the condition for appending 'F' or 'S' will always be met for the given `i`.

Therefore, `nx` will be constructed with 'F' or 'S' based on the conditions, but without the exact list `sa`, we cannot determine the exact sequence of 'F' or 'S'. However, we know that `nx` will be constructed with these characters.

Output: **nx (where nx is a string constructed by appending 'F' or 'S' based on the conditions described, with i being 2 and xx[i][j - 1] not being '?')**
