Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `i` is 2
   - `nx` is a string constructed by appending either 'F' or 'S' based on conditions inside the loop
   - `n` must be a positive integer
   - `j` is `n + 1`
   - `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?' for all iterations

2. **Loop Head**:
   - The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `n + 1`.

3. **Current Iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will become 3.

5. **Other Variables**:
   - `nx` is constructed based on the conditions inside the loop, but since we are only adjusting the state at the start of the next iteration, we don't need to change `nx` yet.
   - `n` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `j` is `n + 1`, so it remains unchanged.
   - `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', so this condition still holds true.

6. **Updated State**:
   - `i` will be 3.
   - `nx` remains the same as it is constructed during the loop execution.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `j` remains the same.
   - `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?'.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is 3, `nx` is a string constructed by appending either 'F' or 'S' based on conditions inside the loop, `n` must be a positive integer, `j` is `n + 1`, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?'**.
