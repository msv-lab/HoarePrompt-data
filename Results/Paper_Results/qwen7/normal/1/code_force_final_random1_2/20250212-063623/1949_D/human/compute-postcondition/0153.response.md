Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` should start from 1 and go up to `n+1`.
   - `n` is a positive integer.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `n+1`.

4. **Initial values before the loop**:
   - `i` is not yet set to its starting value.
   - `n` is a positive integer, but its exact value is not specified.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since the loop starts with `i = 1`, we need to set `i` to 1.
   - `n` must be a positive integer, so we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer**
