Output State: **`sa` is an empty list, `xx` is a list containing `n+1` strings, each being the input received at each iteration of the loop, the lists `a` and `b` are updated such that for each index `i` from `1` to `n+1`, `a[i]` represents the total number of times the character `'F'` appeared at position `i-1` across all inputs, and `b[i]` represents the total number of times the character `'S'` appeared at position `i-1` across all inputs.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list `sa`. The initial state of `xx`, `a`, and `b` remains unchanged. Therefore, `sa` is now an empty list, while `xx` still contains the list of all inputs provided during the loop's execution, and the lists `a` and `b` are updated according to the given conditions.
