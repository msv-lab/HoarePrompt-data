Output State: **`n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, and the input consists of n lines, each containing n characters representing the partial transition video plan. The characters can be F (funny), S (scary), ?, or . (no transition video). At most \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor transition videos are already decided (i.e., at most 2\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor characters are F or S); `n` is now set to the integer input received.**

The code `n = int(input())` takes an integer input within the specified range (2 ≤ n ≤ 24) and assigns it to the variable `n`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
