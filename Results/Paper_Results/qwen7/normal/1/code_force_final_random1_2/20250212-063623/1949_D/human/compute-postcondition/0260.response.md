To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**: The final value of `nx` will be a string constructed based on the conditions within the loop.
2. **Code Snippet**: 
   ```python
   print(nx)
   ```

Given the initial state, `nx` is described as a string constructed based on conditions within a loop. Since no specific loop or conditions are provided in the initial state, we need to consider the general behavior of such a scenario.

- If `nx` is a string that is constructed during a loop, it could be any string depending on the logic inside the loop.
- Without specific details about the loop, we cannot determine the exact content of `nx`.

However, since the problem states that `nx` is a string constructed based on conditions within the loop, we can infer that `nx` will be a string.

Therefore, the output will be a string, but without more specific details about the construction of `nx`, we cannot provide the exact string.

Output: **nx (where nx is a string constructed based on conditions within the loop)**
