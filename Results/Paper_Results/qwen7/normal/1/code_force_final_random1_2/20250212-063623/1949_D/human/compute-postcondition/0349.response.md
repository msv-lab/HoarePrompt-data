Output State: **`j` is equal to `n`, `nx` is an empty string, `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0**

Explanation: The code `nx = ''` assigns an empty string to the variable `nx`. This operation does not affect the values of `j`, `i`, or `n`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
