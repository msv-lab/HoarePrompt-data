Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 1.
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `nx` is a string composed of 'F' and 'S' characters.
- `j` is `n`.

The `print(nx)` statement will print the string `nx`.

Since the exact content of `nx` is not specified other than it being composed of 'F' and 'S' characters, we cannot provide a more precise description.

Output: **nx (where nx is a string composed of 'F' and 'S' characters)**
