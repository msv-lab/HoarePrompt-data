Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `nx` is either 'FF' + 'xx'[2][j - 1]', 'FS' + 'xx'[2][j - 1]', 'SF' + 'xx'[2][j - 1]', 'FFF', 'FSF', 'SFF', 'FFS', 'FSS', or 'SFS', `n` must be at least 1, `j` is `n`, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?'**.

This means that after the if-else block executes, `i` remains 2, `nx` can take on several specific forms depending on the value of `xx[2][j - 1]` in the if part or the default values in the else part, `n` remains at least 1, `j` equals `n`, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?'.
