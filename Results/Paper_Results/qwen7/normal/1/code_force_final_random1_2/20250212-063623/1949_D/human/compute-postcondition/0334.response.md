Postcondition: `j` is 2 if it was 1, otherwise 1, `n` is greater than 0, the element at index `i-1` in the list `xx[i]` is either 'S' or 'F', and `nx` is determined as follows:
- If `i` is in the first quarter of `sb` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is 'S', then `nx` is 'S'.
- If `i` is in the first quarter of `sb` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is 'F', then `nx` is 'F'.
- If `i` is in the first quarter of `sb` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is 'F', then `nx` becomes 'SF'.
- Otherwise, `nx` is 'F' if `xx[i][j - 1]` is 'F', and remains 'S' if `xx[i][j - 1]` is 'S'. Additionally, if `xx[i][j - 1]` is 'F', then `nx` becomes 'FF' when neither `i` nor `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`.
