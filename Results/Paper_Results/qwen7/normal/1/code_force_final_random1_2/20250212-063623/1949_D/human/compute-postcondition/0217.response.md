Output State: **`i` is 2, `nx` is either 'FFS', 'FSS', or 'SFS', `n` must be at least 1, `j` is `n`, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?'**

Explanation: The code `nx += 'S'` appends 'S' to the end of the string stored in `nx`. Since `nx` could initially be 'FF', 'FS', or 'SF', appending 'S' results in 'FFS', 'FSS', or 'SFS'. All other variables remain unchanged.
