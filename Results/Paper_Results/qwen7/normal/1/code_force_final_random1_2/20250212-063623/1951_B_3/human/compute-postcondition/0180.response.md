Output State: **`j` is -1, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `i` is now the first element of the list `s`, `z` is 1 if `s[0]` is not equal to `h`, `ans1` is incremented each time `z` is 1 and `i` is not equal to `h`, `s` is updated such that the first and the k-1th elements are swapped, `ans` is 0, `h` is the first element of the list `s` before the swap.**

The code `j = -1` simply assigns the value `-1` to the variable `j`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `n`, `k`, `i`, `z`, `ans1`, `s`, `ans`, and `h` remain unchanged from their initial states.
