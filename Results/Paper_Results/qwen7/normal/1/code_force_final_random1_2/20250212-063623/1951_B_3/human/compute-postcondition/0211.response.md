Output State: **`i` is equal to `h`, `s[0]` is not equal to `h`, `ans1` is equal to `1`.**

Explanation: The variable `ans1` is incremented by 1. Since no specific initial value for `ans1` was given, we assume it starts at 0. After executing `ans1 += 1`, `ans1` becomes 1. The values of `i` and `s[0]` remain unchanged from their initial states.
