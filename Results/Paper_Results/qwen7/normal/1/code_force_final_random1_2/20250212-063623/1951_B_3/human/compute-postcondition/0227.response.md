Postcondition: `i` and `h` are integers. If `i` is equal to `h`, then `s[0]` is not equal to `h`, `ans1` is equal to `1`, and `z` is `1`. If `i` is not equal to `h`, then `i` is either greater than `h` in which case we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or `i` is less than or equal to `h` and if `z` is `1`, then `ans1` remains `1`.
