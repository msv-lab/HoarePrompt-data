Output State: **`j` is 0, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `i` is the first element of the list `s` after swapping the first and the `k-1`th elements, `z` is 1 if `s[0]` is not equal to `h`, `ans1` is incremented by 1 each time `z` is 1 and `i` is not equal to `h`, `s` is updated such that the first and the `k-1`th elements are swapped, `ans` is 1, `h` is the first element of the list `s` before the swap, and `h` is greater than or equal to `i`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. Initially, `ans` was 0, so now `ans` is 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
