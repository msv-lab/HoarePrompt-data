Output State: **`ans` is 0, `ans1` is the total number of elements in the list `s` that are not equal to `h` and do not cause the loop to break when found to be greater than `h`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `h` is the first element of the list `s`, the first and the last elements of the list `s` have been swapped, `j` is -1.**

The variable `j` is assigned the value `-1`. The values of the other variables (`ans`, `ans1`, `n`, `k`, `h`, and the list `s`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
