Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is the length of the list `a`, `x` is an integer, `c` is 3, and `ind` is a list containing the value 1.**

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to the last index checked, which is 2 (since the loop increments `i` from 0 to `n-1`). The variable `c` will be 3 because it increments by 1 each time `a[i] > x` is true, and it reaches 2 on the third iteration, causing the loop to break. Therefore, `ind` will contain the index where `c` reached 2, which is 1. The other variables (`a`, `k`, `x`, `ind`, and `c`) will retain their final values as described.
