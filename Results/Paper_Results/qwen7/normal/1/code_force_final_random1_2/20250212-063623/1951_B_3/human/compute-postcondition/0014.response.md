Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `n` is the length of the list `a`
   - `x` is an integer (this variable is not in the loop head)
   - `c` is 2 (this variable is not in the loop head)
   - `ind` remains unchanged because `c` equals 2 (this variable is not in the loop head)

3. **Determine the Conditions for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `i` is currently 0 and `n` is the length of the list `a`, the loop will execute again if `n > 0`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will become 1.
   - `n` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.

5. **Final States for the Start of the Next Iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is the length of the list `a`
   - `x` is an integer (unchanged)
   - `c` is 2 (unchanged)
   - `ind` remains unchanged (unchanged)

Therefore, the updated states for the start of the next iteration are:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` is the length of the list `a`, `x` is an integer, `c` is 2, and `ind` remains unchanged**
