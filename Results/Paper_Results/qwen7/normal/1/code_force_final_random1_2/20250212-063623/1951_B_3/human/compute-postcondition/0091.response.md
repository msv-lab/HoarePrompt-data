Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the list slice `s[1:]`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: Since the loop starts iterating from the second element of the list `s`, the initial value of `i` should be the second element of the list `s`.

3. **Determine the initial state of the list `s[1:]`**: The list `s` has its first and last elements swapped. Therefore, `s[1:]` will start from the second element (which was originally the last element) and go up to the second-to-last element.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `i` should be initialized to the second element of the list `s`.
   - The list `s[1:]` should reflect the state where the first and last elements of the original list `s` have been swapped.

Given these points, we can formulate the required state adjustments as follows:

State: **`ans` is 0, `ans1` is the total number of elements in the list `s` that are not equal to `h` and do not cause the loop to break when found to be greater than `h`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `h` is the first element of the list `s`, the first and the last elements of the list `s` have been swapped, `j` is -1, `i` is the second element of the list `s`, `s[1:]` is the list starting from the second element of the list `s` with the first and last elements swapped.**

However, since we only need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, we focus on `i` and `s[1:]`.

State: **`i` is the second element of the list `s`, `s[1:]` is the list starting from the second element of the list `s` with the first and last elements swapped.**
