Output State: **`i` is the second element of the list `s`, `s` is a list, and `z` is 1; `ans1` is 1.**

Explanation: The variable `ans1` is incremented by 1, starting from an unspecified initial value (which could be 0 or any other value). Since no initial value for `ans1` is given, we assume it was 0 before this line of code was executed. After executing `ans1 += 1`, `ans1` becomes 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
