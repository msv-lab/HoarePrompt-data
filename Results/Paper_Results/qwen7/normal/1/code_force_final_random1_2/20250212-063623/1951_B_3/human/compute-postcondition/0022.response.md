Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is the length of the list `a`
   - `x` is an integer (not part of the loop head)
   - `c` is 3
   - `ind` is a list containing the value 1 (not part of the loop head)
   - Break condition: If `c` equals 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement (not part of the loop head)

3. **Adjust the states of the loop head variables**:
   - `i` is currently 1. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 2.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is determined by the length of the list `a` and does not change within the loop.

4. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` is now 2
   - `n` is still the length of the list `a`
   - `x`, `c`, and `ind` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` is the length of the list `a`**
