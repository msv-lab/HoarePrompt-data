Postcondition: `ans` is increased by `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`, `tmp` contains the value of `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2`, and `y` is greater than half the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` minus 2, provided that the sum of the first element of the list `a` and the variable `n` minus the last element of the list `a` is even and `y` is greater than half the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` minus 2. If these conditions are not met, the values of `ans` and `tmp` remain unchanged, and no additional operations are performed on `y`.
