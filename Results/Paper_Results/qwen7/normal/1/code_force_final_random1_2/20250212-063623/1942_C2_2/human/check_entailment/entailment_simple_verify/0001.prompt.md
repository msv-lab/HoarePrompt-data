You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version 0 \leq y \leq n - x . You
can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , 0 \leq y \leq n - x )
— the number of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen,
and the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 2
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    7 3 1
    
    6 4 3
    
    4 2 2
    
    1 3

Output

    5
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 6 , 5 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that Bessie chose, the yellow dots represent
vertices that you chose, the blue lines represent diagonals that are drawn,
and the red numbers represent triangles that are counted.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Problem Analysis
The problem involves maximizing the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake by choosing additional vertices from a polygon with \( n \) sides. Given \( x \) vertices already chosen by Bessie and \( y \) additional vertices you can choose, the goal is to maximize the number of triangles formed.

### Program Analysis
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `tt`.
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \), \( x \), and \( y \).
   - It then reads \( x \) vertices chosen by Bessie and sorts them.

2. **Initial Calculation**:
   - The initial number of triangles is calculated as \( x + y - 2 \). This is because any set of 3 vertices forms a triangle, and we start with \( x \) vertices.
   
3. **Processing Gaps Between Chosen Vertices**:
   - The program iterates through the sorted list of chosen vertices to find gaps of even length (since even gaps can be split into triangles).
   - For each gap of length \( g \) (where \( g \) is even), it adds \( g // 2 \) triangles to the count and reduces \( y \) by \( g // 2 - 1 \).

4. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The program checks the gap between the first and last chosen vertices, considering the wrap-around nature of the polygon.
   - If this gap is even, it similarly adds triangles and reduces \( y \).

5. **Final Adjustment**:
   - The final number of triangles is adjusted by adding the remaining \( y \) vertices.
   - The result is capped at \( n - 2 \) to ensure it does not exceed the total number of possible triangles in a polygon with \( n \) sides.

### Correctness Verification
1. **Initial Calculation**:
   - The initial calculation \( x + y - 2 \) is correct as it accounts for the minimum number of triangles formed by the initial set of vertices.

2. **Gap Processing**:
   - The logic for processing gaps of even length is sound. Each even gap of length \( g \) can be split into \( g // 2 \) triangles, and the reduction of \( y \) ensures that only feasible splits are considered.

3. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - The edge case handling for the gap between the first and last chosen vertices is correctly implemented, ensuring that the wrap-around nature of the polygon is considered.

4. **Final Adjustment**:
   - Adding the remaining \( y \) vertices and capping the result at \( n - 2 \) is a valid approach to ensure the result does not exceed the maximum possible number of triangles.

Given the analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
