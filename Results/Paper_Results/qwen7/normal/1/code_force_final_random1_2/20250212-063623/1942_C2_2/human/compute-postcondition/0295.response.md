Postcondition: `x` must be greater than 0, `i` is `x - 2`, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `gap` is `next_elem - a[i] - 1`, `odd` list has an additional element which is the value of `gap` if `gap` is greater than 1 and odd, `even` list has an additional element which is the value of `gap` if `gap` is greater than 0 and even. If `gap` is greater than 1 and odd, `odd` list includes the value of `gap`; otherwise, `even` list includes the value of `gap` if `gap` is greater than 0 and even, and `odd` list remains unchanged.
