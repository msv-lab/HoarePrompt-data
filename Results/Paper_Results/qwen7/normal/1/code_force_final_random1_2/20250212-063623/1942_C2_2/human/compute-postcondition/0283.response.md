Output State: **`x` must be greater than 0; `i` is `i + 1`; `next_elem` is `a[0] + n` if `i` equals `x - 1`, otherwise `next_elem` is `a[i + 1]`; `gap` is `next_elem - a[i] - 1`; `even` list has appended the value of `gap`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `gap` to the list `even`. The values of `x`, `i`, `next_elem`, and `gap` remain unchanged from their previous states. The only new information is that `even` now contains the value of `gap`.
