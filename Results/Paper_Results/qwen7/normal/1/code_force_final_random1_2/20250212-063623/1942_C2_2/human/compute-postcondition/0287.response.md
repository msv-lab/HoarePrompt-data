Postcondition: **`x` must be greater than 0; `i` is `i + 1`; `next_elem` is `a[0] + n` if `i` equals `x - 1`, otherwise `next_elem` is `a[i + 1]`; `gap` is `next_elem - a[i] - 1`; if `gap` is greater than 1 and odd, the `odd` list has an additional element which is the value of `gap`. If `gap` is greater than 0 and even, the `even` list has an additional element which is the value of `gap`.**
