Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `x` remains unchanged, `y` remains unchanged, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `ans` is `x + y - 2`, `tmp` collects all the valid values of `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` that meet the specified conditions during each iteration of the loop, `ii` is `len(a) + 1`.**

Explanation: The line `ans = x + y - 2` assigns the value of `x + y - 2` to the variable `ans`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
