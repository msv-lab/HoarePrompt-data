Postcondition: `ans` is increased by either 1 or `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, depending on whether `a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2`. If the condition is true, `ans` is increased by 1. If the condition is false, `ans` is increased by `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1` and `tmp` contains an additional element which is `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`. Both `a` and `i` retain their original values.
