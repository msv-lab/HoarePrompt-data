Output State: **`x` must be greater than 0, `i` is `x - 2`, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `gap` is `next_elem - a[i] - 1`, `odd` list has an additional element which is the value of `gap` if `gap` is greater than 1 and odd, `even` list has an additional element which is the value of `gap` if `gap` is greater than 0 and even, `odd` list now includes the value of `gap`.**

Explanation: The code `odd.append(gap)` appends the value of `gap` to the `odd` list. The other variables (`x`, `i`, `next_elem`, `gap`, `even`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
