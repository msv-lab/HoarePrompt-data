Output State: **`tt` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq tt \leq 10^4\), `ii` is 0, `n` is the first number inputted, `x` is the second number inputted, `y` is the third number inputted.**

Explanation: The code `n, x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `x`, and `y` respectively. The initial value of `tt` remains unchanged, and the initial value of `ii` also remains unchanged.
