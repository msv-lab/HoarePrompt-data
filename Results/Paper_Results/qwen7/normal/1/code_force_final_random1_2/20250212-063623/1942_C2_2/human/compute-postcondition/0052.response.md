Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `x` remains unchanged, `y` remains unchanged, `a` is a list of integers converted from the input, `ans` remains unchanged, `tmp` collects all the valid values of `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` that meet the specified conditions during each iteration of the loop, `ii` is `len(a) + 1`.**

Explanation: The code converts the input (which is assumed to be space-separated integers) into a list of integers using `map(int, input().split())` and assigns it to the variable `a`. The lengths of the list `a` plus one is assigned to `ii`. The other variables (`n`, `x`, `y`, `ans`, and `tmp`) remain unchanged.
