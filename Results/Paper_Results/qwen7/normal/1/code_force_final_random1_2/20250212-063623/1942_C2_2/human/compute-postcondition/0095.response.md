Postcondition: `ans` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, and `x` is an integer. If `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` equals 2, then `ans` is equal to its original value plus 1. Otherwise, `ans` is increased by `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`, where `tmp` contains the value of `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2`, and `y` is greater than half the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` minus 2.
