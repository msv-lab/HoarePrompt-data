Output State: **`len(a)` is at least 2, `i` is 1, the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is not equal to 2, the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is even, and the current value of `y` is greater than the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` divided by 2 minus 1; `tmp` is a list containing the value `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`; `ans` is increased by `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` adds the value of `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` to `ans`. Given the precondition, the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is even, so `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` is an integer. The other conditions remain unchanged.
