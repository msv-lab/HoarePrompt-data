Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `x` remains unchanged, `y` remains unchanged, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `ans` is `x + y - 2`, `tmp` is an empty list, `ii` is `len(a) + 1`.**

The code initializes `tmp` as an empty list. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
