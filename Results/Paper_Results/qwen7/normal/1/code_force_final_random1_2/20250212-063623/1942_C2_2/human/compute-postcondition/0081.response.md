Output State: **`tmp` contains an additional element which is `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`, `i` is either 3 or 4, `ans` is `ans` plus `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`, `y` is `y` minus `((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1)`**.

This means that the value of `y` has been updated by subtracting `((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1)`. The values of `tmp`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
