Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tt` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `tt` ≤ 10^4. The values of `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and the lists of integers are not yet defined.
Code of the loop:
for ii in range(tt):
    n, x, y = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort()
    ans = x + y - 2
    tmp = []
    for i in range(1, len(a)):
        if a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2:
            ans += 1
        elif (a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1:
            tmp.append((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2)
            ans += (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2
            y -= (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1
    if a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2:
        ans += 1
    elif (a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]
        ) // 2 - 1:
        tmp.append((a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2)
        ans += (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2
        y -= (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1
    ans += y
    print(min(ans, n - 2))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ii` is equal to `len(a)`, `n` remains unchanged, `x` remains unchanged unless `y` was reduced to zero, `y` is the remaining value after all possible reductions during the loop's iterations, `a` retains its sorted order but may have been altered by the loop's operations, `ans` is updated to be the initial value of `x + y - 2` plus the value of `y`, and `tmp` collects all the valid values of `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` that meet the specified conditions during each iteration of the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ans` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, and `x` is an integer. `ans` is increased by `y`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ans` is incremented by `y`, `tmp` contains the integer division of the differences by 2 for those pairs where the difference was even and `y` allowed it, `i` is equal to the length of list `a`, and `y` is decremented by `((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1)` if the condition is met.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
