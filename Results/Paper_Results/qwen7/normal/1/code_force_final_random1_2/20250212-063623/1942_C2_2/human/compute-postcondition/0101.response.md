Output State: **`ans` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input().split(), `x` is an input integer, `ii` is `tt`, `n` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `a`. The other variables (`ans`, `x`, `ii`, `n`, `y`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
