Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `x` remains unchanged, `y` remains unchanged, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `ans` remains unchanged, `tmp` collects all the valid values of `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` that meet the specified conditions during each iteration of the loop, `ii` is `len(a) + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. All other variables remain unchanged.
