Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `t` is equal to the first element of the tuple returned by the lambda function `R()`.
Code of the loop:
while t:
    t -= 1
    n, x, y = R()
    sx = 0
    l = list(R())
    l.sort()
    l.append(n + l[0])
    val = []
    for i in range(1, x + 1):
        c = l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1
        if c == 1:
            sx += 1
        val.append(c)
    val.sort(key=lambda x: (1 - x & 1, x))
    for i in val:
        c = i // 2
        if y < c:
            sx += y * 2
            break
        sx += i
        y -= c
    cons = x + sx - 2
    cons = min(n - 2, cons)
    print(cons)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `val` is an empty list, `c` is undefined, `sx` is 0, `y` is the initial value of `y` minus the sum of `i // 2` for each `i` in `val`, and `cons` is `min(n - 2, x + sx - 2)`
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: The loop has executed for all elements in `val`. The final value of `i` is the last element of `val`. The variable `c` is set to the last element of `val` divided by 2 plus 1. The variable `sx` is the sum of all elements in `val`. The variable `y` is reduced by twice the value of `c` from the last iteration. `cons` is calculated as `x + sx - 2`; `cons` is updated to be the minimum of `n - 2` and the current value of `cons`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is 0, `n` is `R()`, `x` is the final value after the loop completes, `y` is `R() - (i_final // 2) - c_final`, `sx` is `x + y * 2 + sum(i for i in val)`, `l` is a sorted list containing elements generated by `R()` with the additional element `n + l[0]` appended to it, and `c_final` is `i_final // 2`, `cons` is `min(n - 2, x + sx - 2)`


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
