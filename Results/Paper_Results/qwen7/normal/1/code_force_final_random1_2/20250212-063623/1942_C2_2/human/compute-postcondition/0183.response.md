Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input data consisting of multiple test cases. Each test case includes three integers n, x, and y, followed by x distinct integers from 1 to n. It returns a result for each test case based on the given conditions.**

- For each test case, the function reads three integers n, x, and y, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (t being the number of test cases), 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2⋅10^5), and 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x.
- It then reads x distinct integers from 1 to n.
- The function processes this input and returns a result for each test case, adhering to the specified constraints and relationships between the input parameters.
