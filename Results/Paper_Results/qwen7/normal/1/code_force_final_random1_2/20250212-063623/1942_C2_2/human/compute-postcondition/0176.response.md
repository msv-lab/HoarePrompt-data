Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is `R()`, `x` is the final value after the loop completes, `y` is `R() - (i_prev + 1) // 2 - c`, `sx` is `x + y * 2 + (i_prev + 1) + y * 2 + (i_prev + 1) + 1 + y * 2 + i`, `l` is a sorted list containing elements generated by `R()` with the additional element `n + l[0]` appended to it, `c` is `(i_prev + 1) // 2`, and `i` is `i_prev + 1`.**

Explanation: The line `y -= c` subtracts the value of `c` from `y`. Since `c` is defined as `(i_prev + 1) // 2`, the updated value of `y` is now `R() - ((i_prev + 1) // 2) - c`, which simplifies to `R() - (i_prev + 1) // 2 - c`. All other variables remain unchanged.
