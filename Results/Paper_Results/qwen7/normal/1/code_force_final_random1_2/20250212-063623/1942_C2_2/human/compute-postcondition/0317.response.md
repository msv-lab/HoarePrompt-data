Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop iterates over the variable `gap` which is taken from the list `odd`. Therefore, the only variables involved in the loop head are `gap` and `odd`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as there are elements left in the list `odd`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `odd` must have at least two elements.

3. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop continues based on the elements in `odd`, `odd` must have at least two elements for the loop to execute again.
   - `gap` will take the next element from `odd` in the next iteration.

Given these points, we need to adjust the states such that `odd` still has at least two elements, and `gap` is set to the next element from `odd`.

**State at the start of the next iteration**:
- `even` is sorted in ascending order (this state does not change within the loop).
- `odd` must have at least two elements (to ensure the loop can continue).
- `next_elem` retains its previous value based on the condition (this state does not change within the loop).
- `gap` is the next element from `odd` (it will be updated in the next iteration).
- `ans` is increased by the previous `gap` value (this state does not change within the loop).
- `y` is decreased by half of `gap` if `y` is not less than half of `gap` (this state does not change within the loop).

Therefore, the relevant states to adjust are `odd` and `gap`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`even` is sorted in ascending order, `odd` must have at least two elements, `next_elem` retains its previous value based on the condition, `gap` is the next element from `odd`, `ans` is increased by the previous `gap` value, and `y` is decreased by half of `gap` if `y` is not less than half of `gap`.**
