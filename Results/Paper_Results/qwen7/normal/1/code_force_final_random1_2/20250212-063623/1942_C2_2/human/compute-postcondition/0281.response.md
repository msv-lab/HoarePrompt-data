Output State: **`x` must be greater than 0; `i` is `i + 1`; `next_elem` is `a[0] + n` if `i` equals `x - 1`, otherwise `next_elem` is `a[i + 1]`; `gap` is `next_elem - a[i] - 1`.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `gap` by calculating `next_elem - a[i] - 1`. However, the values of `next_elem` and `a[i]` depend on the value of `i` relative to `x`. Since the exact values of `x`, `i`, `a`, and `n` are not specified, we keep the expressions for `next_elem` and `gap` as they are. The conditions for `next_elem` remain unchanged, and `i` is incremented by 1.
