Postcondition: `ans` is `x - 2`, `y` is an input integer, `t` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted set of integers where each element is one less than its original value in the list, `i` is 2, `t2` is `(a[0] + 2) % n`, and `t1` is not in `st` while `t2` is in `st`.
