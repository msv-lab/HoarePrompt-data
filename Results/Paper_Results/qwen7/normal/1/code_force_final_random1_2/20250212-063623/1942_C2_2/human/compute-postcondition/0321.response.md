Postcondition: `even` is sorted in ascending order, `odd` must have at least two elements, `next_elem` retains its previous value based on the condition, `gap` is the next element from `odd`, `ans` is increased by the previous value of `gap`, and `y` is decreased by half of the previous value of `gap` if `y` is not less than half of `gap`. If `y` is less than half of `gap`, `y` is set to 0 and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.
