Postcondition: `i` is 3, `a` must have at least 2 elements, the difference between `a[3]` and `a[2]` is either 2 or even, and `ans` is the previous value of `ans` minus 1 if the condition `a[3] - a[2] != 2` is true, otherwise `ans` remains 1. Additionally, if the condition is false, `tmp` is a list containing the value `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2`.
