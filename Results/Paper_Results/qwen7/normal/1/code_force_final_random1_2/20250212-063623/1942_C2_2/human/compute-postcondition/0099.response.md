Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head defines the variables that are being iterated over. In this case, the loop is iterating over `ii` in the range of `tt`.

2. **Determine the Initial States**: 
   - `ans` is an integer.
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `x` is an integer.
   - `ans` is increased by `y`.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `ii` is less than `tt`.

4. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `ans` is an integer (its value is not specified but it was increased by `y`).
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `x` is an integer.
   - `ii` is the current value of the loop variable, which is `tt-1` at the end of the previous iteration.

5. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `ii` starts from 0 and goes up to `tt-1`, at the end of the previous iteration, `ii` is `tt-1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `ii` needs to be incremented to `tt`, which means `ii` should be `tt`.

6. **Update the States**:
   - `ans` remains the same as it was increased by `y` during the loop body but no further change is mentioned.
   - `a` remains the same as no operations are specified on it within the loop.
   - `x` remains the same as no operations are specified on it within the loop.
   - `ii` is updated to `tt`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**`ans` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `x` is an integer, `ii` is `tt`**.

So, the final state is:
State: **`ans` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `x` is an integer, `ii` is `tt`**
