Output State: **`even` is a non-empty iterable, `ans` is increased by twice the value of `y`, `y` is decreased by half the value of `gap`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += 2 * y` updates the value of `ans` by adding twice the current value of `y` to it. The value of `y` is also decreased by half the value of `gap`. The iterable `even` remains unchanged.
