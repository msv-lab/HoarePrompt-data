Output State: **`even` is a non-empty iterable, `y` is 0, `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus 4 times the value of `y`.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables. It only exits the loop or the most internal loop or if statement it is inside. Since there was no loop or if statement affecting the variables `even`, `y`, and `ans` before the `break` statement, their values remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is still the original value of `ans` plus 4 times the value of `y` (which is 0), so `ans` remains as its original value.
