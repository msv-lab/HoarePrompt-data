Postcondition: **`i` will be equal to the length of list `a`, `ans` will be the count of consecutive pairs in `a` that differ by 2 or an even number where `y` was sufficient to decrement, `tmp` will contain the integer division of the differences by 2 for those pairs where the difference was even and `y` allowed it, and `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is not equal to 2**
