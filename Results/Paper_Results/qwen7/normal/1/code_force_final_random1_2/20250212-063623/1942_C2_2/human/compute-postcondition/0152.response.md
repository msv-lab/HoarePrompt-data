Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes input data for multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers n, x, and y (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2⋅10^5), and 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x), followed by x distinct integers from 1 to n. The function returns information based on the given inputs for each test case.**

This means the function processes a series of test cases, where each test case consists of specific integers and a list of distinct integers. The function reads these inputs and performs operations based on the given constraints, but the exact operation is not specified in the problem statement. The function returns results for each test case as per the provided inputs.
