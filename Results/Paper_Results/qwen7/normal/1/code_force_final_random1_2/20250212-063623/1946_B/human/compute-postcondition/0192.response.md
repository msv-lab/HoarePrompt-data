Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and a list `l` of `n` integers. It calculates a specific value `sm` based on the list `l` and the integer `k`. After processing all test cases, it prints the final value of `sm` for each case. The value `sm` is computed using suffix sums and minimum suffix sums, adjusted according to the given formula, and then possibly adjusted further based on its sign.**
