State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `j` is 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head is `for j in range(t):`.
2. The only variables involved in the loop head are `j` and `t`.
3. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer because `range(t)` will generate a sequence from 0 to `t-1`, and if `t` is less than or equal to 0, the sequence will be empty, and the loop will not execute.
4. Before the loop starts, `j` is not yet defined within the loop context; it starts at 0 according to the `range(t)` function.
5. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, `t` must be greater than 0, and `j` should be initialized to 0.

Thus, the state to be adjusted is that `t` must be greater than 0 and `j` is 0.
