Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `i` is 0.
- The postcondition states that if `suf[i + 1]` is less than `smin[i]`, then `smin` is a list containing the value of `suf[i + 1]`. Otherwise, `smin` has an additional element which is equal to `smin[i]`.

### Loop Head
The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Determine the Range of the Loop**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n - 1`.
2. **Current Value of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
3. **Next Value of `i`**: For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 1.
4. **Condition Check**: We need to check the condition `suf[i + 1] < smin[i]` for `i = 1`.
5. **Postcondition Update**:
   - If `suf[1] < smin[0]`, then `smin` will be updated to contain `suf[1]`.
   - Otherwise, `smin` will have an additional element which is equal to `smin[0]`.

### Updated State
- `i` will be 1.
- The postcondition will depend on the values of `suf[1]` and `smin[0]`.

### Final State
Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `i` is 1.
- The postcondition will be based on the comparison of `suf[1]` and `smin[0]`.

Thus, the final state is:
**State: **`i` is 1, `smin` is updated based on the condition `suf[1] < smin[0]`**.
