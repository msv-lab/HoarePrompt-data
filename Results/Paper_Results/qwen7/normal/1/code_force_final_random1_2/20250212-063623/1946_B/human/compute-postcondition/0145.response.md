Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is the integer value of the first element of the list `b`, and `smin` is a list with one additional element which is equal to `suf[i + 1]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `suf[i + 1]` to the list `smin`. Since initially, `i` is 0 and `smin[i]` is less than `suf[i + 1]`, the new value appended to `smin` is `suf[i + 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
