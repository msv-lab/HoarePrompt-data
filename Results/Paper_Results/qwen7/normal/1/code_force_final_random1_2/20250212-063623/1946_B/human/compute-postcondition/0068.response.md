Output State: **`sm` is equal to either 2 plus `suf[n]` plus 2 times \(10^9 + 7\) or (2 + `suf[n]`) modulo \(10^9 + 7\), depending on whether `sm` is less than 0; `a` is the absolute value of `sm` divided by \(10^9 + 7\); `j` is `t`; `n` is the first element of the list `b` converted to an integer; `k` is the second element of the list `b` converted to an integer; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers; `suf` is [0]; `suf[n]` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `suf.append(0)` adds the value `0` to the list `suf`. Since `suf` was initially empty, after appending `0`, `suf` becomes `[0]`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.
