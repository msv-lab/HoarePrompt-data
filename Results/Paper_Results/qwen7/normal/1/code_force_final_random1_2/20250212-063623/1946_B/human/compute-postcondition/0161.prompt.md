Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The loop iterates `n` times, where `n` is the first element of the list `b` converted to an integer. After all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n-1`. The list `suf` will contain `n+1` elements, starting from `suf[0]` up to `suf[n]`, each element being the cumulative sum of the first `i+1` elements of the list `l`. The variable `smin` remains unchanged and is still `[0]`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if suf[i + 1] < smin[i]:
        smin.append(suf[i + 1])
    else:
        smin.append(smin[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` is the integer value of the first element of the list `b`, and `smin` is a list where the last element is either equal to `suf[i + 1]` (if `suf[i + 1] < smin[i]`), or equal to `smin[0]` (if `suf[i + 1] >= smin[i]`).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is an integer, `n` is the integer value of the first element of the list `b`, and `smin` is a list where the last element is `suf[i+1]` if `suf[i+1] < smin[i]`, otherwise it remains unchanged as `smin[1]` if `i` is 1, or `suf[3]` if `i` is 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` is the integer value of the first element of the list `b`, and `smin` is a list where the last element is either `suf[4] + 1` if `suf[i + 1] < smin[i]` is true, otherwise it remains `smin[3]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
