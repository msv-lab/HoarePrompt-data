Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Initial State:**
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is the integer value of the first element of the list `b`.
   - The condition `suf[0] - smin[0] > sm` or `sm == -111` holds true.

3. **Determine the Changes in the Loop:**
   - `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
   - After the first iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is based on the value of the first element of the list `b`.

4. **Check the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `i` changes to 1 and `n` is the integer value of the first element of the list `b`, the condition `i < n` must hold true.

5. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration:**
   - `i` will be 1.
   - `n` remains the same, which is the integer value of the first element of the list `b`.
   - The condition `suf[0] - smin[0] > sm` or `sm == -111` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `i` is 1, `n` is the integer value of the first element of the list `b`, and the condition `suf[0] - smin[0] > sm` or `sm == -111` holds true.**
