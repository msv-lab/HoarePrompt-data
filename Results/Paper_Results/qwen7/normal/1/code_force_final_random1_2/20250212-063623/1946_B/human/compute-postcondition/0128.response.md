Output State: **`sm` is equal to either 2 plus `suf[n]` plus 2 times \(10^9 + 7\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\) (if `sm` is less than 0), or (2 + `suf[n]`) modulo \(10^9 + 7\) (if `sm` is greater than or equal to 0), `a` is the absolute value of `sm` divided by \(10^9 + 7\), `j` is `t`, `b` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string**.

Explanation: The code `b = input().split()` reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings. This operation does not affect the values of `sm`, `a`, or `j`. Therefore, their values remain unchanged. The new variable `b` is created and assigned the result of splitting the input string.
