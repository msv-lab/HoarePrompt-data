Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` is the first element of the list `b` converted to an integer and must be greater than 0, `smin` contains at least two elements. If `suf[3]` is less than `smin[2]`, then `smin[3]` is set to `suf[3]`. Otherwise, `smin` remains unchanged with its third element being `smin[2]`.
