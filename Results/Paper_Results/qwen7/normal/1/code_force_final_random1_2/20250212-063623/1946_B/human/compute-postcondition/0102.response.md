Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `sm` is equal to `suf[i] - smin[i]`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `suf[i] - smin[i]` to `sm`. Since `i` is `n-1` and `n` must be greater than 0, these conditions remain unchanged. The new value of `sm` is directly calculated from the given expression.
