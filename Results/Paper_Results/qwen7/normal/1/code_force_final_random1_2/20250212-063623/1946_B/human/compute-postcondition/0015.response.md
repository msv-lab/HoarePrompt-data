Output State: `suf` is a list where each element is the sum of all elements in `l` up to that index, and `n` must be equal to the length of `l`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `suf` will contain the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`. Specifically, `suf[i]` will represent the sum of the first `i+1` elements of `l`. Since the loop runs `n` times, which is the length of `l`, `suf` will have `n+1` elements (from `suf[0]` to `suf[n]`), where `suf[n]` is the sum of all elements in `l`. The variable `n` will be equal to the length of `l` because the loop runs as long as `n` is greater than 0, and it decreases by 1 with each iteration until it reaches 0.
