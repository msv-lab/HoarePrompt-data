Output State: **`suf` is updated such that suf[i+1] = suf[i] + l[i], and `n` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code updates the list `suf` by appending the value of `suf[i] + l[i]` to it. However, the initial state does not provide specific values for `suf` or `l`, only that `n` must be greater than 0. Since the code modifies `suf`, the updated state reflects that `suf` now includes the new value, while `n` remains unchanged and still must be greater than 0.
