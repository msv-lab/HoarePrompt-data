Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is the integer value of the first element of the list `b`.
   - `smin` is a list where the last element is either equal to `suf[i + 1]` (if `suf[i + 1] < smin[i]`), or equal to `smin[0]` (if `suf[i + 1] >= smin[i]`).

3. **Determine the new state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `range(n)`, the variable `i` will be incremented by 1 at the start of each new iteration.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `1` (since it was `0` at the end of the previous iteration).
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is determined by the first element of the list `b` and does not change within the loop.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be `1`.
   - `n` remains the same, which is the integer value of the first element of the list `b`.
   - For `smin`, since `i` is now `1`, the last element of `smin` will be either `suf[i + 1]` (which is `suf[2]`) or `smin[0]` depending on the condition.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` is the integer value of the first element of the list `b`, and `smin` is a list where the last element is either equal to `suf[2]` (if `suf[2] < smin[1]`), or equal to `smin[0]` (if `suf[2] >= smin[1]`)**.
