Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 0
   - `n` is the first element of the list `b` converted to an integer
   - `suf` is a list with its first element being `suf[0] + b[0]`

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Adjusting the States:**
   - The loop variable `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.
   - Since `i` is currently 0, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be 1.
   - Therefore, `i` should be incremented by 1.

4. **State After Incrementing `i`:**
   - `i` becomes 1.
   - `n` remains the same (the first element of the list `b` converted to an integer).
   - `suf` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop head.

5. **Final State:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is the first element of the list `b` converted to an integer
   - `suf` is a list with its first element being `suf[0] + b[0]`

Therefore, the final state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` is the first element of the list `b` converted to an integer, `suf` is a list with its first element being `suf[0] + b[0]`**
