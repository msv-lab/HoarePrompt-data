Output State: **`i` is 0; `suf[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to `smin[i]`; `smin` has an additional element which is equal to `smin[i]`**.

Explanation: The code appends the value of `smin[i]` to the list `smin`. Since `i` is 0, `smin[i]` is the first element of the list `smin`. Therefore, `smin` gains an additional element which is the same as the first element of the original list `smin`. The conditions involving `i` and `suf` remain unchanged.
