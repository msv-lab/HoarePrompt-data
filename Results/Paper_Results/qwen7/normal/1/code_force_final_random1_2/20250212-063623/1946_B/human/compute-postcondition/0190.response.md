Output State: **The final value of `sm` is calculated as described in the problem statement, but it will be the result after processing all `t` inputs.**

Natural Language Description: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the final value of `sm` will be determined based on the last input provided. The process involves calculating `sm` for each input, which includes steps such as computing suffix sums (`suf`), finding the minimum prefix sum (`smin`), and applying a transformation involving powers of 2 and modulo operations. The final `sm` value will either be adjusted to be non-negative using modulo arithmetic or adjusted if negative by adding a multiple of \(10^9 + 7\). The exact value of `sm` will depend on the specific inputs provided for each iteration, but it will be the result of these calculations applied to the last input since the loop processes each input independently.
