Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `suf` is a list where the last element is updated to `suf[i] + l[i]`.
   - `i` is `i + 1`.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.

3. **Determine the state adjustments needed for the next iteration**:
   - The variable `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, so `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - The loop will continue as long as `n` is greater than 0. Since `n` must be greater than 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it will remain the same unless explicitly changed within the loop body (which is omitted).

Given these points, we need to adjust the states of `i` and ensure that `n` remains valid for the next iteration.

**Step-by-step adjustment**:
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `n` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

So, the new state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`suf` is a list where the last element is updated to `suf[i] + l[i]`, `i` is `i + 1`, and `n` must be greater than 0**.

However, since `i` is incremented by 1, we need to reflect this change in the state description:

State: **`suf` is a list where the last element is updated to `suf[i+1] + l[i+1]`, `i` is `i + 1`, and `n` must be greater than 0**.

Thus, the final state is:

State: **`suf` is a list where the last element is updated to `suf[i+1] + l[i+1]`, `i` is `i + 1`, and `n` must be greater than 0**.
