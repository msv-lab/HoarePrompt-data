Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `j` is 0; `b` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string; `n` is the integer value of the first element in the list `b`; `k` is the integer value of the second element in the list `b`; `l` is a list of integers obtained from converting the input string using `map(int, input().split())`; `suf` is a list containing 0.**

Explanation: The code `suf.append(0)` appends the integer `0` to the list `suf`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
