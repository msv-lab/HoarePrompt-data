Output State: `i` is `n`, `n` is the integer value of the first element of the list `b`, and `sm` is the maximum value of `suf[i] - smin[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n`.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, the variable `i` will be equal to `n` because the loop runs from `0` to `n` inclusive. The variable `sm` will hold the maximum value of `suf[i] - smin[i]` encountered during the loop iterations. This is because the loop updates `sm` whenever it finds a value of `suf[i] - smin[i]` that is greater than the current `sm` or if `sm` is initially -111.
