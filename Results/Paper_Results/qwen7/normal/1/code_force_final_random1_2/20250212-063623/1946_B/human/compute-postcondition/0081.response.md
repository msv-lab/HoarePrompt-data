Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is the first element of the list `b` converted to an integer and must be greater than 0, `suf[i + 1]` is less than `smin[i]`, `smin` is appended with `suf[i + 1]`**.

Explanation: The code appends `suf[i + 1]` to the list `smin`. Given that `i` is 0, `suf[i + 1]` translates to `suf[1]`. Therefore, `smin` now contains one additional element, which is `suf[1]`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
