Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**:
   - The variable `i` is being iterated from `0` to `n + 1`.
   - The variable `n` is the length of the list `l`.

3. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` starts from `0` and goes up to `n + 1`, the loop will execute `n + 1` times.
   - The variable `n` must be a non-negative integer because the length of a list cannot be negative.

4. **Consider the given states**:
   - `sm` is `-111`.
   - `suf` is a list where each element is the sum of all elements in `l` up to that index.
   - `n` is the length of `l`.
   - `smin` is a list where each element (except the first one) is the minimum value found so far among the sums in `suf` up to that index.

5. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - The variable `n` must be a non-negative integer.
   - The variable `i` will start from `0` and go up to `n + 1`.

Given these considerations, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `n` must be a non-negative integer.
- `i` will start from `0` and go up to `n + 1`.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`n` must be a non-negative integer, `i` is 0**
