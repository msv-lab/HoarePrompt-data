Output State: **`i` is 1; `smin` is a list with its second element being the minimum of `suf[1]` and `smin[0]` appended to it.**

Explanation: Initially, `i` is 1 and `smin` is updated based on the condition `suf[1] < smin[0]`. After executing `smin.append(smin[i])`, the value of `i` remains unchanged, so `i` is still 1. The value of `smin` is updated to include its second element, which is the minimum of `suf[1]` and `smin[0]` appended to the list.
