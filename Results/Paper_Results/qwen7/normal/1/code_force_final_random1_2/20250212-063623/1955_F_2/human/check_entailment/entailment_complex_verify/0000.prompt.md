You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))
        print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, p_i is a list of four non-negative integers representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the initial sequence, where 0 ≤ p_i[0] + p_i[1] + p_i[2] + p_i[3] ≤ 200.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))
        
        print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)
        
    #State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and \(t = \text{initial\_t} - n\), `p` is a list of integers where each element is the largest even number less than or equal to the corresponding input integer, the input is processed and converted into a list of integers where each element is the largest even number less than or equal to the corresponding input integer, and the loop has executed `n` times, where `n` is the total number of test cases provided.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, where for each test case, it takes a list of four integers (representing counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s) and computes a value based on specific conditions. It prints a result for each test case, indicating whether the sum of the odd counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s equals 3 and adding half the sum of all elements in the list. The function effectively reduces the count of test cases and updates the internal state by processing each input list and printing the computed value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win. The given solution attempts to calculate the sum of the odd numbers in the list and checks if the sum of the first three elements is equal to 3, which does not align with the problem description.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to consider the bitwise XOR operation and the parity of the counts of the numbers. Specifically, we need to ensure that the XOR of all numbers is zero for Bob to win. The optimal strategy for Eve is to remove numbers that contribute to making the XOR non-zero.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def max_bob_wins(p):
    ones, twos, threes, fours = p
    # Calculate the total number of numbers
    total_numbers = ones + twos + threes + fours
    # Calculate the number of ones and threes (since XOR of 1 and 3 is 2, they cancel out)
    effective_ones_and_threes = ones + threes
    # Calculate the number of twos and fours (since XOR of 2 and 4 is 6, they also cancel out)
    effective_twos_and_fours = twos + fours
    # Bob wins if the total number of numbers is even and the number of ones and threes is even
    # or if the total number of numbers is odd and the number of ones and threes is odd
    if total_numbers % 2 == 0:
        return effective_ones_and_threes // 2
    else:
        return (effective_ones_and_threes + 1) // 2

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        print(max_bob_wins(p))

func()
```

This corrected version correctly calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win based on the parity of the counts of the numbers.
