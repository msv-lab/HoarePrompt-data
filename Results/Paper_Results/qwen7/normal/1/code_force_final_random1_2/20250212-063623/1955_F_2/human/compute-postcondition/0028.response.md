Output State: The list `a` is empty, and `cnt` is the sum of the floor division of each integer in the original list `a` by 2, after the loop has executed all its iterations.

In simpler terms, after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, the list `a` will be empty because all elements have been processed, and the variable `cnt` will hold the total sum of the floor division of each integer in the original list `a` by 2.
