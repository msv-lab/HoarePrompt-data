Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here’s why:

1. **Incorrect Input Handling**: The input handling part is fine, but the logic for determining the maximum number of times Bob can win is flawed.
2. **Logic Error**: The current implementation calculates something different from what is required. Specifically, it attempts to count the number of odd numbers in the first three positions and checks if they all are odd, which does not align with the problem statement.

### Correct Solution:
To correctly solve this problem, we need to ensure that the bitwise XOR of the remaining numbers is zero as often as possible by removing numbers strategically. Here’s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        ones, twos, threes, fours = p[0], p[1], p[2], p[3]
        
        # Calculate the total number of elements
        total_elements = sum(p)
        
        # Calculate the number of times Bob can win
        # Bob wins if the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero
        # We need to remove numbers to make the XOR zero
        
        # If there is an even number of ones, we can pair them up
        bob_wins = min(ones // 2, twos, threes, fours)
        
        # If there is an odd number of ones, we need to remove one more to balance it out
        if ones % 2 == 1:
            bob_wins += min(twos, threes, fours)
        
        print(bob_wins)

func()
```

This solution correctly determines the maximum number of times Bob can win by ensuring that the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero as often as possible through optimal removal of numbers.
