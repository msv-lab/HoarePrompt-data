Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: The list `a` is empty, and `cnt` is the sum of the floor division of each integer in the original list `a` by 2. Since the list `a` is empty, `cnt` remains unchanged from its initial value (which is 0).

2. **Loop Head**: The loop is defined as `for _ in range(int(input())):`. This means that the loop will run for a number of times equal to the integer input provided by the user. However, since we are only asked to consider the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to determine what changes would allow the loop to execute one more time.

3. **Variables in Loop Head**: The only variables involved in the loop head are the loop counter `_` and the input value. The loop counter `_` is incremented with each iteration, but it does not affect the state directly. The input value is read at the beginning of the loop and does not change within the loop.

4. **Condition for Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, the input value must be greater than 0. If the input value is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute at all.

5. **State Adjustment**: Since the list `a` is empty and `cnt` is already the sum of the floor division of each integer in the original list `a` by 2, no changes are needed for these variables. The only thing that needs to be adjusted is the input value to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that the input value is now 1 (assuming the original input was 1, allowing the loop to execute once), and the list `a` remains empty.

**State: **`a` is an empty list, and `cnt` is the sum of the floor division of each integer in the original list `a` by 2, and the input value is 1**
