To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `cnt` is the sum of the floor division of each element in the list `a` by 2.
   - This means `cnt = (a[0] // 2) + (a[1] // 2) + ... + (a[n] // 2)`, where `n` is the length of the list `a`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   - The code snippet contains a single `print` statement: `print(cnt)`.

Given the initial state, `cnt` is already computed and stored as the sum of the floor divisions of each element in the list `a` by 2. When the `print` statement executes, it will simply print the value of `cnt`.

Therefore, the output will be the computed value of `cnt`.

Output: **cnt (where cnt is the sum of the floor division of each element in the list `a` by 2)**
