Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads a quadruple of non-negative integers representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in an initial sequence. It calculates and prints the sum of the floor division of each integer in the quadruple by 2, plus one additional count if the first three integers are equal and odd.**
