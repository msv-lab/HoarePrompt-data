Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_4`**: This function correctly checks if \( k \) is divisible by 2 and calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length \( n \). If \( k \) is not divisible by 2 or if \( k \) exceeds the maximum possible Manhattan value, it returns "No" (by returning zeros). Otherwise, it returns "Yes" (by returning \( n \) and \( k \)).

2. **Function `func_1`**: This function attempts to construct a permutation with the desired Manhattan value. It initializes a list of numbers from 1 to \( n \) and iteratively swaps elements to adjust the Manhattan value. The logic seems to be correct for constructing a permutation with a given Manhattan value, especially when considering the constraints and the nature of the Manhattan value calculation.

3. **Function `func_2`**: This function correctly swaps elements in the list as required to adjust the Manhattan value. The swapping logic is straightforward and does not introduce any errors.

4. **Function `func_3`**: This function incorrectly returns the list without making any changes. It should swap the elements at positions `c-1` and `len(l)-c`, but instead, it returns the original list. This introduces a significant flaw because the intended purpose of `func_3` is to make adjustments to the list to achieve the desired Manhattan value, which it fails to do.

5. **Function `func_5`**: This function correctly prints the permutation and returns nothing. The logic here is sound.

6. **Function `func_6`**: This function integrates the other functions to solve the problem. It correctly handles the initial check via `func_4` and then uses `func_1` to generate the permutation. However, since `func_3` does not perform any necessary swaps, `func_1` might not produce the correct permutation in some cases.

Given that `func_3` does not perform any necessary swaps, the overall correctness of the program is compromised. Specifically, `func_1` relies on `func_3` to make the necessary adjustments, but `func_3` does nothing, leading to potential incorrect results.

Correctness: **False**
