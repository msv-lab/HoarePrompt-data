### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_4`**:
   - This function checks if `k` is divisible by 2. If not, it returns `(0, 0)`.
   - It calculates `max_k` which is the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n`. 
     - If `n` is odd, `max_k = (n ** 2 - 1) // 2`.
     - If `n` is even, `max_k = n ** 2 // 2`.
   - If `max_k < k`, it returns `(0, 0)`.
   - Otherwise, it returns `n` and `k`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function aims to construct a permutation with the given `n` and `k`.
   - It initializes a list `l` with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
   - It iteratively modifies the list by swapping elements to achieve the desired Manhattan value.
   - The loop continues until `k` is zero or `i` becomes negative.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function swaps two elements in the list `l` at positions `-c` and `-c - k`.
   - It ensures that the Manhattan value is adjusted accordingly.

4. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function swaps two elements in the list `l` at positions `-c` and `c - 1`.
   - It ensures that the Manhattan value is adjusted accordingly.

5. **Function `func_5`**:
   - This function prints "YES" followed by the permutation list `l` on a single line.
   - It prints each element of `l` separated by a space.

6. **Function `func_6`**:
   - This function calls `func_4` to get `n` and `k`.
   - If `n` is zero, it prints "NO" and returns.
   - Otherwise, it constructs the permutation using `func_1` and prints it using `func_5`.

### Analysis:
- The logic in `func_4` correctly determines if a solution is possible based on the constraints.
- The logic in `func_1` correctly constructs the permutation by iteratively adjusting the Manhattan value through swaps.
- The functions `func_2` and `func_3` ensure that the swaps are made correctly to adjust the Manhattan value.
- The function `func_5` correctly prints the permutation.

Given the detailed analysis, the provided code seems to correctly implement the logic to find a permutation with the given Manhattan value or determine if no such permutation exists.

### Conclusion:
**Correctness: True**

The program is logically sound and correctly implements the required functionality based on the problem statement.
