Output State: **`l` is a list; `k` is `k - i + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `k = k - i + 1` updates the value of `k` by subtracting `i` from it and then adding 1. The list `l` remains unchanged unless the condition `1 + i > k` is met, which is not determined by the given code. Therefore, the only change is to the value of `k`.
