Output State: **The program returns the value of `i - 2` if `k` equals 0, otherwise, it calls the function `func_2(c, k, l)` with the current values of `c`, `k`, and `l`.**

Given the initial conditions:
- `i` is `i - 2`
- `n` is greater than or equal to `i - 2`
- `c` is increased by 1
- If `k` equals 0, the function returns `i` which is `i - 2`

The return statement `return func_2(c, k, l)` indicates that the function `func_2` is called with the updated values of `c`, `k`, and `l`. However, without knowing the exact values of `k` and `l`, we cannot determine the exact return value of `func_2(c, k, l)`. But if `k` equals 0, the function returns `i - 2`.

Therefore, the final output state depends on the value of `k`:
- If `k` is 0, the program returns `i - 2`.
- Otherwise, the program returns the result of `func_2(c, k, l)`.
