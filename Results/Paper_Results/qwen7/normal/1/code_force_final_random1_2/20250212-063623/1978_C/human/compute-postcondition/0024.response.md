Output State: **`l` is the return value of `func_3(c, l)`, `c` is increased by 2, `i` is `i - 2`, and `k` is equal to `k - (i - 2) + 1`. Additionally, `k` is not equal to 0 and is greater than or equal to `i - 1`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `l = func_3(c, l)` updates the value of `l` to be the return value of the function `func_3(c, l)`. The other variables (`c`, `i`, and `k`) are updated as described in the initial state. The precondition that `k` is not equal to 0 and is greater than or equal to `i - 1` remains valid after the code execution.
