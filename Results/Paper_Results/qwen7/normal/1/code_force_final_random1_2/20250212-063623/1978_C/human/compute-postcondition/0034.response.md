Output State: **`i` is `i - 2`, `n` is greater than or equal to `i - 2`, `c` is increased by 1, `k` is `k - (i - 2) + 1`, `l` is the return value of `func_3(c, l)`**.

Explanation: The variable `l` is assigned the return value of the function `func_3(c, l)`. The values of `i`, `n`, `c`, and `k` remain unchanged from their previous states. The function call `func_3(c, l)` may modify its internal state, but since no specific details about `func_3` are provided, we only know that `l` now holds whatever value `func_3` returns.
