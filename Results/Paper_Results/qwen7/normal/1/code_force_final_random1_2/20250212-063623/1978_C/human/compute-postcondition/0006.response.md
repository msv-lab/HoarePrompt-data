Output State: **`l` is the result of `func_1(n, k)`, and `l` is passed to `func_5(l)`**.

Explanation: The function call `func_5(l)` is made, which means that the value of `l` is passed as an argument to `func_5`. However, since the implementation of `func_5` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact changes to the variables within `func_5`. The only thing we know for certain is that `l` is now being used as an argument in the function call `func_5(l)`. Therefore, the initial conditions regarding `n` and `k` remain unchanged, and the only new information is that `l` is the input to `func_5`.
