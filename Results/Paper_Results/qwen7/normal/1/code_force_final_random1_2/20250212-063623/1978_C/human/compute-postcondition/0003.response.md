Output State: **The program returns the new values of `n` and `k` after the function `func_4()` has been called.**

Given the initial state where `n` is 0 and `k` is an integer between 0 and \(10^{12}\), and considering that `func_4()` has modified these values, the return statement will simply pass back these updated values. Since no specific operations are performed within the return statement, it directly returns the updated values of `n` and `k`.
