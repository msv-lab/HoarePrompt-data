You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and k is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12.
def func_1(n, k):
    k = k // 2
    l = list(range(1, n + 1))
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        if k == 0:
            return l
        
        if 1 + i > k:
            x = l[-1]
            l.pop(-1)
            l.insert(-k, x)
            return l
        
        k = k - i + 1
        
        x = l[-1]
        
        l.pop(-1)
        
        l.insert(0, x)
        
    #State: Output State: The list `l` is reversed, `k` is `0`, and `i` is `-1`.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the list `l` will be fully reversed because each iteration moves the last element of the current list to the front or removes the last element until the list is empty. Since the loop runs from `n-1` down to `0`, it effectively reverses the list. Additionally, once the loop condition `i >= 0` is no longer met (i.e., `i` becomes `-1`), the loop terminates, and since `k` was decremented to `0` during the last iteration where `1 + i <= k` held true, `k` remains `0`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters `n` and `k`. `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12. The function returns a list `l` based on the following cases:

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns a list 'l' containing integers from 1 to n inclusive, where n is between 1 and 2⋅10^5 inclusive.

Case_2: The program returns a list 'l' which contains integers from 1 to n-1 inclusive, with the last element 'x' inserted at index -k.

Case_3: The program returns 'l', which is not defined in the initial state or within the provided code snippet.

Case_4: The program returns the list `l` with its second last element inserted at index `-k`

Case_5: The program returns a list 'l' with its last element removed and the first element set to the second last element of the updated list. The update to the list involves setting the first element to the second last element after removing the last element.

Case_6: The program returns a list `l` with its last two elements removed, the first element set to the third last element of the updated list, and the last element being the original last element before modifications.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
