Output State: **`l` is a list; `x` is the last element of `l`; `k` is `k - i + 1`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the last element of the list `l` to the variable `x`. The value of `k` remains unchanged from its previous state, which was `k - i + 1`. The list `l` itself is not modified by this operation.
