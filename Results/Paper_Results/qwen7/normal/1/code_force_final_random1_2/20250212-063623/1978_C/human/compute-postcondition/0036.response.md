Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, and `k` is an integer between 0 and 10^12. The function may return an undefined value, call `func_2` with specific arguments, call `func_3` with specific arguments, return the value of `l`, return `i - 2`, or call `func_2` with the current values of `c`, `k`, and `l` based on certain conditions involving `c`, `i`, and `k`.**
