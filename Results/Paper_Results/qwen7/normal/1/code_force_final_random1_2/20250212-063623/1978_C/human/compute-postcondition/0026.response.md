Output State: **`i` is `i - 2`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `i - 2`, `c` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `c` is incremented by 1, while the values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial conditions. The precondition that `n` must be greater than or equal to `i - 2` is still valid after the code execution.
