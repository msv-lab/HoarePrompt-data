Let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `b` is the original value of `b` plus `c`.
   - `a` is an integer obtained by splitting the new value of `s` and converting the first part to an integer.
   - `c` is an integer obtained by splitting the new value of `s` and converting the last part to an integer.
   - `b` is updated to be the original value of `b` plus `c`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print((a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3])
   ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Expression Analysis**:
   - The expression inside the `print` function is `(a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3]`.
   - This expression uses a conditional index `[c < b % 3]` to select between two values: `a - -b // 3` and `-1`.

2. **Conditional Index**:
   - The condition `c < b % 3` determines which value to return.
   - If `c < b % 3` is `True`, it returns `a - -b // 3`.
   - If `c < b % 3` is `False`, it returns `-1`.

3. **Value of `-b // 3`**:
   - The expression `-b // 3` means taking the floor division of `b` by 3 and then negating the result.
   - Since `b` is an integer, `-b // 3` will be the negative floor division of `b` by 3.

4. **Value of `a - -b // 3`**:
   - `a` is an integer obtained by splitting the new value of `s` and converting the first part to an integer.
   - `--b // 3` is the negation of the floor division of `b` by 3.
   - Therefore, `a - -b // 3` is `a + b // 3`.

5. **Final Expression**:
   - The expression simplifies to either `a + b // 3` if `c < b % 3` is `True`, or `-1` if `c < b % 3` is `False`.

### Conclusion:

Given the initial state and the operations described, the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are not explicitly provided. However, based on the structure of the problem, the output will depend on the condition `c < b % 3`.

- If `c < b % 3` is `True`, the output will be `a + b // 3`.
- If `c < b % 3` is `False`, the output will be `-1`.

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are not specified, we can only describe the output in terms of the condition.

Output: **a + b // 3 if c < b % 3 is True, otherwise -1**
