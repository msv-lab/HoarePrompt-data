Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `b` is the original value of `b` plus `c`, `a` is an integer obtained by splitting the string `s` and converting the first part to an integer, `c` is an integer obtained by splitting the string `s` and converting the last part to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `b += c` increments the value of `b` by the value of `c`. The values of `t`, `a`, and `c` remain unchanged from their initial state.
