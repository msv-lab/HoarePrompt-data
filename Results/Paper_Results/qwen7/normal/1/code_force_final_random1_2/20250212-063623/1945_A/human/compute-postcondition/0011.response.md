Let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `b` is the original value of `b` plus `c`.
   - `a` is the integer value of the first part of `s` split by spaces and converted to an integer.
   - `c` is the integer value of the last part of `s` split by spaces and converted to an integer.
   - `s` is the next line of input from the input stream.
   - `b` is increased by `c`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print((a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3])
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The expression inside the `print` function is a tuple: `(a - -b // 3, -1)`.
   - The tuple contains two elements: `a - -b // 3` and `-1`.
   - The second element of the tuple is always `-1`.
   - The first element of the tuple, `a - -b // 3`, will be selected based on the condition `c < b % 3`.

4. **Condition Analysis:**
   - `b % 3` gives the remainder when `b` is divided by 3.
   - If `c < b % 3`, then the first element of the tuple, `a - -b // 3`, will be printed.
   - If `c >= b % 3`, then `-1` will be printed.

5. **Value Calculation:**
   - `a` is the integer value of the first part of `s` split by spaces.
   - `b` is the original value of `b` plus `c`, and then `b` is increased by `c` again.
   - `-b // 3` means taking the floor division of `-b` by 3, which is equivalent to `-(b // 3)` because `b // 3` is an integer division.
   - Therefore, `a - -b // 3` simplifies to `a + b // 3`.

6. **Final Output:**
   - The output depends on the condition `c < b % 3`.
   - If `c < b % 3`, the output will be `a + b // 3`.
   - If `c >= b % 3`, the output will be `-1`.

Given the nature of the problem, without specific values for `a`, `b`, `c`, and `s`, we can only describe the output in terms of the condition.

Output: **a + b // 3 if c < b % 3, otherwise -1**
