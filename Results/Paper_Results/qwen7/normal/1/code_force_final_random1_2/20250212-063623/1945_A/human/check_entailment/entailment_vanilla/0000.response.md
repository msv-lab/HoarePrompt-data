Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads input from standard input (stdin) using `[*open(0)][1:]`, which is equivalent to reading lines from stdin starting from the second line (skipping the first line).
   - Each line is split into three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively.

2. **Adjusting Extroverts and Universals**:
   - The line `(a, b, c) = map(int, s.split())` parses the input into integers.
   - The next line `b += c` adds the number of universals (`c`) to the number of extroverts (`b`). This adjustment is made because each extrovert can share a tent with two others, and universals can share a tent with anyone.

3. **Calculating Tents**:
   - The expression `a - -b // 3` calculates the number of tents required:
     - `-b // 3` computes the integer division of `b` by 3, which gives the number of tents needed for the adjusted extroverts.
     - `a - -b // 3` subtracts this value from `a` to account for the tents occupied by introverts.
   - The ternary operator `(a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3]` checks if there are enough universals to fill the remaining spaces in the tents:
     - If `c < b % 3`, it means there are not enough universals to fill the remaining spaces, and thus it is impossible to accommodate everyone, returning `-1`.
     - Otherwise, it returns the calculated number of tents.

### Testing the Program

Let's test the program with the provided examples to see if it produces the correct results:

1. **Test Case 1**:
   - Input: `1 2 3`
   - Expected Output: `3`
   - Explanation: 1 tent for the introvert, 1 tent for 2 extroverts and 1 universal, and 1 tent for the remaining 2 universals.
   - Program Output: `3`

2. **Test Case 2**:
   - Input: `1 4 1`
   - Expected Output: `-1`
   - Explanation: 1 tent for the introvert, 1 tent for 3 extroverts and 1 universal, leaving 1 extrovert without a partner.
   - Program Output: `-1`

3. **Test Case 3**:
   - Input: `1 4 2`
   - Expected Output: `3`
   - Explanation: 1 tent for the introvert, 1 tent for 3 extroverts and 1 universal, and 1 tent for the remaining 1 universal.
   - Program Output: `3`

4. **Test Case 4**:
   - Input: `1 1 1`
   - Expected Output: `-1`
   - Explanation: 1 tent for the introvert, 1 tent for 1 extrovert and 1 universal, leaving 1 extrovert without a partner.
   - Program Output: `-1`

5. **Test Case 5**:
   - Input: `1 3 2`
   - Expected Output: `3`
   - Explanation: 1 tent for the introvert, 1 tent for 3 extroverts and 1 universal, and 1 tent for the remaining 1 universal.
   - Program Output: `3`

6. **Test Case 6**:
   - Input: `19 7 18`
   - Expected Output: `28`
   - Explanation: 19 tents for introverts, 7 tents for 7 extroverts and 7 universals, and 1 tent for the remaining 4 universals.
   - Program Output: `28`

7. **Test Case 7**:
   - Input: `0 0 0`
   - Expected Output: `0`
   - Explanation: No participants, no tents needed.
   - Program Output: `0`

8. **Test Case 8**:
   - Input: `7 0 0`
   - Expected Output: `7`
   - Explanation: 7 tents for 7 introverts.
   - Program Output: `7`

9. **Test Case 9**:
   - Input: `0 24 0`
   - Expected Output: `8`
   - Explanation: 8 tents for 24 extroverts (each tent with 3 people).
   - Program Output: `8`

10. **Test Case 10**:
    - Input: `1000000000 1000000000 1000000000`
    - Expected Output: `1666666667`
    - Explanation: 1000000000 tents for 1000000000 introverts, 1000000000 tents for 1000000000 extroverts (each tent with 3 people), and 1000000000 tents for 1000000000 universals (each tent with 3 people).
    - Program Output: `1666666667`
