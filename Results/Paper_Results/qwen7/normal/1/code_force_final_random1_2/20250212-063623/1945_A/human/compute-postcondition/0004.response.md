Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is the variable `s`. The loop iterates over each line from the standard input (denoted by `[*open(0)][1:]`), starting from the second line.

2. **Determine the state adjustments needed**: Since the loop iterates based on the value of `s`, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `s` itself. The values of `t`, `b`, and `a` are not directly affected by the loop head and thus do not need to be modified.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are lines available in the input. After each iteration, `s` takes the next line from the input.

4. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `b` is the original value of `b` plus `c`.
   - `a` is an integer obtained by splitting the string `s` and converting the first part to an integer.
   - `c` is an integer obtained by splitting the string `s` and converting the last part to an integer.

5. **Next state for the loop to execute one more time**: 
   - `t` remains the same since it is not affected by the loop.
   - `b` remains the same since it is not directly modified in the loop.
   - `a` will be updated based on the new value of `s`.
   - `c` will be updated based on the new value of `s`.

Given that the loop reads the next line from the input, the new value of `s` will be the next line. Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `b` is the original value of `b` plus `c`, `a` is an integer obtained by splitting the new value of `s` and converting the first part to an integer, `c` is an integer obtained by splitting the new value of `s` and converting the last part to an integer.**
