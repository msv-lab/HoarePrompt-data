Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the allocation of tents according to the given rules. Specifically, the program incorrectly combines the number of extroverts and universals before attempting to allocate tents. This approach fails to properly account for the specific needs of introverts and the constraints on the number of people per tent.

For example, consider the test case `1 2 3`:
- According to the problem description, we need 1 tent for the introvert.
- We also need 1 tent for 2 extroverts and 1 universal.
- The remaining 2 universals can share another tent.

However, the program attempts to combine the number of extroverts and universals into a single value (`b += c`) and then tries to allocate tents based on this combined value. This leads to incorrect results. For instance, in the test case `1 2 3`, the program outputs `3`, which is correct, but for the test case `1 4 1`, the program outputs `-1`, which is incorrect because it is possible to accommodate the participants as follows:
- 1 tent for the introvert.
- 1 tent for 2 extroverts and 1 universal.
- 1 tent for the remaining 2 universals.

Thus, the minimum number of tents needed is 3, not -1. This indicates that the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.
