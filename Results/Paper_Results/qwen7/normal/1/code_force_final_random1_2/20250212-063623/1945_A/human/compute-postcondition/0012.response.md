Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `b` is the sum of its original value and all `c` values encountered during the loop, `a` is the total sum of all `a` values encountered during the loop, and `c` is the total sum of all `c` values encountered during the loop. The variable `s` contains the last line of input read from the input stream before the loop completes.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `a`, `b`, and `c` will hold the cumulative sums of their respective values from all the input lines processed. The variable `t` remains within its initial bounds, and `s` will contain the last line of input that was processed, if any, after the loop has completed.
