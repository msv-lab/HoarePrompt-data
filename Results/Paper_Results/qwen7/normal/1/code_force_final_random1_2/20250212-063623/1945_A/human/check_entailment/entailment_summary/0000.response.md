Reasoning:
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads input from standard input, which is simulated by `[*open(0)]`. This means it reads all lines of input at once and stores them in a list of strings.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**: For each line of input, it splits the string into three integers (a, b, c) representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively.

3. **Adjusting Extrovert Count**: The program then updates the count of extroverts (`b`) by adding the count of universals (`c`). This adjustment is done with the line `b += c`.

4. **Calculating Tents Needed**:
   - The expression `(a - -b // 3)` is used to calculate the number of tents needed.
   - The `- -b // 3` part simplifies to `b // 3 + 1` because the double negation `- -b` results in `b`.
   - The condition `[c < b % 3]` checks if there are any universals left over after distributing them among the extroverts. If there are, it returns `-1`.

5. **Output**: The program prints the result for each test case.

Now, let's check if this logic aligns with the problem statement:
- The program correctly handles the introverts needing separate tents.
- The extroverts need to be paired up, and the universals can be used to fill these pairs.
- The logic to handle leftover universals is correct, as it ensures that if there are leftover universals that cannot form a complete pair, the function returns `-1`.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
