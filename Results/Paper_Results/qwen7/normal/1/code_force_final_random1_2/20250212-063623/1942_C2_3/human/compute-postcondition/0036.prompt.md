Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tt` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq tt \leq 10^4\), `ii` is 0, `n` is the first number inputted, `x` is the second number inputted, `y` is the third number inputted, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `ans` is `x + y - 2`, `tmp` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(a)):
    if a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2:
        ans += 1
    elif (a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1:
        tmp.append((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2)
        ans += (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2
        y -= (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ii` is 0, `n` is the first number inputted, `x` is the second number inputted, `y` is either `y - (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 + 1` if the current value of `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is even and `y` is greater than `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, or `y` remains unchanged, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order that must have more than one element, `ans` is `x + y - 2` adjusted accordingly, `tmp` is a list containing the value of `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` if the condition is met, and the difference between consecutive elements in `a` is 2 or not 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `ans` is increased by either 1 or `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, depending on whether `a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2`. If the condition is true, `ans` is increased by 1. If the condition is false, `ans` is increased by `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1` and `tmp` contains an additional element which is `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`. Both `a` and `i` retain their original values.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `ans` is the value of `ans` after the previous iteration, `a` is the list `a` with its original values, `i` is the value of `i` after the previous iteration incremented by 1. If `a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2`, then `ans` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0` and `y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, then `ans` is increased by `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`, `y` is decreased by `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, and a list `tmp` containing the value `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` is created.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
