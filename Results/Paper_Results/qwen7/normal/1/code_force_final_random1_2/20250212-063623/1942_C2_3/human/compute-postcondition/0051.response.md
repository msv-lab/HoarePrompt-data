Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `x` remains unchanged, `y` remains unchanged, `a` retains its sorted order but may have been altered by the loop's operations, `ans` remains unchanged, `tmp` collects all the valid values of `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` that meet the specified conditions during each iteration of the loop, `ii` is `len(a) + 1` after converting `a` into a list and calculating its length.**

Explanation: The code `n, x, y = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `x`, and `y`. The variable `ii` is defined as `len(a) + 1` in the initial state, where `a` is a list. Since the code does not directly modify `ii`, its value remains as `len(a) + 1`. The values of `n`, `x`, and `y` are updated to the integers read from the input. All other variables (`a`, `ans`, and `tmp`) retain their previous states as described.
