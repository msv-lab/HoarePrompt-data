Output State: **`x` must be greater than 0; `i` is `i + 1`; `next_elem` is `a[0] + n` if `i` equals `x - 1`, otherwise `next_elem` is `a[i + 1]`; `gap` is `next_elem - a[i] - 1`; `odd` is a list with one additional element which is the value of `gap`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `gap` to the list `odd`. Since `gap` is already defined, its value is added to the list `odd`. The other variables (`x`, `i`, `next_elem`, and `gap`) remain unchanged according to their previous definitions.
