Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is `R()`, `x` is the final value after the loop completes, `y` is `R() - ((i_prev + 1) // 2)`, `sx` is `x + y * 2 + (i_prev + 1) + y * 2 + i`, `l` is a sorted list containing elements generated by `R()` with the additional element `n + l[0]` appended to it, `c` is `i // 2`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

Explanation: The line `sx += i` adds the value of `i` to `sx`. Since `i` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value, but we know that `sx` will now be the original value of `sx` plus `i`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
