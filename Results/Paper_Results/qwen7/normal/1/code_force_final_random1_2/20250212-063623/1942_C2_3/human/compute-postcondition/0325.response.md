Output State: The `even` list remains sorted in ascending order, the `odd` list is fully consumed (i.e., it has no remaining elements), `next_elem` retains its final value based on the last condition checked, `gap` retains its final value which is the last element from the `odd` list, `ans` is the sum of all `gap` values minus the integer division of `gap` by 2 for each iteration, and `y` is 0 if it became 0 during any iteration due to `y < gap // 2` condition, otherwise, `y` is the result of decrementing by `gap // 2` for each iteration where `y` was greater than or equal to `gap // 2`.

This means that after all iterations, `ans` will be the cumulative sum of all `gap` values minus half of each `gap` value for each iteration, and `y` will be 0 if it reached 0 during any iteration, otherwise, it will be the result of the last decrement operation.
