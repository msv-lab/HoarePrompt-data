Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The only variable in the loop head is `gap`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `gap`**: The problem states that `odd` is sorted in ascending order and `gap` retains its previous value. This means that `gap` will take on the values of the elements in the `odd` list one by one during each iteration of the loop.

3. **Ensure the loop can execute**: For the loop to execute, the `odd` list must contain at least one element. If `odd` is empty, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**: Since `even` and `odd` are already described as being in a certain state, we only need to focus on ensuring that the loop can start by having at least one element in `odd`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is that `odd` must have at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`even` is sorted in ascending order, `odd` must have at least one element, `next_elem` retains its previous value based on the condition, `gap` retains its previous value, and all other variables (`ans`, `y`, `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`) remain unchanged**.
