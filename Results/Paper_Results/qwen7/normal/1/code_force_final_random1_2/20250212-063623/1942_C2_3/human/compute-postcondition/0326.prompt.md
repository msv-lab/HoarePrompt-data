Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `even` is sorted in ascending order, `odd` remains sorted in ascending order from the previous operation, `next_elem` retains its previous value based on the condition, `gap` retains its previous value, and all other variables (`ans`, `y`, `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`) remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for gap in odd:
    if y < gap // 2:
        ans += 2 * y
        y = 0
        break
    ans += gap
    y -= gap // 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `even` is sorted in ascending order, `odd` must have at least one element, `next_elem` retains its previous value based on the condition, `gap` retains its previous value, `ans` is increased by `gap`, and `y` is decreased by `gap // 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `even` is sorted in ascending order, `odd` must have at least two elements, `next_elem` retains its previous value based on the condition, `gap` is the next element from `odd`, `ans` is increased by the previous `gap` value, and `y` is decreased by half of `gap` if `y` is not less than half of `gap`. If `y` is less than half of `gap`, then `ans` is increased by 0 and `y` is decreased by 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `even` is sorted in ascending order, `odd` must have at least two elements, `next_elem` retains its previous value based on the condition, `gap` is the next element from `odd`, `ans` is increased by the previous `gap` value, and `y` is decreased by half of `gap` if `y` is not less than half of `gap`. If `y` is less than half of `gap`, then `y` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. `ans` is increased by the previous `gap` value, `y` is decreased by `gap // 2`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
