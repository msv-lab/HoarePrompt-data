Output State: **`x` must be greater than 0; `next_elem` is `a[0] + n` if `i` equals `x - 1`, otherwise `next_elem` is `a[i + 1]`; `gap` is `next_elem - a[i] - 1`; `odd` is a list containing the value of `gap`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `gap` to the list `odd`. Since `gap` is initially greater than 1 and is an odd number, after executing the line `odd.append(gap)`, the list `odd` will contain this value of `gap`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
