Output State: **`tmp` contains an additional element which is `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`, `ans` is increased by `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`, `a` and `i` retain their original values.**

This means that the value of `ans` has been updated by adding `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` to its current value, while `tmp` now includes an additional element which is `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`. The lists `a` and the integer `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
