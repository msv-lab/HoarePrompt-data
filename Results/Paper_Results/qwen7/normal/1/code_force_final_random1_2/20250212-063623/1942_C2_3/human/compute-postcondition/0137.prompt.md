Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ans` is `x + y - 2`, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from input().split(), `x` is an input integer, `ii` is `tt`, `n` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `tmp` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(a)):
    if a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2:
        ans += 1
    elif (a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1:
        tmp.append((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2)
        ans += (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2
        y -= (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 1, `a` must have at least 2 elements, and the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is either 2 or even. If the difference is 2, `ans` remains 1. If the difference is even and `y` is greater than the difference divided by 2 minus 1, then `tmp` is a list containing the integer division of the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` by 2, `ans` is incremented by the integer division of the difference by 2, and `y` is decreased by the integer division of the difference by 2 minus 1. Otherwise, `tmp`, `ans`, and `y` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `a` must have at least 2 elements, the difference between `a[2]` and `a[1]` is either 2 or even. If the difference is 2, `ans` remains 2, `tmp` remains unchanged, and `y` remains unchanged. If the difference is even and `y` is greater than the integer division of the difference by 2 minus 1, then `tmp` is a list containing the integer division of the difference between `a[2]` and `a[1]` by 2, `ans` is incremented by the integer division of the difference by 2, and `y` is decreased by the integer division of the difference by 2 minus 1. Otherwise, `tmp`, `ans`, and `y` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 3, `a` must have at least 2 elements, the difference between `a[3]` and `a[2]` is either 2 or even, and `ans` is the previous value of `ans` minus 1 if the condition `a[3] - a[2] != 2` is true, otherwise `ans` remains 1. Additionally, if the condition is false, `tmp` is a list containing the value `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
