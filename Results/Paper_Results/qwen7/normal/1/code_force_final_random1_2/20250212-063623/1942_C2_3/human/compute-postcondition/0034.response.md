Postcondition: `ans` is the value of `ans` after the previous iteration, `a` is the list `a` with its original values, `i` is the value of `i` after the previous iteration incremented by 1. If `a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2`, then `ans` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0` and `y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, then `ans` is increased by `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`, `y` is decreased by `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, and a list `tmp` containing the value `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` is created. In all other cases, no changes are made to `ans`, `a`, `i`, or `y`.
