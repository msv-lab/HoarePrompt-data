Postcondition: **`even` is sorted in ascending order, `odd` must have at least one element, `next_elem` retains its previous value based on the condition, `gap` retains its previous value, and all other variables (`ans`, `y`, `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`) remain unchanged. The current value of `y` is less than half of `gap`.**
