Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `x` must be greater than 0, `i` will be equal to `x - 1`, `next_elem` will be `a[0] + n` if `i` equals `x - 1`, otherwise `next_elem` will be `a[i + 1]`. The variable `gap` will be calculated as `next_elem - a[i] - 1`. Depending on the value of `gap`, the `odd` list will include the value of `gap` if `gap` is greater than 1 and odd, and the `even` list will include the value of `gap` if `gap` is greater than 0 and even. If `gap` does not meet these conditions, the respective list will remain unchanged.

In summary, after all iterations of the loop, `x` will be greater than 0, `i` will be `x - 1`, and based on the calculations within the loop, the `odd` and `even` lists will contain the appropriate values of `gap` that satisfy the given conditions.
