Postcondition: `ans` is increased by the sum of all elements in the `odd` list plus 2 times the initial value of `y` (which is 0), and `ans` is further increased by `gap`. `y` is decreased by `gap // 2`, and `gap` is the next element in the `even` list. If `y` is less than `gap // 2`, `ans` is additionally increased by 2 times the initial value of `y` (which is 0) plus the sum of all elements in the `odd` list plus `gap`, and `y` is set to 0.
