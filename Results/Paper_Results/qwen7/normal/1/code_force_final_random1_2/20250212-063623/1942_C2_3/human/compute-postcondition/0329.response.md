Output State: **`even` is a non-empty iterable, `y` is an element of `even` and the current value of `y` is less than `gap` / 2, `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus 4 times the value of `y`.**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is incremented by `2 * y`, where `y` is an element of the iterable `even` and its value is less than `gap` / 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
