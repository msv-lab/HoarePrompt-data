Output State: **`ans` is equal to the original value of `ans` plus 1, `a` is a list of integers, `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` equals 2, `x` is an integer.**

The code `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. Since no other changes are made to the variables, the other conditions remain the same as the initial state, with `a` being a list of integers and `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` still equal to 2.
