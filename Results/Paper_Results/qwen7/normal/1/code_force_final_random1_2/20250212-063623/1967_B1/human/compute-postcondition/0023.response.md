Output State: **`count` is 3, `countmins` is 2, `g` is `int(n / 3) - 2`, `ans` is `ans + int((int(n / 3) - 2) / 3) + 1`**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is updated by adding `int(g / count) + 1` to its current value. Given that `g` is `int(n / 3) - 2`, the new value of `ans` becomes `ans + int((int(n / 3) - 2) / 3) + 1`. The values of `count` and `countmins` remain unchanged.
