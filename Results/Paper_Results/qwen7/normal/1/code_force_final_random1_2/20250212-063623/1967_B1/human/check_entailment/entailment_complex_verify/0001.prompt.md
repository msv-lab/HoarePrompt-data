You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        count = 2
        ans = n
        while count <= m:
            countmins = int(count - 1)
            g = int(n / count)
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += int(g / count) + 1
            count += 1
        print(int(ans))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6. It is also guaranteed that the sum of n and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^6.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        count = 2
        
        ans = n
        
        while count <= m:
            countmins = int(count - 1)
            g = int(n / count)
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += int(g / count) + 1
            count += 1
        
        print(int(ans))
        
    #State: `count` is `m + 1`, `countmins` is `m`, `g` is `0`, `ans` is the sum of `n` plus the series of increments calculated from all loop iterations, `i` is `t`, `m` is the final value of `m` from the last iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two positive integers \( n \) and \( m \). For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on \( n \) and the number of iterations up to \( m \). Specifically, it iteratively updates a running total starting from \( n \), adding a calculated increment in each iteration until the specified limit \( m \) is reached. The final printed value represents the sum of the initial \( n \) and all the increments calculated during the iterations.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - It initializes `count` to 2 and `ans` to `n`.

3. **Main Loop:**
   - The loop runs while `count` is less than or equal to `m`.
   - Inside the loop:
     - `countmins` is set to `count - 1`.
     - `g` is calculated as `int(n / count)`.
     - If `g` is less than `countmins`, the loop breaks.
     - Otherwise, `g` is adjusted by subtracting `countmins`.
     - `ans` is updated by adding `int(g / count) + 1` to itself.
     - `count` is incremented by 1.

4. **Output:**
   - After the loop, the result `ans` is printed.

### Correctness Check

To check the correctness, we need to verify if the logic inside the loop correctly counts the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` such that:
- \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
- \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Example Analysis

Let's manually check the example given in the problem statement for one of the test cases:

**Test Case:**
- \(n = 10\)
- \(m = 8\)

**Expected Output:**
- The expected output is 14.

**Manual Calculation:**
We need to find all pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \leq a \leq 10\)
- \(1 \leq b \leq 8\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Valid pairs are:
- \((1, 1)\): \(1 + 1 = 2\) and \(2\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(1, 1) = 1\).
- \((2, 1)\): \(2 + 1 = 3\) and \(3\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(2, 1) = 1\).
- \((2, 2)\): \(2 + 2 = 4\) and \(4\) is a multiple of \(2 \cdot \gcd(2, 2) = 2\).
- \((3, 1)\): \(3 + 1 = 4\) and \(4\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(3, 1) = 1\).
- \((4, 1)\): \(4 + 1 = 5\) and \(5\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(4, 1) = 1\).
- \((5, 1)\): \(5 + 1 = 6\) and \(6\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(5, 1) = 1\).
- \((6, 1)\): \(6 + 1 = 7\) and \(7\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(6, 1) = 1\).
- \((6, 2)\): \(6 + 2 = 8\) and \(8\) is a multiple of \(2 \cdot \gcd(6, 2) = 2\).
- \((6, 3)\): \(6 + 3 = 9\) and \(9\) is a multiple of \(3 \cdot \gcd(6, 3) = 3\).
- \((7, 1)\): \(7 + 1 = 8\) and \(8\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(7, 1) = 1\).
- \((8, 1)\): \(8 + 1 = 9\) and \(9\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(8, 1) = 1\).
- \((9, 1)\): \(9 + 1 = 10\) and \(10\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(9, 1) = 1\).
- \((10, 1)\): \(10 + 1 = 11\) and \(11\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(10, 1) = 1\).
- \((10, 2)\): \(10 + 2 = 12\) and \(12\) is a multiple of \(2 \cdot \gcd(10, 2) = 2\).

Counting these, we get 14 valid pairs.

### Conclusion

The given program does not correctly implement the logic to count the valid pairs. Specifically, the logic inside the loop does not accurately determine the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
