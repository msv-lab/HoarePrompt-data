Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop is defined as `for i in range(t)`.
   - The variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < t`.

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - From the given information, we know:
     - `count` is `m + 1`.
     - `countmins` is `m - 1`.
     - `g` is `int(n / (m + 1)) - m + 1`.
     - `ans` is the sum of `n` plus the series of increments calculated in each iteration.
     - `m` must be less than or equal to the value of `t`.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would be `t - 1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to `t`.

5. **Update the State:**
   - The only variable that changes in the loop head is `i`, which will be incremented to `t`.
   - The other variables (`count`, `countmins`, `g`, `ans`, and `m`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`count` is `m + 1`, `countmins` is `m - 1`, `g` is `int(n / (m + 1)) - m + 1`, `ans` is the sum of `n` plus the series of increments calculated in each iteration, `m` must be less than or equal to the value of `t`, and `i` is `t`**.
