Output State: **`count` is 3, `countmins` is 2, `g` is `int(n / 4) - 2`, `ans` is `n + int((int(n / 2) - 1) / 2) + 1`, `m` must be at least 4, and if `g` is less than `countmins`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The value of `g` is decremented by `countmins`, which is 2. So, `g` becomes `int(n / 4) - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
