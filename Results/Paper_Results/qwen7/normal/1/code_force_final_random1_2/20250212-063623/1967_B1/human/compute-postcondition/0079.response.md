Output State: **`count` is 2, `countmins` is `count - 1`, `g` is 0, `ans` is `n`, `m` must be greater than or equal to 2, `n` is an input integer, `i` is `t + 1**.

Explanation: The code `countmins = int(count - 1)` updates the value of `countmins` to be `count - 1`. Given that `count` is initially 2, `countmins` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
