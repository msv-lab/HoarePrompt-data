Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer obtained from the first input split, `m` is an integer obtained from the second input split.**

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `m`. The initial value of `t` remains unchanged, and now `n` and `m` are assigned the integer values from the input.
