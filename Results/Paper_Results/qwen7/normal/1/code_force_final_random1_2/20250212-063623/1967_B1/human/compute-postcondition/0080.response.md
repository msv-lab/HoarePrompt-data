Output State: **`count` is 2, `countmins` is 1, `g` is int(`n` / 2), `ans` is `n`, `m` must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `t + 1**.

Explanation: The value of `g` is updated to be the integer division of `n` by `count`, which is 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
