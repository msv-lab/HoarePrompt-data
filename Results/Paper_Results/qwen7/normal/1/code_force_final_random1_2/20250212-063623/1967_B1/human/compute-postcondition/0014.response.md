Output State: **`countmins` is 0, `count` is 2, `ans` is `n + int((int(n / 2) - 1) / 2) + 1`, `g` is `int(n / 2) - 1`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans` by adding `int(g / count) + 1` to its current value. Given the initial state, `g` is `int(n / 2) - 1`. So, `int(g / count) + 1` simplifies to `int((int(n / 2) - 1) / 2) + 1`. Since `count` is 2, `int((int(n / 2) - 1) / 2)` evaluates to `int(int(n / 2) / 2) - 1`, which is `int(n / 4) - 1`. Adding 1 to this gives `int(n / 4)`. Therefore, `ans` is updated to `n + int(n / 4)`. The values of `countmins` and `g` remain unchanged.
