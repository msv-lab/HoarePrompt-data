Output State: **`count` is 3, `countmins` is 2, `ans` is `n` + (int(`n` / 2) / 2) + 1, `m` must be greater than or equal to 4, `i` is `t + 1, `g` is now `n` // 3, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only exits the current loop or conditional block. All the variables retain their previous values from the initial state, and the only change is that we exit the loop or conditional block we were in.
