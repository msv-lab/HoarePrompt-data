Output State: **`count` is 4; `countmins` is 3; `g` is an integer value equal to `n // 4`**

Explanation: The variable `g` is assigned the value of `int(n / count)`, which means `g` is the integer division of `n` by `count`. Given that `count` is 4, `g` will be `int(n // 4)`. The values of `count` and `countmins` remain unchanged.
