Output State: **`count` is 2, `countmins` is `count - 1`, `g` is `int(n / (m + 1)) - m + 1`, `ans` is `n`, `m` must be at least 2, `i` is `t`**

Explanation: The code `countmins = int(count - 1)` updates the value of `countmins` to be `count - 1`. Given that `count` is initially 2, `countmins` becomes `2 - 1`, which is 1. All other variables (`g`, `ans`, `m`, `n`, `i`) remain unchanged.
