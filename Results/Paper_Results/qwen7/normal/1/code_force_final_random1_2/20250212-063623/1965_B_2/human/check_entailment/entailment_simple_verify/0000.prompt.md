You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

        #Explanation: The loop runs from `lk` to `l-1`. After `lk - 1` iterations (since the loop starts at `lk`), `i` will be `l - 1`. During each iteration, the loop appends `2 ** i` to `ans`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate a sequence `a` that satisfies the given conditions for all test cases. Specifically, the function `func_14()` attempts to generate a sequence, but it does not guarantee that no subsequence will sum to `k`. Additionally, it does not ensure that all integers from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) can be represented as a subsequence sum.

For example, consider the test case `n = 8` and `k = 8`. The generated sequence `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` does not meet the requirement because it does not include a subsequence that sums to 8. The only subsequences that sum to values less than 8 are `[2]`, `[3]`, `[4]`, `[5]`, and `[6]`, and there is no combination of these that sums to 8.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that the sequence includes numbers that can form all required sums from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) and avoid forming a subsequence that sums to `k`. The current implementation does not achieve this.
