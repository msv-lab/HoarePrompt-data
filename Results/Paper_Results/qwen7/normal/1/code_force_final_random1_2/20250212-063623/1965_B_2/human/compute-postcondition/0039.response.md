Output State: `i` is `l - 1`, `ans` is a list containing the values `[2, 4, 8, ..., 2^{l-1}, k - 2^{lk}, k + 1, 2 * k + 1]`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `l - 1`. The list `ans` will contain the initial elements `[2, 2, 4, 8, 16, ..., 2^{lk-1}, k - 2^{lk}, k + 1, 2 * k + 1]` followed by all the numbers generated inside the loop, which are `2^lk, 2^{lk+1}, ..., 2^{l-1}`.
