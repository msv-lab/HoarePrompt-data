Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variables `i` and `lk` and `l`. Specifically, the loop iterates over `i` starting from `lk` up to but not including `l`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is given as follows:
   - `i` is `lk`
   - `ans` contains the value 2

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `l`. After each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from `lk` and is incremented by 1 at each iteration, the new value of `i` will be `lk + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue executing, `i` must still be less than `l`. Therefore, `lk + 1` must be less than `l`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is `lk + 1`
- `ans` still contains the value 2 (since the loop body is omitted, `ans` does not change within the loop)

Therefore, the updated state is:

State: **`i` is `lk + 1`, `ans` contains the value 2**
