Output State: The loop will execute `func_10()` times, which returns the total number of test cases (t). For each test case, `func_14()` will be called, returning a list of two integers [n, k]. The loop will write the return value of `func_14()` to `sys.stdout` followed by a newline for each test case.

In natural language, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the output will consist of `t` lines, where each line contains the result of `func_14()` for each test case, formatted as `[n, k]`.
