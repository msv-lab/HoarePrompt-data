Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `lk` and `l`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from `lk` to `l`. This means the loop continues as long as `i < l`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `lk + 1`
   - `ans` is a list containing the value 4

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `i` starts from `lk + 1` and the loop increments `i` by 1 each time, the next value of `i` will be `lk + 2`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `l`. Therefore, `lk + 2` must be less than `l`, which implies `l > lk + 2`.
   - The variable `ans` remains unchanged since it is not involved in the loop condition.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be `lk + 2`.
   - `lk` and `l` remain the same as they are not modified within the loop.
   - `ans` remains a list containing the value 4.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is `lk + 2`, `ans` is a list containing the value 4**
