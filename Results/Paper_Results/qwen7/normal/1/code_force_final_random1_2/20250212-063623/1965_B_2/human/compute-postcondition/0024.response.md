Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(lk - 1)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `lk`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ans` contains the element 2.
   - These variables are not directly involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

3. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < lk - 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to the value it had in the last iteration, and `lk` remains unchanged.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was incremented in the previous iteration, let's assume `i` was `i-1` before the increment. Therefore, `i` will now be `i`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `lk - 1`. If `i` was `lk - 2` in the previous iteration, then `i` will be `lk - 1` now, and the condition `i < lk - 1` will no longer hold true.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `ans` still contains the element 2 (unchanged).
   - `i` will be `lk - 1` (since it was incremented from `lk - 2`).
   - `lk` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`ans` contains the element 2, `i` is `lk - 1`, `lk` must remain unchanged**
