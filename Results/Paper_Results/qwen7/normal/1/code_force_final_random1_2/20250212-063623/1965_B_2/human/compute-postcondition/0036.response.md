Output State: **`i` is `lk + 1`, `ans` is a list containing the value 4**.

Explanation: The code appends \(2^i\) to the list `ans`. Given that `i` is `lk + 1`, the value of \(2^i\) is \(2^{lk + 1}\), which simplifies to \(4 \times 2^{lk-1}\). Since the initial value of `ans` contains the value 2, after appending \(2^i\), `ans` will contain the value 4.
