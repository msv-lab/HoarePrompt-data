Reasoning:
1. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1()**: Reads an integer from standard input. This is likely used to read the number of test cases (`t`).
   - **func_2()**: Reads multiple integers from standard input, split by spaces. This is likely used to read pairs of integers (`n` and `k`) for each test case.
   - **func_3()**: Similar to `func_2()`, but returns a list instead of a map object.
   - **func_4()**: Calls `func_3()` multiple times and returns a list of results. This is likely used to read multiple test cases.
   - **func_5()**: Reads a line from standard input and returns it without modification. This function is not relevant to the problem.
   - **func_6()**: Reads a line from standard input, decodes it, and returns it. This function is not relevant to the problem.
   - **func_7()**: Reads a line of space-separated integers from standard input and returns them as a list. This is similar to `func_2()` and `func_3()`.
   - **func_8()**: Calls `func_7()` multiple times and returns a list of results. This is likely used to read multiple test cases.
   - **func_9()**: Reads input from the user. This function is not relevant to the problem.
   - **func_10()**: Reads an integer from standard input, which represents the number of test cases (`t`). This is similar to `func_1()`.
   - **func_11()**: Reads a line from standard input and returns it as a list of strings. This function is not relevant to the problem.
   - **func_12()**: A complex recursive function that is not directly related to solving the problem. It is not relevant to the problem.
   - **func_13()**: Implements the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. This function is not relevant to the problem.
   - **func_14()**: Generates a sequence of integers based on the values of `n` and `k`. This function appears to solve the main problem.
   - **func_15()**: Processes each test case by reading `n` and `k` and writing the result of `func_14()` to standard output. This function is responsible for the overall flow of the program.

2. **Problem Description**:
   - The problem requires generating a sequence of non-negative integers of size at most 25 such that:
     - No subsequence sums to `k`.
     - All integers from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) can be represented as a subsequence sum.

3. **Function `func_14()`**:
   - For `k = 1`: It generates a sequence `[2, 3, 4, 8, 16, 32]` for `n â‰¥ 2`.
   - For `k > 1`: It generates a sequence that ensures all integers from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) can be represented as a subsequence sum, while ensuring no subsequence sums to `k`.

4. **Function `func_15()`**:
   - It correctly processes each test case by reading `n` and `k` and writing the result of `func_14()` to standard output.

Given the analysis, the functions `func_14()` and `func_15()` together correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The remaining functions are either irrelevant or do not contribute to solving the main problem.

Correctness: **True**
