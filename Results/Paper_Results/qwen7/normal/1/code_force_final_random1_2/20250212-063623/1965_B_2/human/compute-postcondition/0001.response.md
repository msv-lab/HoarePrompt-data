Output State: **`func_14()` returns an integer, n and k retain their original values.**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.write(str(func_14()) + '\n')` writes the return value of `func_14()` to the standard output as a string. Since `func_14()` must return at least 1, the output will be an integer. However, the values of `n` and `k` are not affected by this line of code and retain their original values from the initial state.
