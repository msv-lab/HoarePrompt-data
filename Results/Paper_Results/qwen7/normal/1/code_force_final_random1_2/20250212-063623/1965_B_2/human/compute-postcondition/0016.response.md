Output State: `i` is 5; `l` is greater than 5; `ans` contains the values [4, 8, 16, 32].

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `i` is less than `l`. Given that the loop has executed 3 times, `i` is currently 4, and `l` must be greater than 4. Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time it runs, after the fourth iteration, `i` will be 5. The loop will continue until `i` is no longer less than `l`, which means `l` must be greater than 5. During each iteration, the loop appends `2 ** i` to `ans`, so after 4 iterations, `ans` will contain `[2 ** 2, 2 ** 3, 2 ** 4, 2 ** 5]`, which is `[4, 8, 16, 32]`.
