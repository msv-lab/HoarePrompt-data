Output State: **`ans` contains the elements `[2, 2, 4, 8, 16, ..., 2^{lk-1}]` and `ans.append(k - 1 - sum(ans))` is executed, resulting in the final element being `k - 1 - (2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 + ... + 2^{lk-1}) = k - 1 - (2^{lk} - 2) = k - 2^{lk}`.**

Explanation: The loop appends powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{lk-1}\) to the list `ans`. After the loop, the sum of the elements in `ans` is \(2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 + \ldots + 2^{lk-1} = 2^{lk} - 1\). The next line appends `k - 1 - sum(ans)` to `ans`, which simplifies to `k - 1 - (2^{lk} - 1) = k - 2^{lk}`. Therefore, the final list `ans` contains the elements `[2, 2, 4, 8, 16, ..., 2^{lk-1}, k - 2^{lk}]`.
