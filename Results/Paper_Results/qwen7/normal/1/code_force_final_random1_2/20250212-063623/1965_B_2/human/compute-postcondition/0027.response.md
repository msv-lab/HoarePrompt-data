Output State: **`ans` contains the elements [2, 2, 4], `i` is `lk - 1`**

Explanation: The code appends `2 ** i` to the list `ans`. Given that `i` is `lk - 1`, `2 ** i` becomes `2 ** (lk - 1)`, which is 4. Therefore, `ans` now contains `[2, 2, 4]`. The value of `i` remains `lk - 1`, and the condition that `lk` must be greater than `lk - 1` is still valid.
