You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

For the loop to complete its iterations, `l` must be greater than 4, and it has now reached 5. Each iteration of the loop appends `2 ** i` to `ans`, so after 3 iterations, `ans` contains [4, 8, 16].

However, since the loop stops just before `i` reaches `lk`, the last element `2^{lk-1}` is not included, making the sum \(2^{lk} - 2\).

        #
        #Explanation: The loop runs from `lk` to `l-1`. After `lk - 1` iterations (since the loop starts at `lk`), `i` will be `l - 1`. During each iteration, the loop appends `2 ** i` to `ans`. Therefore, `ans` will contain all powers of 2 from `2^lk` to `2^{l-1}` in addition to the initial elements `[k - 2^{lk}, k + 1, 2 * k + 1]`.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes no explicit parameters and returns a string. If the value of `k` is 1 and `n` is 2, it returns the string '1\n2'. Otherwise, it calculates a list of numbers based on the binary representations of `n` and `k`, and returns a string of these numbers separated by spaces.

For each test case, `func_14()` will be called, returning a list of two integers [n, k]. The loop will write the return value of `func_14()` to `sys.stdout` followed by a newline for each test case.
    #
    #In natural language, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the output will consist of `t` lines, where each line contains the result of `func_14()` for each test case, formatted as `[n, k]`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function outputs the results of calling `func_14()` for each test case specified by `func_10()`. Specifically, it writes the list `[n, k]` to standard output for each test case, where `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6` and `1 ≤ k ≤ n`. After all test cases have been processed, the output consists of `t` lines, each containing the values returned by `func_14()` for the corresponding test case.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to generate a sequence `a` of at most 25 non-negative integers.
   - The sequence should not have any subsequence summing to `k`.
   - For all values `v` from 1 to `n` where `v ≠ k`, there must exist a subsequence of `a` that sums to `v`.

2. **Given Functions:**
   - Most of the functions defined (`func_1` to `func_14`) are not used in the main logic of solving the problem.
   - Only `func_14` and `func_15` are relevant to the problem.

3. **Function `func_14`:**
   - This function takes `n` and `k` as inputs.
   - It converts `n` and `k` to binary representations.
   - Depending on whether `k` is 1 or not, it constructs the sequence `ans`:
     - If `k == 1`, it handles special cases.
     - Otherwise, it constructs `ans` by including powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `n` and ensuring certain conditions are met.

4. **Function `func_15`:**
   - This function reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_14` and writes the result to the standard output.

### Verification of Logic:

1. **Handling Special Cases:**
   - When `k == 1` and `n == 2`, the sequence `[2]` is returned, which satisfies the conditions.
   - For general `k > 1`, the sequence construction ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` and all other values from 1 to `n` are covered.

2. **Binary Representation and Powers of 2:**
   - Using binary representation helps in constructing the sequence efficiently.
   - Including powers of 2 ensures that all values from 1 to `n` can be formed as subsequences, except `k`.

3. **No Subsequence Summing to `k`:**
   - By carefully choosing the elements, the sequence avoids having any subsequence summing to `k`.

### Conclusion:

The logic in `func_14` correctly constructs the sequence based on the problem requirements. The function handles both special and general cases appropriately. Therefore, the given program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
