Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

    func_15()

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    return int(sys.stdin.buffer.readline())
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function reads an integer from standard input and returns it. This integer is expected to be part of the input provided by the user or another process through the standard input stream.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return map(int, sys.stdin.buffer.readline().split())
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function reads integers from the standard input, split by spaces, and returns a map object containing these integers.

 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, sys.stdin.buffer.readline().split()))
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function reads a line of input from standard input, splits it into individual integers based on spaces, and returns them as a list.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4(rows_number):
    return [func_3() for _ in range(rows_number)]
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function accepts an integer `rows_number` between 1 and 25, invokes `func_3()` exactly `rows_number` times, and returns a list containing the results of these invocations.

''' 

 Output hints for function5:  Functionality: The function reads a line from standard input, removes any trailing whitespace, and returns the resulting string.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6():
    return sys.stdin.buffer.readline().rstrip().decode()
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  The function `func_6()` accepts no parameters and reads a line of text from standard input. It decodes the bytes to a string, removes any trailing whitespace, and returns this processed string.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7():
    return [int(i) for i in input().split()]
''' 

 Output hints for function7:  The function reads a line of space-separated integers from the standard input, splits the line into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and returns a list of these integers.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_8(rows):
    return [func_7() for _ in range(rows)]
''' 

 Output hints for function8:  The function `func_8` accepts a positive integer `rows` (where 1 ≤ rows ≤ 25) and returns a list of length `rows`. Each element in the returned list is the result of calling the function `func_7()` one time.
Function number 9 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_9():
    return input()
''' 

 Output hints for function9:  The function does not accept any parameters and returns the input provided by the user.
Function number 10 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_10():
    return int(input())
''' 

 Output hints for function10:  The function reads an integer input representing the number of test cases (t) from the standard input. It then processes each test case separately based on the input values for n and k.
Function number 11 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_11():
    return input().split()
''' 

 Output hints for function11:  The function does not accept any parameters and returns a list of strings obtained by splitting a single input string provided by the user.
Function number 12 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_12(d, processing, da, rank):
    tmp = 10 ** 9
    if len(d[da]) == 1:
        return 1
    for di in d[da]:
        if processing[di - 1] == 0:
            processing[di - 1] = 1
            tmp = min(tmp, func_12(d, processing, di, rank))
            processing[di - 1] = 0
    rank[da - 1] = tmp + 1
    return tmp + 1
''' 

 Output hints for function12:  The function accepts a dictionary `d` where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, a list `processing` of zeros and ones with the same length as the maximum value in `d`'s keys plus one, an integer `da` representing a key in the dictionary `d`, and a list `rank` of integers with the same length as the maximum value in `d`'s keys plus one. It returns 1 if the length of `d[da]` is 1. Otherwise, it recursively updates `tmp` to the minimum value between its current value and the result of `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)` for every `di` in `d[da]`, sets `rank[da - 1]` to `tmp + 1`, and for each `di` in `d[da]`, sets `processing[di - 1]` to 0. The function ultimately returns `tmp + 1`.
Function number 13 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_13(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        x = 1
        y = 0
        return (x, y, a)
    (x, y, g) = func_13(b, a % b)
    return (y, x - a // b * y, g)
''' 

 Output hints for function13:  The function accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b`, where `b` is not zero. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, it returns `(1, 0, a)`. Otherwise, it recursively calculates values using the Euclidean algorithm and returns `(y, x - a // b * y, g)`.
Function number 14 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_14():
    (n, k) = func_7()
    b = bin(n)[2:]
    l = len(b)
    if k == 1:
        if n == 2:
            return '1\n2'
        ans = [2, 3]
        for i in range(2, l):
            ans.append(2 ** i)
    else:
        bk = bin(k)[2:]
        ans = []
        lk = len(bk)
        for i in range(lk - 1):
            ans.append(2 ** i)
        ans.append(k - 1 - sum(ans))

        ans.append(2 * k + 1)
        for i in range(lk, l):
            ans.append(2 ** i)
    return ' '.join(map(str, ans))
''' 

 Output hints for function14:  The function takes no explicit parameters and returns a string. If the value of `k` is 1 and `n` is 2, it returns the string '1\n2'. Otherwise, it calculates a list of numbers based on the binary representations of `n` and `k`, and returns a string of these numbers separated by spaces. The list can either be [4, 8, 16, 32] or a sequence of powers of 2 along with specific calculations involving `k`.
Function number 15 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_15():
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        sys.stdout.write(str(func_14()) + '\n')
''' 

 Output hints for function15:  The function outputs the results of calling `func_14()` for each test case specified by `func_10()`. Specifically, it writes the list `[n, k]` to standard output for each test case, where `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6` and `1 ≤ k ≤ n`. After all test cases have been processed, the output consists of `t` lines, each containing the values returned by `func_14()` for the corresponding test case.
