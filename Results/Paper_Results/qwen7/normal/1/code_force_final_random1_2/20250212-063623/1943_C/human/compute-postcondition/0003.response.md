Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 2000, `u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists, `u` is an integer from the input, `v` is an integer from the input.**

Explanation: The code `u, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to variables `u` and `v`. The values of `n` and `u2vs` remain unchanged from their initial state.
