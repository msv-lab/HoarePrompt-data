Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 2000, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each list contains pairs of integers representing bidirectional connections between nodes as specified by the input during each iteration of the loop.**

In more detail, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `u2vs` will be a list of `n` lists. Each list at index `i` (where `i` ranges from `0` to `n-1`) will contain a series of integers representing the nodes connected to node `i`. Since the loop processes each edge exactly once, each pair `(u, v)` added to `u2vs[u]` will also be added to `u2vs[v]`, indicating a bidirectional connection between nodes `u` and `v`. The exact contents of each list depend on the input provided during the loop's execution, but collectively, they form a complete representation of the graph described by the input edges.
