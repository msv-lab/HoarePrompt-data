Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ops` is an empty list, `d` is the result of calling `bfs(a)`, `previous` is the second return value of `bfs(a)`, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each list contains pairs of integers representing bidirectional connections between nodes as specified by the input during each iteration of the loop, `b` is the result of calling `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the elements `b` and a sequence of nodes leading from `b` back to `-1` through the `previous` array, until the condition `n == -1` is met, the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ci` is the integer value of half the length of `path_ba` (integer division), `c` is the element at index `ci` in `path_ba`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(ci + 1):
    ops.append((c, i))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ops` is a list containing one tuple `(c, 0)`, `d` is the result of calling `bfs(a)`, `previous` is the second return value of `bfs(a)`, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each list contains pairs of integers representing bidirectional connections between nodes, `b` is the result of calling `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the elements `b` and a sequence of nodes leading from `b` back to `-1` through the `previous` array, until the condition `n == -1` is met, the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ci` is at least 0, `i` is 0

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ops` is a list containing two tuples, the first being (c, 0) and the second being (c, 1); `d` is the result of calling `bfs(a)`, `previous` is the second return value of `bfs(a)`, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each list contains pairs of integers representing bidirectional connections between nodes, `b` is the result of calling `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the elements `b` and a sequence of nodes leading from `b` back to `-1` through the `previous` array, until the condition `n == -1` is met, the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ci` is at least 0, `i` is 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ops` is a list containing three tuples: the first being (c, 0), the second being (c, 1), and the third being (c, 3); `d` is the result of calling `bfs(a)`, `previous` is the second return value of `bfs(a)`, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each list contains pairs of integers representing bidirectional connections between nodes, `b` is the result of calling `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the elements `b` and a sequence of nodes leading from `b` back to `-1` through the `previous` array, until the condition `n == -1` is met, the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ci` is at least 0, `i` is 3.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
