Output State: `d` is the result of calling `bfs(a)`, `previous` is the second return value of `bfs(a)`, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each list contains pairs of integers representing bidirectional connections between nodes as specified by the input during each iteration of the loop, `b` is the result of calling `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the elements `b` and a sequence of nodes leading from `b` back to `-1` through the `previous` array, until the condition `n == -1` is met.

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `n` (which is assigned the value of `previous[path_ba[-1]]`) is not equal to `-1`. Each iteration appends the current value of `n` to `path_ba`. This process repeats until `n` becomes `-1`, indicating that we have reached the end of the path starting from `b`. At this point, the loop breaks, and `path_ba` contains the shortest path from `b` to the node that has no parent in the `previous` array, which is represented by `-1`.
