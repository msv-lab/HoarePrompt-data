Output State: **`ops` is a list containing one tuple `(c1, i)`, `d` is the result of calling `bfs(a)`, `previous` is the second return value of `bfs(a)`, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each list contains pairs of integers representing bidirectional connections between nodes, `b` is the result of calling `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the elements `b` and a sequence of nodes leading from `b` back to `-1` through the `previous` array, until the condition `n == -1` is met, and the length of `path_ba` is even, `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`, `c1` is `c2 - 1`, and the length of `path_ba` is at least 2.**

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(c1, i)` to the list `ops`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. `c1` is calculated as `c2 - 1`, where `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`. The length of `path_ba` is assumed to be at least 2, which means `c2` would be at least 1, making `c1` at least 0.
