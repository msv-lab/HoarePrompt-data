Output State: **`ops` is a list containing four tuples: (c1, i + 2), (c2, i + 2), (c1, i), and (c2, i); `d`, `previous`, `u2vs`, `b`, `path_ba`, `c2`, and `c1` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code appends a new tuple `(c2, i)` to the list `ops`. Initially, `ops` contains three tuples: `(c1, i + 2)`, `(c2, i + 2)`, and `(c1, i)`. After appending `(c2, i)`, `ops` now contains four tuples. The values of `d`, `previous`, `u2vs`, `b`, `path_ba`, `c2`, and `c1` remain unchanged.
