Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 2000, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, with one list at index `v-1` now containing the value `[v-1, u-1] and an additional element `u-1`, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `u, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `u` and `v`. It does not modify the existing lists in `u2vs`, but it introduces new variables `u` and `v` which are set to the values of the integers entered by the user. The range of `n` and the structure of `u2vs` remain unchanged.
