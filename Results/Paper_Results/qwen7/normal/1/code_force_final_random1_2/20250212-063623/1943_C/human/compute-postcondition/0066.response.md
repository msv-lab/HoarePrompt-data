Output State: **`ops` is a list containing three tuples, the first two tuples are `(c1, i + 2)` and `(c2, i + 2)`, and the third tuple is `(c1, i)`. The values of `d`, `previous`, `u2vs`, `b`, `path_ba`, `c2`, and `c1` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code appends a new tuple `(c1, i)` to the list `ops`. The values of `c1`, `i`, `d`, `previous`, `u2vs`, `b`, `path_ba`, `c2`, and `c1` remain the same as they were in the initial state. The list `ops` now contains one additional tuple.
