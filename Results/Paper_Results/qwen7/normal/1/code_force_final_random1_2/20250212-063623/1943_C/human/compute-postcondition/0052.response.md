Output State: **`ops` is a list containing two tuples, the first being (c, 0) and the second being (c, 1); `d` is the result of calling `bfs(a)`, `previous` is the second return value of `bfs(a)`, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each list contains pairs of integers representing bidirectional connections between nodes, `b` is the result of calling `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the elements `b` and a sequence of nodes leading from `b` back to `-1` through the `previous` array, until the condition `n == -1` is met, the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ci` is at least 0, `i` is 2.**

This output state reflects that the list `ops` has had a new tuple appended to it, changing its size from one to two. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions as described in the initial state.
