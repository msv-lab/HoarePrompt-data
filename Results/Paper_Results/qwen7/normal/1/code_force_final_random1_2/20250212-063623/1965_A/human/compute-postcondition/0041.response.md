Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `n` is the input integer, `l` is a map object created from the integers split from the input, `lis` is a list of unique sorted integers from `l` and has at least 2 elements, `test` is definitively False, and `j` is the total number of elements in `lis`. The if condition evaluates to False since `test` is False.**
