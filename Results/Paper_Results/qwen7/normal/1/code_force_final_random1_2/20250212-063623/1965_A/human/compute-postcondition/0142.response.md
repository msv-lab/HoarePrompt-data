Postcondition: `j` is equal to the length of `lis`, `test` is True, and the loop has either printed 'Bob' or 'Alice' based on the condition `lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1`. This holds regardless of whether the length of `lis` is odd or even, as both branches of the if-else statement maintain the same conditions.
