Postcondition: **`A` is True, `arr[0]` is 1, `set_` contains at least two elements including 1 and 2, `not_c` is False.**

This means that after the execution of the if-else block, `A` becomes True, `arr[0]` remains 1, `set_` still contains at least two elements including 1 and 2, and `not_c` remains False.
