Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), followed by an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5), and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). It returns information about the initial number of stones in each of the n piles for each test case.**

Note: The function does not explicitly define the return type or value in the given code snippet, so the description focuses on the input structure and expected processing.
