Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object of integers split from the input, `lis` is a list of unique sorted integers from `set(l)`, `test` is True.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, len(lis)):
    if lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1:
        if j % 2 == 1:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
        test = False
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `j` is 1, the length of `lis` is greater than 1, and the value of `test` is False. If the difference between the first two elements of `lis` is greater than 1, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change is made to `test` and `j`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `j` is 2, the length of `lis` is greater than 1, and the value of `test` remains False. If `lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `lis[j] - lis[j - 1] <= 1`, then `test` remains False and no action is taken regarding the break.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `j` is 3, the length of `lis` is greater than 1, and `test` remains False. If `lis[3] - lis[2] > 1`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `lis[3] - lis[2] <= 1`, then `test` remains False and no action is taken regarding `test` or `j`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
