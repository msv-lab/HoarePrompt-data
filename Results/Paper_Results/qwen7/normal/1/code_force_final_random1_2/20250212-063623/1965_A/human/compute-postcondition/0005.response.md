Output State: **`A` is False; arr[0] is 1; set_ is [1]**.

The code `set_.sort()` sorts the elements in the set `set_`. Since `set_` initially contains only one element, 1, sorting does not change its contents. Therefore, the set remains `[1]`. The variables `A` and `arr[0]` remain unchanged from their initial states.
