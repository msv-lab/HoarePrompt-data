Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop variable in the given for loop is `j`. The loop starts from 1 and goes up to but does not include `len(lis)`. 

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `j` is currently 1.
   - The length of `lis` is greater than 1.
   - The value of `test` is `False`.

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than the length of `lis`.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since `j` starts from 1 and the loop increments `j` by 1 with each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `j` will be 2 at the start of the next iteration.
   - The length of `lis` remains unchanged.
   - The value of `test` remains unchanged unless the condition inside the loop changes it.

5. **Condition Inside the Loop**:
   - The postcondition mentions that if the difference between the first two elements of `lis` is greater than 1, the loop will break. However, since we are only asked to adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, we assume the condition is not met yet (as per the current state).

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`j` is 2, the length of `lis` is greater than 1, and the value of `test` is False**.
