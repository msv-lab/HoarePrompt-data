Output State: **`j` is 2, the length of `lis` is greater than 1, and the value of `test` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `j`, `lis`, or `test`. It only indicates that the execution exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such block is specified in the given code, the values of the variables remain unchanged.
