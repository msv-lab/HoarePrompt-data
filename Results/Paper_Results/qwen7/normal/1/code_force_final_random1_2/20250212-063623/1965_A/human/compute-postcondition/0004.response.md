Output State: **`A` is False; arr[0] is 1; set_ is [1]** 

Explanation: The code `set_ = list(set(arr))` creates a set from the list `arr`, which contains only one element, 1. Since sets cannot contain duplicate elements, the set will only include the unique elements from `arr`. After converting the set back to a list, `set_` will be `[1]`. The values of `A` and `arr[0]` remain unchanged.
