Output State: **`j` is 2, the length of `lis` is greater than 1, and the value of `test` is False.**

Explanation: The code simply reassigns the variable `test` to `False`, which was already its value in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `j` and `lis` remain unchanged, and `test` stays `False`.
