Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object of integers split from the input, `lis` is a list of unique sorted integers from `set(l)`, `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`**.

In this case, the code snippet simply assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `n`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
