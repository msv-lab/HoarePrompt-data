Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `len(set_)`.

2. **Determine the initial state of the loop head variables**:
   - `i` starts from 1 (as specified in the `range(1, len(set_))`).
   - `len(set_)` determines the upper limit of the loop.

3. **Check the current state**:
   - `A` is False.
   - `arr[0]` is 1.
   - `set_` is [1].
   - `not_c` is True.

4. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1, we need to ensure that `i` is 1 initially.
   - We need to check if `len(set_)` is greater than 1 because the loop runs as long as `i` is less than `len(set_)`.

Given these points, let's formulate the required state adjustments:

- `i` should be set to 1.
- `len(set_)` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

**State: **`A` is False, `arr[0]` is 1, `set_` is [1], `not_c` is True, `i` is 1, `len(set_)` must be greater than 1**
