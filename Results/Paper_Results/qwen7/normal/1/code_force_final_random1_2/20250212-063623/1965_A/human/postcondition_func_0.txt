The function accepts a list of integers `arr` representing the number of stones in each pile. It first checks if the first element of `arr` is not 1, in which case it returns 'Alice'. Otherwise, it creates a sorted list of unique elements from `arr`, then iterates through this list to check if any two consecutive elements have a difference greater than 1. If such a pair is found, it sets `not_c` to False and breaks out of the loop. The boolean variable `A` is toggled in each iteration. Finally, it returns 'Alice' if `A` is True, otherwise it returns 'Bob'. In all cases, the function returns either 'Alice' or 'Bob'.
