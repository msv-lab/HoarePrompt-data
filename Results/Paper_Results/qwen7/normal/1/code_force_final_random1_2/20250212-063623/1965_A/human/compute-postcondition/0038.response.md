Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object created from the integers split from the input, `lis` is a list of unique sorted integers from `l` and must have at least 2 elements, `test` remains False, and `j` is 3. If `lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
