Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads an integer t indicating the number of test cases, then reads an integer n and a list of n integers representing the number of stones in each of the n piles. It sorts and removes duplicates from the list of stones, checks specific conditions related to the presence of the integer 1 and the gaps between consecutive elements in the sorted list. Based on these conditions, it determines and prints whether Alice or Bob wins the game. The function does not return any value but prints the winner for each test case.**
