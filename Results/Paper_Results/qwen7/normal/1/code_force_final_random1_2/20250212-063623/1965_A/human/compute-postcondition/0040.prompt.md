Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object created from the integers split from the input, `lis` is a list of unique sorted integers from `l`, the number 1 is in `lis`, and the length of `lis` is greater than 1, `test` is True.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, len(lis)):
    if lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1:
        if j % 2 == 1:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
        test = False
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object created from the integers split from the input, `lis` is a list of unique sorted integers from `l` and must have at least 2 elements, `test` is False, `j` is 1, and if `lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1`, then `test` is set to False and the most internal loop or if statement is broken; otherwise, `test` remains True.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object created from the integers split from the input, `lis` is a list of unique sorted integers from `l` and must have at least 2 elements, `test` is still False, and `j` is 2. If `lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs to the variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object created from the integers split from the input, `lis` is a list of unique sorted integers from `l` and must have at least 2 elements, `test` remains False, and `j` is 3. If `lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
