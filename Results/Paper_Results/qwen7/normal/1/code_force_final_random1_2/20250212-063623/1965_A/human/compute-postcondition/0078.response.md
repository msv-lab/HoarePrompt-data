Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variable `j` and the list `lis`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `j = 1` to `j < len(lis)`. 

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `j` is 2
   - The length of `lis` is greater than 1
   - `test` remains False
   - If `lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1`, the loop breaks.
   - If `lis[j] - lis[j - 1] <= 1`, `test` remains False and no action is taken regarding the break.

4. **Determine the Next Value of `j`**:
   - Since `j` starts at 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `j` would be `2 + 1 = 3`.
   - We need to check if `j` is still within the bounds of the list `lis`. Given that the length of `lis` is greater than 1, `j = 3` is valid as long as `len(lis) > 3`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `j` will be incremented to 3.
   - The length of `lis` remains the same (greater than 1).
   - `test` remains False unless the condition `lis[3] - lis[2] > 1` is met, but since we don't know the values of `lis[3]` and `lis[2]`, we assume it does not break the loop.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

State: **`j` is 3, the length of `lis` is greater than 1, and `test` remains False**.
