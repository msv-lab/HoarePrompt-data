Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `num != 0`.
2. **Current State**: 
   - `a` is `num % 10`.
   - `num` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq \text{num} \leq 20000\).
   - `num` is reduced by a factor of 10 after each iteration.

3. **Determine the Next Iteration Condition**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `num` must not be zero at the start of the next iteration.
   - Since `num` is reduced by a factor of 10 each iteration, the only way `num` can become zero is if it reaches 0 exactly at the current iteration or was already 0 before this iteration started.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Given that `num` is reduced by a factor of 10 each iteration, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `num` itself.
   - To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `num` must be a positive integer (not zero) at the start of the next iteration.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `num` to ensure it is a positive integer (not zero).

**Final Answer**:
State: **`a` is `num % 10`, `num` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq \text{num} \leq 20000\) and `num` must be a positive integer (not zero)**.
