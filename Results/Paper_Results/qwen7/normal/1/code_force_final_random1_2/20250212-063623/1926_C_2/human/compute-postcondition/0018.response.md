Output State: **`pd[i]` is increased by the value of `int(j)`, `i` is the string `i` without its last character, `j` is the next character in the string representation of the new `i`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `pd[i]` by adding the integer value of `j`. After this operation, `i` becomes the string `i` without its last character, and `j` becomes the next character in the string representation of the new `i`. The initial conditions remain true for the other variables.
