Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Identify the Loop Condition:**
   The loop condition is `num != 0`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `a` is `2 * (num // 10) % 10`
   - `num` is now `num // 10`

3. **Determine the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The only variable in the loop head is `num`.

4. **Check the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   For the loop to execute one more time, `num` must not be equal to 0. Since `num` is updated to `num // 10` at the end of each iteration, we need to ensure that `num` is still not zero.

5. **Adjust the State:**
   - We need to ensure that `num` is not zero for the next iteration. Therefore, `num` should be adjusted to a non-zero value.

### Final Answer

State: **`a` is `2 * (num // 10) % 10`, `num` must be non-zero**
