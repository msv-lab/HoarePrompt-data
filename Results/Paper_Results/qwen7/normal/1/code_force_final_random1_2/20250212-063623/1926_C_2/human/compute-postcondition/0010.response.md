Output State: `a` is the sum of all digits of the original `num`, and `num` is 0.

Explanation: After the loop runs as long as `num` is not zero, all the digits of `num` are added to `a` one by one. Once `num` becomes 0 (i.e., there are no more digits left to process), the loop terminates. At this point, `a` contains the sum of all digits of the original `num`, and `num` itself is reduced to 0.
