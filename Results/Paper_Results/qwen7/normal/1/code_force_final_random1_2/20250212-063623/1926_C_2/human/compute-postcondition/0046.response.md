Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5). It initializes an array pd with a size of 400001 and precomputes the sum of digits for all numbers from 1 to 400000. For each test case, it reads the value of n and prints the precomputed sum of digits for the number n from the array pd. The function does not return any value but updates and uses the pd array to provide the required sums for each test case.**
