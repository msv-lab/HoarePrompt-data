Reasoning:
1. The provided code initializes two variables `A` and `sum` but does not use them correctly. Instead of precomputing the sums for all numbers up to 200,000, which would be highly inefficient, the code should compute the required sum directly for each test case.
2. The function `func_1` correctly computes the sum of the digits of a given number.
3. The main part of the program should read the number of test cases and then for each test case, compute the sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to `n` and print the result.
4. The current implementation stores the cumulative sum in `A` and then uses this array to get the result for each test case, which is unnecessary and inefficient.

Given these points, the current implementation is incorrect due to the inefficiency and unnecessary storage.

Correctness: **False**
