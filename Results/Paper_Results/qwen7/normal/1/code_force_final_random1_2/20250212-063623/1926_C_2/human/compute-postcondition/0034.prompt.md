Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer, `N` is 400001, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `pd` is a list of 400001 elements, each initialized to 0
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, N):
    pd[i] += pd[i - 1]
    for j in str(i):
        pd[i] += int(j)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `i` is "400000"; `pd['400000']` is increased by the integer value of each digit in `i`.

Explanation: The loop iterates over each digit in the current value of `i` and adds the integer value of that digit to `pd[i]`. Starting from `i = 1`, the loop continues until `i` reaches "400000". For each iteration, `i` is incremented by one, and its digits are processed to update the corresponding `pd` values. Therefore, after all iterations, `i` will be "400000", and `pd['400000']` will hold the sum of the integer values of all digits from 1 to 400000.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `pd['400001']` is reduced to `pd['400000']`, `pd['400000']` is further reduced to the sum of its digits, and this process continues until `i` becomes a single-digit number.

To explain this output state in natural language: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will eventually become a single-digit number because the loop continuously removes the last digit from `i` and updates `pd[i]` with the sum of the digits of the current `i`. The final state of `pd['400001']` will be the sum of all digits of the original `i` (4 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 5), and `pd['400000']` will be the sum of the remaining digits after the last iteration. This process continues until `i` is reduced to a single digit.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `pd['400001']` is the sum of digits of `pd['400000']`, `pd['400000']` is the sum of its digits, `i` is 400005, `pd[400004]` is `pd[400003] + 4`, `pd[400005]` is the sum of digits of `pd[400004]`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations (assuming it continues until `i` reaches or exceeds `N`), the value of `i` will be the next integer after the last iteration, which is 400005. The value of `pd[400004]` remains as it was updated in the previous iteration, which is `pd[400003] + 4`. Now, `pd[400005]` will be the sum of the digits of `pd[400004]`, following the pattern established by the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
