Output State: `a` is the sum of all digits of the initial `num`, `num` is 0.

Explanation: After the loop executes all iterations, `num` will eventually become 0 because the loop continues to divide `num` by 10 until it reaches 0. During each iteration, the last digit of `num` is added to `a`. Therefore, by the end of the loop, `a` contains the sum of all the digits of the original `num`.
