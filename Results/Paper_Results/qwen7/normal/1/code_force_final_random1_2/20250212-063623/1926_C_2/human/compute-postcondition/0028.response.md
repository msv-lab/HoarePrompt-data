Output State: **`pd['400001']` is the sum of digits of `pd['400000']`, `pd['400000']` is the sum of its digits, `i` is 400004, `pd[400004]` is `pd[400003] + 4`, `pd[i]` is `pd[i] + int(j)`**.

In this case, the code `pd[i] += int(j)` updates the value of `pd[i]` by adding the integer value of `j` to it. However, since the value of `j` is not specified, we can only say that `pd[i]` is now `pd[i] + int(j)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
