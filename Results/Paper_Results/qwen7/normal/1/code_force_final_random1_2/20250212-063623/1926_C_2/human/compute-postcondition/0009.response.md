Output State: **`a` is `a + num % 10`, `num` is a non-zero value divided by 10.**

Explanation: The code divides `num` by 10 and converts the result to an integer, effectively removing the last digit of `num`. The value of `a` remains unchanged from its initial state, which is defined as `a + num % 10`. The variable `num` is updated to its new value after being divided by 10 and rounded down to the nearest integer.
