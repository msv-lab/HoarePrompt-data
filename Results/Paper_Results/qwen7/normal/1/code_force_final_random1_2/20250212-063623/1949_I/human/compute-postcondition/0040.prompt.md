Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `bipartite` is True, `i` is equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, each element in the lists `x`, `y`, and `r` up to index `n-1` is an integer entered by the user, and the lists `x`, `y`, and `r` have length `n`, `visited` remains unchanged and is still filled with `False`, `coef` remains unchanged and is still filled with `None`; `tot` is 0, `ok` is False.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if not visited[i]:
        coef[i] = 1
        tot = 0
        bipartite = True
        dfs(i)
        ok = ok or bipartite and tot != 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `bipartite` is True, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, each element in the lists `x`, `y`, and `r` up to index `n-1` is an integer entered by the user, and the lists `x`, `y`, and `r` have length `n`, `visited` remains unchanged and is still filled with `False`, `coef[0]` is 1, `tot` is 0, `ok` is True if `bipartite` is True and `tot` is not 0, otherwise `ok` is False.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is updated to 2, `bipartite` remains unchanged, `coef[2]` is set to 1, `tot` is 0, `ok` remains unchanged. If `visited[i]` is False, `bipartite` is True. Otherwise, the conditions remain as they were before the if-else block.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `coef[3]` is 1, `tot` is 0, `bipartite` is True, `ok` is True, and if `visited[3]` is False, then `visited[3]` remains unchanged; otherwise, no changes to the other variables.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
