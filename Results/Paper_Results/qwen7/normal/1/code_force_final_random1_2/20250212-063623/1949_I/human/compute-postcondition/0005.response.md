Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `x` is a list of length `n` filled with `None`, `y` is a list of length `n` filled with `None`, `r` is a list of length `n` filled with `None`, `visited` is a list of length `n` filled with `False`, and `coef` is a list of length `n` filled with `None`.**

Explanation: The code initializes `coef` as a list of length `n` filled with `None`. This changes the value of `coef` but does not affect the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, `r`, or `visited`. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `coef` and retains the unchanged values of the other variables.
