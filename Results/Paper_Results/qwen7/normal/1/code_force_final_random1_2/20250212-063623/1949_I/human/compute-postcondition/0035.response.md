Output State: **`i` is 3; `n` must be greater than 3; `coef[3]` is 1; `tot` is 0; `bipartite` is True**

The variable `bipartite` is assigned the value `True`. This assignment does not affect the values of the other variables (`i`, `n`, `coef[3]`, and `tot`). Therefore, their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
