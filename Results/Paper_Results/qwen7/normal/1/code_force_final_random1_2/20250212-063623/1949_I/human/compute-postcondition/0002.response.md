Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `x` is a list of length `n` filled with `None`, `y` is a list of length `n` filled with `None`, `r`, `visited`, and `coef` retain their original values.**

Explanation: The code initializes a new list `y` of length `n` filled with `None`. The length of `x` remains `n` and it is still filled with `None`. The variables `r`, `visited`, and `coef` remain unchanged from their original values.
