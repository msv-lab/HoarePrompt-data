Output State: **`bipartite` is True, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, each element in the lists `x`, `y`, and `r` up to index `n-1` is an integer entered by the user, and the lists `x`, `y`, and `r` have length `n`, `visited` remains unchanged and is still filled with `False`, `coef[0]` is 1, `tot` is 0, `ok` is True if `bipartite` is True and `tot` is not 0, otherwise `ok` is False.**

Explanation: The variable `ok` is updated to be `ok or bipartite and tot != 0`. Given the initial state, `bipartite` is `True` and `tot` is `0`, so `ok` remains `False` because `0 != 0` is `False`. Therefore, `ok` is only set to `True` if `tot` is not `0`, which is not the case here.
