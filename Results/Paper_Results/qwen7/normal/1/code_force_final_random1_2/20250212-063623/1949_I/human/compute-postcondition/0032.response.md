The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we can only adjust these two variables.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is updated to 2, and `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to continue executing. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3. Since the condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than `n`, `n` must still be greater than 3.

The other variables (`bipartite`, `coef[2]`, `tot`, and `ok`) are not part of the loop head and their values do not change based on the loop head's conditions. The value of `visited[i]` is not specified, but since the loop continues as long as `visited[i]` is False and `bipartite` is True, we do not need to change these variables unless explicitly stated otherwise.

State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3**
