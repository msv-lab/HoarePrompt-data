Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `coef[3]` is 1, `tot` is 0, `bipartite` is True, `ok` is True**

Explanation: The variable `ok` is updated to `ok or bipartite and tot != 0`. Given that `bipartite` is `True` and `tot` is `0`, the condition `bipartite and tot != 0` evaluates to `False` because `tot` is not unequal to `0`. However, since `ok` is initially not specified, and given the logical OR operation, `ok` will be set to `True` regardless of its original value. All other variables remain unchanged.
