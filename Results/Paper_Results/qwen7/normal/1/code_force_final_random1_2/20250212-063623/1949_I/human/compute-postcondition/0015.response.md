Output State: **`bipartite` is True, `i` is equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, each element in the lists `x`, `y`, and `r` up to index `n-1` is an integer entered by the user, and the lists `x`, `y`, and `r` have length `n`, while all other variables (`visited` and `coef`) remain unchanged and are still filled with `False` and `None`, respectively; `tot` is 0.**

Explanation: The variable `bipartite` is assigned the value `True`. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef`, and `tot`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
