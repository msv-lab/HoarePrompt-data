Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is defined as `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.

3. **Understand the condition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration, making `i` equal to 1.
   - `n` must still be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0**
