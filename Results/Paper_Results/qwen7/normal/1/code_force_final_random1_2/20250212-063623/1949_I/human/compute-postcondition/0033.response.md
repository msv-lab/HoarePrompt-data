Output State: **`i` is 3; `n` must be greater than 3; `coef[3]` is 1**

Explanation: The code `coef[i] = 1` assigns the value 1 to the element in the list `coef` at index `i`. Given that `i` is initially 3, the value of `coef[3]` is set to 1. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and the condition that `n` must be greater than 3 is still valid.
