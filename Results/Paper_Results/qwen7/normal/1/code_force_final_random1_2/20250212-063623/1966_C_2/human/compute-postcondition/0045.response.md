Output State: **`tc` is greater than 0 and equals to its initial value minus 1, `n` remains at least 1, `i` is equal to the length of the list `arr`, `dp` is `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp`.**

Explanation: 
- `tc` is decremented by 1, so it is now `tc - 1`, which is still greater than 0 since it was initially greater than 0.
- `n` remains unchanged and is still at least 1.
- `i` remains unchanged and is still equal to the length of the list `arr`.
- `dp` remains unchanged and is still set to `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp`.
