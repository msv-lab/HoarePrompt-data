Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to `n`.
   - `n` is given as `len(arr) - 1`.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n`. This means `i` should start from 1 and go up to `n` (inclusive).

4. **Check the initial value of `i`**:
   - Initially, `i` is set to `n`, which is `len(arr) - 1`.
   - For the loop to start executing, `i` must be at least 1.

5. **Check the value of `n`**:
   - `n` is `len(arr) - 1`, which is valid as long as `arr` is a non-empty list.

6. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is initially set to `n` (which is `len(arr) - 1`), and `i` must start from 1 for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `i` is at least 1.
   - `n` is already correctly set to `len(arr) - 1`.

Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `i` is at least 1.

**Final State**:
State: **`tc` must be greater than 0, `n` is `len(arr) - 1`, `arr` is a list of unique, sorted integers in descending order followed by 0, `dp` is `True`, `i` is at least 1**
