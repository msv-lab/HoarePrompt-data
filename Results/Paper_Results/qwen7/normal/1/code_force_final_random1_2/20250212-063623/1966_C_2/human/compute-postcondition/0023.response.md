Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, n):`. The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `tc` must be greater than 0.
   - `n` is `len(arr) - 1`.
   - `arr` is a list of unique, sorted integers in descending order followed by 0.
   - `dp` is `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp`.
   - `i` is at least 1.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is at least 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `i + 1`.
   - Since `n` does not change within the loop, `n` remains the same.
   - `tc`, `arr`, and `dp` are not directly affected by the loop itself and thus remain unchanged.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `tc` must still be greater than 0.
   - `n` remains the same, which is `len(arr) - 1`.
   - `arr` remains the same, being a list of unique, sorted integers in descending order followed by 0.
   - `dp` remains the same, being `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp`.
   - `i` is now `i + 1`, which means `i` is at least 2 (since it was at least 1 before).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`tc` must be greater than 0, `n` is `len(arr) - 1`, `arr` is a list of unique, sorted integers in descending order followed by 0, `dp` is `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp`, `i` is at least 2**
