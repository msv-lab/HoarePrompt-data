Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tc` is an input integer, and all other variables are undefined.
Code of the loop:
while tc > 0:
    n = int(input())
    arr = sorted(list(set([int(x) for x in input().split(' ')])), reverse=True
        ) + [0]
    dp = True
    n = len(arr) - 1
    for i in range(1, n):
        dp = arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp
    print('Alice' if dp else 'Bob')
    tc -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `tc` is greater than 0 minus 1, `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1, `arr` is a list containing unique, sorted integers in descending order followed by 0, `dp` is the result of `arr[n-1] - arr[n] > 1 or not dp`, `i` is equal to `n`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `tc` is `tc - 1`, `n` is `len(arr) - 1`, `arr` is a list of unique, sorted integers in descending order followed by 0, `dp` is `arr[n-1] - arr[n] > 1 or not dp`, `i` is `n`
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `tc` is greater than 0 and equals to its initial value minus 1, `n` remains at least 1, `i` is equal to the length of the list `arr`, `dp` is `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
