Output State: **`tc` must be greater than 0, `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1, `arr` is a list containing unique, sorted (in descending order) integers from the input followed by 0, `dp` is set to True.**

Explanation: The code `n = len(arr) - 1` calculates the length of the list `arr` and subtracts 1 from it, storing the result in the variable `n`. The value of `tc`, `arr`, and `dp` remains unchanged from their initial state.
