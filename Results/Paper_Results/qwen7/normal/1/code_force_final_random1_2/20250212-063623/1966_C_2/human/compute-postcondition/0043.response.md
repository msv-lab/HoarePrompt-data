Output State: `tc` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 1, `i` is equal to `len(arr)`, `dp` is `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp`.

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `tc` remains greater than 0, `n` remains at least 1, and `i` will be equal to the length of the list `arr`. The variable `dp` will be set to `True` if the difference between the last two elements of the list (considering the list ends with 0) is greater than 1, or it will be the negation of its previous value if the difference is not greater than 1.
