Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Description:**
   - `tc` is greater than 0.
   - `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1.
   - `arr` is a list of unique, sorted integers in descending order followed by 0.
   - `dp` is the result of the expression `arr[n-1] - arr[n] > 1 or not dp`.
   - `i` is equal to `n`.

2. **Expression Analysis:**
   - Since `arr` is a list of unique, sorted integers in descending order followed by 0, let's denote the last two elements of `arr` as `arr[n-1]` and `arr[n]`.
   - Given that `arr` ends with 0, `arr[n]` is 0.
   - Therefore, `arr[n-1] - arr[n]` simplifies to `arr[n-1] - 0 = arr[n-1]`.
   - The expression `arr[n-1] - arr[n] > 1` becomes `arr[n-1] > 1`.

3. **Determining `dp`:**
   - If `arr[n-1] > 1`, then `arr[n-1] - arr[n] > 1` is true.
   - If `arr[n-1] <= 1`, then `arr[n-1] - arr[n] > 1` is false.
   - The final value of `dp` will be `True` if `arr[n-1] > 1` or `False` otherwise.

4. **Print Statement Execution:**
   - The print statement is `print('Alice' if dp else 'Bob')`.
   - This will print `'Alice'` if `dp` is `True`, and `'Bob'` if `dp` is `False`.

Given the initial conditions and the nature of `arr`, the value of `arr[n-1]` will always be the second-to-last element of the list, which is a non-zero integer since `arr` contains unique, sorted integers in descending order followed by 0. Therefore, `arr[n-1]` will always be greater than 1.

Thus, `dp` will be `True`.

Output: **Alice**
