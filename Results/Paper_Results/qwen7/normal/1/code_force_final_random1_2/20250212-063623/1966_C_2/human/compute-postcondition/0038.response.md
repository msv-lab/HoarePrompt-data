Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `tc` must be greater than 0
   - `n` must be at least 1
   - `i` is `n-1`
   - `dp` is `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp`

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(1, n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop starts with `i = 1` and increments `i` by 1 each iteration until `i < n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `n-1`.

4. **Adjusting the States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `i` was `n-1` at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` would be `n` (since the loop increments `i` by 1).
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`. Therefore, `i` should be set to `n` and the condition `i < n` must hold true.

5. **Other Variables:**
   - `tc` and `n` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.
   - `dp` is dependent on the values of `arr[i]` and `arr[i + 1]`, but since `i` changes, `dp` will be recalculated based on the new value of `i`.

6. **Final States for the Next Iteration:**
   - `tc` must be greater than 0
   - `n` must be at least 1
   - `i` is now `n`
   - `dp` will be recalculated based on the new value of `i`

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`tc` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 1, `i` is `n`, `dp` will be recalculated based on the new value of `i`**
