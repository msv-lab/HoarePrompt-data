Output State: **`tc` is `tc - 1`, `n` is `len(arr) - 1`, `arr` is a list of unique, sorted integers in descending order followed by 0, `dp` is `arr[n-1] - arr[n] > 1 or not dp`, `i` is `n`**.

Explanation: The code `tc -= 1` decrements the value of `tc` by 1. All other variables (`n`, `arr`, `dp`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial or previous states. Therefore, the output state reflects this change in `tc` while keeping the other variables as they were before the code execution.
