Output State: `tc` is less than or equal to 0, `n` is 0, `arr` is a list of unique, sorted integers in descending order followed by 0, `dp` is `arr[n-1] - arr[n] > 1 or not dp`, `i` is equal to the length of the list `arr`.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `tc` will be less than or equal to 0 because it is decremented by 1 in each iteration. The variable `n` will be 0 since it is set to `len(arr) - 1` and `arr` always has at least one element (the 0 appended at the end). The variable `dp` will be the final value determined by the last iteration's condition. The variable `i` will be equal to the length of the list `arr` because the loop runs from 1 to `n` (exclusive), and once the loop completes, `i` will effectively be `n + 1`, which is the length of the list.
