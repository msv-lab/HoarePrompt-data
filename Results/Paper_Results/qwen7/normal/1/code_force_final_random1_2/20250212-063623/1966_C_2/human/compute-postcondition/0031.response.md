Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- The loop condition is `while tc > 0`.
- At the end of the previous iteration:
  - `tc` is `tc - 1`
  - `n` is `len(arr) - 1`
  - `arr` is a list of unique, sorted integers in descending order followed by 0.
  - `dp` is `arr[n-1] - arr[n] > 1 or not dp`
  - `i` is `n`

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `tc > 0`.
2. **Variables in the Loop Head**:
   - `tc`: This is the only variable in the loop head that directly controls the loop continuation.

### Adjusting the States:
- Since `tc` is the only variable in the loop head, we need to ensure that `tc` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute one more time.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `tc` is `tc - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to continue, `tc` must be greater than 0.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state such that `tc` is greater than 0.

### Final Answer:
State: **`tc` must be greater than 0, `n` is `len(arr) - 1`, `arr` is a list of unique, sorted integers in descending order followed by 0, `dp` is `arr[n-1] - arr[n] > 1 or not dp`, `i` is `n`**
