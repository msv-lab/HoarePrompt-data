Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `i < len(a)` and `a[i] == b[i]`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `b` is a list of integers created from the input string.
   - `new` is a list of length `len(a)` with `new[0]` being `max(a[0], b[0])` and the rest of the elements being `None`.
   - `new2` is a list of length `len(a)` with `new2[0]` being `min(a[0], b[0])` and the rest of the elements being `None`.

3. **Determine which states need adjustment**:
   - The loop condition involves two parts: `i < len(a)` and `a[i] == b[i]`.
   - Since `i` is currently 1, we need to check if `a[1] == b[1]` to determine if the loop can continue.
   - To ensure the loop can execute one more time, both conditions must be satisfied.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - We need to ensure `i < len(a)`. Since `i` is 1, we need to make sure `i` can be incremented to 2 (or higher) without violating the loop condition.
   - We also need to ensure `a[1] == b[1]` for the loop to continue.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and the values of `a[1]` and `b[1]`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` must be 1 and `a[1]` must be equal to `b[1]`**
