Output State: **`i` is equal to `len(a)`, `b` is a list of integers created from the input string, `new` is a list of length `len(a)` where each element is either `max(a[j], b[j])` if `a[j] == b[j]` or `None` otherwise, with the last element being `min(a[i], b[i])`, `new2` is a list of length `len(a)` where each element is either `min(a[j], b[j])` if `a[j] == b[j]` or `None` otherwise, with the last element being `min(a[i], b[i])`, and `new2[i]` is equal to `max(a[i], b[i])`, and `a` is updated to a list of integers created from the input string, and `input_value` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, list(input())))` reads an input string, converts it into a list of characters, and then maps each character to its corresponding integer value, updating the list `a` to contain these integer values. The other variables (`b`, `new`, `new2`, `i`, and `input_value`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
