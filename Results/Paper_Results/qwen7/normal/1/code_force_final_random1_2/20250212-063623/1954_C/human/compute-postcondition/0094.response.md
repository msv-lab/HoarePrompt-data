Output State: **`i` is 1; `new2[1]` is equal to `min(a[1], b[1])`; `a[1]` must be equal to `b[1]`**

Explanation: The code assigns the minimum value between `a[1]` and `b[1]` to `new2[1]`. Since `a[1]` is equal to `b[1]`, `new2[1]` will be equal to `a[1]` (or `b[1]`). All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
