Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `i < len(a)`.
2. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The only variable in the loop head is `i`.
3. **Determine the current state of `i`**: The state right before the loop is given as `i` is incremented by 1. This means `i` is at least 1.
4. **Check the loop condition**: For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be less than `len(a)`. Since `i` is incremented by 1 right before the loop, the smallest possible value for `i` is 1. Therefore, `i` must be less than `len(a)`.

Given this analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i` must be less than `len(a)`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` must be less than `len(a)`**
