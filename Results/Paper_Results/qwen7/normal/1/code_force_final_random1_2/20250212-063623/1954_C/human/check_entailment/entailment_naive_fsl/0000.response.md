Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the digits at the same position in both numbers are already the optimal pair. For example, consider the input:

```
3
19
91
```

The expected output would be:

```
91
19
```

However, the current implementation does not check if the digits are already in the optimal position. It only checks if the digits are equal and swaps them if they are not, which may not always result in the maximum product. The provided solution does not guarantee the optimal swapping of digits to maximize the product of the two numbers.
