Output State: **`i` is 0; `new[0]` is equal to `max(a[0], b[0])`; `a[0]` must be equal to `b[0]`**

Explanation: The code assigns the maximum value between `a[0]` and `b[0]` to `new[0]`. Since `a[0]` must be equal to `b[0]`, the value of `new[0]` will be the same as `a[0]` (or `b[0]`). The value of `i` remains unchanged as it was set to 0 initially.
