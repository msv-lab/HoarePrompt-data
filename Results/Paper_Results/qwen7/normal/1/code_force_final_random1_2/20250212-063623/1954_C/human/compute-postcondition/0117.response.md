Output State: **`new2[i]' is equal to the maximum of `a[i]' and `b[i]', while `new[i]' is equal to the minimum of `a[i]' and `b[i]'**.

Explanation: The code assigns the maximum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]` to `new2[i]`. The value of `new[i]` remains unchanged as it was previously set to the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`. All other variables retain their original values.
