Output State: **`i` must be 2 (or higher), `new[i]` is equal to `max(a[i], b[i])`, `a[i]` must be equal to `b[i]` for the loop to execute one more time, `new2[i]` is equal to `min(a[i], b[i])`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `min(a[i], b[i])` to `new2[i]`. Since `a[i]` must be equal to `b[i]` for the loop to execute one more time, `new2[i]` will be equal to `a[i]` (or `b[i]`). The conditions and values of the other variables remain unchanged.
