Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1; `new2[i]` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `new2[i]` to be the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`. Since `i` was previously incremented by 1 before this line of code, it is now incremented by 1 again. The values of `a`, `b`, `new`, `new2`, and `x`, `y` remain unchanged from their initial state.
