Output State: **`new2[i+1]` is equal to `max(a[i+1], b[i+1])`, `new[i+1]` is equal to `min(a[i+1], b[i+1])`, `new[i]` is equal to `min(a[i], b[i])`, `i` must be less than `len(a)`**

Explanation: The code assigns `min(a[i], b[i])` to `new[i]`. Since `i` must be less than `len(a)`, the other conditions and values of the variables `new2[i+1]`, `new[i+1]`, and `i` remain unchanged from the initial state.
