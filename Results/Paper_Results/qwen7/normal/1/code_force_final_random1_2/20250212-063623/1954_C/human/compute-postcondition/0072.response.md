Output State: **`i` is equal to `i + 1`, `b` is a list of integers created from the input string, `new` is a list of length `len(a)` where each element is either `max(a[j], b[j])` if `a[j] == b[j]` or `None` otherwise, with the second last element being `max(a[i], b[i])` and the last element being `min(a[i], b[i])`, `new2` is a list of length `len(a)` where each element is either `min(a[j], b[j])` if `a[j] == b[j]` or `None` otherwise, with the second last element being `min(a[i], b[i])` and the last element being `min(a[i], b[i])`, and `new2[i]` is equal to `max(a[i], b[i])`**.

In natural language: The variable `i` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions. The value of `i` is now `i + 1`.
