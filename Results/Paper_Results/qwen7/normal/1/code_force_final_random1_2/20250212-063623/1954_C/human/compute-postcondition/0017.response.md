Output State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `new[i-1]` is the maximum of `a[i-1]` and `b[i-1]`, `new2[i]` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`.**

Explanation: The initial state had `i` set to `i + 1`, `new[i-1]` as the maximum of `a[i-1]` and `b[i-1]`, and `new2[i]` as the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`. After executing `i += 1`, the value of `i` is incremented by 1 again, making it `i + 2`. The values of `new[i-1]` and `new2[i]` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the line of code.
