Output State: **`i` is 1; `new[1]` is equal to `max(a[1], b[1])`; `a[1]` must be equal to `b[1]`**

Explanation: The code assigns the maximum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]` to `new[i]`. Given that `i` is 1, `new[1]` is set to the maximum of `a[1]` and `b[1]`. Since `a[1]` must be equal to `b[1]`, `new[1]` will be equal to that common value. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
