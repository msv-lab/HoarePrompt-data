Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns whether two strings representing integers of the same length (x and y) are equal.**

Given that the parameters `x` and `y` are strings representing integers of the same length, consisting of digits from 1 to 9, the function does not actually take any parameters but rather implies that such strings are passed to it. The functionality is to compare these two strings and return a boolean value indicating whether they are the same.
