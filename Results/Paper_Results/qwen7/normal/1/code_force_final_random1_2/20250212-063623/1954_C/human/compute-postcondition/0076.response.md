Output State: **`new2[i]` is equal to the maximum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`; `i` is equal to `i + 3`.**

Explanation: The initial state has `new2[i]` set to the maximum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, and `i` set to `i + 2`. After executing `i += 1`, the value of `i` is incremented by 1, making it `i + 3`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
