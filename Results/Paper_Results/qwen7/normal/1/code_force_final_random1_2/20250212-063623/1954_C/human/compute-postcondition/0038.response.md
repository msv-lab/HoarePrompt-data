Postcondition: **All elements in `new` will be the minimum of the corresponding elements in `a` and `b`, and all elements in `new2` will be the maximum of the corresponding elements in `a` and `b`, up to the length of the lists `a` and `b`. The variable `i` will be equal to `len(a)`, indicating that the loop has processed all elements.**
