Output State: **`i` must be 2 (or higher), `new[i]` is equal to `max(a[i], b[i])`, `a[i]` must be equal to `b[i]` for the loop to execute one more time.**

Explanation: The code assigns the maximum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]` to `new[i]`. Since `a[i]` must be equal to `b[i]` for the loop to execute one more time, `new[i]` will be equal to both `a[i]` and `b[i]`. The precondition that `i` must be 2 (or higher) remains unchanged, and the condition for the loop to continue executing one more time also remains the same.
