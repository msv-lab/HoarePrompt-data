Output State: The final output state will have `new[i]` set to `min(a[i], b[i])` for each index `i` from `0` to `len(a) - 1`, and `new2[i]` set to `max(a[i], b[i])` for each index `i` from `0` to `len(a) - 1`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `new` list will contain the minimum values from corresponding indices of lists `a` and `b`, while the `new2` list will contain the maximum values from the same indices.
