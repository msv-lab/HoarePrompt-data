Output State: **`i` is `len(a) + 1`, `b` is a list of integers created from the input string, `new` is a list of length `len(a)` filled with `None` values.**

Explanation: The code initializes a new list `new` with `None` values, where the length of `new` is equal to the length of `a`. The values of `i` and `b` remain unchanged from their initial state.
