Output State: **`new2[i]` is equal to `max(a[i], b[i])`, `new2[i+1]` is equal to `max(a[i+1], b[i+1])`, `new[i+1]` is equal to `min(a[i+1], b[i+1])`, `new[i]` is equal to `min(a[i], b[i])`, `i` must be less than `len(a)`**

Explanation: The code updates `new2[i]` to be the maximum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`. The other variables and their relationships remain unchanged. Therefore, `new2[i]` is updated, while `new2[i+1]`, `new[i+1]`, `new[i]`, and the condition on `i` remain as they were in the initial state.
