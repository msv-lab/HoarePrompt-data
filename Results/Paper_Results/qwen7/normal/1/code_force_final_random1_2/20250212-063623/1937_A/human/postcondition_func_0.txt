The function processes a series of test cases, each containing an integer \( n \). For each \( n \), it calculates a specific power of 2 and prints the result. If \( n \) is 1, it directly prints 1. Otherwise, it computes the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to \( n \), and prints the value of that power. The function reads the number of test cases first, then for each test case, it reads \( n \) and performs the calculation and printing as described.
