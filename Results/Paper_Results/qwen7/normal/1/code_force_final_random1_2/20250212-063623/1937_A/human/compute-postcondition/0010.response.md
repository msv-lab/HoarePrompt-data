Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `power < n`.
2. **Determine the current state**: 
   - `power` is 2.
   - `n` is \(\log_2(n)\).
   - `n_cases` must be greater than 0.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `power < n` must be true.
   - Given that `power` is currently 2, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to continue.

4. **Check the constraints**:
   - Since `n` is \(\log_2(n)\), this means \(n = 2^{\text{some value}}\). Letâ€™s denote this value as \(k\), so \(n = 2^k\).
   - For \(n\) to be greater than 2, \(k\) must be greater than 1 (since \(2^1 = 2\) and we need \(n > 2\)).

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - The only variable in the loop head that affects the loop condition is `n`.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 2.

Given the constraints, the state at the end of the previous iteration should be adjusted such that `n` is greater than 2.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`power` is 2, `n` is \(\log_2(n)\), `n_cases` must be greater than 0, and `n` must be greater than 2**
