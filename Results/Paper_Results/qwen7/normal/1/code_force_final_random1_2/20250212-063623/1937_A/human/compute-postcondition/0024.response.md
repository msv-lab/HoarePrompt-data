Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `n_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `power` remains as it was after the loop execution.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input integer to `n`. According to the initial state, `i` is 1 if it was 0, otherwise `i` is incremented by 1. Since `i` was initially 1 (as per the initial state), it gets incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2. The other variables (`n_cases` and `power`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet.
