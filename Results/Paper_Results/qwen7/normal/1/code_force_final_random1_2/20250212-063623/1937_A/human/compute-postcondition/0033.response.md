Output State: **`power` is 4, `n` must be greater than 3, `n_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2**

Explanation: The code `power += 1` increments the value of `power` by 1. Given that `power` was initially 3, after executing this line, `power` becomes 4. The conditions for `n` and `n_cases` remain unchanged, and `i` remains 2.
