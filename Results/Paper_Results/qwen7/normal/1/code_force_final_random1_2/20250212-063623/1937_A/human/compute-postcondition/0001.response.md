Let's break down the task step by step:

1. Identify the objects involved in the loop head:
   - The loop variable `i`
   - The loop control variable `n_cases`

2. Determine the initial state of these objects:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
   - `n_cases` is an input integer

3. Understand the condition for the loop to execute:
   - The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n_cases`.

4. Adjust the states of the relevant objects to ensure the loop can execute:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, the loop will execute if `n_cases` is at least 1.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that `n_cases` is greater than 0.

5. Note that the state of `t` does not affect the loop's execution, so it does not need to be adjusted.

Based on this reasoning, the states that need to be adjusted are:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n_cases` must be greater than 0**
