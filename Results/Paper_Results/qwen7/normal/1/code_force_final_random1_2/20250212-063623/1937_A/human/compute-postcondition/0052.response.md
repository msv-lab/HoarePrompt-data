The variables in the loop head are `power` and `n`, so we can only adjust these two variables.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `power` and `n`. If `power` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` must be greater than 1, and `power` has been increased by 1. For the loop to be executed one more time, `power` must be less than `n`.

Since `n` must be greater than 1 and `power` is increased by 1, `power` must be less than `n` for the loop to continue.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1 and `power` must be less than `n`**
