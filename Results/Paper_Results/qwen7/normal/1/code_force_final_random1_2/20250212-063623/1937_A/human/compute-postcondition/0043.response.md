Postcondition: `n` is an input integer, `n_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, and `power` remains as it was after the loop execution. If `n` is 1, then `power` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `power` is set to 5, `n` is greater than 4, `n_cases` is greater than 0, and `i` is 2. The loop continues until `power` equals `n`.
