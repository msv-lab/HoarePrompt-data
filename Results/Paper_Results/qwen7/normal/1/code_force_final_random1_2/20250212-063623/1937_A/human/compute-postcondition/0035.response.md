Output State: `power` is 5, `n` must be greater than 4, `n_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `power` by 1 as long as `power` is less than `n`. After each iteration, `power` increases by 1. Given that the loop has executed 3 times up to now, `power` is currently 4. Therefore, after executing the loop one more time (making it 4 iterations in total), `power` will become 5. For the loop to continue, `n` must be greater than 4. The other variables (`n_cases` and `i`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
