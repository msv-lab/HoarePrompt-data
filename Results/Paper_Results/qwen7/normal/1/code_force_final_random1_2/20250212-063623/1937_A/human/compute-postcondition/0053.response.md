Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1; `power` is equal to its original value plus 1.**

The value of `power` is incremented by 1, while the condition that `n` must be greater than 1 remains unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is that `n` must still be greater than 1, and `power` is now one more than its original value.
