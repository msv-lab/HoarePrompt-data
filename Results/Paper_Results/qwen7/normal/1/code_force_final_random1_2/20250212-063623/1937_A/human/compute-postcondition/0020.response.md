Output: **16**

Explanation: 
- The initial state tells us that `power` is 4.
- The value of `2 ** power` is calculated as \(2^4\), which equals 16.
- The `print` statement will output this result.
- Since `n` being greater than 256 and `n_cases` being greater than 0 do not affect the calculation of `2 ** power`, they are not relevant to the output of the print statement.
