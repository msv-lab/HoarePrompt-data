Output State: `power` is 5, `n` must be greater than 256, and `n_cases` must be greater than 0.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `power` by 1 until it is no longer less than `n`. From the given information, we can see that after each iteration, `power` increases by 1. After 3 iterations, `power` is 4 and `n` must be greater than 8. This implies that `n` must be at least 9 (since `n` must be greater than 8). 

For the fourth iteration, `power` becomes 5. For the fifth iteration, `power` would become 6, but we need to determine when the loop stops. Given that `n` must be greater than \(2^7 = 128\) after 7 iterations (since `power` would be 8), and specifically greater than 256 after 8 iterations (since `power` would be 9), we can conclude that the loop will stop after 8 iterations because `n` must be greater than 256. Therefore, the final value of `power` is 5, and the condition for `n` remains that it must be greater than 256.
