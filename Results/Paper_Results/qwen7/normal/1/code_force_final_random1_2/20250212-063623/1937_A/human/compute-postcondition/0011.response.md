Output State: **`power` is 3, `n` is \(\log_2(n)\), `n_cases` must be greater than 0, and `n` must be greater than 2**

Explanation: The value of `power` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The values of `n` and `n_cases` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code snippet.
