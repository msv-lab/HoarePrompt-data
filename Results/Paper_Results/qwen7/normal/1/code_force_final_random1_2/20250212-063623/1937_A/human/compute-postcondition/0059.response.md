Based on the initial state, `power` is equal to `n`. Since `n` must be greater than the final value of `power`, and `power` is already set to `n`, it means `power` is `n`.

The expression `2 ** power` calculates 2 raised to the power of `power`, which is `n`.

Therefore, the print statement will output 2 raised to the power of `n`.

Output: **2 ** n**
