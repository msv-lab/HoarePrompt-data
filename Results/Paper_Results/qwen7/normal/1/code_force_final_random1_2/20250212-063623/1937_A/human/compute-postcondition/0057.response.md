Output State: `n` must be greater than the final value of `power`.

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `power` is less than `n`. After the loop has executed all iterations, `power` will be equal to `n` (since it increments until it is no longer less than `n`). Therefore, the final condition is that `n` must be greater than the final value of `power`, which is `n` itself. This implies that the loop would continue indefinitely if `n` were not strictly greater than 1, but since we know from the initial conditions that `n` must be greater than 1, the loop will terminate when `power` equals `n`.
