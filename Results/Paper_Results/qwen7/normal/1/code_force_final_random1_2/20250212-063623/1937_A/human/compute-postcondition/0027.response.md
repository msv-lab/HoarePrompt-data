Output State: **`power` is 1, `n` is log2(n), `n_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2**.

Explanation: The code `n = log2(n)` changes the value of `n` to the base-2 logarithm of its original value. The other variables (`power`, `n_cases`, and `i`) remain unchanged. The precondition that `n_cases` must be greater than 0 is still valid.
