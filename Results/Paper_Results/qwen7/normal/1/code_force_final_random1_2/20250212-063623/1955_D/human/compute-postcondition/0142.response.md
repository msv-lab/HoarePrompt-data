Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `i` is `i + 1`, `b_values` is a set of integers, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decreased by 1, and `curr` is increased by 1 if `a[i+1]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i+1]]` is greater than or equal to 0.**

Explanation: The code `cnt_b[a[i]] -= 1` decreases the value of `cnt_b[a[i]]` by 1. The other variables (`a`, `i`, `b_values`, and the condition for `curr`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
