Output State: **`i` is 1, `n - m` is greater than 0, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1 if `a[i + m]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than 0, `curr` is increased by 1 if `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, and `curr` remains unchanged otherwise, and `ans` is incremented by 1 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`**

Explanation: The code `cnt_b[a[i]] += 1` increments the value of `cnt_b[a[i]]` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the updated state includes the increment of `cnt_b[a[i]]` by 1. The conditions for decrementing `cnt_b[a[i + m]]`, increasing `curr`, and incrementing `ans` are not met since they depend on additional conditions that are not specified to change with this line of code.
