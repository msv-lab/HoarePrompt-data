Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `m`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < m`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is incremented by 1 (`i + 1`).
   - `m` remains the same.
   - `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decreased by 1 if `a[i]` is in `b_values`.
   - `curr` is increased by 1.
   - If `a[i]` is not in `b_values`, `i` remains at `i + 1`, `m` remains the same, and no changes are made to `cnt_b[a[i]]` and `curr`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, `i` will be `i + 1` at the start of the next iteration.
   - `m` remains unchanged.
   - `cnt_b[a[i]]` and `curr` might have been modified based on the value of `a[i]` in the previous iteration, but these values will be relevant for the next iteration.

Given this information, we can conclude that the only variables that need to be adjusted for the next iteration are `i` and `m`.

5. **State at the start of the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be `i + 1` from the previous iteration.
   - `m` remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `m` remains the same**
