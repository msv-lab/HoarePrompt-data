Output State: All values in `cnt_b` are 0, `curr` is 0, `ans` retains the cumulative count of instances where `curr` was greater than or equal to `k` during the entire loop's execution, and `n` remains greater than `2 * m - 1`. The set `b_values` is empty since all its elements have been processed and reset in `cnt_b`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the counter `cnt_b` for each value from `0` to `1000000` is set to `0` as each element in `b_values` is processed and reset. The variable `curr` is reset to `0` after the last iteration. The variable `ans` retains the cumulative count of instances where `curr` was greater than or equal to `k` throughout the entire loop's execution. The variable `n` remains unchanged and is still greater than `2 * m - 1`. The set `b_values` is empty because all its elements have been processed and reset in `cnt_b`.
