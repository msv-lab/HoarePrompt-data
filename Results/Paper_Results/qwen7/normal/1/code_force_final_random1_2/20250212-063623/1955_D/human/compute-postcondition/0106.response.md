Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than `2 * m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `curr` is 0, `cnt_b` is a dictionary with key `0` and value `0`, and `cnt_b[1]` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `cnt_b[i] = 0` updates the dictionary `cnt_b` by setting the value at key `i` (which is 1) to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
