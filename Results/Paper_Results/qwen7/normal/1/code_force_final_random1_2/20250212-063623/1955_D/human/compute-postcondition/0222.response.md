Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `b_values` has been fully iterated over, `cnt_b[i]` is 0 for all `i` in `b_values`, `curr` retains its value, `ans` retains its value.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in the list `a`. The variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `b_values`, `cnt_b`, `curr`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states.
