Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, max_val is 1000000, cnt_b is a list of 1000001 zeros**.

The code initializes `cnt_b` as a list containing 1,000,001 zeros. This means that `cnt_b` is now a list where each element from index 0 to 1000000 is set to 0. The values of `t` and `max_val` remain unchanged from their initial state.
