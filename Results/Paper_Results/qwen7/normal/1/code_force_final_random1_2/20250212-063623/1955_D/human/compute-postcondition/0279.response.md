Postcondition: **`ans` is 1, `curr` is the total count of elements in `a` that are also present in `b_values` and it is greater than or equal to `k` minus 1, `i` is equal to `m - 1`, `n - m` must be greater than `m - 1`, `a` is a list of integers, `b_values` is a set containing all unique values from the list `b`, `cnt_b` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `b` and its value is the count of how many times it appears in `a` but with decremented counts based on the loop's condition, the value of `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, and the next element `a[i + m]` is also present in `b_values`.**
