The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `b_values`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the sequence `b_values`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is 1
- `n` is greater than `2 * m - 1`
- `ans` is 0
- `curr` is 0
- `cnt_b` is a dictionary with key `0` and value `0`, and `cnt_b[1]` is 0

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be within the range defined by `b_values`. Since `i` is currently 1, it means the loop has already started with `i = 1`. The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` should be less than the length of `b_values`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1 (assuming the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration). Given that `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it will become 2 at the start of the next iteration.

Since `b_values` is not explicitly defined in the given information, we cannot determine its exact contents, but we know that the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than the length of `b_values`.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than `2 * m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `curr` is 0, `cnt_b` is a dictionary with key `0` and value `0`, and `cnt_b[1]` is 0**
