Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` is equal to `m-1`; `m` must be greater than 0; `cnt_b[b[m-1]]` is incremented by `m` times; `b_values` is a set containing all unique values from the list `b`; `ans` is 0; `curr` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(m):
    if a[i] in b_values:
        cnt_b[a[i]] -= 1
        if cnt_b[a[i]] >= 0:
            curr += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 1, `m` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `b_values` is decremented by 1 at the index equal to `a[0]` (if `a[i]` is in `b_values`), and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than or equal to 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `a[i]` is an element of the list `b_values`. If `a[i]` is found in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decreased by 1, and if `cnt_b[a[i]]` was initially non-negative, `curr` is increased by 1. If `a[i]` is not found in `b_values`, no changes are made to `cnt_b[a[i]]` and `curr`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `a[i]` is an element of array `a`, and `b_values` is a collection of elements. If `a[i]` is found in `b_values`, then `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decremented by 1, and if `cnt_b[a[i]]` was greater than or equal to 0, `curr` is increased by 1. If `a[i]` is not found in `b_values`, no changes are made to `cnt_b[a[i]]` and `curr`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
