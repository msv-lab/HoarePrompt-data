Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the range of `a`, `b_values` is a set of integers, and the count of `a[i]` in `cnt_b` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `cnt_b[a[i]] -= 1` decreases the count of the element `a[i]` in the dictionary `cnt_b` by 1. The values of `a`, `i`, and `b_values` remain unchanged.
