Output State: **`i` is less than `m`, `n` is greater than `2 * m - 1`, `ans` is the total number of times `curr` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop's execution, `curr` is `0`, `cnt_b` is a dictionary where each key from `0` to `n - m - 1` (inclusive) has a value of `0`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces, `b` is a list of integers obtained from further input split by spaces, `cnt_b[b[i]]` is incremented by 1.**

In this state, the dictionary `cnt_b` has its value at the index `b[i]` increased by 1. All other variables retain their initial conditions or are not affected by this line of code.
