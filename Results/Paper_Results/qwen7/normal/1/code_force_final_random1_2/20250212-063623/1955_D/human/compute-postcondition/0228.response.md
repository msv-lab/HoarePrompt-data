Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `m`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i < m`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `m` must be greater than 0
   - `cnt_b[b[1]]` is incremented by 1 (this variable is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted)

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `m` must still be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`i` is 2, `m` must be greater than 0**
