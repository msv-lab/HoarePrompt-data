Output State: **`i` is -1, `n - m` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, and the current value of `a[i]` is either in `b_values` or not. If `a[i]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is now incremented by 1 (since the original value was -1), and is less than or equal to 0. If `a[i]` is not in `b_values`, `i` remains -1 and no changes are made to `cnt_b`. Additionally, the condition `(a[i + m] in b_values)` is true, and `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is now greater than or equal to 0.**

Explanation: The variable `curr` is incremented by 1, but since `curr` was not mentioned in the initial state, we assume it's a new variable or its value was not relevant to the conditions given. The values of `i`, `n - m`, `a`, `b_values`, `cnt_b`, and the conditions involving `a[i + m]` remain unchanged except for `cnt_b[a[i]]` which is incremented by 1 if `a[i]` is in `b_values`.
