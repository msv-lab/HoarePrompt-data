Postcondition: **`i` is -1, `n - m` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, and the current value of `a[i]` is either in `b_values` or not. If `a[i]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is now incremented by 1 and is less than or equal to 0. If `a[i]` is not in `b_values`, `i` remains -1 and no changes are made to `cnt_b`. Additionally, the condition `(a[i + m] in b_values)` is true, and `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is now greater than or equal to 0.**
