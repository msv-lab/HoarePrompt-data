Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n - m)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n - m`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `m - 2` and `n` is greater than `2 * m - 1`.

3. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `i` starts from `m - 2` and increments by 1 in each iteration, the new value of `i` will be `m - 1`.
   - The condition `n > 2 * m - 1` remains unchanged because `n` is not modified within the loop.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
- `i` should be `m - 1`.
- `n` should remain greater than `2 * m - 1`.

State: **`i` is `m - 1`, `n` is greater than `2 * m - 1`**
