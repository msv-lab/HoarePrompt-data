Output State: **`ans` is increased by 1, `i` is `m - 2`, `n` is greater than `2 * m - 1`, `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `curr` is incremented by 1 if `a[i + m]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is non-negative, and no changes are made to `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` if `a[i + m]` is not in `b_values`.**

Explanation: The line `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. No other variables are affected by this operation. The conditions and relationships involving `i`, `n`, `curr`, and `a[i + m]` remain unchanged as per the initial state.
