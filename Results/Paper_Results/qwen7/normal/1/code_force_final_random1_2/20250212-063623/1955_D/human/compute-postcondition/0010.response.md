Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the initial state at the end of the previous iteration:**
   - `m` must be a positive integer.
   - `i` is equal to `m`.
   - `cnt_b[b[i]]` is incremented by 1.

2. **Understand the loop condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `range(m)`, meaning `i` will take values from 0 to `m-1`.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration:**
   - Since `i` starts from `m` in the previous iteration and the loop runs until `i < m`, the next value of `i` will be `m - 1`.
   - Therefore, `i` will be decremented by 1 from its current value of `m` to `m - 1`.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly:**
   - `m` remains a positive integer.
   - `i` will be `m - 1`.
   - `cnt_b[b[i]]` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration when `i` is `m - 1`.

Given these steps, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`m` must be a positive integer; `i` is `m - 1`; `cnt_b[b[i]]` is incremented by 1**.
