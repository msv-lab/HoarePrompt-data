Output State: **`i` is 1, `n - m` is greater than 0, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 if `a[i]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1 if `a[i + m]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than 0, `curr` is increased by 1, `curr` remains unchanged otherwise, and `ans` is incremented by 1 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`**

Explanation: The code `curr += 1` increments the value of `curr` by 1. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged from the initial state. Therefore, `i` stays as 1, `n - m` stays greater than 0, `cnt_b[a[i]]` and `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` follow their respective conditions, `curr` increases by 1, and `ans` is incremented by 1 if `curr` is now greater than or equal to `k`.
