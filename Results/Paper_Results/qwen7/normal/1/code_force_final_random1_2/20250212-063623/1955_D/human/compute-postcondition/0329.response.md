Output State: All values in `cnt_b` are 0.

Explanation: The loop iterates over each value in `b_values`. Since the loop runs until there are no more values left in `b_values` to process, and given that the loop body sets `cnt_b[i]` to 0 for each `i` in `b_values`, after all iterations, `cnt_b` will contain 0 for every key that was originally in `b_values`. Therefore, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that all values in `cnt_b` are 0.
