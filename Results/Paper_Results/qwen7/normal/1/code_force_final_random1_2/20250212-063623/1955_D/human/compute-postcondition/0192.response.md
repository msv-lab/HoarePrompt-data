Output State: **`ans` is incremented by 1, `i` is 0, `n - m` is greater than 0, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 if `a[i]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, and `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1 if `a[i + m]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than 0, and `curr` is increased by 1 if `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, and `curr` remains unchanged otherwise.**

Explanation: The line `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
