Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `b_values` has been fully iterated over, `cnt_b[i]` is 0 for all `i` in `b_values`, `curr` retains its value, `ans` retains its value.**

Explanation: The code `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. It does not affect the values of `b_values`, `cnt_b`, `curr`, or `ans`. Therefore, these variables retain their previous states.
