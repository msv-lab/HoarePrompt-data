Output State: **`i` is either `m - 1` or `m - 2`; `n` is greater than `2 * m - 1`; `ans` is incremented by 1; if `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, then `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1, and `curr` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. The conditions and values of `i`, `n`, `a[i + m]`, `b_values`, `cnt_b`, and `curr` remain unchanged from the initial state.
