Output State: **`i` is `n - m - 1`, `n` is greater than `2 * m - 1`, `ans` is the total number of times `curr` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop's execution, `curr` is `0`, `cnt_b` is a dictionary where each key from `0` to `n - m - 1` (inclusive) has a value of `0`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` from the input using `map(int, input().split())`. These values replace the existing placeholders for `n`, `m`, and `k` in the initial state. The other variables (`i`, `ans`, `curr`, and `cnt_b`) remain unchanged.
