Output State: **`i` is one of the values in `b_values`, `cnt_b[i]` is 0**

Explanation: The code `cnt_b[i] = 0` sets the value of `cnt_b[i]` to 0. Since `i` is one of the values in `b_values` and `cnt_b[i]` was previously 0, the value of `cnt_b[i]` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is that `i` is one of the values in `b_values`, and `cnt_b[i]` is 0.
