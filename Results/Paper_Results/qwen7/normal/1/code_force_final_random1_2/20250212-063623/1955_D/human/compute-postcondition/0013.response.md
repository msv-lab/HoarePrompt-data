Output State: The loop has executed `m` times; `i` is `m - 1`; for each element `b[i]` in the list `b`, `cnt_b[b[i]]` is incremented by 1 for every occurrence of `b[i]` in the list `b`. This means that `cnt_b[b[i]]` now contains the count of how many times each value `b[i]` appears in the list `b`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `cnt_b` will contain the frequency count of each value present in the list `b`.
