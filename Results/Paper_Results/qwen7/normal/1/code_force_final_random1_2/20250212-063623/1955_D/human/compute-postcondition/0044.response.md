Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the constant `n - m`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: According to the given information, after the if-else block executes, `i` will be equal to `m - 1`. Therefore, the loop should start from `i = m - 1`.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop runs for `range(n - m)`, meaning it starts from `i = 0` and goes up to `n - m - 1`. For the loop to execute, `i` must be less than `n - m`.

4. **Adjust the state of `i`**: Since `i` will be `m - 1` after the if-else block, we need to ensure that `m - 1` is within the range of `range(n - m)`. This means `m - 1` must be less than `n - m`.

5. **State the final adjusted state**: We need to ensure that `i` is set to `m - 1` and that this value is within the valid range for the loop.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

State: **`i` is `m - 1`, `n` must be greater than `2 * m - 1`**.

This ensures that `i` starts at `m - 1` and the loop can proceed as expected.
