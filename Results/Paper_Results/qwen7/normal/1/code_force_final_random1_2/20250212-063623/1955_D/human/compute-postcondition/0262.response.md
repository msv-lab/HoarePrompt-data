Postcondition: **Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` is equal to `m-1`, `m` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `b_values` is a set containing all unique values from the list `b`, `cnt_b` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `b` and its value is the count of how many times it appears in `a` but with decremented counts based on the loop's condition, `ans` remains 0, and `curr` is the total count of elements in `a` that are also present in `b_values`. Additionally, `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`.**
