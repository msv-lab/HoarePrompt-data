Output State: **`i` is `n - m - 1`, `n` is greater than `2 * m - 1`, `ans` is the total number of times `curr` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop's execution, `curr` is `0`, `cnt_b` is a dictionary where each key from `0` to `n - m - 1` (inclusive) has a value equal to its count in the list `b`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces, `b` is a list of integers obtained from further input split by spaces, `b_values` is a set containing all unique elements from the list `b`.**

The code `b_values = set(b)` creates a set from the list `b`, which removes any duplicate elements in `b` and stores them in the variable `b_values`. All other variables remain unchanged.
