Output State: **`i` is `m - 2`, `n` is greater than `2 * m - 1`, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1, and `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`.**

Explanation: The code decrements the value of `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` by 1. Since `i` is `m - 2` and `n` is greater than `2 * m - 1`, these conditions remain unchanged. The value of `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is updated by subtracting 1 from its current value. The condition that `a[i + m]` is in `b_values` also remains unchanged.
