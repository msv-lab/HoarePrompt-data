Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- **State at the end of the previous iteration**: 
  - `i` is an element of `b_values`
  - `cnt_b[i]` is 0

- **For Loop Statement**:
  ```python
  for i in b_values:
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**:
   - The loop iterates over each element in `b_values`.
   - The variable `i` takes on each value from `b_values` during each iteration.

2. **Condition for Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be the next element in `b_values`.

3. **State Adjustments**:
   - Since `i` is an element of `b_values`, it will take on the next value in `b_values` for the next iteration.
   - The value of `cnt_b[i]` will be updated within the loop body but is not relevant for determining if the loop can continue.

### Conclusion:
- The only variable that needs to be adjusted for the next iteration is `i`, which will be the next element in `b_values`.

### Updated State:
- `i` will be the next element in `b_values`.
- `cnt_b[i]` will be updated within the loop body but is not part of the loop head state.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is the next element in `b_values`, `cnt_b[i]` is 0 (will be updated within the loop body)**
