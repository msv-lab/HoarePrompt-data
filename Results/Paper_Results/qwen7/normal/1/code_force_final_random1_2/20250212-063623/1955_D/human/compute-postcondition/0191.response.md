Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n - m` is greater than 0, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 if `a[i]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, and `curr` is decremented by 1. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1, and `curr` is increased by 1. If `a[i + m]` is not in `b_values` or `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is not greater than 0, the values of `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` and `curr` remain unchanged.
