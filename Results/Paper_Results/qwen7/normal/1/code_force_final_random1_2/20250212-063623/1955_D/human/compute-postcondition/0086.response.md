Output State: **`i` is `m` or `m - 1`, `n` is greater than `2 * m - 1`, `ans` is incremented by 1, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1, and `curr` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code increments the count of `a[i]` in `cnt_b`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. `i` can be `m` or `m - 1`, `n` is still greater than `2 * m - 1`, `ans` has been incremented by 1, `cnt_b[a[i]]` has been incremented by 1, and `curr` has also been incremented by 1.
