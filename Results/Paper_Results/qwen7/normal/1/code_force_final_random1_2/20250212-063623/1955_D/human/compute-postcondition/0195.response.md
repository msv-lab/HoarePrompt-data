Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i`, `n`, and `m`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < n - m`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n - m` is greater than 0.
   - `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 if `a[i]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0.
   - `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1 if `a[i + m]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than 0.
   - `curr` is increased by 1 if `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, and `curr` remains unchanged otherwise.
   - `ans` is incremented by 1 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` will be `i + 1 = 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `n - m` must still be greater than 0.
   - The values of `cnt_b[a[i]]`, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]`, `curr`, and `ans` depend on the specific elements in the array `a` and the set `b_values`, but these values do not change based on the loop itself; they are determined by the loop body.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` will be 1.
   - `n - m` must still be greater than 0 (unchanged from the previous iteration).
   - The values of `cnt_b[a[i]]`, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]`, `curr`, and `ans` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration unless the loop body changes them.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `i` is 1, `n - m` is greater than 0, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 if `a[i]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1 if `a[i + m]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than 0, `curr` is increased by 1 if `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, and `curr` remains unchanged otherwise, and `ans` is incremented by 1 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`.**
