Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < n - m`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is either `m - 1` or `m - 2`.
   - `n` is greater than `2 * m - 1`.
   - `ans` is incremented by 1.
   - If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, then `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1, and `curr` is incremented by 1.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is either `m - 1` or `m - 2`, after incrementing `i` by 1, `i` will become `m` or `m - 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n - m`. Given that `n` is greater than `2 * m - 1`, `n - m` will be greater than `m - 1`.
   - Therefore, if `i` is `m - 1`, it will still be less than `n - m` because `n - m > m - 1`.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so if `i` was `m - 1`, it will now be `m`, and if `i` was `m - 2`, it will now be `m - 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `ans` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, so it will be incremented again.
   - If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, then `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1, and `curr` is incremented by 1. This condition will be checked again in the next iteration.

Given these points, the updated states for the next iteration are:

- `i` will be `m` if it was `m - 1` or `m - 1` if it was `m - 2`.
- `n` remains the same.
- `ans` is incremented by 1.
- `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` and `curr` will be updated based on the condition `if a[i + m] in b_values`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is `m` or `m - 1`, `n` is greater than `2 * m - 1`, `ans` is incremented by 1, if `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, then `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1, and `curr` is incremented by 1**.
