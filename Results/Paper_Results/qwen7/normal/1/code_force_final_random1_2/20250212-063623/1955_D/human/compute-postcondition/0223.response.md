Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `b` is a list of integers obtained from input, `cnt_b[i]` is 0 for all `i` in `b_values`, `curr` retains its value, `ans` retains its value.**

Explanation: The code `b = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input and converts them into a list of integers. The original values of `a`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `cnt_b[i]` (which is 0 for all `i` in `b_values`), `curr`, and `ans` remain unchanged. Therefore, these variables are still in their initial states except for the new list `b` which contains the newly input integers.
