Postcondition: `a` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the range of `a`, `b_values` is a set of integers, `cnt_b` is a dictionary mapping integers to counts, and `curr` is an integer. If `a[i]` is in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` was greater than or equal to 0, then `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decreased by 1 and `curr` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is not in `b_values`, no changes are made to `cnt_b` and `curr`.
