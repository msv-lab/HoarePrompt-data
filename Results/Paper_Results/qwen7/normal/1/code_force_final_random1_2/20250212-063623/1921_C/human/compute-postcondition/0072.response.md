Postcondition: `arr` is an array of integers, `i` is an index within the bounds of `arr`, `a` is a non-zero value, and `b` is a value such that if the difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[i - 1]` is less than `b / a`, then `array2` contains one element which is `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`. If the condition is not met, `array2` remains unchanged.
