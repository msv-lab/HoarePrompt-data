Output State: **`i` is `feat[0] + 1`, `n` is `feat[0]`, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `feat[-1]` to the variable `b`. This means that `b` now holds the value of `feat[-1]`, while the other variables (`i`, `n`, `f`, `a`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
