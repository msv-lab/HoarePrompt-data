Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be equal to `test_cases`, `array2` will contain the product `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` for every index `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1` where the difference `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]` is less than the ratio `b / a`. The final output will be 'Yes' if the sum of the elements in `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is less than `f`, otherwise it will be 'No'.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, the variable `i` will have reached the value of `test_cases`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The list `array2` will hold the calculated values based on the condition specified within the inner loop. Finally, the program will print 'Yes' or 'No' based on the comparison between the sum of `array2` and the adjusted value of `f`.
