Output State: **`i` is `feat[0] + 1`, `n` is `feat[0]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `array2` contains the product of the differences between consecutive elements of `arr` that are less than `b/a`, scaled by `a`, and the sum of the elements in `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` will be less than `f` if it was less than `f` before, otherwise it will be greater than or equal to `f`; `feat` is a list of integers obtained from user input, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`**.

Explanation: The variable `b` is assigned the value of `feat[-1]`. All other variables and their relationships remain unchanged from the initial state.
