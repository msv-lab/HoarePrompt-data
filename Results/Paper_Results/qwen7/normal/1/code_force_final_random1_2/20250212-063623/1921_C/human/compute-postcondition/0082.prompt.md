Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `feat` is a list of integers obtained from input().split(' '), `n` is equal to `feat[0]`, `i` is `feat[0] + (n - 1) + 1` to ensure it is less than `test_cases`, `f` is equal to `feat[1]`, `a` is equal to `feat[2]`, `b` is equal to `feat[-1]`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from input().split(' '), `array2` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a:
        array2.append((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `arr` is an array of integers, `i` is an index within the bounds of `arr`, `a` is a non-zero value, and `b` is a value such that if the difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[i - 1]` is less than `b / a`, then `array2` contains one element which is `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`. If the condition is not met, `array2` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `arr` is an array of integers, `i` is `n`, `a` is a non-zero value, `b` is a value, `array2` contains one element which is `(arr[n] - arr[n - 1]) * a` if the difference between `arr[n]` and `arr[n - 1]` is less than `b / a`, otherwise `array2` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `arr` is an array of integers, `i` is `n-1`, `a` is a non-zero value, `b` is a value, and `array2` contains the element `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` if the difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[i - 1]` is less than `b / a`. Otherwise, `array2` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
