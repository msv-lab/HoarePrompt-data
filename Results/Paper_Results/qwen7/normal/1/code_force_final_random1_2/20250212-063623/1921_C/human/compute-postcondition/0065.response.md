Output State: **`feat` is a list of integers obtained from input().split(' '), `n` is equal to `feat[0]`, `i` is `feat[0] + (n - 1) + 1` to ensure it is less than `test_cases`, `f` is equal to `feat[1]`, `a` is equal to `feat[2]`, `b` is equal to `feat[-1]`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the last element of the `feat` list to the variable `b`. No other variables are affected. The values of `feat`, `n`, `i`, `f`, and `a` remain unchanged.
