Output State: **`i` is `feat[0] + 1`, `n` is `feat[0]`, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `array2` contains elements based on the conditions specified in the loop body.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `feat[2]` to the variable `a`. No other changes are made to the existing variables or the state of `array2`. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, `f`, and `array2` remain unchanged from their initial states.
