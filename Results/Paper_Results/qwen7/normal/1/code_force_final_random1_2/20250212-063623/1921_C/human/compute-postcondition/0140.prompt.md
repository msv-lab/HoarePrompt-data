Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(test_cases):
    feat = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
    n = feat[0]
    f = feat[1]
    a = feat[2]
    b = feat[-1]
    arr = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
    array2 = []
    for i in range(0, n):
        if i == 0:
            if arr[0] < b / a:
                array2.append(arr[0] * a)
        elif arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a:
            array2.append((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a)
    if sum(array2) + (n - len(array2)) * b < f:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `array2` contains all elements that satisfy the condition `(arr[i] - arr[i-1]) * a` where `arr[i] - arr[i-1] < b / a` for each iteration `i` from 0 to `n-1`. Additionally, the sum of elements in `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is less than `f` if the condition in the if statement is true. Otherwise, the sum of elements in `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is greater than or equal to `f`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is equal to `n`, `n` remains greater than 0, and `array2` contains elements based on the conditions specified in the loop body. Specifically, `array2` will contain `arr[0] * a` if `arr[0] < b / a`, and it will also append `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` to `array2` whenever `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a` for any `i` from 1 to `n-1`. Additionally, the sum of `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is either less than `f` or greater than or equal to `f`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `arr` is a list of integers, `i` is equal to `n`, `n` is the original length of `arr`, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, and `array2` is a list. Depending on the condition, for each index `i` in the range from 0 to `n-1`, if `i == 0` and `arr[0] < b / a`, then `array2` will include `arr[0] * a`. For any other index `i` where `0 < i < n`, if `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`, then `array2` will include `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`. If neither condition is met for any iteration, `array2` will remain unchanged from its initial state. If the sum of `array2` plus the product of `(n - len(array2))` and `b` is less than `f`, the first condition is met. Otherwise, the second condition is met.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
