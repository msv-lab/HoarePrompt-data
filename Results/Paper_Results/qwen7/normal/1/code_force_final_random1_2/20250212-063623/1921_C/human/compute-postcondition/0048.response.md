Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `i` is `feat[0] + 2`
- `n` is greater than `feat[0] + 2`

### Loop Head
```
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`.
2. **Initial Value of `i`**: From the postcondition, `i` is `feat[0] + 2`.
3. **Range of `i`**: Since `i` starts from `feat[0] + 2` and the loop runs until `i < n`, the next value of `i` will be `feat[0] + 3`.

### Adjusting the States
- **Variable `i`**: The next value of `i` will be `feat[0] + 3`.
- **Variable `n`**: `n` remains unchanged as it is a condition for the loop but not modified within the loop.

### New State
- `i` is now `feat[0] + 3`
- `n` is still greater than `feat[0] + 2`

### Final Answer
State: **`i` is `feat[0] + 3`, `n` is greater than `feat[0] + 2`**
