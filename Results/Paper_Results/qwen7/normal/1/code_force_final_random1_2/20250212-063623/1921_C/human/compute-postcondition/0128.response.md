Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `array2` is a list, and `array2` contains the element `(arr[2] - arr[1]) * feat[2]`.**

Explanation: The code appends to `array2` the value of `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`. Given that `i` is 2, this translates to `(arr[2] - arr[1]) * feat[2]`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
