Postcondition: `i` is an integer starting from 3, `array2` remains unchanged, and `n` must still be greater than 1. If `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`, then `i` becomes 4 and `array2` is updated to `[arr[3] - arr[2] * a]`. If the condition `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a` is not met, `i` and `array2` remain unchanged.
