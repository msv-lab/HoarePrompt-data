Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(0, n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `arr` is a list of integers.
   - `i` is either 1 or 2.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `f` is `feat[1]`.
   - `a` is `feat[2]`.
   - `b` is `feat[-1]`.
   - `array2` is a list.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` was either 1 or 2 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 2 if it was 1, or 3 if it was 2.
   - `n` must remain the same since the loop condition does not depend on changing `n` within the loop itself.

5. **Final States**:
   - `arr` remains unchanged.
   - `i` becomes 2 if it was 1, or 3 if it was 2.
   - `n` remains greater than 1.
   - `f` remains `feat[1]`.
   - `a` remains `feat[2]`.
   - `b` remains `feat[-1]`.
   - `array2` remains unchanged unless the conditions inside the loop change its contents.

Given these points, the updated states for the start of the next iteration are:

**State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `i` is 2 (if it was 1, otherwise 3), `n` must be greater than 1, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, and `array2` is a list.**
