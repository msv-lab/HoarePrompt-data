Postcondition: `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `array2` is a list containing either the value `arr[0] * feat[2]` (if `arr[0] < b / a`) or it remains an empty list (if `arr[0] >= b / a`), and the current value of `i` is 0.
