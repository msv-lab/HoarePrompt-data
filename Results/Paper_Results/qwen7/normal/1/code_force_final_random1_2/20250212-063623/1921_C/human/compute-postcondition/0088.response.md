Based on the initial state provided:

- `arr` is an array of integers.
- `i` is `n-1`, where `n` is the length of the array `arr`.
- `a` is a non-zero value.
- `b` is a value.
- `array2` contains all elements \((arr[i+1] - arr[i]) * a\) for each `i` where the difference between `arr[i+1]` and `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to `b / a`.

The `print('No')` statement simply prints the string `'No'`.

Since the code snippet only contains the `print('No')` statement and does not depend on the values of `arr`, `i`, `a`, `b`, or `array2`, the output will be the string `'No'`.

Output: **No**
