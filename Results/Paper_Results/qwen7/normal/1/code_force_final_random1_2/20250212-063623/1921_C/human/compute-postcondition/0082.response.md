Output State: **Postcondition: `arr` is an array of integers, `i` is `n-1`, `a` is a non-zero value, `b` is a value, and `array2` contains all elements `(arr[i+1] - arr[i]) * a` for each `i` where the difference between `arr[i+1]` and `arr[i]` is less than `b / a`.**

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `array2` will contain all the valid differences between consecutive elements of `arr`, scaled by `a`, as long as these differences are less than `b / a`. The loop starts with `i` being `n` and decrements `i` until it reaches `1`, checking the condition for each pair of consecutive elements in `arr`.
