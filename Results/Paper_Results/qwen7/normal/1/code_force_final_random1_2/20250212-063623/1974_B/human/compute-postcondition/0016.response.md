Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is `len(unique_chars)`, `unique_chars` has `char` inserted at index 1, `s` is modified according to the rules specified.**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` is 1, so after executing the code, `i` becomes 2. The values of `j`, `unique_chars`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial state.
