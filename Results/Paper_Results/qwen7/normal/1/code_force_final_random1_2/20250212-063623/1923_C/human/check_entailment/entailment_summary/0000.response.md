Reasoning:
1. The problem requires checking if a subarray is "good" based on specific conditions.
2. A subarray is considered "good" if there exists another array `b` that meets three criteria:
   - The sums of `a` and `b` are equal.
   - All elements in `a` and `b` are different.
   - All elements in `b` are positive.
3. The provided solution attempts to check if a subarray is "good" using a different approach:
   - It calculates the cumulative sums (`p`) and counts of ones (`c`) for the entire array.
   - For each query, it computes the sum of the subarray and the count of ones within the subarray.
   - It then checks if the subarray can potentially be "good" by comparing the sum of the subarray minus its length with the count of ones.
4. The logic in the solution seems to be flawed because:
   - The condition `s - (b - a + 1) >= i` does not fully capture the requirements for a subarray to be "good".
   - This condition only checks if the sum of the subarray minus its length is greater than or equal to the count of ones, which is not sufficient to guarantee the existence of a valid `b` array.
   - The solution does not explicitly construct or verify the existence of such a `b` array.

Given these points, the provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if a subarray is "good".

Correctness: **False**
