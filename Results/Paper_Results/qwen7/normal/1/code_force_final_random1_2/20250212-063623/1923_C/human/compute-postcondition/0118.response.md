Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers representing the last pair of numbers entered through input, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, `m` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations executed minus 1, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in the list `l`. The values of `a`, `b`, `i`, `s`, `m`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged from their initial states.
