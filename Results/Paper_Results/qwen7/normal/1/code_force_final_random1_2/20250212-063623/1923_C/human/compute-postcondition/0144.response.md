Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(m)`. The variables involved here are `_` (which is typically an underscore used as a throwaway variable) and `m`.

2. **Determine the initial state required for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute `m` times. Therefore, `m` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute at all.

3. **Adjust the given states**: We need to ensure that the loop can execute based on the given conditions. The states provided are:
   - `i` will be the sum of all elements in the list `l` after all iterations.
   - `j` will be the count of 1's in the list `l` after all iterations.
   - `p` will be a list starting with 0 followed by the cumulative sums of `l`.
   - `c` will be a list starting with 0 followed by the cumulative counts of 1's in `l`.

4. **Adjust the necessary states**: Since the loop head involves `m`, we need to ensure that `m` is greater than 0. The other states (`i`, `j`, `p`, and `c`) are results of the loop body and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `m` to ensure the loop can execute.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`m` must be greater than 0**
