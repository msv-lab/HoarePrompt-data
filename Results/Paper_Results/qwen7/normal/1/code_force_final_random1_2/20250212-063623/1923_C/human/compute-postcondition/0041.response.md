Postcondition: `m` must be greater than 0, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. If `b - a + 1` is greater than 1 and `s - (b - a + 1)` is greater than or equal to `i`, then `s - (b - a + 1)` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `s - (b - a + 1)` is set to be less than `i`.
