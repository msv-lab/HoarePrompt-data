Based on the initial state provided:

- `m` is greater than 0.
- `a` and `b` are integers from the input.
- `i` is calculated as `c[b] - c[a - 1]`.
- `s` is calculated as `p[b] - p[a - 1]`.
- The expression `s - (b - a + 1)` is greater than or equal to `i`.
- `b - a + 1` is greater than 1.

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('YES')
```

This statement will print the string 'YES' regardless of the values of the other variables and their relationships.

Output: **YES**
