Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input**.

Explanation: The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to variables `a` and `b`. The initial state of `m` being greater than 0 remains unchanged. Therefore, `m` must still be greater than 0, while `a` and `b` are now integers derived from the input.
