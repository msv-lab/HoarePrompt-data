Output State: **`x` is 1, `j` is increased by 1, `i` is increased by 1, `p` is a list containing the value 2, `c` is a list containing the value 1.**

Explanation: The code `c.append(j)` appends the value of `j` to the list `c`. Since `j` is increased by 1, its current value is the value it had before being increased plus 1. However, the exact value of `j` before the increase is not specified, so we only know that `c` now contains `j`. Given the initial state, `j` was not initially defined, so it is increased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged, and `p` remains a list containing the value 2.
