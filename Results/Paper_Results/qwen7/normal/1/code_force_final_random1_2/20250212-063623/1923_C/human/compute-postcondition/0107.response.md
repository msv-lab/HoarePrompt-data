Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `_` (which is just a placeholder), `m`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `s`, and the conditions that determine if the loop continues.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `m` is greater than 0 and the condition `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i` is satisfied.

3. **Determine the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` is an integer equal to the first input number.
   - `b` is an integer equal to the second input number.
   - `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`.
   - `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`.
   - `m` must be greater than 0.

4. **Check the loop condition at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `b - a + 1 > 1` is true.
   - `s - (b - a + 1) >= i` is true.

5. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop condition is true, `m` will be decremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration.
   - `a`, `b`, `i`, and `s` remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop body and their values are determined before the loop starts.

6. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - `m` must be greater than 0 and will be decremented by 1.
   - The other variables (`a`, `b`, `i`, `s`) remain the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`a` is an integer equal to the first input number, `b` is an integer equal to the second input number, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, and `m` must be greater than 1.**
