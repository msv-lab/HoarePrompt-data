Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is the first positive integer entered by the user, `m` is the second positive integer entered by the user, `l` is a list of integers created from the input split and mapped to integers, `p` is a list containing the single element 0.**

The code initializes `p` as a list containing a single element, which is 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, or `l`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
