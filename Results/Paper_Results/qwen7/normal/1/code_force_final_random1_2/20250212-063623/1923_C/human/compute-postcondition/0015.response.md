Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `x` and `l`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as there are elements left in the list `l`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `x` is the first element of the list `l`, `i` is increased by the value of `x`, and `j` is increased by 1 if `x` equals 1. `p` contains the value of `i`, and `c` contains the value of `j`.

3. **Update the states based on the loop head variables**:
   - Since `x` is the first element of the list `l`, and the loop continues as long as there are elements in `l`, the next element in the list `l` will be the new value of `x`.
   - `i` is increased by the value of `x`, so we need to add the value of the next element in `l` to the current value of `i`.
   - `j` is increased by 1 if `x` equals 1. We need to check if the next element in `l` equals 1 and update `j` accordingly.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `l` will now be the list without the first element (since `x` was the first element).
   - `x` will be the new first element of the updated list `l`.
   - `i` will be the current value of `i` plus the value of the new `x`.
   - `j` will be the current value of `j` plus 1 if the new `x` equals 1.

Given the initial states:
- `l` is a list of integers with at least one element.
- `x` is the first element of the list `l`.
- `i` is increased by the value of `x`.
- `j` is increased by 1 if `x` equals 1.
- `p` is a list containing the value of `i`.
- `c` is a list containing the value of `j`.

After the loop iterates once, the new states should be:
- `l` is the list without the first element.
- `x` is the new first element of the updated list `l`.
- `i` is the current value of `i` plus the value of the new `x`.
- `j` is the current value of `j` plus 1 if the new `x` equals 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`l` is a list of integers with at least one element, `x` is the new first element of the list `l`, `i` is the current value of `i` plus the value of the new `x`, `j` is the current value of `j` plus 1 if the new `x` equals 1, `p` is a list containing the value of `i`, `c` is a list containing the value of `j`**.
