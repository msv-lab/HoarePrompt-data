Based on the initial state provided:

- `m` must be greater than 1.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer.
- `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`.
- `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`.

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`. There are no variables or objects within the `print` statement itself that need further evaluation. Therefore, the output is directly the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
