Output State: **`m` must be greater than 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `s - (b - a + 1)` is non-negative, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `c[b] - c[a - 1]` to the variable `i`. The values of `m`, `a`, `b`, and `s - (b - a + 1)` remain unchanged from their initial states.
