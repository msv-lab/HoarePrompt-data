Postcondition: **`a` is an integer equal to the first input number, `b` is an integer equal to the second input number, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, and `m` must be greater than 0. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, then no changes are made. Otherwise, no changes are made.**

This postcondition summarizes that regardless of the condition in the if statement, the values of `a`, `b`, `i`, `s`, and `m` remain unchanged because the provided if and else parts do not perform any operations that would alter these variables.
