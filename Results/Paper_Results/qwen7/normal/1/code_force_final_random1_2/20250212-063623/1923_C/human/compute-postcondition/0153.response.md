Output: **NO**

Explanation:
- `m` is greater than 0 but its specific value is not needed to determine the output of the print statement.
- `a` and `b` are integers from the input, but their specific values are not provided.
- `i` is calculated as `c[b] - c[a - 1]`.
- `s` is calculated as `p[b] - p[a - 1]`.
- The condition `s - (b - a + 1) < i` is given but not used to determine the output since the print statement simply outputs 'NO'.

Therefore, regardless of the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `p`, `i`, and `s`, the print statement will always output 'NO'.
