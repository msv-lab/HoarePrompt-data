Output State: **`a` is an integer equal to the first input number, `b` is an integer equal to the second input number, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, and `m` must be greater than 1.**

Explanation: The code snippet `s = p[b] - p[a - 1]` does not change the values of `a`, `b`, `i`, or `m`. It only updates the value of `s` to be `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. Therefore, the values of `a`, `b`, `i`, and `m` remain unchanged from their initial states.
