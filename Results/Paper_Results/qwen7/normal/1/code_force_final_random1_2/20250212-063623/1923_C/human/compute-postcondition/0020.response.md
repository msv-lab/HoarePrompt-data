Output State: **`l` is a list of integers with at least one element, `x` is the new first element of the list `l`, `i` is the current value of `i` plus the value of `x`, `j` is the current value of `j` plus 1 if the new `x` equals 1, `p` is a list containing the value of `i` appended, `c` is a list containing the value of `j`.**

Explanation: The code `p.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` to the list `p`. The values of `l`, `x`, `i`, `j`, and `c` remain unchanged from their initial states.
