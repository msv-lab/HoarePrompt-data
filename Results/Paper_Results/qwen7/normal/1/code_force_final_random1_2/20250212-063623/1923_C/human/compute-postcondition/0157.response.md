Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, `a` and `b` are updated to new integer values from the input.**

Explanation: The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to variables `a` and `b`. The values of `m`, `c`, `i`, `p`, and `s` remain unchanged from their previous states.
