Output State: **`m` is updated to be the second integer entered through input, `a` and `b` are the last pair of integers entered through input, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, `n` is the first integer entered through input, `l` is a list of integers split from the input.**

Explanation: The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, converts each integer to an int, and stores them in a list `l`. The length of `l` is `m - 1` from the initial state, so `m` is updated to be the second integer entered through input. The values of `a`, `b`, `i`, `s`, and `n` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.
