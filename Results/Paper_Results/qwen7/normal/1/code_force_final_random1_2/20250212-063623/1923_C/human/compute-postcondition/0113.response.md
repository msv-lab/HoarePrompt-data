Postcondition: **`a` is an integer equal to the first input number, `b` is an integer equal to the second input number, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, and `m` must be greater than 1. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, then no changes are made to `i` and `s`. Otherwise, no specific changes are made to `i` and `s` as well.**
