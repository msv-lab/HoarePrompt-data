Output State: **`a` is an integer equal to the first input number, `b` is an integer equal to the second input number, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `p[b] - p[a - 1]` to the variable `s`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `s` is updated to reflect this calculation while keeping the other variables as they were initially.
