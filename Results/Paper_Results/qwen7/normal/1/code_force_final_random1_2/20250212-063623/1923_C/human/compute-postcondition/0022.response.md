Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variables `x` and `i` and `j` and `l`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element `x` in the list `l`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `l` is a list of integers with at least one element.
   - `x` is the new first element of the list `l`.
   - `i` is the current value of `i` plus the value of `x`.
   - `j` is the current value of `j` plus 1 if the new `x` equals 1.
   - `p` is a list containing the value of `i` appended.
   - `c` is a list containing the value of `j` and the updated value of `j` appended.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `x` is the new first element of the list `l`, after the next iteration, `x` will be the second element of the list `l`.
   - `i` will be updated to the current value of `i` plus the new value of `x`.
   - `j` will be updated to the current value of `j` plus 1 if the new `x` equals 1.
   - `p` will contain the updated value of `i` appended.
   - `c` will contain the updated value of `j` and the new value of `j` appended.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `l` will now be a list with at least two elements (the original list minus the first element plus the new first element).
   - `x` will be the second element of the list `l`.
   - `i` will be the current value of `i` plus the new value of `x`.
   - `j` will be the current value of `j` plus 1 if the new `x` equals 1.
   - `p` will contain the updated value of `i` appended.
   - `c` will contain the updated value of `j` and the new value of `j` appended.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`l` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `x` is the second element of the list `l`, `i` is the current value of `i` plus the value of `x`, `j` is the current value of `j` plus 1 if the new `x` equals 1, `p` is a list containing the updated value of `i` appended, `c` is a list containing the updated value of `j` and the new value of `j` appended**.
