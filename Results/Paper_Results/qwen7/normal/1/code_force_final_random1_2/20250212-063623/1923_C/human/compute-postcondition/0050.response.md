Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`**.

Explanation: The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers from the input and assigns them to `a` and `b` respectively. The values of `m`, `i`, and `s` remain unchanged from their previous states. The precondition that `m` must be greater than 0 is still valid. The values of `a` and `b` are now specific integers from the input, while `i` and `s` are still defined in terms of `c` and `p`.
