Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is the first positive integer entered by the user, `m` is the second positive integer entered by the user, `l` is a list of integers created from the input split and mapped to integers, `p` is a list containing the single element 0, `c` is a list containing the single element 0.**

The code initializes the list `c` with a single element `0`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, or `p`. Therefore, their states remain unchanged, and `c` is updated to contain the single element `0`.
