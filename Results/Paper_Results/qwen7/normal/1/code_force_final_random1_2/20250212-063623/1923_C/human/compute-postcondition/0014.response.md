Output State: **`l` is a list of integers with at least one element, `x` is the first element of the list `l`, `i` is increased by the value of `x`, `j` is increased by 1 if `x` equals 1, `p` is a list containing the value of `i`, `c` is a list containing the value of `j`.**

Explanation: The code `c.append(j)` appends the current value of `j` to the list `c`. Since `j` is increased by 1 if `x` equals 1, and `x` is the first element of the list `l`, the value of `j` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `x` is 1 or not. The lists `l`, `p`, and the updated values of `i` and `j` remain as described in the initial state, with `c` now containing the value of `j`.
