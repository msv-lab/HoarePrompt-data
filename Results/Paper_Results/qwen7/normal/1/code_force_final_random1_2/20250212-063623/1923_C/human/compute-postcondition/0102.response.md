Output State: **`a` is an integer equal to the first input number, `b` is an integer equal to the second input number, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, and `m` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `i` to `c[b] - c[a - 1]`. The values of `a`, `b`, `s`, and `m` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions for `a`, `b`, `s`, and `m`, while updating `i` to the new value.
