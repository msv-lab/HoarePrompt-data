Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is the first positive integer entered by the user, `m` is the second positive integer entered by the user, `l` is a list of integers created from the input split and mapped to integers.**

The code creates a list `l` by taking a single line of input from the user, splitting it into individual elements, and converting each element to an integer using the `map` function. The original values of `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.
