Postcondition: `a` is an integer equal to the first input number, `b` is an integer equal to the second input number, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. If the condition `(b - a + 1 > 1 and s - (b - a + 1) >= i)` is true, the program does not change `i` and `s`. Otherwise, the difference `s - (b - a + 1)` is less than `i`, and `b - a + 1` is less than or equal to 1.
