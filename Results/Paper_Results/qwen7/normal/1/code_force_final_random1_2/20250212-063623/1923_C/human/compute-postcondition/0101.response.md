Output State: **`a` is an integer equal to the first input number, `b` is an integer equal to the second input number, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, and `m` must be greater than 0. `a` and `b` have been updated to the values of the integers inputted by the user.**

Explanation: The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `a` and `b` respectively. The values of `i` and `s` remain unchanged because they are not affected by this line of code. The precondition that `m` must be greater than 0 remains valid.
