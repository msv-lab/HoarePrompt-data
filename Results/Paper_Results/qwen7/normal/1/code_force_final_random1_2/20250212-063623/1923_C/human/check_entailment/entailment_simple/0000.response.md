Reasoning:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if a subarray is "good" according to the problem statement. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Subarray Sum and Count of 1s**:
   - The code calculates the prefix sums (`p`) and counts of 1s in the subarray (`c`). However, it does not correctly compute these values for the subarray in question. Instead, it computes these values for the entire array up to the current index.

2. **Condition Check**:
   - The condition check `if b - a + 1 > 1 and s - (b - a + 1) >= i:` is flawed. This condition checks if the sum of the subarray minus the number of elements in the subarray is greater than or equal to the count of 1s in the subarray. However, this does not guarantee that the subarray can be transformed into another array `b` that meets all the conditions of being "good".

3. **Missing Logic to Verify "Good" Array Conditions**:
   - The code does not verify whether the subarray can be transformed into another array `b` that satisfies all the conditions of being "good". Specifically, it does not ensure that the subarray can be rearranged such that all elements are different and positive.

Given these issues, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
