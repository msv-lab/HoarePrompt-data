Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for x in l:`. The only variable involved here is `x` and `l`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `l` is a list of integers split from the input.
   - `x` will take on each value from the list `l` during each iteration of the loop.

3. **Understand the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, the list `l` must contain at least one element. If `l` is empty, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since the loop depends on the list `l` having at least one element, we need to ensure that `l` contains at least one integer.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are those related to the list `l`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`l` is a list of integers that must have at least one element**
