Postcondition: **`m` must be greater than 0, `a` and `b` are updated to new integer values from the input, and the following holds: if `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, then the condition `s - (b - a + 1) >= i` is satisfied. Otherwise, no additional constraints are imposed on `s - (b - a + 1)` beyond it being non-negative.**
