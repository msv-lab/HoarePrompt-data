Output State: **`l` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `x` is the next integer in the list, `j` is increased by 1, `i` is increased by `x`, `p` is a list containing the value of `i`, `c` is a list containing the value of `j + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `i += x` increases the value of `i` by the value of `x`. The other variables (`l`, `j`, `p`, and `c`) remain unchanged from their initial state. Note that `j` is increased by 1 before the code is executed, so when we refer to `j` in the output state, it is now `j + 1`.
