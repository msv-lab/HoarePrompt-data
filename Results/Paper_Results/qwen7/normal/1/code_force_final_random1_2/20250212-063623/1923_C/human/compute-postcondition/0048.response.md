Postcondition: **`m` must be greater than 1, `a` and `b` are integers from the input, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, and `a` and `b` are updated to integers from the input. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, then the condition holds as is. Otherwise, the condition also holds as is.**
