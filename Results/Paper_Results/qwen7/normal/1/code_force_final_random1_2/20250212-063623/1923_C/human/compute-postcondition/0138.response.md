Output State: **`j` is increased by 1, `i` is increased by 1, `p` is a list containing the value 2, `c` is a list containing the value 1**.

Explanation: The code `j += 1` increments the value of `j` by 1. The values of `i`, `p`, and `c` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `j` is increased by 1, while `i` is also increased by 1, and `p` and `c` retain their original values.
