Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is the first positive integer entered by the user, `m` is the second positive integer entered by the user**.

Explanation: The code splits the input into two integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The first integer is assigned to `n` and the second integer is assigned to `m`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
