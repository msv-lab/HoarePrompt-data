Output State: **`l` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `x` is the next integer in the list, `j` is increased by 1, `i` is increased by `x`, `p` is a list containing the value of `i`, `c` is a list containing the value of `j + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `p.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` to the list `p`. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes that `p` now contains the value of `i`.
