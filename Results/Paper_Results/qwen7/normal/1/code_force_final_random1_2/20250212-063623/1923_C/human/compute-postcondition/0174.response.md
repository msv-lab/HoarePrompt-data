Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a list `c` of n positive integers and handles q queries. For each query, it checks if a given range [l_i, r_i] within the list satisfies certain conditions and returns the result accordingly.**

This means the function is designed to work with a predefined list `c` and a set of queries. It does not take any parameters when called but uses an external list `c` and processes `q` queries, each defined by a range `[l_i, r_i]` within the list `c`. The function checks some conditions within the specified range and returns the result based on those conditions.
