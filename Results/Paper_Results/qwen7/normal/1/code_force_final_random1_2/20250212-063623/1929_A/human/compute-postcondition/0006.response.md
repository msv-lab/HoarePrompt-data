Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `itest` and `ntest`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ntest` is an input integer.
   - `itest` must be between 0 and `ntest`-1 inclusive.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `itest` is 0.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `0` to `ntest-1` with a step of `1`. Therefore, the loop will continue as long as `itest` is less than `ntest`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `itest` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `itest` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - The condition for the next iteration is that `itest` must still be less than `ntest`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `ntest` remains the same (as it is an input integer and does not change within the loop).
- `itest` is incremented by 1, so it becomes 1.
- `itest` must still be less than `ntest`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `ntest` is an input integer, `itest` must be between 0 and `ntest`-1 inclusive, and `itest` is 1**
