You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program:
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, ntest, 1):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        print(a[len(a) - 1] - a[0])



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer n and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. For each test case, it sorts the list of integers and calculates the difference between the largest and smallest integers in the sorted list. It then prints this difference for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but outputs the differences for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements, i.e., \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution**:
   - The solution reads the number of test cases (`ntest`).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a`.
   - It sorts the array `a` in ascending order.
   - Finally, it prints the difference between the largest and smallest elements in the sorted array, i.e., `a[len(a) - 1] - a[0]`.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - Sorting the array ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are minimized when the array is in increasing order.
   - The maximum beauty is achieved by maximizing the positive differences and minimizing the negative ones. By sorting the array, we ensure that the largest element is paired with the smallest element, which gives us the maximum possible difference.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the array has only two elements, sorting them will still give the maximum possible difference.
   - If all elements are the same, the beauty will be zero, which is correctly handled by the solution.
   - The solution handles arrays of different sizes and values within the specified constraints.

Given the above analysis, the provided solution correctly maximizes the beauty of the array by sorting it and calculating the difference between the largest and smallest elements.

Correctness: **True**
