Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array. The program sorts the array and prints the difference between the maximum and minimum values, which does not necessarily maximize the sum of differences \( (a_i - a_{i-1}) \).

To achieve the maximum beauty, we need to arrange the array such that the largest values are adjacent to the smallest values, except for the first and last elements. However, the current implementation only considers the difference between the maximum and minimum values, which is not sufficient.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
100 54 80 43 90
```
The program sorts the array to `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]` and outputs `100 - 43 = 57`. However, the optimal arrangement would be `[100, 43, 54, 80, 90]`, resulting in a beauty of \( (100 - 43) + (43 - 54) + (54 - 80) + (80 - 90) = 57 - 11 - 26 - 10 = 57 - 47 = 10 \).

Thus, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly and hence is incorrect.
