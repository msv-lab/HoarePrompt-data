You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, ntest, 1):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a.sort()
        
        print(a[len(a) - 1] - a[0])
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `ntest` is an input integer, `itest` is equal to `ntest`, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer for each iteration, and `n` is an input integer for each iteration.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop has completed all its iterations, `ntest` will be the last value it was set to, which is also the number of times the loop ran. The variable `a` will hold the sorted list of integers from the last input, and `n` will be the last input integer processed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input data consisting of a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) representing the number of test cases, followed by t sets of input. Each set includes an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). For each set, the function returns a specific value based on the input data.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
