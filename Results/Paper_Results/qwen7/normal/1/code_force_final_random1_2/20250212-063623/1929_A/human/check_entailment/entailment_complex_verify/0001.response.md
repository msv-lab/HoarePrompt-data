### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements, i.e., \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution**:
   - The solution reads the number of test cases (`ntest`).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a`.
   - It sorts the array `a` in ascending order.
   - Finally, it prints the difference between the largest and smallest elements in the sorted array, i.e., `a[len(a) - 1] - a[0]`.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - Sorting the array ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are minimized when the array is in increasing order.
   - However, the goal is to maximize the beauty, which means we want to maximize the positive differences and minimize the negative ones. Sorting the array in ascending order only considers the extreme values (largest and smallest) without considering the arrangement of other elements.

4. **Counterexample**:
   - Consider the array `[1, 100, 2]`. The beauty calculated by sorting and taking the difference between the largest and smallest elements would be \(100 - 1 = 99\).
   - However, if we rearrange the array to `[100, 2, 1]`, the beauty would be \((100 - 2) + (2 - 1) = 99 + 1 = 100\), which is greater than 99.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The current solution only considers the extreme values and does not explore all possible permutations of the array to find the maximum beauty.
   - Therefore, the solution is not guaranteed to find the maximum beauty for all possible input arrays.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given solution is incorrect because it does not consider all possible permutations of the array to find the maximum beauty. Sorting the array and taking the difference between the largest and smallest elements does not always yield the maximum possible beauty.
