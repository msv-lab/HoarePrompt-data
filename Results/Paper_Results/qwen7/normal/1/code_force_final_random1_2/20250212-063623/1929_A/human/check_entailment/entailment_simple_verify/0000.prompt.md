You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program: 
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, ntest, 1):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        print(a[len(a) - 1] - a[0])



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, ntest, 1):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a.sort()
        
        print(a[len(a) - 1] - a[0])
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `ntest` is an input integer, `itest` is equal to `ntest`, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer for each iteration, and `n` is an input integer for each iteration.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop has completed all its iterations, `ntest` will be the last value it was set to, which is also the number of times the loop ran. The variable `a` will hold the sorted list of integers from the last input, and `n` will be the last input integer processed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array. The program sorts the array and prints the difference between the maximum and minimum values, which does not necessarily maximize the sum of differences \( (a_i - a_{i-1}) \).

To achieve the maximum beauty, we need to arrange the array such that the largest values are adjacent to the smallest values, except for the first and last elements. However, the current implementation only considers the difference between the maximum and minimum values, which is not sufficient.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
100 54 80 43 90
```
The program sorts the array to `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]` and outputs `100 - 43 = 57`. However, the optimal arrangement would be `[100, 43, 54, 80, 90]`, resulting in a beauty of \( (100 - 43) + (43 - 54) + (54 - 80) + (80 - 90) = 57 - 11 - 26 - 10 = 57 - 47 = 10 \).

Thus, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly and hence is incorrect.
