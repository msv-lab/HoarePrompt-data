Output State: **`a[i]` is 0 - `a[i]`, `a[i + 1]` is decremented by `4 * opNum`, `a[i + 2]` is decremented by `4 * opNum`, `stop` is `True`, `i` is `0`, `n` is `3`, `opNum` is `a[i]`**.

Explanation: The code `a[i] -= opNum` subtracts `opNum` from `a[i]`. Given that `a[i]` was initially 0 and `opNum` is equal to `a[i]`, which is 0, `a[i]` remains 0. The values of `a[i + 1]` and `a[i + 2]` are decremented by `4 * opNum`, which is 0, so their values remain unchanged. The variables `stop`, `i`, `n`, and `opNum` are not affected by this operation.
