Output State: **`stop` is `True`, `i` is `n-3`, `opNum` is equal to `a[i] - opNum`, `a[i+2]` is decreased by `opNum`**

Explanation: The line `stop = True` does not change any existing values but updates the variable `stop` to `True`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
