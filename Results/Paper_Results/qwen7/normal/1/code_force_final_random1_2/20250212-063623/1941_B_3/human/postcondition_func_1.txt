The function accepts a list of integers and its length. It iterates through the list (excluding the first and last elements) and modifies the middle elements based on specific conditions. If `func_1(list, n)` returns `True`, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. Regardless of the outcome, the function does not change the final state of the list or the index `i`.
