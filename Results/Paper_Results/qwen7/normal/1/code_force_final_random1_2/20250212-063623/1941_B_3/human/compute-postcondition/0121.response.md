Postcondition: `a[i]` is decremented by `opNum`, `a[i + 1]` is decremented by `2 * opNum`, `a[i + 2]` is decremented by `2 * opNum`, `stop` is `True`, `i` is `0`, `n` is `3, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[i]` is less than 0, then `a[i]` is further decremented by `opNum`, `a[i + 1]` is further decremented by `2 * opNum`, `a[i + 2]` is further decremented by `2 * opNum`, `stop` is set to `True`, `i` remains `0`, and `n` remains `3, causing us to break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
