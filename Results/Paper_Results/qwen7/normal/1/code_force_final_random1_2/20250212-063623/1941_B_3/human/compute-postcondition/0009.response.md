Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an input integer, `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer. The first element of `b` is either an odd number and the second element is not equal to the first element plus 2, or the last element of `b` is an odd number and the second last element is not equal to the last element plus 2, or the first element of `b` is even or the second element equals the first element plus 2 and the last element is even or the second last element equals the last element plus 2.
