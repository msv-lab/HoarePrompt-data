Output State: **`a[i]` is decremented by `opNum`, `a[i + 1]` is decremented by `2 * opNum`, `a[i + 2]` is decremented by `2 * opNum`, `stop` is `True`, `i` is `0`, `n` is `3**.

In this output state, the variable `stop` has been set to `True`, while the values of `a[i]`, `a[i + 1]`, `a[i + 2]`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
