Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a set of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), and an array a of n integers (0 ≤ a_j ≤ 10^9). For each test case, the function returns a result based on the given inputs.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing a specific number of test parameters, and process them according to the defined constraints and relationships. However, since the function definition itself does not accept any parameters, the processing logic would be inferred from the described behavior.
