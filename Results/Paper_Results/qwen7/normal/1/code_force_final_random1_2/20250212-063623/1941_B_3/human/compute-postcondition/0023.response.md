Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an input integer, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the final input string split on spaces and converted to integers, `num` is the initial value of `t` minus the total number of iterations, `a` is assigned the value of the final input integer, and `b` is updated with the final list of integers.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` will still be within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). The variable `a` will hold the value of the last integer input, and `b` will contain the list of integers corresponding to the last input. The variable `num` will be the initial value of `t` reduced by the total number of iterations performed.
