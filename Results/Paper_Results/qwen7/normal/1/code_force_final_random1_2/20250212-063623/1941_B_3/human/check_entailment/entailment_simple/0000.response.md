Reasoning:
1. The function `func()` processes each test case independently.
2. It checks the first and last elements of the array to see if they can be reduced to zero according to the given operation rules.
3. The operation allows reducing three consecutive elements by a specific pattern, but the key observation is whether the first and last elements can be manipulated to become zero.
4. The condition `if b[0] % 2 == 1 and b[1] != b[0] + 2 or b[-1] % 2 == 1 and b[-2] != b[-1] + 2:` checks if the first or last element cannot be reduced to zero due to parity issues or mismatched values.
5. If either condition is true, it prints 'NO', indicating that it's impossible to make all elements zero. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.
6. However, the logic in the function is flawed because it only checks the first and last elements without considering the entire array. This means it might incorrectly determine that an array can be made zero when it actually cannot.

Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The function `func()` is incorrect because it only checks the first and last elements of the array, which is insufficient to determine if the entire array can be made zero. The correct approach would involve checking if the sum of the array is even and ensuring that no element violates the reduction rules when combined with its neighbors. The current implementation fails to account for these broader conditions.
