Output State: **`numTest` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers where the (i+1)-th element is decreased by 2 * `opNum`, `stop` is `True`, and `a[i + 2]` is decreased by `opNum`, and `i` is `n-3`; `a[i]` is decreased by `opNum`.**

Explanation: The code `a[i] -= opNum` decreases the value of `a[i]` by the value of `opNum`. Given the initial conditions, `i` is `n-3`, and `opNum` is assigned the value of `a[i]`. Therefore, `a[i]` is decreased by its own value, making `a[i]` equal to 0 if it was initially non-zero. All other conditions remain unchanged.
