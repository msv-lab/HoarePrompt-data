Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine whether it's possible to make all elements of the array zero using the specified operations. The program only checks the first two and the last two elements of the array against certain conditions and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on these checks. However, the conditions checked are too restrictive and do not cover all scenarios where making all elements zero is possible.

For example, consider the array `[1, 3, 5, 5, 2]`. According to the program, since the first two elements do not meet the condition (1 is not odd, and 3 is not equal to 1+2), it would incorrectly print 'NO'. But as shown in the example in the problem description, it is indeed possible to make all elements zero with the given operations.

Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
