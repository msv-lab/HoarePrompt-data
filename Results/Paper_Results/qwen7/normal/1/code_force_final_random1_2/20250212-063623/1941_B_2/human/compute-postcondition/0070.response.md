Output State: **`numTest` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers where each element from `a[0]` to `a[n-3]` has been decreased by `opNum`, each element from `a[1]` to `a[n-2]` has been decreased by 2 * `opNum`, each element from `a[2]` to `a[n-1]` has been decreased by `opNum`, `stop` is `True`, `i` is `n-4`, `opNum` is now equal to `a[i+1]` and `a[i+1]` is decreased by `2 * opNum`.**

Explanation:
- Initially, `i` is `n-3`.
- After executing `a[i + 1] -= 2 * opNum`, `i` becomes `n-4` because `i` is decremented by 1.
- `opNum` remains unchanged and is still equal to `a[i]`, which is now `a[n-4]`.
- `a[i+1]` (which is `a[n-3]`) is decreased by `2 * opNum`.
