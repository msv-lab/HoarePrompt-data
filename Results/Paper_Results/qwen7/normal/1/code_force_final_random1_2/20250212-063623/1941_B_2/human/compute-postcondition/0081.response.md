Output State: **`numTest` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers where each element from `a[0]` to `a[n-3]` has been decreased by `opNum`, each element from `a[1]` to `a[n-2]` has been decreased by `2 * opNum`, each element from `a[2]` to `a[n-1]` has been decreased by `opNum`, `stop` is `True`, `i` is `n-5`, `opNum` is now equal to `a[i+1] - 2 * opNum`, `a[i+2]` is decreased by `opNum`, `a[i]` is now equal to `a[i] - opNum`, `a[i+2]` is further decreased by `opNum`**.

Explanation: The code `a[i + 2] -= opNum` decreases the value of `a[i + 2]` by `opNum`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged from the initial state.
