Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer.
- `b[0]` is even or `b[1]` equals `b[0] + 2`.
- `b[-1]` is even or `b[-2]` equals `b[-1] + 2`.

The print statement is simply `print('YES')`. This statement does not depend on the values of any variables but rather prints a fixed string.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **YES**
