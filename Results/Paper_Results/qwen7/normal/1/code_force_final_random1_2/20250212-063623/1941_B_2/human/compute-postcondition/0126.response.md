Output State: **`a[i]` is 0 - `a[i]`, `a[i + 1]` is decremented by 6 * `opNum`, `a[i + 2]` is decremented by 8 * `opNum`, `stop` is `True`, `i` is `0`, `n` is `3`, `opNum` is `a[i]`**.

Explanation: The code `a[i + 2] -= opNum` decrements the value of `a[i + 2]` by `opNum`. Given the initial state, `opNum` is equal to `a[i]`, which is `0 - a[i]`. Since `a[i]` is `0 - a[i]`, substituting this into the expression gives `opNum` as `0 - (0 - a[i]) = a[i]`. Initially, `a[i + 2]` is decremented by `4 * opNum`, so now it is decremented by `8 * opNum` (since `opNum` is `a[i]` and `4 * opNum` was already applied). All other variables remain unchanged.
