Output State: **`stop` is `True`, `i` is `n-5`, `opNum` is now equal to `a[i+1]` which is decreased by `2 * opNum`, `a[i+2]` is decreased by `opNum`.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or match statement. In this case, since there is no loop or match statement that the `break` is associated with, the variables `stop`, `i`, `opNum`, and the values of `a[i+1]` and `a[i+2]` remain unchanged. We break out of the most internal loop or match statement we were directly inside, but no new values are assigned to the variables.
