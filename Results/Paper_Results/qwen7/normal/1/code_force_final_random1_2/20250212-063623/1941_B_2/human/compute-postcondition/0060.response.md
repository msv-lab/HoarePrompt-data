Output State: **`numTest` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers where each element from `a[0]` to `a[n-3]` has been decreased by `opNum`, each element from `a[1]` to `a[n-2]` has been decreased by 2 * `opNum`, each element from `a[2]` to `a[n-1]` has been decreased by `opNum`, `stop` is `True`, and `i` is `n-3`; `opNum` is equal to `a[i] - opNum`**.

Explanation: The code `a[i] -= opNum` decreases the value of `a[i]` by `opNum`. Given that initially `opNum` is equal to `a[i]`, after executing the code, `a[i]` will become `a[i] - opNum`, which simplifies to 0 since `opNum` was originally equal to `a[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
