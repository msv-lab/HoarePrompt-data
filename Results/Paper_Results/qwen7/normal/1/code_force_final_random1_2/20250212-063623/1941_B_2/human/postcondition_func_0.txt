The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and an array `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it checks if the first two elements of the array `a` meet specific conditions: both are odd and the second element equals the first element plus two, or if the last two elements meet similar conditions. If either condition is met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.
