Output State: **`numTest` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers where each element from `a[0]` to `a[n-3]` has been decreased by `opNum`, each element from `a[1]` to `a[n-2]` has been decreased by 2 * `opNum`, each element from `a[2]` to `a[n-1]` has been decreased by `opNum`, `stop` is `True`, and `i` is `n-4`, `opNum` is equal to `a[i] - opNum`**.

Explanation:
- The original value of `i` was `n-3`.
- After executing `a[i + 1] -= 2 * opNum`, the index `i + 1` becomes `n-2`, and the value at this index is decreased by `2 * opNum`.
- Since `i` is updated to `i + 1 - 1`, the new value of `i` is now `n-4`.
- All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
