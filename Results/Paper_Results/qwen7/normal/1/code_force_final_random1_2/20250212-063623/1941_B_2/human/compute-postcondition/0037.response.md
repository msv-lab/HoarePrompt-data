The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since the initial state includes the condition `stop == True`, which is already satisfied, the `continue` statement does not change the state of any variables. The loop will exit because the condition `stop == True` is met.

Output State: **`numTest` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers where each element from `a[0]` to `a[n-3]` has been decreased by `opNum`, each element from `a[1]` to `a[n-2]` has been decreased by 2 * `opNum`, each element from `a[2]` to `a[n-1]` has been decreased by `opNum`, `stop` is `True`, and `i` is `n-3`. The loop exits due to the condition `stop == True`.**
