Output State: **The list `a` will be empty, `stop` will be `True`, `i` will be `0`. We continue to the next iteration of the loop.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next one. Since no changes are made to the variables `a`, `stop`, or `i`, their values remain the same. The loop continues, and we are ready for the next iteration.
