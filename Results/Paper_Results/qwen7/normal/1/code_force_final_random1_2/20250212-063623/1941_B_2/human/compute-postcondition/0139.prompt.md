You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and a is a list of n non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a_j ≤ 10^9 for each element a_j in the list. The sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func():
    numTest = int(input())
    for _ in range(0, numTest):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        
        stop = False
        
        for i in range(0, n - 2):
            if a[i] < 0:
                print('NO')
                stop = True
                break
            opNum = a[i]
            a[i] -= opNum
            a[i + 1] -= 2 * opNum
            a[i + 2] -= opNum
        
        if stop == True:
            continue
        
        if a[len(a) - 1] != 0 or a[len(a) - 2] != 0:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `numTest` will be 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. For each test case, the list `a` will be fully processed according to the loop logic. If the last two elements of `a` are both 0 after processing, the output will be 'YES' for that test case; otherwise, it will be 'NO'. The variable `stop` will be `True` for all test cases since the loop breaks as soon as any negative value is encountered in `a`. The variable `i` will be `0` after the last iteration, indicating that the entire list `a` has been processed for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list `a` of `n` non-negative integers where each integer `a_j` satisfies 0 ≤ a_j ≤ 10^9, and an integer `n` such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5. Additionally, there is a positive integer `t` (not directly passed as a parameter) such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. The function returns a value based on the input list `a` and integer `n` for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
