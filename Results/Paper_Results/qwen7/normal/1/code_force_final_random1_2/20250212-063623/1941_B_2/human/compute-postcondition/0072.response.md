Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `numTest` must be greater than 0.
   - `n` must be greater than 2.
   - `a` is a list of integers where:
     - Each element from `a[0]` to `a[n-3]` has been decreased by `opNum`.
     - Each element from `a[1]` to `a[n-2]` has been decreased by `2 * opNum`.
     - Each element from `a[2]` to `a[n-1]` has been decreased by `opNum`.
   - `stop` is `True`.
   - `i` is `n-4`.
   - `opNum` is now equal to `a[i+1]` and `a[i+1]` is decreased by `2 * opNum`.
   - `a[i+2]` is decreased by `opNum`.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(0, n - 2):
   ```

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop variable `i` starts from `0` and increments by `1` in each iteration.
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < n - 2`.

4. **Current Values:**
   - `i` is currently `n-4`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will become `n-5`.

5. **Adjusting the State:**
   - Since `i` is incremented by `1`, the new value of `i` will be `n-5`.
   - `opNum` remains unchanged unless it is modified within the loop body, but there is no indication of such modification in the given information.
   - `a[i+1]` and `a[i+2]` are already adjusted based on the current value of `i` (which is `n-4`).

6. **Final State Adjustment:**
   - `numTest` remains greater than 0.
   - `n` remains greater than 2.
   - `a` remains as described, with the adjustments made.
   - `stop` remains `True` since no condition for changing it is provided.
   - `i` becomes `n-5`.
   - `opNum` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`numTest` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers where each element from `a[0]` to `a[n-3]` has been decreased by `opNum`, each element from `a[1]` to `a[n-2]` has been decreased by `2 * opNum`, each element from `a[2]` to `a[n-1]` has been decreased by `opNum`, `stop` is `True`, `i` is `n-5`, `opNum` is now equal to `a[i+1]` and `a[i+1]` is decreased by `2 * opNum`, `a[i+2]` is decreased by `opNum`.**
