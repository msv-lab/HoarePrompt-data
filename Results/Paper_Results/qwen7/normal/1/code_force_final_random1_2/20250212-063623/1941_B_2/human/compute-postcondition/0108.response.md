Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial conditions**:
   - `a` is a list of integers where each element is decremented by `opNum`.
   - `stop` is `True`.
   - `a[i + 2]` is decremented by `opNum`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `0` to `n - 2`, so the loop will continue as long as `i < n - 2`.

4. **Analyze the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` is a list of integers where each element is decremented by `opNum`.
   - `stop` is `True`.
   - `a[i + 2]` is decremented by `opNum`.

5. **Determine the changes needed for the next iteration**:
   - `i` needs to be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must still be less than `n - 2`.

6. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - `stop` remains `True` unless the loop body changes it.
   - `a[i + 2]` will be decremented by `opNum` again.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `stop` remains `True`.
- `a[i + 2]` is decremented by `opNum`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`a` is a list of integers where each element is decremented by `opNum`, `stop` is True, and `a[i + 2]` is decremented by `opNum`**.

To explicitly show the updated values:

- `i` is now `i + 1`.
- `a[i + 2]` is now `a[i + 2] - opNum`.

So, the final state is:

State: **`a` is a list of integers where each element is decremented by `opNum`, `stop` is True, and `a[i + 2]` is decremented by `opNum` (with `i` incremented by 1)**.
