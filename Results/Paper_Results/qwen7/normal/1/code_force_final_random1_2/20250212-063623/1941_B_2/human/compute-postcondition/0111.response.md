Output State: **`stop` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the value of `stop`, but it indicates that we have broken out of the innermost loop or conditional statement we were inside. Since the initial state of `stop` is `True`, and no other variables are affected by the `break` statement, the only change is that we have exited the loop or conditional.
