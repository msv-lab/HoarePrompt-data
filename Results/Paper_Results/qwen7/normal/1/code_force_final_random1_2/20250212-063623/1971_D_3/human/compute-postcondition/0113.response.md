Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `t` and a binary string `s`. For each test case, it counts the total number of transitions between different characters in the string `s`, adjusting the count by subtracting one if a '0' is immediately followed by a '1'. It also checks if there was at least one instance where a '0' was immediately followed by a '1'. The function prints the adjusted count for each test case and does not return any value.**
