Output State: **`current_year` is `ai`, `next_year` is `2*ai`, `results` is a list containing `ai`, `ai` is the first element of `a`.**

Explanation: The code updates `next_year` to be `current_year + ai`. Given that `current_year` is initially divisible by `ai` and equals `ai`, after executing the line `next_year = current_year + ai`, `next_year` becomes `ai + ai`, which is `2*ai`. The value of `current_year` remains `ai` since no assignment is made to it in the given code snippet. The list `results` contains the initial value of `current_year`, which is `ai`. The value of `ai` is the first element of `a`, which remains unchanged.
