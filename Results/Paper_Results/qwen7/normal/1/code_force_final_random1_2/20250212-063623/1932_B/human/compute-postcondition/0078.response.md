Output State: **`ai` is the third element of `a`, `current_year` is either the value of `next_year - ai` if `current_year % ai == 0`, or the value of `next_year` if it does not satisfy the condition, `results` includes the updated `current_year` or `next_year` for the current iteration, `a` remains the same, `n` remains the same, and `current_year` is now equal to `next_year`.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the value of `next_year` to `current_year`. This means that the value of `current_year` is now the same as `next_year`, while all other variables remain unchanged.
