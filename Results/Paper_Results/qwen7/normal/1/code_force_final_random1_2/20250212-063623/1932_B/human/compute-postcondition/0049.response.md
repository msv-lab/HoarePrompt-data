Output State: **`current_year` is equal to `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`, `next_year` is equal to `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `next_year` to `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`. Since `current_year` is now equal to `next_year` after the assignment, both `current_year` and `next_year` are updated to `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`.
