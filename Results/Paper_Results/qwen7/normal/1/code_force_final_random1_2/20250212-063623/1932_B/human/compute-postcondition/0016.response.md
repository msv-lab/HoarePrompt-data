Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `year` is the sum of the smallest elements in the original list `a` for each iteration of the loop, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in the list `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `year` remain unchanged from their initial states.
