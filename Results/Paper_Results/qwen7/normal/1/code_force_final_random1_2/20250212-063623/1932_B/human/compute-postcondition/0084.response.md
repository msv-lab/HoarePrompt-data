Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t`, a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and `test_cases`, a list of test case descriptions. Each test case description is a tuple containing an integer `n` (between 1 and 100) and a list of `n` integers `a_i` (each between 1 and 10^6). For each test case, the function processes the list of integers and returns a list of final values of `current_year` for each test case.**

This means the function takes a positive integer `t` and a list of test cases, where each test case includes a count `n` and a list of `n` integers. It then processes these integers to determine some final value for `current_year` for each test case and returns a list of these final values.
