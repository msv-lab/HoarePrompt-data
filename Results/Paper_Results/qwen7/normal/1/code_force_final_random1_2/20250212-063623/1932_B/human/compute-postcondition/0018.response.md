Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `ai`, which is iterating over the list `a`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of the Variables in the Loop Head**:
   - `ai`: This is the current element being processed in the list `a`. Initially, it will be the first element of the list `a`.
   - `a`: This is the list of integers entered by the user.

3. **Check the Conditions for the Loop to Execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, the list `a` must contain at least one element. If `a` is empty, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `ai` will be the first element of the list `a` when the loop starts, we need to ensure that `a` is not empty.
   - The other variables (`year`, `n`, and `t`) are not directly involved in the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is that the list `a` must contain at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`year` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `t` must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` must have at least one element**
