Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a non-empty list of integers.
   - `year` is `ai` where `ai` is the smallest element in list `a`.

2. **Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over each element `ai` in the list `a`.

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `year` was set to the smallest element in the list `a`.
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as there are elements left in the list `a`.

4. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop is iterating over each element in the list `a`, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the current element being processed (`ai`).
   - The variable `year` will be updated to the next smallest element in the list `a` if the loop continues.

5. **Updated State:**
   - `t` remains greater than 0 (no change needed here as it is not part of the loop head).
   - `n` remains the same (no change needed here as it is not part of the loop head).
   - `a` loses one element since one iteration has completed.
   - `year` will be updated to the next smallest element in the remaining list `a`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty list of integers (with one element removed), `year` is the smallest element in the updated list `a`**.
