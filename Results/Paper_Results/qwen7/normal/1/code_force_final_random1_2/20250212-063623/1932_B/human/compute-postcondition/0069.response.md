Output State: **`ai` is now the second element of `a`; `current_year` is now equal to `next_year` for the new `ai`; `results` includes the updated `current_year` for the current iteration; `a` remains the same; `n` remains the same; `next_year` is calculated as `current_year + ai`.**

This means that the value of `ai` remains as the second element of `a`, `current_year` is updated to `next_year` for the new `ai`, and `results` includes the updated `current_year` for the current iteration. The lists `a` and `n` remain unchanged, and `next_year` is now set to `current_year + ai`.
