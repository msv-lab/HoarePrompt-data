Output State: **`n` is the value from `test_cases`, `a` is the second value from `test_cases`, `current_year` is 0, `next_year` is equal to `current_year`, `results` is a list containing the final value of `current_year` for each iteration including the new one.**

Explanation: The code initializes `current_year` to 0. This changes the value of `current_year` but does not affect the values of `n`, `a`, `next_year`, or `results`. Therefore, the updated state includes `current_year` being set to 0, while the other variables retain their initial states.
