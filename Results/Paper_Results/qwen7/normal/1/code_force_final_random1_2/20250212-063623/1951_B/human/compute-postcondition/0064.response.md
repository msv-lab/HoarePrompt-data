Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `a`, which is a list of n distinct integers. Depending on the conditions, it returns the length of the list `a` minus 1, a value that is 1 less than the value of variable `k`, 0, the maximum value between k - 0 and 0 - 1, the minimum value between an invalid expression ind[1] - 1 and k - 1, the value of `val - 1` where `val` is the second element of the list `ind`, or k - 1 where k is at least 1.**
