Output State: **`i` is an integer, `h` is an integer, and `i` is not equal to `h`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of `i` and `h`; it only causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is currently in. Therefore, the values of `i` and `h` remain as they were in the initial state, and the condition that `i` is not equal to `h` is preserved.
