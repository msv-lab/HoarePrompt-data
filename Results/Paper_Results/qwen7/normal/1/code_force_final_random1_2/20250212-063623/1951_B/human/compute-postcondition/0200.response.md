Postcondition: **`j` is 2, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `i` is the third element of the list `s` after swapping the first and the `k-1`th elements, `z` is 1 if the third element of the list `s` is not equal to `h`, `ans1` is incremented by 1 each time `z` is 1 and the third element of the list `s` is not equal to `h`, `s` is updated such that the first and the `k-1`th elements are swapped, `ans` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `h` is less than the third element of the list `s`, and `h` is the first element of the list `s` before the swap. If `h` is less than the third element of the list `s`, `ans` is 0; otherwise, `ans` is 1.**
