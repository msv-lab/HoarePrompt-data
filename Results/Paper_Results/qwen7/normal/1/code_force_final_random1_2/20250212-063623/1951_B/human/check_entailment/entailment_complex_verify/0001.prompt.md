You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[The HU - Shireg Shireg](https://youtu.be/SNCx4n2m5_o)

ඞ

There are n cows participating in a coding tournament. Cow i has a Cowdeforces
rating of a_i (all distinct), and is initially in position i . The tournament
consists of n-1 matches as follows:

  * The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2 . 
  * Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1 . 
  * In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match. 

You are the owner of cow k . For you, winning the tournament is not important;
rather, you want your cow to win in as many matches as possible. As an
acquaintance of the tournament organizers, you can ask them to swap the
position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do
nothing.

Find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le n \le
10^5, 1 \le k \le n ) — the number of cows and your cow's index.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the Cowdeforces rating of the cows. It is guaranteed that
a_i 's are pairwise different.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of wins cow k can
achieve if you choose to swap (or do nothing) optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    6 1
    
    12 10 14 11 8 3
    
    6 5
    
    7 2 727 10 12 13
    
    2 2
    
    1000000000 1

Output

    1
    2
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal to do nothing. Let a' be the Cowdeforces
rating of the cows in the original order (with your cow's rating bolded), then

  * Initially, a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 14 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 1 match.

In the second test case, it is optimal to swap your cow to position 3 . Then,
let a' be the Cowdeforces rating of the cows in the order after the swap.

  * Initially, a' = [7, 2, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 2 and wins. a' = [7, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against your cow, and your cow wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 727 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 2 matches.

    #State: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` is the length of the list `a`, `x` is an integer, `c` is 3, `ind` is a list containing the value 1, and `ind` is not an empty list, and the length of `ind` is not equal to 1, and the first element of `ind` is not 0

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `a` of distinct integers and an integer `k`. It iterates through the list to find indices where elements are greater than a specific value `x`, which is the `k`-th element of the list. Based on certain conditions, it returns one of the following:
1. The length of the list `a` minus 1.
2. A value that is 1 less than the value of `k`.
3. 0.
4. The maximum value between `k - 0` and `0 - 1`.
5. An invalid operation due to an IndexError because the list `ind` only contains one element (0) and does not have an element at index 1.
6. The value of the second element of the list `ind` minus 1, where the second element is a non-zero value not equal to 1.
7. `k - 1`, where `k` is at least 1.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the maximum number of matches that cow `k` can win.
   - We can either swap the position of cow `k` with another cow or do nothing.
   - The goal is to maximize the number of wins for cow `k`.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cows `n`, the index of the cow `k`, and the ratings of all cows.
   - It then calls the function `func_1` with the list of ratings.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function aims to determine the maximum number of wins for cow `k`.
   - It identifies the positions of cows with ratings greater than `x` (the rating of cow `k`).
   - If there are at most two such cows, it calculates the maximum possible wins for cow `k`.
   - If no such cows exist, it returns `n - 1` (cow `k` could potentially win all matches except the first one).
   - If there is exactly one such cow, it considers the relative positions to calculate the maximum wins.
   - If there are two such cows, it calculates the maximum wins considering both possible swaps.

4. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic in `func_1` seems to handle the different scenarios correctly:
     - If there are no cows with higher ratings, cow `k` can theoretically win all matches except the first one.
     - If there is exactly one cow with a higher rating, the function calculates the maximum wins based on the position of this cow.
     - If there are two cows with higher ratings, the function considers both possible swaps to maximize the number of wins.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles edge cases like when `ind` is empty or contains only one element.
   - The function also prints `ind` when `k` is 14, which helps in debugging but is not necessary for the final output.

### Conclusion:

The given code appears to correctly implement the logic to find the maximum number of wins for cow `k`. The function `func_1` handles all the necessary scenarios and edge cases appropriately.
