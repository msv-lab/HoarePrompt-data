Output State: **`ans` is increased by 1, `i` is the fourth element of the list `s`, `s[1:]` is the list starting from the second element of the list `s` with the first and last elements swapped, `j` is `j + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += 1` increases the value of `ans` by 1. The other variables (`i`, `s[1:]`, `j`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
