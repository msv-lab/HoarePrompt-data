Postcondition: `s` is a list of integers with at least one element, `i` is the third element in `s`, and `z` is 1. If `s[0]` is not equal to `h`, `ans1` is 2. If `s[0]` equals `h`, `ans1` is 2 if `i` is not greater than `h`, or the most internal loop or if statement is exited if `i` is greater than `h`.
