Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n; a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and all a_i's are distinct.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s[0], s[k - 1] = s[k - 1], s[0]
    ans = 0
    h = s[0]
    j = -1
    for i in s[1:]:
        j += 1
        if h < i:
            break
        else:
            ans += 1
    p = j
    s[0], s[k - 1] = s[k - 1], s[0]
    ans1 = 0
    s[p], s[k - 1] = s[k - 1], s[p]
    z = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == h:
            if s[0] != h:
                ans1 += 1
            z = 1
        elif i > h:
            break
        elif z == 1:
            ans1 += 1
    print(max(ans, ans1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The final output state will have `ans1` equal to the total number of elements in the list `s` that are not equal to `h` and do not cause the loop to break when found to be greater than `h`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: All elements of the list `s` have been iterated over, `i` is now the last element of the list `s`, `z` is 1 if `s[0]` is not equal to `h`, and `ans1` is incremented each time `z` is 1 and `i` is not equal to `h`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: All elements in the list `s` have been iterated over. `i` is the last element in `s`, `h` is an integer (the first element of `s` before the swap), `s[0]` is an integer, `ans1` is the total count of elements in `s` that are equal to `h` plus the count of elements less than `h` if `z` is 1, and `z` is 1 if any element in `s` was found to be equal to `h` and `s[0]` was not equal to `h` initially.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
