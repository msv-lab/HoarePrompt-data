Postcondition: **`j` is 1, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `i` is the second element of the list `s` after swapping the first and the `k-1`th elements, `z` is 1 if `s[0]` is not equal to `h`, `ans1` is incremented each time `z` is 1 and `i` is not equal to `h`, `s` is updated such that the first and the `k-1`th elements are swapped, `ans` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `h` is less than `i`, `h` is the first element of the list `s` before the swap, and `s[0]` is different from `h`. If `h < i`, then `ans` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `ans` is incremented by 1.**
