Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for _ in range(int(sys.stdin.readline())):`. The only variable involved here is `sys.stdin.readline()`, which reads an integer from standard input and converts it to an integer.

2. **Determine the condition for loop execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as the value read from `sys.stdin.readline()` is a positive integer. Since the loop is iterating based on this value, the loop will stop when this value becomes zero or negative.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `solve()` has been called.

4. **Adjusting the state for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will execute one more time if the value read from `sys.stdin.readline()` is a positive integer.
   - Therefore, `t` must be decremented by 1 for the loop to continue executing.

5. **New state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - `t` will now be \(t - 1\), ensuring that the loop continues as long as \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t < 10^4\)**.
