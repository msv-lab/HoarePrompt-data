Output State: The value of `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t < 10^4\), and `num_iterations` is equal to \(t - 1\). The function `solve()` has been called `t` times.

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will be one less than its initial value because the loop runs `t` times, incrementing `num_iterations` each time until it reaches `t - 1`. The function `solve()` will have been executed exactly `t` times.
