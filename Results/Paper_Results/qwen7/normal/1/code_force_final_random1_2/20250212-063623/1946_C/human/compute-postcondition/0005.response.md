Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t < 10^4\), and `num_iterations` is \(t - 1\)**.

Explanation: The function `solve()` is called, but since no changes to variables are made within the function call itself (no assignments or modifications to `t` or `num_iterations` are shown), the values of these variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions provided.
