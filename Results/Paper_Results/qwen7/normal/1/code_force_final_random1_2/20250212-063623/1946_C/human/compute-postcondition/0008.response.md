Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input data consisting of an integer t, followed by t sets of input data. Each set includes two integers n and k, and then n - 1 lines representing edges in a tree. The function returns a value based on the given conditions for each set of input data.**

This means the function `func_1` indirectly accepts input through a predefined structure (likely from a file or standard input), where it first reads an integer `t`, indicating the number of sets of input data to follow. For each set, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, and then reads `n - 1` lines, each containing two integers `v` and `u` representing edges in a tree. Based on these inputs, the function processes and returns a value for each set according to the specified conditions.
