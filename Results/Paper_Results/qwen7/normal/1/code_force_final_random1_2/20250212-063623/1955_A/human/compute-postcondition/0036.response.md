Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes inputs through variables t, n, a, and b, where t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), and for each test case, n, a, and b are integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) for n, and 1 and 30 (inclusive) for a and b. The function does not return any value explicitly mentioned in the given information.**

Given the constraints and relationships, the function likely processes multiple test cases defined by the variable `t`, where for each test case, it uses `n`, `a`, and `b` to perform some operation or check conditions, but no explicit return value is stated.
