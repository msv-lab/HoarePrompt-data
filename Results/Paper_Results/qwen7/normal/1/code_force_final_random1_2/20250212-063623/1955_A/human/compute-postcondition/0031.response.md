Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 2, `A` is the first integer input, `B` is the second integer input, `C` is the third integer input, `next_input` is the fourth integer input provided by the user, `X` is `A // 2`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `A` divided by 2 using integer division (//) to the variable `X`. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `A`, `B`, `C`, `next_input`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
