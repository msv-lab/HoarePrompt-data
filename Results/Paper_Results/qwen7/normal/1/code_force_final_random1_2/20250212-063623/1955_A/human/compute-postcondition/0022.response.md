Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 1, `A` is the first integer input, `B` is the second integer input, `C` is the third integer input, `X` is `A // 2`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `A` divided by 2 (integer division) to the variable `X`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
