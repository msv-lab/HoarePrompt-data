Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is 2.
- `A` is the first integer input provided by the user.
- `B` is the second integer input provided by the user.
- `C` is the third integer input provided by the user.
- `next_input` is the fourth integer input provided by the user.
- `X` is calculated as `A // 2`.

The print statement is `print(X * C + B)`.

Let's break it down:

1. `X = A // 2`: This means `X` is the integer division of `A` by 2.
2. `print(X * C + B)`: This will print the result of multiplying `X` by `C` and then adding `B`.

So, the output will be the value of `X * C + B`.

Output: **(A // 2) * C + B**
