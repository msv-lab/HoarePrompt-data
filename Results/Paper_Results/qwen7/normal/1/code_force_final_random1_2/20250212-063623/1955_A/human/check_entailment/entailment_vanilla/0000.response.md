Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which indicates the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Promotion Logic:**
   - The program checks if the cost of buying two yogurts at the promotional price (`C`) is less than the cost of buying two yogurts at the regular price (`B * 2`).
     - If `B * 2 < C`, it means it's cheaper to buy each yogurt individually at price `a`. Hence, the total cost is `A * B`.
     - Otherwise, it proceeds to check if the number of yogurts `A` is even.
       - If `A` is even, it calculates the total cost as `int(A * C / 2)`, which means buying all yogurts in pairs.
       - If `A` is odd, it buys as many pairs as possible and then buys the remaining yogurt at the regular price.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The logic handles the scenario where the number of yogurts is odd by buying the maximum number of pairs and then buying the last yogurt separately.
   - It correctly accounts for the scenario where the promotional price for two yogurts is better than buying them individually.

### Testing with Provided Examples:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `2 5 9`
   - Here, `B * 2 = 10 > C = 9`, so it's cheaper to buy each yogurt individually.
   - Output: `2 * 5 = 10` (but the expected output is `9`).

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `3 5 9`
   - Here, `B * 2 = 10 > C = 9`, so it's cheaper to buy each yogurt individually.
   - Output: `3 * 5 = 15` (but the expected output is `14`).

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `3 5 11`
   - Here, `B * 2 = 10 < C = 11`, so it's cheaper to buy in pairs.
   - Output: `1 * 11 + 5 = 16` (but the expected output is `15`).

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - Input: `4 5 11`
   - Here, `B * 2 = 10 < C = 11`, so it's cheaper to buy in pairs.
   - Output: `4 * 5 = 20` (expected output is `20`).

### Conclusion:

The program does not handle the cases correctly when the promotional price for two yogurts is better than buying them individually. Specifically, it fails to account for the optimal way to buy the remaining yogurt when the total number of yogurts is odd.

### Correctness:

Correctness: **False**
