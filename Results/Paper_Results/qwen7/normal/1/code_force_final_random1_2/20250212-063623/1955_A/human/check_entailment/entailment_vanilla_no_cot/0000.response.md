Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided solution correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum cost of buying `n` yogurts under the given conditions. Here's a breakdown of why it works:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Regular Price vs Promotion Price Comparison**:
   - If the regular price for two yogurts (`B * 2`) is less than the promotion price (`C`), it's cheaper to buy each yogurt individually at the regular price (`B`). Therefore, the total cost is `A * B`.
   - Otherwise, the program checks if the number of yogurts (`A`) is even. If so, it calculates the total cost using the promotion price (`C`) for pairs of yogurts.
   - If the number of yogurts is odd, it buys as many pairs as possible using the promotion price and then buys the remaining yogurt at the regular price.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the number of yogurts is odd by ensuring that the last yogurt is bought at the regular price if necessary.

Given the logic and the examples provided, the solution correctly computes the minimum cost for each test case. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
