Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers assigned the values from the input split by spaces, and if `A` is even, `B * 2` is greater than or equal to `C`. If `A` is odd, `i` remains 0, `A` is the first input integer divided by 2, `B` is the second input integer, `C` is the third input integer, and `B * 2` is less than `C`.
