Reasoning:

1. **Loop Initialization**: The loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. This matches the problem statement.
2. **Input Parsing**: Inside the loop, the program reads three integers `A`, `B`, and `C` for each test case. This also aligns with the problem statement.
3. **Condition Evaluation**:
   - The first condition checks if the price of two yogurts (`C`) is less than twice the price of one yogurt (`B * 2`). If true, it prints `A * B`, which means buying each yogurt individually.
   - The second condition checks if the number of yogurts `A` is even. If true, it prints `int(A * C / 2)`, which means buying all yogurts in pairs.
   - The third condition handles the case when `A` is odd. It calculates the cost of buying `A // 2` pairs of yogurts at the promotion price (`C`) and one additional yogurt at the regular price (`B`).
4. **Output**: The program prints the minimum cost for each test case as required by the problem statement.
5. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `A` is very large and `C` is significantly cheaper than `2 * B`, the program correctly calculates the minimum cost.
   - If `A` is odd, the program correctly accounts for the remaining yogurt by adding the regular price of one yogurt.

Given that the program logic correctly handles all scenarios as described in the problem statement, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
