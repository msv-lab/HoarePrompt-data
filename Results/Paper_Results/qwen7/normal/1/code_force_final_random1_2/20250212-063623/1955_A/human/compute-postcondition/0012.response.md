Output State: **`i` is 0, `A` is the first input integer divided by 2, `B` is the second input integer, `C` is the third input integer, and B * 2 is less than C.**

Explanation: The code `X = A // 2` assigns the integer division of `A` by 2 to the variable `X`. Since `A`, `B`, and `C` are assigned values from the input split by spaces, and `B * 2` is less than `C`, the only change is that `X` (renamed to `X` as per the code) is now set to `A // 2`. The values of `i`, `B`, and `C` remain unchanged.
