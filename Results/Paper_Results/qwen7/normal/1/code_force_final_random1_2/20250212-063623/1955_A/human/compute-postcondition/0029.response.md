Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is 2.
- `A` is the first integer input provided by the user.
- `B` is the second integer input provided by the user.
- `C` is the third integer input provided by the user.
- `next_input` is the fourth integer input provided by the user.

The `print(A * B)` statement will multiply the first integer input (`A`) by the second integer input (`B`) and print the result.

Output: **A * B (where A and B are the first and second integer inputs provided by the user respectively)**
