Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where buying in pairs (at the promotion price) is more cost-effective than buying individually (at the regular price), especially when the number of yogurts is odd. 

Consider the following test case:
- Input: `3 5 11`
- Expected Output: `15` (since buying 3 yogurts at the promotion price is cheaper than buying 2 at the promotion price and 1 at the regular price)

However, the program incorrectly calculates the cost as follows:
- It checks if `B * 2 < C`, which is `5 * 2 < 11` (True).
- It then prints `A * B`, which is `3 * 5 = 15`.

This is correct for this specific case, but the program fails to consider the scenario where buying in pairs is more cost-effective when the number of yogurts is odd. For example, in the case where `n = 3`, the correct approach would be to buy 1 yogurt at the regular price and 2 yogurts at the promotion price, resulting in a total cost of `5 + 11 = 16`. However, the program incorrectly calculates this as `15`.

To fix this, the program should calculate the cost of buying as many pairs as possible and then add the remaining individual yogurts at the regular price. Here's a corrected version:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        pairs = n // 2
        singles = n % 2
        total_cost = pairs * b + singles * a
        print(total_cost)
```

This corrected version ensures that the program handles all cases correctly.
