Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to verify that it correctly calculates the minimum cost for Maxim to buy \(n\) yogurts under the given conditions.

1. **Conditions Check**:
   - The program checks if the cost of buying two yogurts at the promotion price (`C`) is less than buying them individually (`2 * B`).
   - If `2 * B < C`, it means it's cheaper to buy two yogurts at the promotion price.
   - If `2 * B >= C`, it means it's cheaper to buy individual yogurts at the regular price.

2. **Even Number of Yogurts**:
   - If the number of yogurts \(A\) is even, the program calculates the total cost as \(\text{int}(A \times C / 2)\), which means buying \(A/2\) pairs of yogurts at the promotion price.

3. **Odd Number of Yogurts**:
   - If the number of yogurts \(A\) is odd, the program calculates the cost by buying \(\text{X} = A // 2\) pairs of yogurts at the promotion price and one yogurt at the regular price (`B`).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles both even and odd numbers of yogurts correctly.
   - It ensures that the minimum cost is calculated based on the given conditions.

5. **Test Cases**:
   - The provided examples match the logic of the program:
     - For \(2\) yogurts with prices \(5\) and \(9\): Buying two at the promotion price is cheaper (`9`).
     - For \(3\) yogurts with prices \(5\) and \(9\): Buying two at the promotion price and one at the regular price is cheaper (`14`).
     - For \(3\) yogurts with prices \(5\) and \(11\): Buying three at the promotion price is cheaper (`15`).
     - For \(4\) yogurts with prices \(5\) and \(11\): Buying four at the regular price is cheaper (`20`).

Given the logic and the matching examples, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
