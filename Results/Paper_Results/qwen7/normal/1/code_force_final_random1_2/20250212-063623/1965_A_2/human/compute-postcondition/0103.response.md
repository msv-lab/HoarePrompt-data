Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `j` and the expression `range(1, len(lis))`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `j`**: The loop starts with `j` being 1 (since `range(1, len(lis))` generates numbers starting from 1).

3. **Determine the Condition for the Loop to Execute**: The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `len(lis)`. Therefore, `j` must be less than `len(lis)` for the loop to continue.

4. **Adjust the States**: We need to ensure that `j` is initially set to 1 and that `len(lis)` is at least 2 (since `j` starts at 1 and the loop will run as long as `j < len(lis)`).

Given these points, let's formulate the required state adjustments:

- `j` should be 1.
- `len(lis)` must be at least 2.

The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `l`, `lis`, and `test`) are not directly involved in the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`j` is 1, `len(lis)` must be at least 2**
