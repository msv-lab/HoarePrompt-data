Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object of integers split from the input, `lis` is a list of unique sorted integers from `set(l)`**.

Explanation: The line `lis = sorted(set(l))` converts the map object `l` into a set to remove duplicates, sorts the resulting set, and assigns the sorted list to `lis`. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `l` remain unchanged.
