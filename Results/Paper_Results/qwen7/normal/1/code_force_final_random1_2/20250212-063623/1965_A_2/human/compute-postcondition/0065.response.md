Postcondition: `j` is 1, the length of `lis` is greater than 1, and the difference between the first two elements of `lis` is either greater than 1 or less than or equal to 1. If `j` is odd, the difference between the first two elements of `lis` remains greater than 1. If `j` is even (though it starts as 1 and cannot become even in this context), the difference between the first two elements of `lis` would be less than or equal to 1.
