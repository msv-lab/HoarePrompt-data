Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object created from the integers split from the input, `lis` is a list of unique sorted integers from `l`. If the first element of `lis` is not 1 or the length of `lis` is 1, the condition remains unchanged. Otherwise, `test` is definitively False and `j` is the total number of elements in `lis`.
