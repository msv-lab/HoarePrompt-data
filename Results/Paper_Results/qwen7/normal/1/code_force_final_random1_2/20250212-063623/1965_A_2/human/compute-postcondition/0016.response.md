Output State: **`A` is True, `arr[0]` is 1, `set_` contains at least two elements including 1 and 2, `not_c` is False**

The code `not_c = False` does not affect the values of `A`, `arr[0]`, `set_`, or `not_c`. It only updates `not_c` to be `False`, which was already its value. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
