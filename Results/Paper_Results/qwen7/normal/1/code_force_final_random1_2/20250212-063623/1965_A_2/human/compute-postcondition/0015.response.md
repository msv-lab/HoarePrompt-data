Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given for loop is `i` and it ranges from 1 to `len(set_)`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `A` is True
   - `arr[0]` is 1
   - `set_` contains at least two elements including 1 and 2
   - `not_c` is False
   - `i` is 1
   - The most internal loop or if statement has been broken out of if `set_[i] - set_[i - 1] > 1`

3. **Analyze the loop condition**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i < len(set_)`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.

4. **Check the loop continuation condition**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < len(set_)`.
   - Since `i` is currently 1, the loop will continue if `1 < len(set_)`.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration, so `i` will become 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `len(set_)` must be greater than 1 (which it is, since `set_` contains at least two elements).

6. **Adjust the states**:
   - `A` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `arr[0]` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `set_` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `not_c` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `i` changes from 1 to 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`A` is True, `arr[0]` is 1, `set_` contains at least two elements including 1 and 2, `not_c` is False, `i` is 2**
