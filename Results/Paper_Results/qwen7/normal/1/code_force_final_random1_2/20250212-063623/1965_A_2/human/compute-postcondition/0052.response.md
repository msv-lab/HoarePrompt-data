Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object of integers split from the input, `lis` is a list of unique sorted integers from `l`, and `n` is assigned the value of the next input integer.**

Explanation: The code `l = map(int, input().split())` takes the next input, splits it into individual strings, and then converts each string into an integer using the `map` function. This results in a map object `l` containing the integers. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, and `lis`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
