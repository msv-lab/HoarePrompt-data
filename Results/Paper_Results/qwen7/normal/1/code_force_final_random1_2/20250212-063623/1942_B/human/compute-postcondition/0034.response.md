Postcondition: `n` is an input integer, `mex` is equal to `n - ar[i]`, `res` is a list of length `n` filled with `None`, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is `len(ar) - 2`, and if `mex` is greater than `mex - ar[i]`, then `res[i]` is set to `mex - ar[i]`. Since there is no else part, the value of `res[i]` remains unchanged if the condition is not met.
