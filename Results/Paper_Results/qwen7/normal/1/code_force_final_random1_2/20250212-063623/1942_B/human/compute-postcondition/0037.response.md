Output State: **`mex` is equal to `mex - ar[i]`, `res` is a list of length `n` filled with `None`, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is `len(ar) - 3`, `res[i]` is set to `mex - ar[i]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `mex` by subtracting `ar[i]` from it. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `mex` is now `mex - ar[i]`, while `res[i]` remains `mex - ar[i]` as per the initial state.
