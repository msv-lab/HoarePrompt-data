Output State: `mex` is equal to the minimum non-negative integer that is not present in the list `ar` after all the iterations, and `res` is a list of length `n` where each element `res[i]` is calculated as `mex - ar[i]` for all `i` in the range of `len(ar)`. The value of `mex` is updated in each iteration to ensure it remains the smallest non-negative integer not present in `ar` up to the current index.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `mex` will be the smallest non-negative integer that does not appear in the list `ar`, and `res` will contain the difference between `mex` and each element of `ar` in reverse order.
