Postcondition: `mex` is equal to `mex - ar[i]`, `res` is a list of length `n` with `res[i]` equal to `mex - ar[i]` and all other elements as `None`, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is `len(ar) - 3`. If `mex` is greater than `mex - ar[i]`, then `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[i] - ar[i]` and `res[i]` is updated to `mex - ar[i] - ar[i]`.
