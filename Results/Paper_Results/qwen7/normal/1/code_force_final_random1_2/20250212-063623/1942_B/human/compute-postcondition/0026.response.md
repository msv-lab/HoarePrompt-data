Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `mex` is reduced by the next element in `ar`, and `res` is updated to include the new value of `mex - ar[i]` for the next index `i`, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from input.**

Explanation: The code `ar = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from the input and converts them into a list of integers. This list is assigned to the variable `ar`. The values of `n`, `mex`, and `res` remain unchanged from their initial state, but now `ar` holds the newly created list of integers. The operations on `mex` and `res` are yet to be performed and will be done in subsequent lines of code.
