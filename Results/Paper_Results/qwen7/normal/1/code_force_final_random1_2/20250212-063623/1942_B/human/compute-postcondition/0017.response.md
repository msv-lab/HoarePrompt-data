Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `res` is a list of length `n` filled with `None`, `mex` is equal to `n - ar[i] - ar[len(ar) - 2]`, `res[len(ar) - 2]` is `mex - ar[len(ar) - 2]`, and `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]` for `i` being `len(ar) - 3`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `res[i]` to `mex - ar[i]` where `i` is `len(ar) - 3`. Given the initial conditions, `mex` is defined as `n - ar[i] - ar[len(ar) - 2]`. For `i` being `len(ar) - 3`, the updated value of `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]`, which translates to `n - ar[len(ar) - 3] - ar[len(ar) - 2] - ar[len(ar) - 3]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
