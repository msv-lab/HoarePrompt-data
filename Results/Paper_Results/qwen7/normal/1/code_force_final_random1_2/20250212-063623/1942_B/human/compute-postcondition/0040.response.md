Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `ar`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs in reverse order from `len(ar) - 1` to `0` with a step of `-1`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `mex` is equal to `mex - ar[i]`.
   - `res` is a list of length `n` filled with `None`.
   - `ar` is a list of integers obtained from input.
   - `i` is `len(ar) - 3`.
   - `res[i]` is set to `mex - ar[i]`.
   - If `mex` is greater than `mex - ar[i]`, then `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[i]`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `len(ar) - 3`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be decremented by 1, so `i` will be `len(ar) - 4`.
   - Since the loop runs in reverse, the loop will continue as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `0`.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `i` will be `len(ar) - 4`.
   - `mex` remains unchanged unless it is updated inside the loop body, but since we don't know what happens inside the loop body, we assume it remains the same for now.
   - `res` and `ar` remain unchanged because they are not modified in the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`mex` is equal to `mex - ar[i]`, `res` is a list of length `n` filled with `None`, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is `len(ar) - 4`**.
