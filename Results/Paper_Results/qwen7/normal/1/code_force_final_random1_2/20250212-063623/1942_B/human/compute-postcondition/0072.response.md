Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` is `-1`, `ar` is a list of integers, `n` is the input integer, `mex` is equal to `n - sum(ar)`, and `res` is a list of length `n` where each element `res[i]` is equal to `mex - ar[i]` if `mex > mex - ar[i]`, otherwise `res[i]` remains unchanged.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `mex` will be the smallest non-negative integer that does not appear in the list `ar`. The list `res` will contain the difference between `mex` and each element of `ar`, and `i` will be `-1` indicating the loop has finished executing. The variable `n` will retain its original value, and `ar` will be the list of integers provided as input.
