Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `res` is a list of length `n` filled with None, `mex` is equal to `n`.**

The code simply assigns the value of `n` to the variable `mex`. Since `n` is an input integer, `mex` will also be an integer equal to `n`. All other variables remain unchanged.
