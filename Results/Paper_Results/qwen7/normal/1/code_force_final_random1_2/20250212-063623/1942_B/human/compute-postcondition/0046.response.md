Output State: `mex` is equal to the minimum value of `mex - ar[i]` for all `i` in the range of `0` to `len(ar) - 1`, `res` is a list of length `n` where each element `res[i]` is equal to `mex - ar[i]`, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is `-1` (indicating the loop has completed), and `n` is the original input integer.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `mex` will be the smallest non-negative integer that does not appear in the list `ar`. The list `res` will contain the difference between `mex` and each element of `ar`, and `i` will be `-1` indicating the loop has finished executing.
