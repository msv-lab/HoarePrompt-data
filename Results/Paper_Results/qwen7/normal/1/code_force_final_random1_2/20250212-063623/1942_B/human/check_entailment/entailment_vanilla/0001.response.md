Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the permutation `n` and the array `ar`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - A result list `res` of size `n` is initialized with `None` values.
   - `mex` is initialized to `n`, which represents the maximum value that can be used as MEX initially.

3. **Backward Iteration:**
   - The loop runs from `len(ar) - 1` down to `0`.
   - For each index `i`, it calculates `res[i]` as `mex - ar[i]`.
   - It then checks if `mex > mex - ar[i]` and updates `mex` accordingly.

4. **Output:**
   - The result list `res` is printed as a space-separated string.

### Detailed Check:

1. **Backward Iteration Logic:**
   - The logic for calculating `res[i]` as `mex - ar[i]` is correct.
   - However, the check `if mex > mex - ar[i]:` is redundant because `mex` is always greater than or equal to `mex - ar[i]` due to the nature of MEX being the smallest non-negative integer not in the set.

2. **MEX Calculation:**
   - The MEX calculation should ensure that the value assigned to `res[i]` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the prefix of `res` up to index `i`.
   - The current implementation does not correctly handle the MEX calculation because it only decrements `mex` without ensuring that the value is not already in the prefix.

### Example Verification:

Let's verify the example provided:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `5`
  - Array: `[1, 1, -2, 1, 2]`
  - Expected Output: `[0, 1, 4, 2, 3]`

  - For `i = 4`: `res[4] = mex - ar[4] = n - 2 = 3` (since `mex = 5`)
  - For `i = 3`: `res[3] = mex - ar[3] = 4 - 1 = 3` (since `mex = 4`)
  - For `i = 2`: `res[2] = mex - ar[2] = 3 - (-2) = 5` (since `mex = 3`)
  - For `i = 1`: `res[1] = mex - ar[1] = 2 - 1 = 1` (since `mex = 2`)
  - For `i = 0`: `res[0] = mex - ar[0] = 1 - 1 = 0` (since `mex = 1`)

  - This results in `res = [0, 1, 5, 3, 3]`, which is incorrect.

### Conclusion:

The given program does not correctly implement the MEX calculation and thus produces incorrect results. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
