Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `res` is a list of length `n` filled with None.**

The code initializes a list `res` with `n` elements, all set to `None`. This does not affect the values of `n` or `ar`, so those variables retain their initial states.
