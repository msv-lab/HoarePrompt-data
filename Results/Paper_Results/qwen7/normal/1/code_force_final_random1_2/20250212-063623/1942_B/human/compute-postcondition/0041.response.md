Output State: **`mex` is equal to `mex - ar[i]`, `res` is a list of length `n` with `res[i]` equal to `mex - ar[i]` and all other elements as `None`, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is `len(ar) - 4`**.

This means that the value of `mex` remains unchanged from its previous state, `res` now has its `i`-th element set to `mex - ar[i]` while the rest of the elements remain `None`, `ar` remains unchanged, and `i` is updated to `len(ar) - 4`.
