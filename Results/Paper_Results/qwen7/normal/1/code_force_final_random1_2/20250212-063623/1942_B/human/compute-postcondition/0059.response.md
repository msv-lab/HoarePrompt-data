Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `len(ar) - 1` to `0` (inclusive), decrementing `i` by 1 each time. Therefore, the loop will continue as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `0`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `len(ar) - 1`
   - `ar` is a list of integers
   - `n` is an input integer
   - `mex` is equal to `n`
   - `res` is a list of length `n` where each element `res[i]` is equal to `mex - ar[i]`. If `mex > mex - ar[i]`, then `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[i]`. Otherwise, the values of `i`, `ar`, `n`, `mex`, and `res` remain unchanged.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop decrements `i` by 1, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `len(ar) - 2`.
   - The values of `ar`, `n`, `mex`, and `res` remain unchanged unless the loop body updates them, but since no such update is mentioned in the postcondition, they stay the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is `len(ar) - 2`, `ar` is a list of integers, `n` is an input integer, `mex` is equal to `n`, `res` is a list of length `n` where each element `res[i]` is equal to `mex - ar[i]`.**
