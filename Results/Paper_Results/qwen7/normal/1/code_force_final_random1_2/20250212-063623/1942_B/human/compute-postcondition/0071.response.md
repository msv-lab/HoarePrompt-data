Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `i` is `-1`.
   - `ar` is a list of integers.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `mex` is equal to `n - ar[-1]`. Since `i` is `-1`, this means we are considering the last element of the list `ar` (if it exists).
   - `res` is a list of length `n` where each element `res[i]` is equal to `mex - ar[i]` if `mex > mex - ar[i]`, otherwise `res[i]` remains unchanged.

2. **Understanding `mex`**:
   - `mex` is defined as `n - ar[-1]`. This means `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the list `ar`.

3. **Constructing `res`**:
   - Each element `res[i]` is determined by the formula `mex - ar[i]` if `mex > mex - ar[i]`, otherwise `res[i]` remains unchanged.
   - Given that `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not in `ar`, `mex - ar[i]` will always be positive for all valid `i` (since `mex` is the smallest integer not in `ar`).

4. **Final Expression for `res[i]`**:
   - For each `i` from `0` to `n-1`, `res[i] = mex - ar[i]` because `mex` is greater than any element in `ar` (by definition of `mex`).

5. **Printing `res`**:
   - The print statement will join all elements of `res` into a single string with spaces between them and then print it.

Given these steps, the output will be a space-separated string of integers where each integer is `mex - ar[i]` for `i` ranging from `0` to `n-1`.

Output: **mex - ar[0] mex - ar[1] ... mex - ar[n-1]**
