Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `res` is a list of length `n` filled with `None`, `mex` is equal to `n - ar[i] - ar[len(ar) - 2]`, `res[len(ar) - 2]` is `mex - ar[len(ar) - 2]`**.

Explanation: The line `mex = mex - ar[i]` updates the value of `mex` by subtracting `ar[i]` from it. Since `i` is `len(ar) - 2`, `ar[i]` is `ar[len(ar) - 2]`. Therefore, `mex` is updated to `n - ar[i] - ar[len(ar) - 2]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
