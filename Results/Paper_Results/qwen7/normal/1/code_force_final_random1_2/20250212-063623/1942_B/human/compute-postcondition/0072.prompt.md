Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5; a is a list of n integers such that -n ≤ a_i ≤ n, and there exists at least one valid permutation p that satisfies the given conditions.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
    res = [None] * n
    mex = n
    for i in range(len(ar) - 1, -1, -1):
        res[i] = mex - ar[i]
        if mex > mex - ar[i]:
            mex = mex - ar[i]
    print(' '.join(str(x) for x in res))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `mex` will be reduced by the sum of all elements in the list `ar`, and `res` will be a list where each element `res[i]` is equal to `mex - ar[i]` for all `i` in the range of `len(ar)`.

In more detail, `mex` starts as `n` and is decreased by each element in `ar` during each iteration of the loop. By the end of the loop, `mex` will be `n - sum(ar)`. The list `res` will contain the value `mex - ar[i]` for each index `i` from `0` to `len(ar) - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `mex` is equal to the minimum value of `mex - ar[i]` for all `i` in the range of `0` to `len(ar) - 1`, `res` is a list of length `n` where each element `res[i]` is equal to `mex - ar[i]`, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is `-1` (indicating the loop has completed), and `n` is the original input integer.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `mex` will be the smallest non-negative integer that does not appear in the list `ar`. The list `res` will contain the difference between `mex` and each element of `ar`, and `i` will be `-1` indicating the loop has finished executing.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is `-1`, `ar` is a list of integers, `n` is an input integer, `mex` is equal to `n - ar[-1]`, `res` is a list of length `n` where each element `res[i]` is equal to `mex - ar[i]` if `mex > mex - ar[i]`, otherwise `res[i]` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
