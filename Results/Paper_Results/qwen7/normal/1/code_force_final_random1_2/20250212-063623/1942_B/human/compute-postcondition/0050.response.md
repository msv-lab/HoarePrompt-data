Output State: **`ar` is a list of integers obtained from input, `n` is an input integer, `mex` is equal to the minimum value of `mex - ar[i]` for all `i` in the range of `0` to `len(ar) - 1`, `res` is a list of length `n` where each element `res[i]` is equal to `mex - ar[i]`, `i` is `-1`.**

Explanation: The code `ar = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from the input, converts each integer to a list, and assigns it to `ar`. The values of `n`, `mex`, `res`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
