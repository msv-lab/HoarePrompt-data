Output State: **`res` is a list of length `n` filled with `None`, `n` is an input integer, `mex` is reduced by the next element in `ar`, and `res` is updated to include the new value of `mex - ar[i]` for the next index `i`, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from input.**

Explanation: The code initializes `res` as a list of `None` values with a length equal to `n`. The values of `n`, `mex`, and `ar` remain unchanged from their initial state, except that `mex` will be reduced by the next element in `ar` and `res` will be updated accordingly during subsequent operations.
