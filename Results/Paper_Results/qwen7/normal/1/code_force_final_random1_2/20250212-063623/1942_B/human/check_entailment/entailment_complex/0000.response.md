Reasoning:

The annotated program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through the array `ar` in reverse order and calculating the permutation `res` based on the MEX value. However, the logic in the annotated program is flawed. Specifically, the logic to update `mex` and calculate `res[i]` is incorrect. The goal is to find a valid permutation `p` such that `a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i`.

Here's the correct approach:
1. Initialize `mex` to 0.
2. Iterate through the array `ar` from the end to the beginning.
3. For each position `i`, set `res[i]` to `mex - ar[i]` if `mex - ar[i]` is a valid candidate (i.e., it hasn't been used before and it doesn't violate the MEX condition).
4. Update `mex` to the next valid MEX value after placing `res[i]`.

Let's analyze the provided code:
- The code initializes `mex` to `n`.
- It iterates through `ar` in reverse order.
- It sets `res[i]` to `mex - ar[i]` without checking if it is a valid candidate.
- It updates `mex` to `mex - ar[i]` unconditionally, which is incorrect because `mex` should be updated based on the valid candidates found.

Given these issues, the provided code does not correctly compute the permutation `p` that satisfies the conditions.

Correctness: **False**
