Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `len(ar) - 1`.

2. **Determine the initial value of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` set to `len(ar) - 1`.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop continues as long as `i >= 0`.

4. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - `i` should be initialized to `len(ar) - 1`.
   - The loop should continue as long as `i >= 0`, which means `i` must be greater than or equal to 0.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `i` is correctly initialized and that the loop condition is satisfied.

### Final Answer:
State: **`n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `res` is a list of length `n` filled with None, `mex` is equal to `n`, `i` is `len(ar) - 1`, and `i` must be greater than or equal to 0**.
