Output State: **`i` is `len(ar) - 3`, `ar` is a list of integers, `n` is an input integer, `mex` is equal to `n - ar[len(ar) - 3] - ar[i]`, `res` is a list of length `n` where each element `res[i]` is equal to `mex - ar[i]` if `mex > mex - ar[i]`, otherwise `res[i]` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `mex` by subtracting `ar[i]` from its current value. The variable `i` remains unchanged as it was initialized to `len(ar) - 3`. The value of `n` and the list `ar` remain unchanged. The variable `mex` is updated to `n - ar[len(ar) - 3] - ar[i]`. The list `res` remains unchanged as no operation directly affects its elements.
