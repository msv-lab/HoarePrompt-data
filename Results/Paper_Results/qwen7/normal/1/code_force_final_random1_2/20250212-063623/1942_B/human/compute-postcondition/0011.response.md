Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `i`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over the range from `len(ar) - 1` to `-1` with a step of `-1`. This means it starts from the last index of the list `ar` and goes backwards.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
   - `res` is a list of length `n` filled with `None`.
   - `mex` is equal to `n - ar[i]` where `i` is `len(ar) - 1` and `i` is greater than or equal to `0`.
   - If `mex > mex - ar[i]`, then `mex` remains unchanged. Otherwise, the condition does not affect the variables.

4. **Analyze the loop body**: The loop body is omitted, but we know that the loop decrements `i` by `1` each time it runs. Therefore, the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration is one less than its initial value.

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - The variable `i` will be decreased by `1` in the next iteration.
   - The value of `mex` remains unchanged as per the given postcondition.

Given these points, let's update the state for the next iteration:

- The variable `i` will be `len(ar) - 2` (one less than the previous value).
- The values of `n`, `ar`, `res`, and `mex` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `res` is a list of length `n` filled with `None`, `mex` is equal to `n - ar[i]` where `i` is `len(ar) - 2` and `i` is greater than or equal to `0`. If `mex > mex - ar[i]`, then `mex` remains unchanged. Otherwise, the condition does not affect the variables.**
