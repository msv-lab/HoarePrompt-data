Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to determine how many integers \( k \) satisfy a set of constraints. These constraints include:
   - \( k \geq x \) (type 1)
   - \( k \leq x \) (type 2)
   - \( k \neq x \) (type 3)

2. **Analyzing the Given Code**:
   - The code defines several helper functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`, `func_6`, `func_7`) but does not use them effectively for solving the problem.
   - The main function `func_7` is designed to solve the problem. Let's break down its logic:
     - It reads the number of constraints \( n \).
     - It initializes `start` to -1 and `end` to 1000000000.0.
     - For each constraint, it updates `start` and `end` based on the type of constraint.
     - It collects all values from type 3 constraints into the `num` list.
     - It calculates the potential range of valid \( k \) values as `end - start + 1`.
     - It subtracts the number of invalid \( k \) values (those in `num`) from the potential range.
     - If `start` exceeds `end`, it returns 0 (indicating no valid \( k \)).

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The logic correctly handles the constraints and calculates the valid range of \( k \).
   - The handling of type 3 constraints (values that \( k \) cannot be) is appropriately subtracted from the total range.
   - The edge case where `start` exceeds `end` is handled correctly by returning 0.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The given code correctly implements the solution to the problem as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
