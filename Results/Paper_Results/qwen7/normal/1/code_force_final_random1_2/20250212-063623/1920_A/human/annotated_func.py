#State of the program right berfore the function call: isOne is a boolean value indicating whether to return an integer input or 1. If isOne is False, the function expects an integer input representing the number of constraints (2 ≤ n ≤ 100). If isOne is True, the function returns 1.
def func_1(isOne):
    if (not isOne) :
        return int(input())
        #The program returns an integer input since isOne is False, which means the input will not be converted to 1.
    else :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1 if isOne is True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a boolean parameter `isOne`. If `isOne` is `False`, it returns an integer input provided by the user. If `isOne` is `True`, it returns the integer `1`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the number of test cases, n is an integer representing the number of constraints for each test case, and for each test case, the input consists of n lines, where each line contains two integers a and x (1 ≤ a ≤ 3, 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9), representing the type of constraint and the value of the constraint respectively.
def func_2(space, to_int):
    line = input()
    if space :
        items = line.split()
    else :
        items = list(line)
    #State: Postcondition: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is an integer representing the number of constraints for each test case, and `line` is a string containing the input for the first test case. If `space` is True, `items` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `line` by spaces. Otherwise, `items` is a list containing the characters of the string `line`.
    if to_int :
        return [int(i) for i in items]
        #The program returns a list of integers obtained by converting each item in the list 'items' to an integer.
    else :
        return items
        #`items` is a list containing the characters of the string `line` if `space` is False, otherwise `items` is not defined as it is not returned or modified by the given code.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `space`, a boolean, and `to_int`, which can be either a string or a list of strings. If `space` is True, it splits the input string `to_int` by spaces and converts each item to an integer, returning a list of integers. If `space` is False, it splits the input string `to_int` into a list of characters. In both cases, the function modifies the input string `to_int` by splitting it into a list (`items`), and it returns a list of integers or characters based on the value of `space`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers, and sym is a string representing a separator (e.g., ' ', ',', etc.).
def func_3(arr, sym):

    #State: Output State: `arr` is a list of integers that must not be empty, `sym` is a string representing a separator, `string` is the concatenation of all elements in `arr` separated by `sym`, `i` is the last element in the list `arr`.
    #
    #In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `string` will contain a single string where all elements from the list `arr` are concatenated together, with each element converted to a string and followed by the separator `sym`. The variable `i` will hold the last element of the list `arr`.
    return string
    #`The program returns a string which is the concatenation of all elements in list 'arr', with each element converted to a string and followed by the separator 'sym'. The last element of the list 'arr' is stored in 'i'.`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and a string `sym` representing a separator. It concatenates all elements in `arr`, converting each element to a string and separating them with `sym`. The resulting string is returned, and the last element of `arr` is stored in `i`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: string is a string, substring is a non-empty string, and substring is guaranteed to appear in string.
def func_4(string, substring):

    #State: Output State: `string` is a string, `substring` is a non-empty string and guaranteed to appear in `string`; `indices` is a list containing all the indices of occurrences of `substring` in `string`, `index` is either the index of the last occurrence of `substring` in `string` or -1, indicating that no more occurrences were found.
    #
    #This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `indices` will contain every starting position where `substring` appears in `string`. The loop continues searching for `substring` starting from the position right after the last found occurrence until it can no longer find any more instances of `substring`, at which point `index` will be set to -1.
    return indices
    #`indices` is a list containing all the starting positions where `substring` appears in `string`, and `index` is -1 indicating no more occurrences were found.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string and a non-empty substring as inputs. It returns a list containing all the starting positions where the substring appears within the string. If no more occurrences of the substring are found, it returns a list of all previously found positions and an index value of -1.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers, and element is an integer present in the list arr.
def func_5(arr, element):
    return [index for index, value in enumerate(arr) if value == element]
    #The program returns a list of indices where the integer `element` is found in the list `arr`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and an integer `element`. It searches through the list `arr` and returns a list of indices where the integer `element` is found. If `element` is not found in `arr`, an empty list is returned.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of lists where each sublist contains exactly two integers representing a constraint (a, x), index is an integer representing the index of the element to compare within each sublist, and value is an integer to match against the element at the specified index in each sublist.

            return subArray
        
    #State: The list `arr` is empty.
    return None
    #The program returns None
#Overall this is what the function does:The function searches through a list of lists (`arr`), where each sublist contains exactly two integers representing a constraint (a, x). It compares the element at a specified index (`index`) within each sublist to a given value (`value`). If it finds a sublist where the element at the specified index matches the given value, it returns that sublist. If no matching sublist is found, it returns a list with one fewer sublist, ensuring that all remaining sublists have elements at the specified index not equal to the given value. If no sublists remain, it returns `None`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and for each constraint, t is an integer in {1, 2, 3} and x is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^9. Additionally, there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, and all constraints are unique.

    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `count_num` will be the total number of elements in `num` that fall within the range from `start` to `end`, inclusive. The variables `i`, `t`, `v`, `num`, `start`, and `end` will retain their final states from the last iteration of the loop. Specifically, `i` will be the last element of `num` processed, `start` will be the minimum value among all `v` where `t` was 1 (or unchanged if no such `v` exists), and `end` will be the maximum value among all `v` where `t` was 2 (or unchanged if no such `v` exists).
    #
    #In simpler terms, after running through all iterations of the loop, `count_num` will hold the count of numbers in the list `num` that are between `start` and `end`, inclusive. The values of `i`, `start`, and `end` will reflect the last processed value and the range defined by the conditions in the loop.

The condition `start > end` is false.
    return end - start + 1 - count_num if end - start + 1 >= count_num else 0
    #0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of constraints and a list of integers. It identifies the minimum value (`start`) from constraints of type 1 and the maximum value (`end`) from constraints of type 2. It then counts how many integers in the provided list (`num`) fall within the range `[start, end]`. If the range is invalid (i.e., `start` is greater than `end`), the function returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates and returns the difference between the range size (`end - start + 1`) and the count of integers within the range, returning 0 if this difference is non-positive.
