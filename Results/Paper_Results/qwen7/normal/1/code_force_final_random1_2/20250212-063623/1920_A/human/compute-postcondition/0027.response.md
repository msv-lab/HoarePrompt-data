Output State: **`i` is 1, `t` is the first integer from input, `v` is the second integer from input**.

Explanation: The code takes two integers as input separated by a space, splits them into a tuple, and assigns the first integer to `t` and the second integer to `v`. The initial values of `i` and `t` remain unchanged, but now `t` and `v` hold the values of the integers entered by the user. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 1 remains valid, although the value of `n` itself is not specified and thus not updated in the output state.
