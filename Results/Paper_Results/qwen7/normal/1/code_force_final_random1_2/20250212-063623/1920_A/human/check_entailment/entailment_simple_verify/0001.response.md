### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires determining how many integers \( k \) satisfy a set of constraints, where the constraints are of three types:
     - \( k \geq x \) (type 1)
     - \( k \leq x \) (type 2)
     - \( k \neq x \) (type 3)

2. **Analyzing the Given Code**:
   - The code defines several helper functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`, `func_6`, `func_7`), but only `func_7` is used to solve the problem.
   - `func_7` is designed to solve the problem by:
     - Reading the number of constraints \( n \).
     - Initializing `start` to -1 and `end` to 1000000000.0.
     - For each constraint, it updates `start` and `end` based on the type of constraint.
     - Collecting all values from type 3 constraints into the `num` list.
     - Calculating the potential range of valid \( k \) values as `end - start + 1`.
     - Subtracting the number of invalid \( k \) values (those in `num`) from the potential range.
     - If `start` exceeds `end`, it returns 0 (indicating no valid \( k \)).

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - **Initialization**:
     - `start` is initialized to -1, which is correct because the smallest possible value for `k` should be greater than or equal to the smallest `x` from type 1 constraints.
     - `end` is initialized to 1000000000.0, which is correct because the largest possible value for `k` should be less than or equal to the largest `x` from type 2 constraints.
   - **Updating `start` and `end`**:
     - For type 1 constraints, `start` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the constraint value `v`.
     - For type 2 constraints, `end` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the constraint value `v`.
     - This ensures that `start` is the smallest possible value and `end` is the largest possible value for \( k \).
   - **Handling Type 3 Constraints**:
     - All values from type 3 constraints are collected in the `num` list.
     - The number of invalid \( k \) values (those in `num`) is subtracted from the potential range `end - start + 1`.
   - **Edge Case**:
     - If `start` exceeds `end`, it correctly returns 0, indicating no valid \( k \).

4. **Validation Using Annotated Code**:
   - The annotated code confirms that the logic in `func_7` is correct and aligns with the problem description.
   - The logic for updating `start` and `end` based on the constraints is accurate.
   - The handling of type 3 constraints by collecting them in the `num` list and subtracting their count from the range is correct.
   - The edge case where `start` exceeds `end` is correctly handled by returning 0.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The given code correctly implements the solution to the problem as described in the problem statement.
