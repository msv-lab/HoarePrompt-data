Output State: **`i` is 2, `t` is an integer from input, `v` is an integer from input, `num` is a list containing [v], and if `start` is less than `v`, then `start` remains unchanged; otherwise, `end` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `num.append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the list `num`. Initially, `num` contains the second integer from input, which is now followed by `v`. The values of `i`, `t`, and `v` remain unchanged. The conditions regarding `start` and `end` also remain unchanged.
