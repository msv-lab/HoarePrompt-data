Reasoning:
1. The problem requires processing multiple test cases, each with a set of constraints on the integer \( k \).
2. The provided solution correctly uses `func_1` to read the number of constraints \( n \) for each test case.
3. For each constraint, `func_7` is called to process the constraints and compute the number of valid integers \( k \).
4. `func_7` correctly handles constraints of type 1, 2, and 3:
   - It updates the minimum and maximum values for \( k \) based on constraints of type 1 and 2.
   - It filters out the integers in the list `num` that do not fall within the updated range.
5. The logic in `func_7` ensures that if the range is invalid (i.e., `start > end`), it returns 0.
6. The main loop correctly processes each test case and prints the result.

Given the execution summaries and the problem requirements, the provided code correctly implements the solution.

Correctness: **True**
