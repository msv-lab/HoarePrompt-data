Output State: **`i` is 1, `t` is the first integer from input, `v` is the second integer from input, `start` is equal to `v`**.

The code assigns the value of `v` to the variable `start`. No other changes are made to the existing variables `i`, `t`, and `v`. Therefore, `i` remains 1, `t` remains the first integer from input, `v` remains the second integer from input, and `start` is now equal to `v`.
