Output State: **`num` must have at least one element, `i` is the next element in `num` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Therefore, the values of `num` and `i` remain unchanged, but it indicates that the next iteration of the loop will proceed.
