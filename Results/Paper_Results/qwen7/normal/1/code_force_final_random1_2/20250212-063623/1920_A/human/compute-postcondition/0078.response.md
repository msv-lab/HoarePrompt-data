Postcondition: **`count_num` will be the total number of elements in `num` that fall within the range from `start` to `end`, inclusive. `i` will be the last element of `num` processed, `start` will be the minimum value among all `v` where `t` was 1 (or unchanged if no such `v` exists), and `end` will be the maximum value among all `v` where `t` was 2 (or unchanged if no such `v` exists). The if condition is now true as `start` is greater than `end`.**
