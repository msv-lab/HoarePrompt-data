Output State: **0**

Explanation: Given that `start > end` is false, it means `start` is less than or equal to `end`. The expression `end - start + 1` calculates the length of the range from `start` to `end`, inclusive. Since `count_num` is the total number of elements in `num` that fall within the range from `start` to `end`, inclusive, and given that `start` is less than or equal to `end`, the range length (`end - start + 1`) will always be greater than or equal to `count_num`. Therefore, the condition `end - start + 1 >= count_num` is true, and the expression evaluates to `end - start + 1 - count_num`. However, since the range length is at least as large as `count_num`, the result of this subtraction will be 0.
