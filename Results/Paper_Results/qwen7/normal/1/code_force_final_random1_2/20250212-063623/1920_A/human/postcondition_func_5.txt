The function searches through a list of lists (`arr`), where each sublist contains exactly two integers representing a constraint (a, x). It compares the element at a specified index (`index`) within each sublist to a given value (`value`). If it finds a sublist where the element at the specified index matches the given value, it returns that sublist. If no matching sublist is found, it returns a list with one fewer sublist, ensuring that all remaining sublists have elements at the specified index not equal to the given value. If no sublists remain, it returns `None`.
