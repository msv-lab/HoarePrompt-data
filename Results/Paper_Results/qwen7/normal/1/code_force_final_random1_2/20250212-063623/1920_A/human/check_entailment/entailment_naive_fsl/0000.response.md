Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the constraints and calculate the valid range for `k`. Specifically, the program initializes `start` to `-1` and `end` to `1000000000.0`, which are not appropriate initial values for the constraints. Additionally, the logic to update `start` and `end` is flawed. For example, consider the following input:

- Test case with `n = 4` and constraints:
  - `1 3` (k must be ≥ 3)
  - `2 10` (k must be ≤ 10)
  - `3 1` (k must not be 1)
  - `3 5` (k must not be 5)

The program should correctly identify that `k` must be in the range `[3, 10]` and exclude `1` and `5`, resulting in the valid range `[3, 10]` excluding `1` and `5`, which gives the result `7`. However, the current implementation does not correctly handle these constraints and may produce incorrect results.
