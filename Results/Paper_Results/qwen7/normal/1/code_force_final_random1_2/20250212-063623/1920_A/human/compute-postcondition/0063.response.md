Output State: **`count_num` is `count_num` + 1, and `i` will iterate over each element in `num`. All elements `i` in `num` are within the range from `start` to `end`, inclusive.**

Explanation: The line `count_num += 1` increments the value of `count_num` by 1. The iteration over `num` and the range condition for `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` will still iterate over each element in `num`, and each element `i` will still be within the range from `start` to `end`, inclusive.
