Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n):`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**:
   - The variable `i` will start from 0 and increment by 1 until it reaches `n`.
   - The variable `n` should be a positive integer because `range(n)` requires `n` to be a non-negative integer.

3. **Check the given initial states**:
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\) and is updated to the integer input value.
   - `t` is an integer in \{1, 2, 3\}.
   - `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^9\).
   - `start` is -1.
   - `end` is 1000000000.0.
   - `num` is an empty list.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1, we need to ensure that `n` is a valid starting point for the loop. Given that `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, we can directly use the value of `n` as it is.
   - We don't need to adjust `t`, `x`, `start`, `end`, or `num` as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are `i` and `n`.

State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be a valid integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\)**
