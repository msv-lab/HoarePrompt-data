Output State: **`num` must have at least one element, `i` is the next element in `num`, and `count_num` is incremented if the current value of `i` is within the range from `start` to `end` inclusive. We continue to the next iteration of the loop.**

The `continue` statement causes the flow of execution to skip the remaining part of the current iteration of the loop and move directly to the next iteration. Therefore, the values of `num`, `i`, and `count_num` remain unchanged, and the loop continues.
