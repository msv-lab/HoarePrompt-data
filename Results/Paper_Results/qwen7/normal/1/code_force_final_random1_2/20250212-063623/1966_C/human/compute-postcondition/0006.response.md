Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `i`.
2. **Determine the initial value of `i`**: The loop starts with `i = 1` and increments `i` until `i < n`.
3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i < n`.

Given the initial state:
- `tc` must be greater than 0.
- `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1.
- `arr` is a list containing unique, sorted (in descending order) integers from the input followed by 0.
- `dp` is set to True.

For the loop to execute, `i` must be within the range `[1, n]`. Since the loop starts with `i = 1`, the minimum value `i` can take is 1. Therefore, the key adjustment needed is ensuring that `i` is less than `n`.

To summarize:
- `tc` must be greater than 0 (unchanged).
- `n` remains as the length of `arr` minus 1 (unchanged).
- `arr` is a list containing unique, sorted (in descending order) integers from the input followed by 0 (unchanged).
- `dp` is set to True (unchanged).
- `i` must be 1 initially and less than `n` for the loop to execute.

State: **`tc` must be greater than 0, `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1, `arr` is a list containing unique, sorted (in descending order) integers from the input followed by 0, `dp` is set to True, `i` must be 1 and less than `n`**
