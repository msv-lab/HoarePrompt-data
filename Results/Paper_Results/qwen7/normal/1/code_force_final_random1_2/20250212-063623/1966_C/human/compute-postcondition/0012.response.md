Output State: `tc` must be greater than 0, `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1, `arr` is a list containing unique, sorted (in descending order) integers from the input followed by 0, `dp` is the result of `arr[n-1] - arr[n] > 1 or not dp`, `i` is equal to `n`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n` because the loop increments `i` from 1 to `n-1`. The variable `dp` will be updated based on the condition `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp` for each iteration, with `i` starting from 1 and ending at `n-1`. Since `i` reaches `n-1`, the final update to `dp` will be based on `arr[n-1] - arr[n] > 1 or not dp`, and since `arr` ends with 0, `arr[n]` will be 0. Therefore, `dp` will be `arr[n-1] - 0 > 1 or not dp`, which simplifies to `arr[n-1] > 1 or not dp`.
