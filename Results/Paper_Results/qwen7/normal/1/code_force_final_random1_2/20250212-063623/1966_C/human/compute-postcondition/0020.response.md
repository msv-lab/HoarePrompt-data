Output State: **`tc` must be greater than 0, `n` is `len(arr) - 1`, `arr` is a list of unique, sorted integers in descending order followed by 0, `dp` is `True`, `i` is equal to `n`.**

Explanation: The code `n = len(arr) - 1` calculates the length of the list `arr` and subtracts 1 from it, assigning the result to the variable `n`. The other variables (`tc`, `arr`, `dp`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
