Output State: **`tc` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of unique, sorted integers in descending order followed by 0, `dp` is True, `i` is `n`.**

Explanation: The code sets `dp` to `True`. The values of `tc`, `n`, `arr`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the output state includes these unchanged variables along with the updated value of `dp`.
