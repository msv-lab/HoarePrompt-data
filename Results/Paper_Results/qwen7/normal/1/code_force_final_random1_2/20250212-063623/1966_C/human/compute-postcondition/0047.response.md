Output State: `tc` is less than or equal to 0, `n` is 0, `arr` is a list containing unique, sorted integers in descending order followed by 0, `dp` is `arr[0] - arr[1] > 1 or not dp`, `i` is equal to 0.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `tc` will be less than or equal to 0 because it is decremented by 1 in each iteration until it becomes 0 or negative. The variable `n` will be 0 since it is set to `len(arr) - 1`, and `len(arr)` will be 1 when `arr` contains only one element (which is the last 0). The variable `i` will also be 0 as it starts from 1 and reaches the end of the list in the last iteration, but since the list has only one element, `i` will never be incremented beyond 0. The value of `dp` will be determined by the condition `arr[0] - arr[1] > 1 or not dp`, where `arr[1]` is 0, so the condition simplifies to `arr[0] > 1 or not dp`.
