Output State: `tc` must be greater than 0, `n` is `len(arr) - 1`, `arr` is a list of unique, sorted integers in descending order followed by 0, `dp` is `arr[n-1] - arr[n] > 1 or not dp`, `i` is `n`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`, as the loop increments `i` from 1 to `n-1`. The variable `dp` will be updated in each iteration based on the condition `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp`. Since the loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`, the final value of `dp` will be `arr[n-1] - arr[n] > 1 or not dp`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previous states within the loop.
