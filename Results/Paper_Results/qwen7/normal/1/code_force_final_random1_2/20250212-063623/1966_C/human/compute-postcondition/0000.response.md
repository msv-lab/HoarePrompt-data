Output State: **`tc` is an input integer, and all other variables are undefined.**

The code `tc = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `tc`. Since the input is read from the user, the exact value of `tc` is not known, but it is specified that `1 ≤ tc ≤ 10^4`. All other variables remain undefined after this line of code.
