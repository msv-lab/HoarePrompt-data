Output State: **`tc` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 1, `i` is `n + 1`, `dp` is `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `dp` based on the condition `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp`. Here, `i` is `n + 1`, so the updated value of `dp` is `arr[n + 1] - arr[n + 2] > 1 or not dp`. The other variables (`tc`, `n`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
