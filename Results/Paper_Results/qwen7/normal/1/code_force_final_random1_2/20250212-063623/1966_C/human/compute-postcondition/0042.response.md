Output State: `tc` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 1, `i` is equal to `n + (n - 1)`, `dp` is `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp`.

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `tc` remains greater than 0, `n` is at least 1, the index `i` will be equal to the original length of the array minus one plus the original length of the array minus two, which simplifies to `i` being `2*n - 2`. The variable `dp` will be set to `True` if the difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[i + 1]` is greater than 1, or `False` otherwise.
