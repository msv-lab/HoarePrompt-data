Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `k` is explicitly defined as 1.
- `i` is explicitly defined as 2.

The `print` statement is:

```python
print('?', 0, k, 0, i, flush=True)
```

Let's break down what will be printed:

- `'?'` is a string literal.
- `0` is an integer.
- `k` is explicitly defined as 1.
- `0` is an integer.
- `i` is explicitly defined as 2.

So, the `print` statement will output these values in the order they appear.

Output: **'? 0 1 0 2'**
