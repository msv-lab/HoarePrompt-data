Output: **'? 0 2 0 3'**

Explanation:
- `t` is greater than 0, but its specific value is not needed since it's not used in the print statement.
- `n` is greater than 1, but again, its specific value is not needed.
- `k` is explicitly defined as 2.
- `i` is explicitly defined as 3.
- `res` is an input string with the current value being '<', but this value is not used in the print statement.

Therefore, the print statement will output the string `'? 0 2 0 3'`.
