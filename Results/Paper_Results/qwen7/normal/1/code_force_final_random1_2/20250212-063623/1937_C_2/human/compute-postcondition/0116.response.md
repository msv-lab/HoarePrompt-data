Based on the initial state provided:
- `i` is explicitly given as 1.
- `n` is greater than or equal to 2 but no specific value is provided for `n`.

The variables `k` and `best` are not defined in the initial state, so their values cannot be determined from the given information. 

Given this, the print statement will include placeholders for `k` and `best`, along with the explicit value for `i`.

Output: **'? k best k 1'**
