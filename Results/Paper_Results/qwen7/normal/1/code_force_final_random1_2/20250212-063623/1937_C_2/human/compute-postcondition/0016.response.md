Output: **'? 0 3 0 4'**

Explanation:
- The variable `t` is greater than 0, but its specific value is not needed for the print statement.
- The variable `n` is greater than 3, but its specific value is not needed for the print statement.
- The variable `k` is explicitly given as 3.
- The variable `i` is explicitly given as 4.
- The variable `res` is an input string, but its value is not needed for the print statement.

The print statement outputs the string `'?'` followed by the values of `0`, `k`, `0`, and `i` in that order. Therefore, the output is `'? 0 3 0 4'`.
