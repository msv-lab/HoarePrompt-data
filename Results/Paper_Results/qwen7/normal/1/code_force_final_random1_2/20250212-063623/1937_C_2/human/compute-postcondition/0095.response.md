Output: **? 0 k 0 2**

Explanation:
- `i` is explicitly given as 2.
- `n` is mentioned to be greater than or equal to 2, but its exact value is not needed to determine the output of the print statement.
- `k` is not defined in the initial state, so it remains as `k` in the output.

The print statement outputs the string `?` followed by the integer `0`, then the variable `k`, another `0`, and finally the value of `i` which is 2. The `flush=True` parameter ensures that the output is flushed immediately, but it does not change the content of the output.
