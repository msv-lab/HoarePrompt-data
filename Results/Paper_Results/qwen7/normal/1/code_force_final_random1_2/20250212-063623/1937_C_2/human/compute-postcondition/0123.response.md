Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 2
   - `res` is an input string (its value is not relevant for adjusting the loop state)
   - If `res` equals '<', `best` is set to 1 (this condition does not affect the loop continuation)

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1 and `n` is greater than or equal to 2, the loop can continue because `i < n`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 2.
   - `n` remains unchanged and still needs to be greater than or equal to 2.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is:

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 2**
