Output: **? 1 2 1 3** 

Explanation:
- `k` is defined as `n-1`. Since `n` must be at least 2, the smallest possible value for `n` is 2. Therefore, `k` is `2-1`, which equals 1.
- `best` is explicitly given as 2.
- The other values (`?`, `k`, `best`, `k`, `i`) are directly printed as they are, without any calculation needed. Here, `i` is explicitly given as 3.
