Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `total` is 1.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` must be at least 2.
   - `k` is `n-1`.
   - `res` is the string with the current value being '<'.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('?', k, best, k, i, flush=True)
   ```

From the initial state:
- `k` is defined as `n-1`. Since `n` must be at least 2, let's assume the smallest possible value for `n`, which is 2. Therefore, `k = 2 - 1 = 1`.
- `best` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its value. We will leave it as `best` in the output.

Now, substituting the known values into the print statement:
```python
print('?', 1, best, 1, 2, flush=True)
```

The output will be:
Output: **'? 1 best 1 2'**
