Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is an input integer greater than 3, `res` is an input string**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The initial state of `i` being 3 and `n` being greater than 3 remains valid, and the value of `res` (an input string) is unchanged. Therefore, `i` is still 3, `n` is now an input integer greater than 3, and `res` remains as an input string.
