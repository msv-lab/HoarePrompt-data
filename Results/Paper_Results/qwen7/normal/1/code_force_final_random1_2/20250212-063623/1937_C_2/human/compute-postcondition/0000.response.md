State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is not explicitly defined but will be an integer representing the current iteration, input function must return valid integers for the loop to continue**.

Explanation:
- The loop will execute as long as there are test cases to process. This means the variable `t` (number of test cases) must be greater than 0 for the loop to start.
- The loop variable `_` is automatically assigned an integer value by the `range(int(input()))` expression, starting from 0 up to `t-1`. It does not need to be explicitly set before the loop; its initial value and the condition for its assignment are handled by the loop itself.
- The `input()` function must return valid integers for both `t` and `n` within each iteration to ensure the loop continues executing. If `input()` returns non-integer values or if the loop encounters any issues with the input, the loop may terminate prematurely.

Therefore, the key states that need adjustment are ensuring `t` is greater than 0 and that the `input()` function provides valid integers for the loop to proceed.
