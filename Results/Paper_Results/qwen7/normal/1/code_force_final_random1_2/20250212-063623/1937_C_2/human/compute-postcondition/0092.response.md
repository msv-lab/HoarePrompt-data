Output State: **`best` is `n-1`, `i` is `n`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is `n-1`, and `res` is an input string**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The values of `best`, `i`, `k`, and `res` remain unchanged from their initial state.
