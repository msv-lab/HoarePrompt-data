Output State: **`res` is a new string from the input, `i` is `i_end + 2`, `k` is `i_end + 1`, and `n` must be greater than `i_end + 2`**.

Explanation: The code `res = input()` assigns a new string value obtained from user input to the variable `res`. The values of `i`, `k`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
