Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the variable `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop `for i in range(1, n)` will start with `i` as 1 and increment `i` until `i` is less than `n`.
   - For the loop to start, `i` must be 1 (the starting point of the range) and `n` must be greater than 1 (since the range starts from 1 and goes up to but not including `n`).

3. **Check the given states**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to the original value of `n`.
   - `k` is equal to `n-1`.
   - `i` is equal to `n-1`.
   - `res` is the last input string received during the loop execution.
   - If `res` equals '<', `k` is set to `n-1`.
   - `best` is 0.

4. **Adjust the states to meet the loop execution requirements**:
   - Since `i` should be 1 for the loop to start, we need to adjust `i` to be 1.
   - Since `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to start, we need to ensure `n` is greater than 1.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

Therefore, the final state should be:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1**
