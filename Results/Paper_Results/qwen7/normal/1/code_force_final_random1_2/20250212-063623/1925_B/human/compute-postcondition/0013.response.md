Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `q` is 0, `x` is a valid integer input, `n` is the second integer input split from the input, `ans` is the maximum of `ans` and `x // i`, `i` is the result of `x // i`, and `(x - n * i)` is greater than or equal to 0 and divisible by `i`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans` to be the maximum of its current value and `x // i`. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is now updated to reflect the maximum between its previous value and the result of `x // i`.
