Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads `x` and `n` from the input.
3. It initializes `ans` to 1, which is the minimum possible GCD.
4. The program then iterates through potential divisors `i` of `x` up to the square root of `x`. This is an efficient approach because any factor larger than the square root would have a corresponding factor smaller than the square root.
5. For each divisor `i`, it checks if `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, and if so, updates `ans` to be the maximum of its current value and `i`.
6. Similarly, it checks if `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative and divisible by `x // i`, and if so, updates `ans` to be the maximum of its current value and `x // i`.
7. After checking all possible divisors, it prints the final value of `ans`.

Given the logic and the steps taken, the program correctly calculates the maximum balance (GCD) of the sub-problems' difficulties.

Correctness: **True**
