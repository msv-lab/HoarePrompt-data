Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `q` is 0, `x` is the first integer input split from the input, `n` is the second integer input split from the input.**

Explanation: The code splits the input into two integers using `map(int, input().split(' '))` and assigns them to `x` and `n` respectively. The precondition that `int(input())` must be at least `t + 1` remains valid, and `q` remains 0 as it was initially.
