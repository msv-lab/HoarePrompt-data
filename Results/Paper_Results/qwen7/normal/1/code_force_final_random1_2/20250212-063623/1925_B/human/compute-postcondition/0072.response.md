Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `q` is 1.
- `x` is the first integer input.
- `n` is the second integer input.
- `ans` is the maximum value obtained from the conditions within the loop for all `i` in the range from 1 to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.
- `i` is `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.
- `sqrt(x)` is a non-negative integer.
- The loop has executed for all possible values of `i` in its defined range.

The key point here is that `ans` is the maximum value obtained from the conditions within the loop. Since the loop has executed for all possible values of `i` in its defined range, `ans` will hold the highest value that was computed during these iterations.

Given that the loop has completed its execution, `i` is set to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`, but this value itself does not affect the value of `ans`.

Therefore, the value printed will be the maximum value computed during the loop iterations.

Output: **ans (where ans is the maximum value obtained from the conditions within the loop for all i in the range from 1 to int(sqrt(x)) + 1)**
