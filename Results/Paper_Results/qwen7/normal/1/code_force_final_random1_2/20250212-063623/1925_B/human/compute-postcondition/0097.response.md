Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `sqrt(x)`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `x` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^3\).
   - `sqrt(x)` is a non-negative integer.
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
   - `ans` is updated based on certain conditions.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, the new value of `i` will be the previous value of `i` plus 1.
   - The value of `sqrt(x)` does not change within the loop, so it remains the same as the previous iteration.
   - The value of `ans` may or may not change depending on the conditions inside the loop body, but we cannot determine its exact value without knowing the loop body. However, we know that `ans` is updated if certain conditions are met.

Given the above points, we can conclude the following for the next iteration:

- `i` will be the previous value of `i` plus 1.
- `sqrt(x)` remains the same.
- `ans` remains unchanged unless the conditions inside the loop body are met, but we don't have the exact value of `ans` from the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`x` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^3\), `sqrt(x)` is a non-negative integer, `i` is incremented by 1, and `ans` remains unchanged.**

However, since we need to provide a specific state, we can express it as follows:

State: **`x` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^3\), `sqrt(x)` is a non-negative integer, `i` is the previous value of `i` plus 1, and `ans` remains unchanged.**
