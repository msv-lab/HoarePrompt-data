Postcondition: `x` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^3\), `sqrt(x)` is a non-negative integer, `i` is incremented by 1, and `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `x // i` if \(x - n \times (x // i) \geq 0\) and \((x - n \times (x // i)) \% (x // i) == 0\). Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.
