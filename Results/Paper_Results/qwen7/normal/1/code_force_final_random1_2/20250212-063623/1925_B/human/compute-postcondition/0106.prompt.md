Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `q` is 2, `x` is the first integer input, `n` is the second integer input, `ans` is 1, `i` is `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`, `sqrt(x)` is a non-negative integer, and `x` and `n` are updated to the values of the two integers inputted by the user.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, int(sqrt(x)) + 1):
    if x % i == 0:
        if x - n * i >= 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0:
            ans = max(ans, i)
        if x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and (x - n * (x // i)) % (x //
            i) == 0:
            ans = max(ans, x // i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `x` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^3\), `sqrt(x)` is a non-negative integer, and `ans` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `x // i` if there exists an integer `i` (\(1 \leq i \leq x\)) such that `x % i == 0` and the condition `(x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and ((x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0)` is true. If no such `i` exists or the condition is false, `ans` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `x` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^3\), `sqrt(x)` is a non-negative integer, `i` is incremented by 1, and `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `x // i` if the condition \(x - n \times (x // i) \geq 0\) and \((x - n \times (x // i)) \% (x // i) == 0\) is satisfied. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `x` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^3\), `sqrt(x)` is a non-negative integer, `i` is the previous value of `i` plus 1, and `ans` is the maximum of its current value and `x // i`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
