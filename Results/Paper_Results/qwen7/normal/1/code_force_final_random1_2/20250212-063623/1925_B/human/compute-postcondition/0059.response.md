Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `q` is 1, `x` is the first integer input, `n` is the second integer input, `ans` is the maximum of `ans` and `2`, `i` is 2, `sqrt(x)` is a non-negative integer, and the condition `2 <= int(sqrt(x)) + 1` must be true. If `x - n * (x // i) >= 0` and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0` is true, then `ans` is updated to the maximum of `ans` and `x // i`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.
