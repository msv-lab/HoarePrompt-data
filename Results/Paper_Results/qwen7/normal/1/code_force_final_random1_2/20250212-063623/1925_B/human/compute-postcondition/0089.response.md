Output State: **`ans` is the maximum of its previous value and `i`, `i` is `i + 1`, `x` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^3\), `sqrt(x)` is a non-negative integer.**

Explanation: The line `ans = max(ans, i)` updates `ans` to be the maximum value between its current value and `i`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The conditions for `x` and `sqrt(x)` remain unchanged.
