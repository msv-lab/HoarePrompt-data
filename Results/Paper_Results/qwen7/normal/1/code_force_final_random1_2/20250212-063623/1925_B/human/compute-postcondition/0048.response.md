Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `q` is 1, `x` is the first integer input, `n` is the second integer input, `ans` is the maximum of `ans` and `i`, `i` is 1, `sqrt(x)` is a non-negative integer, and the current value of `i` is a divisor of `x`. Additionally, if `x - n * (x // i)` is greater than or equal to 0, `x // i` is greater than 0, and `(x - n * (x // i))` is divisible by `x // i`, then `ans` is updated to be the maximum of `ans` and `x // i`.**
