Postcondition: `s` is an input string with at least one character, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is 3, `ans` is `ss` + `ss` + `ss`, `ss` is the next character in the string `s` after the previous `ss`, `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a') + 1`. This is because if the condition `cur == (1 << k) - 1` is true, `cur` will be set to 0, and if it is false, `cur` remains unchanged, but in this case, there is no else part to change the state further.
