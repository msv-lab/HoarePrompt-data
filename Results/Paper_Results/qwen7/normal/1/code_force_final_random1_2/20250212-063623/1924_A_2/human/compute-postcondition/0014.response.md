Postcondition: `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`, `cur` is `(1 << k) - 1`. If `cur & 1 << cur_ss` is `0`, the condition is not met, and no change is made to the variables. If `cur & 1 << cur_ss` is `1`, the condition is met, but no specific changes are mentioned in the if part, so the variables remain unchanged.
