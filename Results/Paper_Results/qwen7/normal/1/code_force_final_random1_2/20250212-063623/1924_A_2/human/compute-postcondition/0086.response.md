Output State: **`s` is an input string with at least one character, `cur` is 1 << (ord(ss) - ord('a')), `cnt` is 1, `ans` is `ss`, `ss` is the next character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the difference between the ASCII value of `ss` and the ASCII value of 'a'**

Explanation: The code `cur += 1 << cur_ss` shifts the binary representation of `1` left by `cur_ss` positions and adds it to `cur`. Here, `cur_ss` is the difference between the ASCII value of `ss` (the current character in the string `s`) and the ASCII value of `'a'`. This operation updates the value of `cur` without affecting the other variables.
