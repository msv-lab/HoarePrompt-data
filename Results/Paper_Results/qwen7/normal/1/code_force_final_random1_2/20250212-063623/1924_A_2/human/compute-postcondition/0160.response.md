Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `s` is a non-empty string.
- `cur` is incremented by `1 << cur_ss` if the condition `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0` is met and `cur` is not equal to \(2^k - 1\).
- If the condition is not met or `cur` equals \(2^k - 1\), `cur`, `cnt`, `ans`, and `cur_ss` remain unchanged.

### Loop Head:
```python
for ss in s:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over each character `ss` in the string `s`.
- The loop does not directly modify `s`, but it modifies `cur`, `cnt`, `ans`, and `cur_ss`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop will continue as long as there are characters left in `s` to iterate over.
   - Therefore, the next character `ss` in `s` must be the first character of the remaining string.

2. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since the loop body is omitted, no direct modifications to `cur`, `cnt`, `ans`, or `cur_ss` are made within the loop itself.
   - However, the loop will continue if there are more characters in `s`.

### Final State:
- `s` must still be a non-empty string, but now it should be the string without the first character (since the loop will process the first character in the next iteration).
- `cur`, `cnt`, `ans`, and `cur_ss` remain unchanged from the previous state.

### Answer:
State: **`s` is a non-empty string (first character removed), `cur` is incremented by \(1 << cur_ss\) if the condition `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0` is met and `cur` is not equal to \(2^k - 1\). If the condition is not met or `cur` equals \(2^k - 1\), `cur`, `cnt`, `ans`, and `cur_ss` remain unchanged.**
