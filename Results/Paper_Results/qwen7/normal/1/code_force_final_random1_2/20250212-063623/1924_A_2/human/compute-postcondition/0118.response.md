Output State: **`tmp` is 'd', `cur` remains 0, `cnt` remains equal to the length of `s`, `ans` remains a string containing every character of `s` repeated three times consecutively, `cur_ss` remains representing the difference between the ASCII value of each character in `s` and the ASCII value of 'a', `i` becomes 4.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `tmp` to the character whose ASCII value is `ord('a') + i`. Since `i` was initially set to 3 and is now incremented to 4, `tmp` becomes `'d'`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
