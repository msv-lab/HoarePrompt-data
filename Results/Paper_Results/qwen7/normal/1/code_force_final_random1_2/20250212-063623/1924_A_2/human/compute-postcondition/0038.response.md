Output State: **`cur` is 0, `cnt` is 1, `ans` is `ss` + `ss`, and `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`**

Explanation: The code `ans += ss` appends the string `ss` to the existing value of `ans`. Initially, `ans` is `ss`. After executing the code, `ans` becomes `ss + ss`. The values of `cur` and `cnt` remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated values are as stated above.
