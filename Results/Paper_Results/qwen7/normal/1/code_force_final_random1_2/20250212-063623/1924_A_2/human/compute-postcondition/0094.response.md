Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `ss` and `s`.

2. **Understand the current state**: 
   - `s` is an input string with at least one character.
   - `cur` is `(1 << k) - 1`.
   - `cnt` is 2.
   - `ans` is `ss` + `ss`.
   - `ss` is the next character in the string `s`.
   - `cur_ss` is the difference between the ASCII value of `ss` and the ASCII value of 'a'.

3. **Determine the changes in the loop head**:
   - `ss` is the next character in the string `s` at the start of each iteration.
   - `s` remains the same throughout the loop since it is the input string.

4. **Calculate the new state**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `ss` was the next character in the string `s`.
   - For the next iteration, `ss` will be the next character in the string `s` after the current `ss`.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `s` remains unchanged.
   - `cur` remains unchanged.
   - `cnt` remains unchanged.
   - `ans` remains unchanged.
   - `ss` is now the next character in the string `s` after the previous `ss`.
   - `cur_ss` is the difference between the ASCII value of the new `ss` and the ASCII value of 'a'.

Given this reasoning, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`s` is an input string with at least one character, `cur` is `(1 << k) - 1`, `cnt` is 2, `ans` is `ss` + `ss`, `ss` is the next character in the string `s` after the previous `ss`, `cur_ss` is the difference between the ASCII value of `ss` and the ASCII value of 'a'**.
