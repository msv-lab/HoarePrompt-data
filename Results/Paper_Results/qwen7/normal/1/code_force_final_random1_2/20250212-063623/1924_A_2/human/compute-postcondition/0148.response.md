Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string; `cur_ss` is the difference between the ASCII value of the first character of `s` and the ASCII value of 'a'; `cnt` is equal to the original value of `cnt` plus 1; `cur` is 0; `ans` is the value of `ss` added to the original value of `ans`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += ss` adds the value of `ss` to `ans`. Since `ss` is the difference between the ASCII value of the first character of `s` and the ASCII value of 'a', and none of the other variables (`cur_ss`, `cnt`, `cur`) are affected by this operation, their values remain unchanged. The only new information is that `ans` now includes the value of `ss`.
