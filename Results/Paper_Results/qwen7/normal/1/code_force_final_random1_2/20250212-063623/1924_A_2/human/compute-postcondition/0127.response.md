The code snippet `ans += tmp` appends the value of `tmp` to the end of the string `ans`. Given the initial state, `tmp` is 'j'. The variable `ans` is a string containing every character of `s` repeated three times consecutively. Since `tmp` is 'j', it will be appended to `ans`.

The other variables (`cur`, `cnt`, `cur_ss`, `i`) are not affected by this operation. The loop has completed all its iterations, so their states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`tmp` is 'j', `cur` is 0, `cnt` is equal to the length of `s`, `ans` is a string containing every character of `s` repeated three times consecutively plus 'j', `cur_ss` represents the difference between the ASCII value of each character in `s` and the ASCII value of 'a', and it resets to 0 whenever `cur` reaches \((1 << k) - 1\), `i` is 7.**
