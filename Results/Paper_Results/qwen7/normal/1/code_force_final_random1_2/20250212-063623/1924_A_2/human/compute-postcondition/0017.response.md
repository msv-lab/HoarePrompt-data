Output State: **`cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is `cnt + 1`**

Explanation: The variable `cur` is set to 0, which overrides its previous value of `(1 << k) - 1`. The variable `cnt` remains unchanged from its previous state of `cnt + 1`. The value of `cur_ss` stays the same as it was not affected by the code snippet.
