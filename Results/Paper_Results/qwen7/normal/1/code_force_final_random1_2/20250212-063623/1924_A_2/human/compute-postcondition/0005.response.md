Output State: **`cur` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `cnt` is 0, `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `s` is the string input by the user.**

The code initializes `cur` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `i`, `cnt`, `n`, `k`, `m`, or `s`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
