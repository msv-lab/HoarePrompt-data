Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^5, and we have read one integer input which is assigned to `t`.**

This means that the variable `t` has been updated to the integer value entered by the user, while all other conditions and constraints remain unchanged. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `m`, and `s`) have not yet been assigned any values.
