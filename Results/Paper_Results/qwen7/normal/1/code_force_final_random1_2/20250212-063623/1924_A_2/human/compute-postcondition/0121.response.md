Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `tmp` is 'd'
   - `cur` remains 0
   - `cnt` remains equal to the length of `s`
   - `ans` remains a string containing every character of `s` repeated three times consecutively
   - `cur_ss` remains representing the difference between the ASCII value of each character in `s` and the ASCII value of 'a'
   - `i` becomes 4 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(k):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The loop variable `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `k`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 4, and the loop breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `k`.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since the loop condition is based on `i < k`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 5 (assuming `k` is at least 5).
   - All other variables (`tmp`, `cur`, `cnt`, `ans`, `cur_ss`) remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` must be 5.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`tmp` is 'd', `cur` remains 0, `cnt` remains equal to the length of `s`, `ans` remains a string containing every character of `s` repeated three times consecutively, `cur_ss` remains representing the difference between the ASCII value of each character in `s` and the ASCII value of 'a', `i` is 5**
