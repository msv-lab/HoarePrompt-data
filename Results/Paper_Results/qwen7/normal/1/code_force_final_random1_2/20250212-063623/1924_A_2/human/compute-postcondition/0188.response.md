Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable `i` is being iterated from `0` to `k-1`.
   - The loop variable `k` is a positive integer.

2. **Determine the Current State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - `k` is a positive integer.
   - The condition `cur & 1 << i` is checked, and based on its result, either `tmp` is set to 'b' or no change occurs.

3. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `i` starts from `0` and increments by `1` in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `2`.
   - The value of `k` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.

4. **Formulate the New State:**
   - `i` will be `2` at the start of the next iteration.
   - `k` remains a positive integer.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 2, `k` is a positive integer**
