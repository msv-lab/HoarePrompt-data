Output State: **`s` is an input string with at least one character, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is 1, `ans` is `ss`**.

Explanation: The code `ans += ss` adds the string `ss` to the existing value of `ans`. Since `ss` is not defined elsewhere in the given context, it is assumed to be a typo and should be `s`. Therefore, `ans` is updated to include the string `s`. The values of `cur` and `cnt` remain unchanged.
