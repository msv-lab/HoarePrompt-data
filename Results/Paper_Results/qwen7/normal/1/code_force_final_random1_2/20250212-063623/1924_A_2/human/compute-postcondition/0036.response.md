Output State: **`cur` is updated to either `cur + (1 << cur_ss)` or remains as `(1 << k) - 1`, `cnt` is incremented by 1 to `cnt + 1`, `ans` is `ss`, and `cur_ss` is equal to `ord(ss) - ord('a')`.**

Explanation: The line `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. Since the other variables (`cur`, `ans`, and `cur_ss`) are not directly modified by this line of code, their states remain unchanged from the initial state. Therefore, `cnt` is incremented by 1, and the other variables retain their previous conditions.
