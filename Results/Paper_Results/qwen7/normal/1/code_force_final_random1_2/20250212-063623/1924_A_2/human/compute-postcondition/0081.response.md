Output State: **`s` is an input string with at least one character, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is 1**.

Explanation: The line `cur = 0` sets the value of `cur` to 0, effectively resetting it from its initial value which was calculated based on the first character of the string `s`. The other variables, `s` and `cnt`, remain unchanged.
