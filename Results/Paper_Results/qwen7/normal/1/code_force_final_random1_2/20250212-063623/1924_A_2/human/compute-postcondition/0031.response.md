Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `ss` from the `for ss in s:` statement. This means the only variable that can be adjusted is `ss`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop iterates over each character in the string `s`. After each iteration, `ss` takes on the value of the next character in the string `s`.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since `ss` is the only variable in the loop head, it will be set to the next character in the string `s`.
   - The other variables (`cur`, `cnt`, and `ans`) are not directly modified by the loop head and their values remain unchanged until the loop body is executed.

Given the postconditions provided, the relevant information for the next iteration is that `ss` will be the next character in the string `s`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop will be:

**State: **`cur` is updated to either `cur + (1 << cur_ss)` or remains as `(1 << k) - 1`, `cnt` is incremented by 1, and `ans` is `ss`. If `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cur` is reset to 0, `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`, `cnt` is incremented by 1, and `ans` is concatenated with `ss`. The only thing that changes is `ss` to the next character in the string `s`.**
