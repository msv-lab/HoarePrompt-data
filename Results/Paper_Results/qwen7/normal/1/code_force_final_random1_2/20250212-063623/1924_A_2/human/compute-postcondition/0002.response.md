Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 0, `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code reads three integers from the user input and splits them into variables `n`, `k`, and `m`. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state.
