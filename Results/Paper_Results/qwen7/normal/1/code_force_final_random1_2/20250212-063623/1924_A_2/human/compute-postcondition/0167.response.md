Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string with its first character removed, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is 1, `ans` is `ans` + `ss`, `cur_ss` is equal to the ASCII value of the first character of `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a'.**

Explanation: The code `ans += ss` adds the value of `ss` to `ans`. Here, `ss` is equal to `cur_ss`, which is the ASCII value of the first character of `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a'. All other variables remain unchanged.
