Output State: **`i` is 2; `k` is a positive integer; `tmp` is 'c'**

Explanation: The code `tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)` calculates the character corresponding to the ASCII value of 'a' plus the value of `i`. Since `i` is 2, `ord('a') + i` equals 97 + 2, which is 99. The ASCII value 99 corresponds to the character 'c'. Therefore, `tmp` is assigned the value 'c'. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and `k` is still a positive integer.
