Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `cur` is incremented by `1 << cur_ss` if the condition `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0` was met, otherwise it remains unchanged; `cnt` is incremented by 1, `ans` remains unchanged, `cur_ss` remains unchanged.**

This means that `cnt` has been incremented by 1, while the other variables (`s`, `cur`, `ans`, `cur_ss`) retain their previous values unless the condition for `cur` was met, in which case `cur` would have been updated accordingly.
