Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The input string `s` has been fully processed, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is equal to the length of `s`, `ans` is a string containing every character of `s` repeated three times consecutively, the variable `cur_ss` represents the difference between the ASCII value of each character in `s` and the ASCII value of 'a', and it resets to 0 whenever `cur` reaches \((1 << k) - 1\), and `tmp` is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    if cur & 1 << i == 0:
        tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `cur` is 0, `cnt` is equal to the length of `s`, `ans` is a string containing every character of `s` repeated three times consecutively, `cur_ss` represents the difference between the ASCII value of each character in `s` and the ASCII value of 'a', and it resets to 0 whenever `cur` reaches \((1 << k) - 1\), `tmp` is "b", `i` is 2, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `tmp` is 'd', `cur` remains 0, `cnt` remains equal to the length of `s`, `ans` remains a string containing every character of `s` repeated three times consecutively, `cur_ss` remains representing the difference between the ASCII value of each character in `s` and the ASCII value of 'a', `i` becomes 4 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `tmp` is 'j', `cur` remains 0, `cnt` remains equal to the length of `s`, `ans` remains a string containing every character of `s` repeated three times consecutively, `cur_ss` remains representing the difference between the ASCII value of each character in `s` and the ASCII value of 'a', `i` is 5 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
