Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^5, and we have read one integer input which is assigned to `t`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n, k, m = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    cnt = 0
    cur = 0
    ans = ''
    for ss in s:
        cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
        if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
            cur += 1 << cur_ss
        if cur == (1 << k) - 1:
            cnt += 1
            cur = 0
            ans += ss
    if cnt >= n:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
        tmp = ''
        for i in range(k):
            if cur & 1 << i == 0:
                tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)
                break
        ans += tmp
        ans += 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)
        print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: All characters of the string `s` are processed, `cur` is reset to 0, `cnt` is the total number of times `cur` reached `(1 << k) - 1`, and `ans` is a string containing all characters of `s` repeated according to the conditions specified in the loop. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to include 'e', followed by 'a' * (5 - cnt - 1), and `i` is set to 5.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The input string `s` has been fully processed, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is equal to the length of `s`, `ans` is a string containing every character of `s` repeated three times consecutively. The variable `cur_ss` represents the difference between the ASCII value of each character in `s` and the ASCII value of 'a', and it resets to 0 whenever `cur` reaches \((1 << k) - 1\). If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `ans` is updated by adding 'j' once and 'a' repeated \(n - cnt - 1\) times to the end of `ans`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: All characters of the string `s` have been processed, `cur` is reset to 0, `cnt` is the total number of times `cur` reached \(2^k - 1\), and `ans` is the original string `s` concatenated with itself three times. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `ans` is the original string `s` concatenated with itself three times followed by 'a' repeated `n - cnt - 1` times.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
