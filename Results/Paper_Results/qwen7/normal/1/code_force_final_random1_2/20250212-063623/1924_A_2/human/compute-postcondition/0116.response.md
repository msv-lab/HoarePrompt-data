Postcondition: `cur` is 0, `cnt` is equal to the length of `s`, `ans` is a string containing every character of `s` repeated three times consecutively, `cur_ss` represents the difference between the ASCII value of each character in `s` and the ASCII value of 'a', and it resets to 0 whenever `cur` reaches \((1 << k) - 1\), `tmp` is "b", `i` is 2, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken.
