Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `tmp` is 'c'
   - `cur` is reset to 0
   - `cnt` is the total number of times `cur` reached `(1 << k) - 1`
   - `ans` is a string containing all characters of `s` repeated according to the conditions specified in the loop
   - `i` is 3

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` from 0 to `k-1`.
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < k`.

3. **Condition to Break the Loop:**
   - The loop breaks if `cur & 1 << i == 0`.

4. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3.

5. **Determine the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will become 4.

6. **Check the Loop Condition:**
   - We need to check if `cur & 1 << 4 == 0`.
   - Since `cur` is reset to 0 at the beginning of each iteration, `cur & 1 << 4` will always be 0 (because `cur` is 0 and 0 & anything is 0).

7. **Adjust the States:**
   - `tmp` remains 'c' because it is not affected by the loop.
   - `cur` remains 0 because it is reset at the beginning of each iteration.
   - `cnt` remains unchanged because the condition for incrementing `cnt` is not met (since `cur` is 0).
   - `ans` remains unchanged because the loop body is omitted and no operations are performed that affect `ans`.
   - `i` becomes 4.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`tmp` is 'c', `cur` is 0, `cnt` is the total number of times `cur` reached `(1 << k) - 1`, `ans` is a string containing all characters of `s` repeated according to the conditions specified in the loop, and `i` is 4**.
