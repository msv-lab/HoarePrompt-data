Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `cnt` is 0, `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `s` is the string input by the user.**

Explanation: The line `cnt = 0` initializes the variable `cnt` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
