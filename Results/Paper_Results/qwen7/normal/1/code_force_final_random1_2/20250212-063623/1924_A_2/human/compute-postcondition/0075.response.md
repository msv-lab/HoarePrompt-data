Output State: **`s` is an input string that must have at least one character; `cur_ss` is the integer value of the first character of `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a'**.

Explanation: The code calculates the ASCII value of the first character of the string `s` and subtracts the ASCII value of 'a' from it. This results in the value of `cur_ss`. The initial state of `s` remains unchanged, but now `cur_ss` holds the calculated value.
