Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cnt` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is the input string, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is equal to the length of `s`, `ans` is a string containing every character of `s` repeated three times consecutively, `cur_ss` resets to 0 whenever `cur` reaches \((1 << k) - 1\), `ans` is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for ss in s:
    cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
    if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
        cur += 1 << cur_ss
    if cur == (1 << k) - 1:
        cnt += 1
        cur = 0
        ans += ss


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `s` is a non-empty string; `cur_ss` is the difference between the ASCII value of the first character of `s` and the ASCII value of 'a'; if `cur` equals \(2^k - 1\), then `cnt` is incremented by 1, `cur` is set to 0, and `ans` is updated to `ss + ans`; otherwise, the values of `cnt`, `cur`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `s` is a non-empty string, `cur` is incremented by `1 << cur_ss` if the condition `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0` is met and `cur` is not equal to \(2^k - 1\). If the condition is not met or `cur` equals \(2^k - 1\), `cur`, `cnt`, `ans`, and `cur_ss` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `s` is a non-empty string with its first character removed, `cur` is incremented by \(1 << cur_ss\) if the condition `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0` is met and `cur` is not equal to \(2^k - 1\); otherwise, `cur`, `cnt`, `ans`, and `cur_ss` remain unchanged; `cur_ss` is equal to the ASCII value of the first character of `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a'. If `cur` equals \(2^k - 1\), then `cur` remains unchanged, `cnt` remains 1, `ans` remains `ans + ss`, and `cur_ss` remains the same as the ASCII value of the first character of `s` minus the ASCII value of 'a'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
