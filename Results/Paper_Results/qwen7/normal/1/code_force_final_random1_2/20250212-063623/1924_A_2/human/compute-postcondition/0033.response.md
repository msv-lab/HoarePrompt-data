Output State: **`cur` is updated to `cur + (1 << cur_ss)`, `cnt` is incremented by 1, `ans` is `ss`, `cur_ss` is equal to `ord(ss) - ord('a')`.**

Explanation: The code updates `cur` by adding `1 << cur_ss` to its current value. `cnt` is incremented by 1, and `ans` remains `ss`. `cur_ss` is calculated as `ord(ss) - ord('a')`, which does not change due to the code execution.
