Output State: **`s` is an input string with at least one character, `cur` is `(1 << (ord(ss) - ord('a'))) - 1 + 1 << (ord(ss) - ord('a')), `cnt` is 2, `ans` is `ss` + `ss`, `ss` is the next character in the string `s` after the previous `ss`, `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a') + 1`**

Explanation: The line `cur += 1 << cur_ss` increments `cur` by `1 << cur_ss`. Given that `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`, `cur` is updated to `(1 << (ord(ss) - ord('a'))) - 1 + 1 << (ord(ss) - ord('a'))`. All other variables remain unchanged.
