Postcondition: `i` is `feat[0] + 3`, `n` is greater than `feat[0] + 2`. If `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`, then `array2` has an additional element which is `(arr[feat[0] + 3] - arr[feat[0] + 2]) * a`. Since there is no else part, no additional changes occur in the case where the condition is not met.
