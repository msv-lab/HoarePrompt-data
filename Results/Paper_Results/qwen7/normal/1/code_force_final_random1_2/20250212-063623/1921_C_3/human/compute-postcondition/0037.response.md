Output State: **`i` is `feat[0] + 1`, `n` is `feat[0]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `array2` is an empty list, `feat` is a list of integers obtained from user input, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from input.**

The code initializes an empty list `array2`. This does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, `b`, `feat`, `f`, `a`, or `arr`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
