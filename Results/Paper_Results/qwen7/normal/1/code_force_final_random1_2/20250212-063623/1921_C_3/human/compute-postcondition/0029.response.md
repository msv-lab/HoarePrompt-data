Postcondition: **After the if-else block executes, `i` will be equal to `n`, `array2` will contain the product of the differences between consecutive elements of `arr` that are less than `b/a` scaled by `a`, and `n` will still be greater than 1. Additionally, if the sum of the elements in `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is less than `f`, the sum will be less than `f`. Otherwise, the sum will be greater than or equal to `f`.**
