Output State: **`arr` is an array of integers, `i` is `n-1`, `a` is a non-zero value, `b` is a value, `array2` contains the element `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` to `array2`. Given that `i` is `n-1`, the expression simplifies to `(arr[n-1] - arr[n-2]) * a`. This value is appended to `array2`, and no other variables are affected. The initial conditions of `arr`, `i`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
