Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `n`.
2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n-1` (inclusive) because of `range(1, n)`.
3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `arr` is an array of integers.
   - `i` is an index within the bounds of `arr`.
   - `a` is a non-zero value.
   - `b` is a value such that if the difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[i - 1]` is less than `b / a`, then `array2` contains one element which is `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`. If the condition is not met, `array2` remains unchanged.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was within the bounds of `arr` and was set to `n-1` (since the loop runs up to `n-1`).
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will become `n`.

5. **Ensure the new state meets the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`. Since `i` will now be `n`, the loop will stop executing.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

- `i` will be `n`.
- `n` remains the same.
- `arr`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`arr` is an array of integers, `i` is `n`, `a` is a non-zero value, `b` is a value such that if the difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[i - 1]` is less than `b / a`, then `array2` contains one element which is `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`. If the condition is not met, `array2` remains unchanged.**
