Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `feat[0] + (n - 1)`
- `n` is greater than `feat[0] + (n - 1) - 1`
- `array2` contains the product `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` for every index `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1` where the difference `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]` is less than the ratio `b / a`.
- The sum of `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is less than `f`.

The print statement is `print('Yes')`.

Given this information, the print statement directly outputs the string `'Yes'`. There are no variables or objects being evaluated or printed within the print statement itself; it simply prints the string as written.

Output: **Yes**
