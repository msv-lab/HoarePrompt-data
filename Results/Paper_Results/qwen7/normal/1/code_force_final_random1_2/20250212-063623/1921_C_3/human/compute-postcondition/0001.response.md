State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0 and `i` is 0**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop is defined as `for i in range(test_cases):`.
2. For the loop to execute, `test_cases` must be a positive integer because `range()` function generates numbers starting from 0 up to (but not including) the specified value.
3. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 when the loop starts, as `range(test_cases)` generates values from 0 to `test_cases - 1`.
4. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, `test_cases` must be greater than 0, and `i` should be set to 0.

Thus, the required state adjustments are:
- `test_cases` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
