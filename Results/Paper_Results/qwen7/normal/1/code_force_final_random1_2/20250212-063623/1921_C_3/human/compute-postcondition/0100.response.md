Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the range function parameters `0` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to `feat[0] + 1`.
   - `n` is initially set to `feat[0]`.
   - The loop iterates over `range(0, n)`, meaning `i` will take values from `0` to `n-1`.

3. **Check if the loop can execute**:
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than `0`.
   - When `i` starts, it should be within the range defined by `range(0, n)`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is set to `feat[0] + 1`, it will start from `feat[0] + 1` and will not be in the range `0` to `n-1` (where `n = feat[0]`). This means the loop will not execute because `i` will never be in the valid range.
   - Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `i` is within the range `0` to `n-1`.

5. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - We need to ensure that `n` is greater than `0` for the loop to execute.
   - We need to adjust `i` to be within the range `0` to `n-1`.

Given the above reasoning, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` and `i`.

**Final State**:
State: **`arr` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `array2` is an empty list**
