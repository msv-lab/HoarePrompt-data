Postcondition: **`i` is equal to `feat[0] + (n - 1)`, `n` is greater than `feat[0] + (n - 1) - 1`, and `array2` contains the product `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` for every index `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1` where the difference `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]` is less than the ratio `b / a`. Additionally, the sum of the elements in `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is either less than `f` or greater than or equal to `f` depending on whether the if condition is true or false.**
