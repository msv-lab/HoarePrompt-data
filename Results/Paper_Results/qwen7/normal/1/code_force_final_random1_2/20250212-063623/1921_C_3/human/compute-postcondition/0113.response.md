Postcondition: `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `array2` is a list containing one element which is `(arr[1] - arr[0]) * a`, and the difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[i - 1]` is less than `b / a`.
