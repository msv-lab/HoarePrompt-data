Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(test_cases):
    feat = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
    n = feat[0]
    f = feat[1]
    a = feat[2]
    b = feat[-1]
    arr = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
    array2 = []
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a:
            array2.append((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a)
    if sum(array2) + (n - len(array2)) * b < f:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After the if-else block executes, `i` will be equal to `n`, `array2` will contain the product of the differences between consecutive elements of `arr` that are less than `b/a` scaled by `a`, and `n` will still be greater than 1. Additionally, if the sum of the elements in `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is less than `f`, the sum will be less than `f`. Otherwise, the sum will be greater than or equal to `f`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is equal to `feat[0] + (n - 1)`, `n` is greater than `feat[0] + (n - 1) - 1`, and `array2` contains the product `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` for every index `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1` where the difference `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]` is less than the ratio `b / a`. Additionally, the sum of the elements in `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is either less than `f` or greater than or equal to `f` depending on whether the if condition is true or false.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `arr` is an array of integers, `i` is `n-1`, `a` is a non-zero value, `b` is a value, and `array2` contains all elements `(arr[i+1] - arr[i]) * a` for each `i` where the difference between `arr[i+1]` and `arr[i]` is less than `b / a`. If the sum of elements in `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is less than `f`, then the condition holds. Otherwise, `array2` includes all elements `(arr[i+1] - arr[i]) * a` for each `i` where the difference between `arr[i+1]` and `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to `b / a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
