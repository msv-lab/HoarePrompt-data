Based on the initial state provided:

- `arr` is an array of integers.
- `i` is set to `n-1`, where `n` is the length of `arr`.
- `a` is a non-zero value.
- `b` is a value.
- `array2` contains all elements \((arr[i+1] - arr[i]) * a\) for each `i` where the difference between `arr[i+1]` and `arr[i]` is less than `b / a`.

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('Yes')
```

This statement does not depend on the values of any variables or objects; it directly prints the string `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
