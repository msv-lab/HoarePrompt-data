Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `arr` is a list of integers.
   - `i` is either 0 or 2.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `f` is `feat[1]`.
   - `a` is `feat[2]`.
   - `b` is `feat[-1]`.
   - `array2` is a list.

4. **Adjust the states based on the loop head variables**:
   - Since `i` can be either 0 or 2, after the loop increments `i` by 1, `i` will be 1 if it was 0, or 3 if it was 2. However, since the loop condition is `i < n`, and `n` is greater than 0, `i` will increment to 1 if it was 0, and the loop will stop if `i` becomes 3 because `3 >= n` (assuming `n` is 2).

5. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - If `i` was 0, after the loop, `i` will be 1.
   - If `i` was 2, after the loop, `i` will be 3, and the loop will stop.

Given these points, let's update the state:

- If `i` was 0, after the loop, `i` will be 1.
- If `i` was 2, after the loop, `i` will be 3, and the loop will stop.

Since `i` can only be 0 or 2 initially, and the loop will stop if `i` becomes 3, the only valid state to consider is when `i` is incremented to 1.

**State:**
- `arr` is a list of integers.
- `i` is 1.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `f` is `feat[1]`.
- `a` is `feat[2]`.
- `b` is `feat[-1]`.
- `array2` is a list.

So, the final state is:

State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `array2` is a list**.
