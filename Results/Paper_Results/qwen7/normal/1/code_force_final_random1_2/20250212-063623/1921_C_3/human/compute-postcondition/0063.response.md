Output State: **`feat` is a list of integers obtained from input().split(' '), `n` is equal to `feat[0]`, `i` is `feat[0] + (n - 1) + 1` to ensure it is less than `test_cases`, `f` is equal to `feat[1]`, `n` and `feat` remain the same, and `array2` remains the same as it is constructed inside the loop.**

Explanation: The code assigns the second element of the list `feat` to the variable `f`. All other variables and their relationships remain unchanged from the initial state.
