Postcondition: `i` is equal to `n`, `array2` contains the product of the differences between consecutive elements of `arr` that are less than `b/a` scaled by `a`, `n` is still greater than 1, and whether the sum of the elements in `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is less than `f` or greater than or equal to `f`, the final state of `i`, `array2`, and `n` remains consistent with the condition that `i` equals `n`, `array2` contains the specified product, and `n` is greater than 1.
