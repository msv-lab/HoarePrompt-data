Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is `feat[0] + 1`, `n` is `feat[0]`, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `array2` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list `array2`. No changes are made to the existing variables `arr`, `i`, `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`. Therefore, their values remain unchanged.
