Output State: **`arr` is an array of integers, `i` is an index within the bounds of `arr`, `a` is a non-zero value, `b` is a value such that the difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[i - 1]` is less than `b / a`, `array2` contains one element which is `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`.**

Explanation: The code appends a new element to `array2`. This new element is calculated as `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`. Since `arr[i]` and `arr[i - 1]` are elements of the array `arr`, and `a` is a non-zero value, the expression `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` is computed and added to `array2`. The conditions on `b` and the relationship between `arr[i]` and `arr[i - 1]` remain unchanged.
