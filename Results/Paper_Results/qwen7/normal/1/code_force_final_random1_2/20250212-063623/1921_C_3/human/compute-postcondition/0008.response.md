Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `n` is the first element of the list `feat`, `f` is the second element of the list `feat`, `a` is the third element of the list `feat`, `b` is the last element of the list `feat`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `array2` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `array2`. This does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, their states remain the same as in the initial state.
