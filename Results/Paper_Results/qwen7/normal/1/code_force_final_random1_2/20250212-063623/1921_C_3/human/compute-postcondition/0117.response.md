Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `array2` is a list, and `array2` now contains the element `arr[0] * a`.**

Explanation: The code appends the product of the first element of `arr` and the value of `feat[2]` (which is stored in `a`) to `array2`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
