Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `i` is 2 (if it was 1, otherwise 3), `n` must be greater than 1, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `array2` is a list with one element which is equal to `arr[0] * feat[2]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the product of the first element of `arr` and the third element of `feat` to `array2`. Since `arr` is a list of integers, `feat` is a list, and `arr[0]` is the first element of `arr` and `feat[2]` is the third element of `feat`, the new element added to `array2` is `arr[0] * feat[2]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
