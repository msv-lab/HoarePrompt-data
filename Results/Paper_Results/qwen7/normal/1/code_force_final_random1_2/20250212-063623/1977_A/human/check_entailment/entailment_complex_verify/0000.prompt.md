You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if n == m:
            print('Yes')
        elif m > n:
            print('No')
        elif m == n - 1:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, m = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        if n == m:
            print('Yes')
        elif m > n:
            print('No')
        elif m == n - 1:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: Output State: The variable `t` remains the same as its initial value, which is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive. After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be equal to `t - 1`, since the loop runs `t` times. The variables `n` and `m` retain their values from the last iteration of the loop. Specifically, `n` is the first integer input by the user, and `m` is the second integer input by the user during the last iteration. The output of the loop depends on the values of `n` and `m` during the last iteration:
    #
    #- If `n` equals `m`, the output is 'Yes'.
    #- If `m` is greater than `n`, the output is 'No'.
    #- If `m` equals `n - 1`, the output is 'Yes'.
    #- If both `m` and `n` are even, the output is 'Yes'.
    #- If both `m` and `n` are odd, the output is 'Yes'.
    #- Otherwise, the output is 'No'.
    #
    #In summary, after all iterations of the loop, `t` remains unchanged, `i` is `t - 1`, and the final output of the loop is determined by the values of `n` and `m` from the last iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two positive integers \( n \) and \( m \). For each test case, it checks specific conditions involving \( n \) and \( m \) and prints 'Yes' or 'No' based on these conditions. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints the results of the last test case. The variables \( t \), \( n \), and \( m \) retain their values from the last test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to consider the case where `m` is odd and `n` is even, or vice versa. According to the problem description, Nikita can only add or remove one cube per move, so the difference between `n` (total moves) and `m` (final number of cubes) must be even. However, the program does not check this condition properly.

For example, consider the test case `n = 4` and `m = 3`. Here, `n` is even and `m` is odd. The difference between `n` and `m` is 1, which is odd. Therefore, it is impossible to achieve `m` cubes after `n` moves. The program incorrectly prints "Yes" in this case because it does not check if the difference between `n` and `m` is even.
