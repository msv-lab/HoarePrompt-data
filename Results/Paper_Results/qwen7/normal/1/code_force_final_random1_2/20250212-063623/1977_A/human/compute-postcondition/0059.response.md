Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is defined as `k + 2`
- `t` is the same as before (though the value of `t` is not specified in the current context, it does not affect the print statement)
- `n` is the first integer from the input
- `m` is the second integer from the input

The print statement is:

```python
print('No')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'No'`.

Output: **No**
