Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `n` is the first integer input by the user, `m` is the second integer input by the user. If `n` equals `m`, the postcondition remains as the initial condition. If `n` does not equal `m`, then `m` is either greater than `n` and remains so, or `m` is not greater than `n`, and in this case, `m` is either equal to `n` (with at least one of them being even) or equal to `n - 1`.
