Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `t`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i < t`.
3. **Analyze the given postcondition**: The postcondition describes the relationship between `n` and `m` based on their initial values and whether they are equal or not. However, these variables (`n` and `m`) are not part of the loop head.
4. **Adjust the loop head variables**: At the start of each iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, if `i` is currently less than `t`, it will become `i + 1` in the next iteration.

Given the postcondition and the loop head, we need to update the state of `i` to reflect its value at the start of the next iteration. The value of `t` remains unchanged unless specified otherwise within the loop body, but since no such specification is provided, `t` stays the same.

Since the loop head variables are `i` and `t`, and `t` does not change, we only need to adjust `i`.

At the end of the previous iteration, let's assume `i` was some value `k` and `t` was some value `T`. For the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`.

Therefore, the updated state is:

State: **`t` is the same as before, `i` is `k + 1` where `k` was the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, and `t` is the same as before**.

To generalize, if `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`.

So, the final answer is:

State: **`t` is the same as before, `i` is `k + 1` where `k` was the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, and `t` is the same as before**.
