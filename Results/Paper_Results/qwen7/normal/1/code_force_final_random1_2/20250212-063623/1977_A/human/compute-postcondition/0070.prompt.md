Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, and no other variables are affected.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n, m = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    if n == m:
        print('Yes')
    elif m > n:
        print('No')
    elif m == n - 1:
        print('Yes')
    elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:
        print('Yes')
    elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `n` is the first integer input by the user, `m` is the second integer input by the user. If `n` equals `m`, then `n` and `m` remain equal. If `n` does not equal `m`, then `m` is either greater than `n` and remains so, or `m` is not greater than `n`, and `m` is either equal to `n` (with at least one of them being even) or equal to `n - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `i` is `k + 1` where `k` was the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, and `t` is the same as before.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is `k + 2`, `t` is the same as before, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input. If `n` equals `m`, no changes are made. If `m` is greater than `n`, no changes are made. If `m` equals `n - 1`, no changes are made. If `m` and `n` are both even, `i` is increased by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
