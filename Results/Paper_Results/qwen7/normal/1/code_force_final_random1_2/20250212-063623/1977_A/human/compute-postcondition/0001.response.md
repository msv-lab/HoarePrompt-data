Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `t`.
2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: The variable `i` starts from 0 in the `range(t)` function.
3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `t`.

Given that `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, and it is the result of `int(input())`, we need to ensure that `t` is within this range for the loop to execute.

4. **Adjust the State**: We need to ensure that `t` is within the valid range (1 to 100) for the loop to execute. Since `t` is the only variable that affects the loop execution, we need to adjust its state accordingly.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be:

**State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive**
