Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is an integer from the input.
- `m` is an integer from the input.
- `i` is `k + 1` where `k` was the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration.
- `t` is the same as before (though the value of `t` is not relevant to the print statement).

The print statement simply outputs the string `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
