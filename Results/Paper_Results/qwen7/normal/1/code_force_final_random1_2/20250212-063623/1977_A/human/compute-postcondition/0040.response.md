Output State: **`n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `i` is `k + 1` where `k` was the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, and `t` is the same as before.**

This means that the values of `n` and `m` are set to integers obtained from splitting the input string, while `i` is updated to be `k + 1` (where `k` was the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration), and `t` remains unchanged from its previous state.
