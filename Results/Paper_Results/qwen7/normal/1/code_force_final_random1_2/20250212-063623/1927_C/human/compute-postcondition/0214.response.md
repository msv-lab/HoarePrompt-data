Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes multiple test cases. Each test case includes integers n and m (both between 1 and 2⋅10^5), an even integer k (between 2 and 2⋅min(n, m)), and two arrays a and b (each containing n and m positive integers not exceeding 10^6 respectively). The function returns different outputs based on the conditions provided for each test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases internally, where each test case involves specific parameters and arrays, and the function processes these inputs according to given constraints and conditions without needing any external parameters.
