Output State: **`aOnes` is 1, `bOnes` is 0, `i` is in the list `a`, `i` is in the list `b`, `t` is incremented by 1, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `b` is a list of integers from the input, `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values of `int(input().split())`, `newk` is equal to `k // 2`, `k` must be at least 2, and the current value of `aOnes` is less than the current value of `bOnes`.**

Explanation: The variable `aOnes` was incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
