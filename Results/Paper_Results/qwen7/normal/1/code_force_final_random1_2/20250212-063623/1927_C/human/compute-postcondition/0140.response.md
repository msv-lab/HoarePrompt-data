Postcondition: **`aOnes` is the count of how many times an element from list `a` was found in the loop up to `newk`, `bOnes` is the count of how many times an element from list `b` was found in the loop up to `newk`, `i` is `k + 1`, `t` is incremented by the number of iterations, `a` and `b` are lists of integers from the input, `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values of `int(input().split())`, `bOnes` is set to 0, `newk` is equal to `k // 2`, and if both `aOnes` and `bOnes` are equal to `newk`, the function does nothing (as both conditions are met); otherwise, the function proceeds with the else part logic.**
