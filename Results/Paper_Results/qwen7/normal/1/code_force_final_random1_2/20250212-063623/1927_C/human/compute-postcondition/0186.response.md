Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `aOnes` and `bOnes` retain their current values unless `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, in which case `aOnes` is incremented by 1. If `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, `bOnes` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `i` remains 2, `a` and `b` are lists of integers from the input, `n`, `m`, and `k` must be greater than or equal to 2, `newk` is equal to `k // 2`, and `aOnes` and `bOnes` retain their current values, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**
