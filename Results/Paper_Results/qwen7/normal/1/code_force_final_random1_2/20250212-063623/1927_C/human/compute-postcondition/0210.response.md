Postcondition: `i` is `k + 1`, `aOnes` and `bOnes` retain their final values after the loop, `n`, `m`, and `k` retain their initial values after the loop, `newk` is equal to `k // 2`, and either both `aOnes` and `bOnes` are equal to `newk` (which is `k // 2`), or at least one of them is not equal to `newk`.
