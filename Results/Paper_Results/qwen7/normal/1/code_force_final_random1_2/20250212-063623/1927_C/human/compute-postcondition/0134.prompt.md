Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is either 0 or incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `i` in `b` up to `newk`, `i` is 1, `t` is incremented by 1, `a` is now a list of integers from the input, `b` is now a list of integers from the input, `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values of `int(input().split())`, `bOnes` is set to 0; `newk` is equal to `k // 2`.
Code of the loop:
while i <= k:
    if i in a and i in b:
        if aOnes < bOnes:
            aOnes += 1
        else:
            bOnes += 1
    elif i in a and aOnes <= newk:
        aOnes += 1
    elif i in b and bOnes <= newk:
        bOnes += 1
    else:
        break
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `aOnes` is either 1 or 0, `bOnes` is incremented by the number of occurrences of `i` in `b` up to `newk` (either 0 or incremented), `i` is 2, `t` is incremented by 1, `a` and `b` are lists of integers from the input, `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values of `int(input().split())`, `bOnes` is set to 0, `newk` is equal to `k // 2`, and `k` must be at least 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `aOnes` is either 2, 1, or 0, `bOnes` is incremented by the number of occurrences of `i` in `b` up to `newk` (either 0 or incremented), `i` is 3, `t` is incremented by 1, `a` and `b` are lists of integers from the input, `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values of `int(input().split())`, `bOnes` is set to 0, `newk` is equal to `k // 2`, and `k` must be at least 2.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `aOnes` is either 2, 1, or 0; `bOnes` is incremented by the number of occurrences of `i` in `b` up to `newk` (either 0 or incremented); `i` is 4; `t` is incremented by 1; `a` and `b` are lists of integers from the input; `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values of `int(input().split())`; `bOnes` is set to 0; `newk` is equal to `k // 2`; and `k` must be at least 3. If `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, then `bOnes` is incremented by the number of occurrences of `i` in `b` up to `newk`; otherwise, `bOnes` is incremented by 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
