Postcondition: **`aOnes` is either 0 or incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `i` in `a` up to `newk`, `bOnes` is either 0 or incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `i` in `b` up to `newk`, `i` is equal to `k + 1`, and the loop has executed all iterations where `i` is less than or equal to `k`. The current value of `aOnes` and `bOnes` is `newk`, indicating that `i` was found in both `a` and `b` up to `newk`.**
