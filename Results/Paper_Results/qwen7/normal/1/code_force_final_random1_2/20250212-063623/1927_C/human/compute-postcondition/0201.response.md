Postcondition: `i` is 3, `aOnes` and `bOnes` retain their current values, `n`, `m`, and `k` must be greater than or equal to 4, `newk` is equal to `k // 2`. If `i` is in both `a` and `b`, and `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, then `bOnes` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `aOnes` is increased by 1. If `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `bOnes` is increased by 1. If none of these conditions are met, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.
