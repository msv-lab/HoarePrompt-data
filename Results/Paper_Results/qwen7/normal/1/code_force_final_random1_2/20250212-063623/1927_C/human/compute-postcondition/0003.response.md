Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code `b = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer, storing the resulting list in `b`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial state.
