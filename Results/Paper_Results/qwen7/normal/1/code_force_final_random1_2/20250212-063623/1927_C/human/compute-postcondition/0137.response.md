Based on the initial state provided:

- `aOnes` is the count of how many times an element from list `a` was found in the loop up to `newk`.
- `bOnes` is the count of how many times an element from list `b` was found in the loop up to `newk`.
- `i` is `k + 1`.
- `t` is incremented by the number of iterations.
- `a` and `b` are lists of integers from the input.
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values of `int(input().split())`.
- `bOnes` is set to 0.
- `newk` is equal to `k // 2`.
- The condition `(aOnes == newk and bOnes == newk)` is true.

Given that the condition `(aOnes == newk and bOnes == newk)` is true, it means both `aOnes` and `bOnes` are equal to `newk`.

The print statement is simply `print('yes')`.

Output: **yes**
