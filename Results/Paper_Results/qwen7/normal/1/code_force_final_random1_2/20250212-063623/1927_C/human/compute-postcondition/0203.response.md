Output State: **`i` is 4, `aOnes` and `bOnes` retain their current values, `n`, `m`, and `k` must be greater than or equal to 4, `newk` is equal to `k // 2`.**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` was 3, so after executing this line, `i` becomes 4. None of the other variables (`aOnes`, `bOnes`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `newk`) are affected by this operation, so they retain their current values. The conditions specified in the postcondition remain unchanged as well.
