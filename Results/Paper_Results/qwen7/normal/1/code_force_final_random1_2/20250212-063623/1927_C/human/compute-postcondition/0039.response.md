Postcondition: `aOnes` and `bOnes` remain unchanged if `aOnes` is not less than `bOnes`. Otherwise, `aOnes` becomes 1 more than its initial value and `bOnes` remains 0. If the condition `aOnes < bOnes` is false, then `bOnes` becomes 1 and `aOnes` remains unchanged. In both cases, `i` must be less than or equal to `k`.
