Postcondition: `aOnes` is 1 if `i` is found in both `a` and `b` up to `newk` (inclusive), otherwise `aOnes` is 0. `bOnes` is incremented by the number of occurrences of `i` in `b` up to `newk`. `i` is 1, `t` is incremented by 1, `a` and `b` are lists of integers from the input, `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values of `int(input().split())`, `bOnes` is set to 0, `newk` is equal to `k // 2`, and `k` must be at least 1.
