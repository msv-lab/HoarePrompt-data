Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers \( n \) and \( m \), an even integer \( k \), and two arrays \( a \) and \( b \). For each test case, it counts the occurrences of integers from 1 to \( k/2 \) in arrays \( a \) and \( b \) under specific conditions. If the counts of these integers in both arrays are equal to \( k/2 \) after processing all test cases, it prints 'yes'; otherwise, it prints 'no'.**
