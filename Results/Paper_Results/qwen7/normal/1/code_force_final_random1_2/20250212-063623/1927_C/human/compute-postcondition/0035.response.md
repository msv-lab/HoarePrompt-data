Output State: **`aOnes` remains unchanged, `bOnes` remains 0, `i` is 2**.

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` is set to 1, so after executing the code, `i` becomes 2. No changes are made to `aOnes` or `bOnes`. All other variables remain in their initial or unchanged state.
