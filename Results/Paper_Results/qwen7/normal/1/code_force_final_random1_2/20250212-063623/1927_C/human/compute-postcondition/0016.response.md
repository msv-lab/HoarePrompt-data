Output State: **`aOnes` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `newk` is `k // 2`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `bOnes` is 1 (previously `bOnes` was 0, now it is incremented by 1), `i` is 1, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, and the current value of `i` is in both lists `a` and `b`, and `aOnes` is greater than or equal to `bOnes`.**

This means that `bOnes` has been incremented by 1, making its new value 1. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
