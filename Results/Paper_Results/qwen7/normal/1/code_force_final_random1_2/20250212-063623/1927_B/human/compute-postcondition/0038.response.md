Output State: **`j` is 2, `l` is the same as before, `ans` is a list containing two elements which are the alphabet characters at the indices (`rev_array[j] - 1`), `array` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `i` is less than the value provided by `int(input())`, `rev_array` is the reverse of `array`.**

Explanation:
- Initially, `ans` is a list containing one element which is the alphabet character at the index (`rev_array[j] - 1`). Since `j` is 2, `rev_array[j]` is `rev_array[2]`.
- The code appends to `ans` the alphabet character at the index (`rev_array[j] - 1`), which is the same as before because `j` remains 2.
- Therefore, `ans` now contains two elements: the original element plus the new element.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
