Output State: **`ans` now contains one additional element which is the character from `alp` list at the index equal to the count of `rev_array[j]` in the slice of `rev_array` starting from index `j` minus 1, `rev_array` remains unchanged, `j` is `j + 1`.**

Explanation:
- The code appends to `ans` the character from `alp` list at the index equal to the count of `rev_array[j]` in the slice of `rev_array` starting from index `j` minus 1.
- This means that `ans` gains one more element, which is determined by the specified index calculation.
- `rev_array` remains unchanged.
- `j` is incremented by 1.
