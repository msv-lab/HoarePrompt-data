Output State: **`l` is an input integer, `j` is equal to `l`, `ans` is a list containing characters from the `alp` list, where each character's index is determined by the count of `rev_array[j]` in the substring starting from `j` to the end of `rev_array` minus 1 for each iteration of `j` from 0 to `l-1`, and `array` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `i` must be less than the value provided by `int(input())`.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of space-separated integers and splits it into a list of integers, which is assigned to the variable `array`. The other variables (`l`, `j`, `ans`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
