Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer starting from 0 up to (but not including) the value of `l`, `array` is a list of integers created from the input split and converted to integers, `alp` is a list of characters from 'a' to 'z'**.

The code snippet does not modify any of the existing variables or introduce new ones. It only defines a list `alp` containing characters from 'a' to 'z'. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged except for the addition of the `alp` list.
