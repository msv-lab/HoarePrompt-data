Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer starting from 0 up to (but not including) the value of `l`, `array` is a list of integers created from the input split and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code `array = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, converts each integer to a string, and then maps them to integers, creating a list of integers. The variable `i` remains unchanged and still holds a non-negative integer starting from 0 up to (but not including) the value of `l`.
