To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `rev_array` is a list, but its contents are not specified.
   - `alp` is a list of characters, e.g., `['a', 'b', 'c', ...]`.
   - `ans` is a list where each element is a character from `alp` at an index calculated by counting occurrences of each element in `rev_array` starting from its current position and subtracting 1.
   - `j` is equal to `l`, but the value of `l` is not specified.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(''.join(map(str, ans)))
   ```

Given the initial state, let's analyze the construction of `ans`:
- For each element in `rev_array`, we count how many times it appears in `rev_array` starting from its current position and subtract 1 to get the index in `alp`.
- The `map(str, ans)` part converts each character in `ans` to a string (though this is unnecessary since characters are already strings).
- `''.join(map(str, ans))` joins all the characters in `ans` into a single string without any separators.

Since the exact contents of `rev_array` and `alp` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact characters in `ans`. However, we know that `ans` is constructed based on the occurrences of elements in `rev_array` within `alp`.

Therefore, the output will be a string composed of characters from `alp` based on the described process.

Output: **a string composed of characters from `alp` based on the occurrences of elements in `rev_array` within `alp`**
