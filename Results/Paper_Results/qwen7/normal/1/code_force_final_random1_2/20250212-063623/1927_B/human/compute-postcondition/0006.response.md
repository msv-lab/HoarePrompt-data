Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head defines the variables `j` and `l`.
2. **Determine the Initial State of `j` and `l`**: 
   - `j` is the loop variable that will iterate from 0 to `l-1`.
   - `l` is the upper limit of the loop, which is the length of the `array` or `rev_array`.

3. **Check the Conditions for Loop Execution**: 
   - For the loop to execute, `j` must be less than `l`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `j` starts at 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, the initial value of `j` is 0.
   - The value of `l` should be the length of either `array` or `rev_array`, as both are lists of the same length.

5. **State the Adjusted States**:
   - `ans` is an empty list and does not affect the loop execution.
   - `i` is a non-negative integer starting from 0 up to (but not including) the value of `l`, but since it is not part of the loop head, it does not need adjustment.
   - `array` and `alp` are not directly involved in the loop condition.
   - `rev_array` is a reversed version of `array`, and its length is the same as `array`.

Therefore, the only states that need to be adjusted are `j` and `l`.

**State:**
**`j` is 0, `l` is the length of array (or rev_array)**
