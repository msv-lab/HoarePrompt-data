Output State: **`l` is an input integer, `ans` is an empty list, `rev_array` is the reverse of `array`, `i` is `i + 1`, and `j` is equal to `l`.**

Explanation: The line `ans = []` initializes `ans` as an empty list. This operation does not affect the values of `l`, `rev_array`, `i`, or `j`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
