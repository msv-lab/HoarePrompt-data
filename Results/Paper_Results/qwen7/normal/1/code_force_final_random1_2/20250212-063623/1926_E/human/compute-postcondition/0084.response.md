Output State: **`a` is 1, `L` is [1, 1, 1], `pow` is 2, `tot` is 3, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `k`. The values of `a`, `L`, `pow`, and `tot` remain unchanged from their initial states. Since the input values for `n` and `k` are not specified, they are represented as "an input integer".
