Output State: `a` is 2, `L` is [], `pow` is 16, `tot` is 12.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, the list `L` becomes empty as the loop continues to process until `n` reaches 0. The variable `a` takes on the value of the last element added to `L`, which is 2. The variable `pow` is doubled in each iteration of the loop, starting from 8 after 3 iterations, and doubles again for each additional iteration until the loop completes. Since the loop processes until `L` is empty and `n` is 0, `pow` doubles for each of the 3 elements in `L`, resulting in `pow` being 16 (2^4). The variable `tot` is the sum of all elements in `L`, which is 2 + 2 + 2 = 6, and it continues to be incremented by `a` (which is 2) for each full iteration of `L` being processed, resulting in `tot` being 12 (6 + 6).
