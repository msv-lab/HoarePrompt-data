Output State: **`n` is 0, `k` is an integer equal to the second input value, `L` is a list containing [1, 1, 1], `pow` is 1, `tot` is 0**

The code initializes the variable `pow` to 1. Since `n`, `k`, `L`, and `tot` are not affected by this line of code, their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
