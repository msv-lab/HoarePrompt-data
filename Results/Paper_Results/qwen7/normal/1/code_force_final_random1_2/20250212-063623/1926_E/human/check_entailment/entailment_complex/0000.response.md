Reasoning:
- The annotated program correctly describes the logic of the function. The function processes each test case by first constructing a list `L` where each element represents the count of numbers of the form \( i \times \text{odd} \) that can be placed in the current step. This is done by repeatedly halving \( n \) and subtracting the result from \( n \).
- The function then iterates over the list `L` and determines the position of \( k \) within the cumulative sum of elements in `L`. Based on this position, it calculates and prints the corresponding card number.
- The explanation provided matches the steps of the algorithm accurately. The values of `pow`, `tot`, and `L` are consistent with the described process.
- The overall structure and logic of the function align with the problem description and the expected behavior.

Correctness: **True**
