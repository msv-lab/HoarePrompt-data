Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for a in L:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `a` and `L`.

2. **Understand the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `tot` is now `tot + a`.
   - `k` is unchanged.
   - `a` is the next integer in the list `L`.
   - `pow` is multiplied by 2.

3. **Determine what needs to be adjusted**:
   - `a` is the next integer in the list `L`, meaning it will be incremented or moved to the next element in the list for the next iteration.
   - `L` remains the same list but with `a` being the next element.
   - `k` is unchanged, so no adjustment is needed for `k`.
   - `pow` is multiplied by 2, so no adjustment is needed for `pow`.

4. **Formulate the new state**:
   - Since `a` is the next integer in the list `L`, it means `a` will be the next element in the list for the next iteration.
   - `L` remains the same list.
   - `k` remains unchanged.
   - `pow` is multiplied by 2, so it will be `pow * 2` for the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`tot` is now `tot + a`, `k` is unchanged, `a` is the next integer in the list `L`, `pow` is multiplied by 2**.

However, since we need to specify the exact values for `a` and `pow` for the next iteration, we can rephrase it as:

State: **`tot` is now `tot + a`, `k` is unchanged, `a` is the next integer in the list `L`, `pow` is `pow * 2`**.

Given the format required, the final answer is:

State: **`tot` is now `tot + a`, `k` is unchanged, `a` is the next integer in the list `L`, `pow` is `pow * 2`**.
