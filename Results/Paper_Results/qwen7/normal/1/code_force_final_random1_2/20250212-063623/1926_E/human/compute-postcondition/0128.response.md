Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each containing integers \( t \), \( n \), and \( k \). For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on the given \( n \) and \( k \). Specifically, it constructs a sequence \( L \) by repeatedly dividing \( n \) by 2 and subtracting the result from \( n \). It then iterates over this sequence, determining a value to print based on the position of \( k \) within the cumulative sum of elements in \( L \). The function does not return any value but prints the calculated value for each test case.**
