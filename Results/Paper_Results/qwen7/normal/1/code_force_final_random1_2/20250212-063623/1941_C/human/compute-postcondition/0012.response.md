Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is `int(input())`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `int(input())` is a positive integer. This means that the loop will execute once for each positive integer entered by the user.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `a` is a positive integer.
   - `s` is an input string.
   - `x` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in `s`.
   - `y` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`.

4. **Determine the state needed for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, the user must enter another positive integer. Therefore, the state needs to reflect that the loop will run again if the user inputs a positive integer.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**: Since the loop head involves `int(input())`, the state should indicate that the user has just entered a positive integer, and the loop can proceed to the next iteration.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

**State: **`a` is a positive integer, `s` is an input string, `x` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in `s`, `y` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`, and the user has just entered a positive integer**.
