Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string from the user, `x` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in the new string `s`, `y` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in the original string `s`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `x` to be the number of times the substring 'map' appears in the current value of `s`. The other variables (`a`, `s` with its new value, `y`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
