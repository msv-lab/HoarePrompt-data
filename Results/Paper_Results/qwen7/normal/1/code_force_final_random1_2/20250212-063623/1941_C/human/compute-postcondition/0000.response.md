Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is the placeholder `_`, which is used as a dummy variable to iterate over the range returned by `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `int(input())` returns a positive integer. Since `t` is given as a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the input will always be valid and the loop will execute.

3. **Adjust the State**: We need to ensure that the state of the variable `t` is correctly represented before the loop starts. Given that `t` is a positive integer within the specified range, we need to reflect this in our state.

Given the above analysis, the state before the loop starts should include the value of `t` as a positive integer within the specified range.

**State:**
**`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**
