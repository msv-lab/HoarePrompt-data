Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The issue lies in how the counts of 'map' and 'pie' are accumulated. The program counts the occurrences of 'map' and 'pie' across all strings rather than for each individual string. This means that for each test case, the counts `x` and `y` represent the total occurrences of 'map' and 'pie' across all previous test cases, which is not what is required. The program should count the occurrences of 'map' and 'pie' only within the current string `s` for each test case and then compute the minimum deletions needed to make the string beautiful.

Correctness: **False**
