Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" in the string `s` for each test case and prints the sum of these counts. However, the goal is to find the minimum number of characters that need to be removed to make the string beautiful, not to count the occurrences of the substrings.

The program should instead iterate through the string and remove characters dynamically to eliminate both "map" and "pie" substrings, keeping track of the minimum deletions required. The current implementation does not achieve this; it simply counts the occurrences without making any changes to the string.

Correctness: **False**
