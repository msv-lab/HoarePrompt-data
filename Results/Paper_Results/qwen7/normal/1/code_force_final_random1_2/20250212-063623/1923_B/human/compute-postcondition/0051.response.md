Output State: **`rest` is reduced by `delta`, `delta` is the minimum value between `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`.**

This means that the value of `rest` has been decreased by the value of `delta`, which was initially defined as the minimum value between `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
