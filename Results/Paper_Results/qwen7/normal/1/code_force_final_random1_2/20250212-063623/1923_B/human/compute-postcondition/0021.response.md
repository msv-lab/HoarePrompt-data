Output State: **`rest` is equal to `k` minus `min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`, `pos` is either unchanged or increased by 1, `delta` is equal to `min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`, and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is equal to `0`.**

Explanation: The value of `delta` is assigned the minimum value between `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`. Since `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is equal to `0`, `delta` will be `0` if `rest` is greater than `0`, otherwise, `delta` will be equal to `rest`. The value of `rest` will be updated to `rest - delta`. The value of `pos` remains unchanged or increases by 1, and the value of `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` remains `0`.
