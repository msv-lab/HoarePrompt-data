You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are playing a computer game. The current level of this game can be modeled
as a straight line. Your character is in point 0 of this line. There are n
monsters trying to kill your character; the i -th monster has health equal to
a_i and is initially in the point x_i .

Every second, the following happens:

  * first, you fire up to k bullets at monsters. Each bullet targets exactly one monster and decreases its health by 1 . For each bullet, you choose its target arbitrary (for example, you can fire all bullets at one monster, fire all bullets at different monsters, or choose any other combination). Any monster can be targeted by a bullet, regardless of its position and any other factors; 
  * then, all alive monsters with health 0 or less die; 
  * then, all alive monsters move 1 point closer to you (monsters to the left of you increase their coordinates by 1 , monsters to the right of you decrease their coordinates by 1 ). If any monster reaches your character (moves to the point 0 ), you lose. 

Can you survive and kill all n monsters without letting any of them reach your
character?

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 3 \cdot 10^4 )
— the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines:

  * the first line contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ; 1 \le k \le 2 \cdot 10^9 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains n integers x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n (-n \le x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < \dots < x_n \le n ; x_i \ne 0 ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if you can kill all n monsters before they reach
your character, or NO otherwise.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Output

Note

In the first example, you can act as follows:

  * during the 1 -st second, fire 1 bullet at the 1 -st monster and 1 bullet at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 1 -st monster dies, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd monster move closer; 
  * during the 2 -nd second, fire 2 bullets at the 2 -nd monster. Then the 2 -nd monster dies, the 3 -rd monster moves closer; 
  * during the 3 -rd second, fire 2 bullets at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 3 -rd monster dies. 

In the second example, you can fire only 1 bullet, so you can kill only one of
the two monsters during the 1 -st second. Then, the remaining monster moves
closer and kills your character.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of non-negative integers representing the health of the monsters, x is a list of integers representing the initial positions of the monsters, and k is a non-negative integer representing the number of bullets that can be fired per second. The length of a and x is n, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^9. The values in x are sorted in strictly increasing order and are non-zero, and -n ≤ x[i] < x[i+1] ≤ n for all i.

    pos = 0

    #State: Output State: All elements in the list `a` that correspond to indices in `sorted_indices` have been set to 0, `distance` is equal to the length of `sorted_indices`, `rest` is 0, and `pos` is equal to `len(sorted_indices)`.
    #
    #Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, every element in the list `a` that corresponds to indices in `sorted_indices` has been reduced to 0. This means all monsters' health has been depleted. The variable `distance` keeps track of how many times the loop has executed, which is equivalent to the length of `sorted_indices`. The variable `rest` is depleted to 0, indicating that all available bullets have been used up. Finally, `pos` is equal to `len(sorted_indices)`, meaning that all indices in `sorted_indices` have been processed.
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters: a list of non-negative integers `a` representing the health of the monsters, a list of integers `x` representing the initial positions of the monsters, and a non-negative integer `k` representing the number of bullets that can be fired per second. It returns `True` if it can defeat all monsters given the conditions, otherwise it returns `False`. The function processes the monsters based on their positions, firing bullets to reduce their health until all monsters' health is depleted. If all monsters' health can be reduced to zero using the given number of bullets, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^9. a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. x is a list of n integers where each integer x_i satisfies -n ≤ x_i < x_{i+1} ≤ n and x_i ≠ 0.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        print('YES' if func_1(a, x, k) else 'NO')
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `t` will be 0, indicating that there are no more inputs left to process. For each iteration, `n` will be the first integer from the input split by space, `k` will be the second integer from the input split by space, `a` will be a list of integers obtained from the input string, and `x` will be a list of integers obtained from another input string using map and split functions. The variable `t` will decrement by 1 after each iteration until it reaches 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads values for \( t \), \( n \), \( k \), list \( a \), and list \( x \). It then calls `func_1(a, x, k)` to determine if a certain condition is met. If the condition is met, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function ends with the variable `t` set to 0, indicating that all inputs have been processed.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if we can kill all monsters before any of them reach the player at position 0.
   - We have `n` monsters with health `a_i` and initial positions `x_i`.
   - We can fire up to `k` bullets per second, each reducing a monster's health by 1.
   - Monsters move towards the player after each second, and if any monster reaches the player, the player loses.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function takes lists `a`, `x`, and an integer `k`.
   - It sorts the indices of the monsters based on their distance from the player.
   - It iterates through the sorted list, firing bullets to reduce the monsters' health.
   - If a monster's health is reduced to zero, it is removed from further consideration.
   - The function returns `True` if all monsters can be killed before any reach the player, otherwise `False`.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function reads the input for multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1` and prints the result.

### Detailed Analysis of `func_1`

- **Sorting Based on Distance:**
  - The function sorts the monsters based on their distance from the player (`abs(x[i])`).
  - This ensures that we prioritize killing monsters that are closer to the player first.

- **Firing Bullets:**
  - The function uses a while loop to fire bullets until either all monsters are dead or all bullets are used.
  - It uses another inner while loop to fire bullets at the closest monster until its health is reduced to zero or no more bullets are available.

- **Checking if Player is Reached:**
  - The function checks if any monster's position equals the current distance (`abs(x[sorted_indices[pos]]) == distance`).
  - If a monster reaches the player, the function immediately returns `False`.

### Correctness Check

1. **Sorting Logic:**
   - Sorting based on distance ensures that we handle the closest threats first, which is a reasonable approach.

2. **Bullet Firing Logic:**
   - The logic for firing bullets is correct. It reduces the health of the closest monster until it is dead or no more bullets are available.

3. **Checking Player Reach:**
   - The check for whether a monster reaches the player is done correctly using the distance variable.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles edge cases where a monster might be killed just as it reaches the player.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the code, it appears that the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to determine if the player can survive and kill all monsters. The function `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and prints the results.
