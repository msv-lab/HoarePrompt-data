Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head is `while rest != 0 and pos != len(sorted_indices):`. This means the loop can continue as long as `rest` is not equal to 0 and `pos` is not equal to the length of `sorted_indices`.

2. **Analyze the Given States**:
   - `rest` is equal to `k` minus `2*delta`.
   - `pos` is either unchanged or increased by 1.
   - `delta` is equal to `0`.
   - `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is equal to `0`.

3. **Determine Necessary Adjustments**:
   - Since `delta` is equal to `0`, the expression `rest = k - 2*delta` simplifies to `rest = k`.
   - For the loop to continue, both conditions `rest != 0` and `pos != len(sorted_indices)` must be true.

4. **Check Each Condition**:
   - **Condition 1: `rest != 0`**
     - At the end of the previous iteration, `rest` is equal to `k`. To ensure the loop continues, `k` must be non-zero.
   - **Condition 2: `pos != len(sorted_indices)`**
     - At the end of the previous iteration, `pos` is either unchanged or increased by 1. Therefore, `pos` must be less than the length of `sorted_indices`.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - To ensure the loop executes one more time, `k` must be non-zero and `pos` must be less than the length of `sorted_indices`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `k` must be non-zero and `pos` must be less than the length of `sorted_indices`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`rest` is equal to `k` (which must be non-zero), `pos` is either unchanged or increased by 1, `delta` is equal to `0`, and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is equal to `0`, and `pos` must be less than the length of `sorted_indices`**.
