Output State: **`rest` is equal to `rest - delta`, `delta` is equal to `min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is reduced by `delta`, `pos` is less than `len(sorted_indices)`**.

Explanation: The code `a[sorted_indices[pos]] -= delta` reduces the value of `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` by `delta`. The value of `delta` is previously defined as `min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`, and `rest` is updated to `rest - delta`. The conditions involving `pos` and `sorted_indices` remain unchanged.
