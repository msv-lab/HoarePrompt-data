Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the input split by space, `k` is the second integer from the input split by space, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input string, `x` is a list of integers obtained from another input string using map and split functions, `a` is updated to be a list of integers obtained from input().split()**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes user input, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `x` remain unchanged.
