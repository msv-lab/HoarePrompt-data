Output State: **`rest` is equal to `rest - delta - delta`, `pos` is less than `len(sorted_indices) - 3`, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is equal to `a[sorted_indices[pos]] - delta`, `delta` is equal to `min(rest - delta - delta, a[sorted_indices[pos]] - delta)**

Explanation: The code subtracts `delta` from `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`. Before the subtraction, `rest` was equal to `rest - delta`, and `delta` was equal to `min(rest - delta, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`. After subtracting `delta` from `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`, `rest` becomes `rest - delta - delta`, and `delta` is recalculated as `min(rest - delta - delta, a[sorted_indices[pos]] - delta)`. The condition `pos < len(sorted_indices) - 3` remains unchanged.
