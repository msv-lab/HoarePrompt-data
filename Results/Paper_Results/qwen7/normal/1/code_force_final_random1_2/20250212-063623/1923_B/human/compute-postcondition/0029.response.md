Output State: **`rest` is equal to `rest - delta`, `delta` is equal to `min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`, `pos` is either unchanged or increased by 1, and `pos` is not equal to the length of `sorted_indices`.**

Explanation: The code `rest -= delta` subtracts the value of `delta` from `rest`. The value of `delta` is `min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`, which means `rest` is decreased by the minimum value between `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`. The value of `pos` remains unchanged or increases by 1, and it is not equal to the length of `sorted_indices`.
