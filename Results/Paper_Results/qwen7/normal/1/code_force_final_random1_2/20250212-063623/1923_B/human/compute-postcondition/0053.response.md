Output State: **`rest` is reduced by `delta`, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is decreased by `delta`, `delta` is the minimum value between `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` before the operation, `pos` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The line `pos += 1` increments the value of `pos` by 1. No other variables are affected by this operation. The values of `rest`, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`, and `delta` remain unchanged from their previous values, which are defined as part of the initial state.
