Output State: **`rest` is equal to `rest - delta`, `delta` remains unchanged**.

Explanation: The code `rest -= delta` subtracts the value of `delta` from `rest`. The value of `delta` is equal to `min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`. After executing the code, `rest` is updated to `rest - delta`, while `delta` remains the same as its original value.
