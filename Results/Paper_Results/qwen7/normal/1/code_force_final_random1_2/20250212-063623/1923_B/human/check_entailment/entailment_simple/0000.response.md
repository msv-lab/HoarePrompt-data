### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `a` (health of monsters), `x` (positions of monsters), and `k` (number of bullets).
   - It sorts the indices of the monsters based on their distances from the origin (`abs(x[i])`).
   - It iteratively fires bullets to reduce the health of the monsters. If a monster's health reaches zero, it is removed from further consideration.
   - The function returns `True` if all monsters can be defeated before any of them reach the player's position (point 0).

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_2` processes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`, followed by the lists `a` and `x`.
   - It calls `func_1` with these values and prints 'YES' if `func_1` returns `True`, otherwise it prints 'NO'.
   - The function correctly handles the input and output format as specified in the problem statement.

3. **Overall Program Flow:**
   - The main function `__name__ == '__main__':` calls `func_2()`, which processes all test cases.
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases, processes each test case, and prints the appropriate result.

Given the detailed analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if the player can survive and kill all monsters without letting any of them reach the player's position.

### Correctness:
**True**
