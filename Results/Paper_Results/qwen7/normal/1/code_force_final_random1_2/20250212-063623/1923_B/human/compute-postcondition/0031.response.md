Output State: **`rest` is equal to `rest - 2*delta`, `delta` is equal to `min(rest - delta, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`, `pos` is increased by 1 (so pos = pos + 1), and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is decreased by `delta`.**

Explanation: The code `pos += 1` increments the value of `pos` by 1. The values of `rest`, `delta`, and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` remain as they were before the increment, but `pos` is now one more than its previous value.
