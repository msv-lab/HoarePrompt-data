Output State: **`rest` is equal to `rest - delta`, `pos` is less than `len(sorted_indices) - 3`, `delta` is equal to `min(rest - delta, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`**

Explanation: The value of `rest` is decreased by `delta`. Since `delta` is initially defined as `min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`, after the subtraction, `delta` is recalculated as `min(rest - delta, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`. The conditions on `pos` and its relation to `len(sorted_indices)` remain unchanged.
