Postcondition: `rest` is reduced to 0, `pos` is less than `len(sorted_indices)`, all elements in the `a` array that correspond to indices in `sorted_indices` have been set to 0, and `distance` is increased by 1. If the absolute value of `x[sorted_indices[pos]]` equals `distance`, the function returns False. Otherwise, the function continues with the same conditions.
