Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to variables `n` and `k`. The initial state of `t` being greater than 0 is unaffected by this operation. Therefore, `t` remains greater than 0, while `n` and `k` are assigned the values of the first and second integers entered by the user, respectively.
