Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not handle the scenario where multiple monsters can be killed in a single second effectively. Here's a counterexample to illustrate the issue:

Consider the following input:
```
3 3
2 1 1
-1 1 2
```

According to the problem description:
- In the first second, you can fire up to 3 bullets.
- The monsters are initially at positions -1, 1, and 2 with health 2, 1, and 1 respectively.

A correct strategy would be:
1. Fire 2 bullets at the monster at position -1 (health 2), reducing its health to 0. This monster dies.
2. Fire 1 bullet at the monster at position 1 (health 1), reducing its health to 0. This monster also dies.

However, the provided `func_1` function does not handle this correctly. It sorts the monsters by their distance from the player and then tries to kill them one by one, but it does not account for the fact that you can kill multiple monsters in a single second if they are within range. As a result, the function might fail to kill all monsters in time, leading to an incorrect outcome.

To fix this, the function needs to consider all possible combinations of bullets fired in a single second to maximize the number of monsters killed. The current implementation only considers firing bullets one by one, which is insufficient for the problem requirements.
