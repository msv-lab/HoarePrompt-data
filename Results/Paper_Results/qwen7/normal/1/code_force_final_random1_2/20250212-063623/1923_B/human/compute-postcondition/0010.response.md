Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 1.
- `n` is the first integer input.
- `k` is the second integer input.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input string.
- `x` is updated to be a list of integers obtained from another input string using `map` and `split` functions.

The `print` statement is `print('YES' if func_1(a, x, k) else 'NO')`.

To determine the output, we need to know the behavior of `func_1(a, x, k)`. Since the function `func_1` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact behavior. Therefore, we cannot definitively say whether `func_1(a, x, k)` will return `True` or `False`.

However, we can describe the output based on the structure of the `print` statement:

- If `func_1(a, x, k)` returns `True`, the output will be `'YES'`.
- If `func_1(a, x, k)` returns `False`, the output will be `'NO'`.

Given this, the precise output cannot be determined without knowing the implementation of `func_1`. 

Output: **'YES' if func_1(a, x, k) returns True else 'NO'**
