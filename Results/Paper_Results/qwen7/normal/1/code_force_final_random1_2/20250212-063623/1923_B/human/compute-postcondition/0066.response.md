The loop condition is `pos != len(sorted_indices)`. For the loop to execute one more time, `pos` must be less than `len(sorted_indices)`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
- `rest` is reduced to 0
- `pos` is equal to `len(sorted_indices)`
- All elements in the `a` array that correspond to indices in `sorted_indices` have been set to 0
- `distance` is increased by 1

To satisfy the loop condition `pos != len(sorted_indices)`, `pos` needs to be adjusted to be less than `len(sorted_indices)`.

Therefore, the state needs to be modified such that `pos` is less than `len(sorted_indices)`.

State: **`rest` is reduced to 0, `pos` is less than `len(sorted_indices)`, all elements in the `a` array that correspond to indices in `sorted_indices` have been set to 0, and `distance` is increased by 1**
