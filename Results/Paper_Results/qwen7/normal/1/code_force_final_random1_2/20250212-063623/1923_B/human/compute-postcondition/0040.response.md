Output State: **`rest` is `k`, `pos` must be less than `len(sorted_indices)`, and the function returns False if the absolute value of `x[sorted_indices[pos]]` equals `distance`. If the condition is not met, the function returns False as well.**

Explanation: The variable `rest` is assigned the value of `k`. The conditions related to `pos`, `sorted_indices`, `x`, and `distance` remain unchanged from the initial state. Therefore, the output state retains the same conditions as the initial state, with the addition that `rest` is now explicitly set to `k`.
