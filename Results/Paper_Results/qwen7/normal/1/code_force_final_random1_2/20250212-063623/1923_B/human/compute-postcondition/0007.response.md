Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input string, `x` is a list of integers obtained from another input string.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. It does not affect the values of `t`, `a`, and `x`. Therefore, `t` remains greater than 1, `a` and `x` remain as lists of integers obtained from their respective inputs, and `n` and `k` are updated to the values of the input integers.
