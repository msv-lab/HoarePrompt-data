Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `pos` is not equal to `len(sorted_indices)`.

2. **Current State**: 
   - The loop has already executed until `pos` is equal to `len(sorted_indices)`.
   - Therefore, the condition `pos != len(sorted_indices)` is no longer true, and the loop has terminated.

3. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since the loop has terminated, the only way to make the loop execute one more time is to change the condition such that `pos` is not equal to `len(sorted_indices)`.
   - This means we need to adjust `pos` to be less than `len(sorted_indices)`.

4. **Other States**:
   - `rest` and `distance` are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.
   - `delta` is determined within the loop and does not affect the loop condition.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `pos`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`pos` must be less than `len(sorted_indices)`**
