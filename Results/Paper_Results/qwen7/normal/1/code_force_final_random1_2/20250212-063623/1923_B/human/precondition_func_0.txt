a is a list of non-negative integers representing the health of the monsters, x is a list of integers representing the initial positions of the monsters, and k is a non-negative integer representing the number of bullets that can be fired per second. The length of a and x is n, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^9. The values in x are sorted in strictly increasing order and are non-zero, and -n ≤ x[i] < x[i+1] ≤ n for all i.
