Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t):`. The variables involved here are `_` (a dummy variable) and `t`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**: We know that `t` is an input integer and the value of `t` is between 1 and \(3 \cdot 10^4\).

3. **Check the condition for loop execution**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is an input integer and the minimum value it can take is 1, we need to ensure that `t` is indeed greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the state accordingly**: The only variable that needs adjustment is `t`, and it must be greater than 0.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`t` must be greater than 0**.
