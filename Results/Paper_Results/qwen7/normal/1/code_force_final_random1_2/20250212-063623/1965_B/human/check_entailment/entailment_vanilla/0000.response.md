Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Function Definitions**:
   - The program defines various utility functions (`func_1` to `func_14`), but these functions are not used in the main logic.
   - Only `func_14` and `func_15` are relevant to solving the problem.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - `func_14` is the core function that generates the sequence.
   - `func_15` reads the number of test cases and calls `func_14` for each test case.

3. **Function `func_14`**:
   - It takes two integers `n` and `k`.
   - It converts `n` and `k` to binary representations.
   - If `k == 1`, it handles a special case where `n` is 2.
   - Otherwise, it constructs a sequence `ans` based on the binary representation of `n` and `k`.

4. **Sequence Construction**:
   - For `k == 1`:
     - If `n == 2`, it returns "1\n2".
     - Otherwise, it initializes `ans` with `[2, 3]` and appends powers of 2 up to `l-1`.
   - For `k > 1`:
     - It initializes `ans` with powers of 2 up to `lk-1`.
     - It calculates the remaining value needed to ensure no subsequence sums to `k` and adds it to `ans`.
     - It ensures that subsequences can sum to all values from 1 to `n` except `k`.

5. **Binary Representation**:
   - The binary representation helps in constructing the sequence such that no subsequence sums to `k` and all other values can be formed.

6. **Output**:
   - The sequence is printed as a space-separated string.

### Verification:

- **Special Case Handling**:
  - For `n == 2` and `k == 1`, the sequence `[1]` works correctly since no subsequence sums to 1.

- **General Case**:
  - The sequence construction ensures that:
    - No subsequence sums to `k`.
    - All other values from 1 to `n` can be formed as subsequences.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program appears to meet the requirements.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the logic to generate a sequence that meets the specified conditions.

**Correctness: True**
