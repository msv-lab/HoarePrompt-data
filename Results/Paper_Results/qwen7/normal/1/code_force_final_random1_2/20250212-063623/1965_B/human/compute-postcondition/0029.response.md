Output State: `ans` contains the elements `[2, 2, 4, 8, 16, ...]` until the sum of all elements equals \(2^{lk} - 2\), where `lk` is the length of the binary representation of `k`.

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = lk - 1`. In each iteration, it appends `2 ** i` to the list `ans`. This means the loop will append powers of 2 starting from \(2^0\) up to \(2^{lk-1}\). The sum of these elements will be \(2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 + \ldots + 2^{lk-1} = 2^{lk} - 1\). However, since the loop stops just before `i` reaches `lk`, the last element `2^{lk-1}` is not included, making the sum \(2^{lk} - 2\).
