Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `lk - 1`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is the loop variable, which starts from 0.
   - `lk` is the length of the binary representation of `k` (without the '0b' prefix), and `lk - 1` is the upper bound of the loop.

3. **Check the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `lk - 1` must be greater than or equal to 0. If `lk - 1` is less than 0, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0, no adjustment is needed for `i`.
   - We need to ensure that `lk - 1` is greater than or equal to 0. This means `lk` must be at least 1.

5. **Final state**:
   - `b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix.
   - `k` is the second return value of `func_7()`.
   - `bk` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix.
   - `l` is the length of `b`.
   - `lk` is the length of `bk`.
   - `ans` is an empty list.

Given the above analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is `lk` must be at least 1.

**State:**
**`b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `k` is the second return value of `func_7()`, `bk` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of `b`, `lk` is the length of `bk` and must be at least 1, and `ans` is an empty list.**
