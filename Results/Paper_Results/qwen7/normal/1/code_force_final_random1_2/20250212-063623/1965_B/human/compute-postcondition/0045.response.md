Functionality: **The function takes no explicit parameters and returns a string. If the value of `k` is 1 and `n` is 2, it returns the string '1\n2'. Otherwise, it calculates a list of numbers based on the binary representations of `n` and `k`, and returns a string of these numbers separated by spaces. The list can either be [4, 8, 16, 32] or a sequence of powers of 2 along with specific calculations involving `k`.**
