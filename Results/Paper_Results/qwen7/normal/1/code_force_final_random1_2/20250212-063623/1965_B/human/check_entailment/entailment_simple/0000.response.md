Reasoning:

1. **Function Analysis**:
   - Functions like `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`, `func_6`, `func_7`, `func_8`, `func_9`, `func_10`, `func_11`, `func_12`, `func_13` are not directly relevant to solving the problem. They either read input or perform operations that do not contribute to generating the required sequence `a`.
   
2. **Relevant Function**:
   - `func_14` is the function that actually generates the sequence `a` for each test case. It correctly handles the logic for constructing the sequence based on the given `n` and `k`:
     - If `k == 1`, it generates a sequence `[2, 3, 4, ..., 2^l]` where `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n`.
     - If `k > 1`, it generates a sequence that includes `k-1`, `k+1`, and `2*k+1`, along with powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `n`.

3. **Problem Requirements**:
   - The sequence `a` must satisfy two conditions:
     1. No subsequence of `a` sums to `k`.
     2. For all `v` from `1` to `n` where `v â‰  k`, there must be a subsequence of `a` that sums to `v`.

4. **Verification**:
   - The logic in `func_14` ensures that the generated sequence meets both conditions:
     - By including `k-1`, `k+1`, and `2*k+1`, it ensures that sequences summing to `k` cannot be formed.
     - By including powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `n`, it ensures that all sums from `1` to `n` (excluding `k`) can be formed.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The function `func_14` correctly implements the logic to generate the required sequence `a` for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
