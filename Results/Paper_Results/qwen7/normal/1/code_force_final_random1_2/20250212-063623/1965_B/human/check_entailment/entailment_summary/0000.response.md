Reasoning:
- The problem requires generating a sequence \(a\) of non-negative integers of size at most 25 such that:
  1. No subsequence of \(a\) has a sum equal to \(k\).
  2. For all \(1 \le v \le n\) where \(v \ne k\), there is a subsequence of \(a\) with a sum of \(v\).

- The function `func_14()` seems to be designed to solve this problem. Let's analyze how it works:
  - If \(k = 1\) and \(n = 2\), it directly returns "1\n2", which is a valid sequence.
  - For other values of \(k\), it constructs a sequence based on the binary representation of \(n\) and \(k\):
    - It creates a list of powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of \(n\).
    - It adjusts the list to ensure no subsequence sums to \(k\) while still allowing all sums from 1 to \(n\) except \(k\).

- The function `func_14()` correctly handles the construction of the sequence based on the problem constraints. It ensures that the sequence meets the required conditions for all test cases within the given constraints.

- The main function `func_15()` correctly processes each test case by reading the number of test cases and then calling `func_14()` for each test case, printing the results.

Given that `func_14()` correctly constructs the sequence for all test cases and `func_15()` correctly processes and prints the results, the overall program meets the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
