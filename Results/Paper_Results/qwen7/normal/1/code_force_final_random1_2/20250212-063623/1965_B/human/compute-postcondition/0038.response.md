Output State: **`i` is `lk + 2`; `ans` is a list containing the values 4 and 2 **(lk + 2)**.**

Explanation: The code appends \(2^i\) to the list `ans`. Given that `i` is `lk + 2`, the value of \(2^i\) is \(2^{lk + 2}\). Since `ans` initially contains the value 4 (which is \(2^2\)), after appending \(2^{lk + 2}\), `ans` now contains both 4 and \(2^{lk + 2}\).
