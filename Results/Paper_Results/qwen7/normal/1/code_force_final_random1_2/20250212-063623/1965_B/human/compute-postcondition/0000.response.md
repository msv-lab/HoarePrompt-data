State: **`func_10()` must return at least 1, n and k are integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n for each test case**.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify Loop Variables**: The loop variable in this case is `_`, but since it's just a placeholder, we don't need to explicitly mention it in the state. The key is to understand what the loop is iterating over.

2. **Loop Iteration Condition**: The loop runs `func_10()` times. Therefore, the state before the loop should ensure that `func_10()` returns at least 1, as the loop requires at least one iteration to execute.

3. **Content of Each Iteration**: For each iteration, `func_14()` returns a list `[n, k]`. This means that inside the loop, `n` and `k` are integers, and they must satisfy the conditions `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6` and `1 ≤ k ≤ n`.

4. **Adjusting the State**: Since the loop relies on the output of `func_10()` and `func_14()`, the state must ensure that these functions return values that allow the loop to execute properly. Specifically, `func_10()` must return at least 1, and for each returned value, `func_14()` must provide a valid `[n, k]` pair.

Thus, the final state is:
**`func_10()` must return at least 1, n and k are integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n for each test case**.
