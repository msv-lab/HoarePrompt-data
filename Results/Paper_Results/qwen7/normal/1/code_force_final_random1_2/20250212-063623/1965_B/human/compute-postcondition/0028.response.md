Output State: `ans` contains the elements `[2, 2, 4, 8, 16, ...]` up to `2^{lk-2}`, where `lk` is the length of `bk`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `ans` will contain all powers of 2 starting from \(2^0\) (which is 1, but since 1 is not included in the given outputs, we start from \(2^1 = 2\)) up to \(2^{lk-2}\). The variable `i` will be equal to `lk - 1`.
