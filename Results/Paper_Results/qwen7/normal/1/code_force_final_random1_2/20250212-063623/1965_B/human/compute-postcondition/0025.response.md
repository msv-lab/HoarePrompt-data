Output State: **`ans` contains the elements [2, 2 ** (`lk - 1`)], `i` is `lk - 1`, `lk` must remain unchanged**

Explanation: The code appends `2 ** i` to the list `ans`. Given that `i` is `lk - 1`, the new element added to `ans` is `2 ** (lk - 1)`. Therefore, `ans` now contains both the original element `2` and the new element `2 ** (lk - 1)`. The values of `i` and `lk` remain unchanged as per the initial state.
