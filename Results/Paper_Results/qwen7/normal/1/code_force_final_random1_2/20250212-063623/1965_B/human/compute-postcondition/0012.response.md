Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and `l`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `l`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `l` is greater than 2
   - `ans` contains the value 4

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 2 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 3.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` (which will be 3) must still be less than `l`. Therefore, `l` must remain greater than 3.

5. **Final state**:
   - `i` will be 3
   - `l` must be greater than 3
   - The value of `ans` does not change and remains 4

So, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 3, `l` must be greater than 3, `ans` contains the value 4**
