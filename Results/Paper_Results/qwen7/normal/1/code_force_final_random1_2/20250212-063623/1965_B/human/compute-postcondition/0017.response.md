Output State: `i` is 5; `l` is greater than 5; `ans` contains the values [4, 8, 16, 32].

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `i` is less than `l`. Given that the loop has executed 3 times, `i` is now 4. For the loop to complete its iterations, `l` must be greater than 4, and it has now reached 5. Each iteration of the loop appends `2 ** i` to `ans`, so after 3 iterations, `ans` contains [4, 8, 16]. Since `i` is incremented to 5 for the next iteration, `ans` will then contain [4, 8, 16, 32] after the fourth iteration.
