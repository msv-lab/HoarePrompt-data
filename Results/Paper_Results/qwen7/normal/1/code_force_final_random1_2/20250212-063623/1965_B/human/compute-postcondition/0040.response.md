Output State: `i` is `l - 1`, `ans` is a list containing the values `[2, 2^lk, 2^{lk+1}, ..., 2^{l-1}, k - 2^{lk}, k + 1, 2 * k + 1]`.

Explanation: The loop runs from `lk` to `l-1`. After `lk - 1` iterations (since the loop starts at `lk`), `i` will be `l - 1`. During each iteration, the loop appends `2 ** i` to `ans`. Therefore, `ans` will contain all powers of 2 from `2^lk` to `2^{l-1}` in addition to the initial elements `[k - 2^{lk}, k + 1, 2 * k + 1]`.
