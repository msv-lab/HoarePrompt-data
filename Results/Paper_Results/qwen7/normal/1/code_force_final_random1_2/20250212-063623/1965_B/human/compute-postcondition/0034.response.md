Output State: **`i` is `lk`, ans contains the value 2 ** `lk`.**

Explanation: The code appends `2 ** i` to the list `ans`. Given that `i` is `lk`, `2 ** i` becomes `2 ** lk`. The value of `l` being greater than `lk` is a precondition and remains unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes `i` remaining as `lk` and `ans` containing the value `2 ** lk`.
