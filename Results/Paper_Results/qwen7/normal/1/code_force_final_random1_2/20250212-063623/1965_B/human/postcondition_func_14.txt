The function outputs the results of calling `func_14()` for each test case specified by `func_10()`. Specifically, it writes the list `[n, k]` to standard output for each test case, where `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6` and `1 ≤ k ≤ n`. After all test cases have been processed, the output consists of `t` lines, each containing the values returned by `func_14()` for the corresponding test case.
