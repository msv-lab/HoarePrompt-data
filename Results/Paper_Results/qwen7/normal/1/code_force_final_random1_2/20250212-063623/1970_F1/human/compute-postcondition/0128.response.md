Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable is `ind`.
   - The loop iterates over `range(len(line))`.

2. **Determine the Current State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `ind` is 3.
   - `tmp` is 1.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `ind < len(line)`.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `ind` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, the next value of `ind` will be 4.
   - The value of `tmp` does not change within the loop head; it is determined before the loop starts.

5. **Update the State:**
   - `ind` will be incremented to 4.
   - `tmp` remains 1.

Given this analysis, the updated state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`ind` is 4, `tmp` is 1**
