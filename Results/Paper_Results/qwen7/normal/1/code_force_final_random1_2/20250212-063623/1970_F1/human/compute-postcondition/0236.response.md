Output State: **`obj` is the first element of the `comand` list, `com` is the second element of the `comand` list, `t` is the integer value of the first line read from standard input, `time` is 2 or 3, `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`**.

In this scenario, the code assigns the value of `elements[obj]` to the variable `pos`. Since `obj` is the first element of the `comand` list, the value of `pos` is determined by accessing the corresponding index in the `elements` list. The other variables remain unchanged.
