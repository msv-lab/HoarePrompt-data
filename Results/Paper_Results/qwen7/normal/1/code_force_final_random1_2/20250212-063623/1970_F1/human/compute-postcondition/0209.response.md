Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **`player`**: 
   - If `isPlayer(obj)` is True, then `player` is `obj`.
   - If `isPlayer(obj)` is False, then `player` is `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`.
   
2. **`time`**: The value is explicitly given as 2.

3. **`command`**: This is a list containing the stripped and split elements of the first line read from standard input.

4. **`obj`**: This is the first element of the `command` list.

5. **`com`**: This is the second element of the `command` list.

6. **`comand`**: This is equal to the list obtained by stripping and splitting the first line read from standard input. Since this is the same as `command`, it doesn't add new information.

7. **`pos`**: This is the value of the element in the `elements` list at index `obj`.

8. **`nxt`**: This is a tuple equal to `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`.

Given these definitions, let's determine what will be printed:

- The print statement is `print('%d %s ELIMINATED' % (time, player))`.
- `time` is explicitly given as 2.
- `player` could be either `obj` or `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`, but since we don't have the specific value of `obj` or the contents of `grid`, we cannot determine the exact value of `player` without additional information.

However, we know that `player` will be one of these two forms, and the print statement will format it accordingly.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **2 [player] ELIMINATED (where player is either obj or grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])**
