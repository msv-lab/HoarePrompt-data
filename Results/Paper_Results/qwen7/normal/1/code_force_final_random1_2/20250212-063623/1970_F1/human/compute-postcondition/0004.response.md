Output State: **`grid` is an empty list, (n, m) are positive integers such that 3 ≤ n, m ≤ 99 and both are odd, `elements` is a dictionary mapping entities to their positions on the field with '.B': (-1, -1), `allPlayers` is an empty dictionary, allPlayers is indicating whether each player is carrying the Quaffle or not, `goal` is now [[], []], `points` is a list of integers representing the current scores of the red and blue teams respectively, `mov` is a dictionary mapping movement commands (U, D, L, R) to their corresponding changes in position, `t` is a non-negative integer representing the number of steps in the game.**

Explanation: The code `goal = [[], []]` simply reassigns the value of the variable `goal` to a new list containing two empty lists. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
