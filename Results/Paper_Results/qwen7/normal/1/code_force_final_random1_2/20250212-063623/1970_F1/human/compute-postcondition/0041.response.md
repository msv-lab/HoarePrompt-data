Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an odd positive integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 99, `line` is a non-empty list of strings, `grid` is a list containing one element which is the `line`, `ind` is 3, `tmp` is 0 if the first character of `line[3]` is 'B', else `tmp` is 1, and `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is `False`.**

Explanation: The code `allPlayers[line[ind]] = False` updates the value of `allPlayers[line[ind]]` to `False`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ind` is updated to the current value of `i`, which is 0, but since `i` is not used further in the given code, we keep it as `i` is 0. The rest of the conditions and values of the variables are as per the initial state.
