Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `i + 1`, `line` is a list of strings obtained from reading a line of input, stripping whitespace, and splitting by spaces.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and splits the line into a list of strings based on whitespace. This operation does not affect the values of `i` or `n`, but it introduces a new variable `line` which holds the result of the split operation.
