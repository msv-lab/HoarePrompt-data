Output State: **`ind` is 3; `tmp` is 1; `goal[tmp]` contains an element which is a tuple `(i, ind)`**

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(i, ind)` to the list `goal[tmp]`. Since `i` is not defined in the initial state, it remains unknown. However, we know `ind` is 3 and `tmp` is 1. Therefore, `goal[1]` (since `tmp` is 1) will contain the tuple `(i, 3)`.
