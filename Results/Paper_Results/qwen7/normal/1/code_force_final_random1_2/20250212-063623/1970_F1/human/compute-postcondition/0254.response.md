Postcondition: **`t` is the integer value of the first line read from standard input, `time` is 2 or 3, `comand` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the second line read from standard input after stripping any leading or trailing whitespace. If `el` is '.', and `obj` is an element of the `comand` list, then `allPlayers[obj]` is set to True. Otherwise, `obj` is the first element of the `comand` list, `com` is the second element of the `comand` list, `el` is the third element of the `comand` list, `team` is 1 if the first character of `obj` is 'B', otherwise `team` is 0, and `points[team]` is 10 more than its previous value. If `el` is not '.', `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`, `obj` is the first element of the `command` list, `com` is the second element of the `command` list, `t` is the integer value of the first line read from standard input, `time` is 2 or 3, `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]` or `elements[nxt]` depending on the condition, `nxt` is the tuple `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`, and `points[team]` is incremented by 1 if `com` is 'T' and a goal is scored. If `com` is not 'T', `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt` and `allPlayers[obj]` is set to False.**
