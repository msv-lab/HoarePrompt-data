Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an odd positive integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 99, `line` is a non-empty list of strings, `grid` is a list containing one element which is the `line`, `elements[line[ind]]` is `i`, `isPlayer(line[ind])` is `False`, and the current value of `line[ind][1]` is `'G'`; `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1; `goal[tmp]` is a list containing the tuple `(i, ind)`**.

Explanation: The line `goal[tmp].append((i, ind))` appends the tuple `(i, ind)` to the list `goal[tmp]`. Since `i` is 0 and `ind` is the index of the element in `line` that meets the condition specified (with `line[ind][1]` being `'G'`), the value of `tmp` determines which list in `goal` the tuple is appended to. Given the conditions, `tmp` is either 0 or 1 depending on the value of `line[ind][0]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
