Postcondition: `obj` is the first element of the `command` list, `com` is the second element of the `command` list, `t` is the integer value of the first line read from standard input, `time` is 2 or 3, `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]` or `elements[nxt]` depending on the condition, `nxt` is the tuple `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`, `points[team]` is incremented by 1 if `com` is 'T' and a goal is scored, and `allPlayers[obj]` is set to False if `com` is not 'T'. If `obj == '.B'` and `isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])` or `isPlayer(obj)` and `elements['.B'] == nxt`, then `player` is either `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` returns True, otherwise it is `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`.
