Output State: **`t` is the integer value of the first line read from standard input, `time` is 2 or 3, `comand` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the second line read from standard input after stripping any leading or trailing whitespace.**

Explanation: The code reads a command from standard input using `stdin.readline().strip().split()`. This operation does not modify the existing variables `t` and `time`, but it creates a new variable `comand` which is a list of strings obtained by splitting the second line read from standard input after stripping any leading or trailing whitespace.
