Output State: **`i` is now `elements[line[ind + 1]]` or `elements['G']`, `ind` is incremented by 1, `n` is an odd positive integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 99\), `line` is a non-empty list of strings, `tmp` is 0 if the first character of `line[ind]` is 'B' else 1, `isPlayer(line[ind + 1])` is evaluated as follows: if `isPlayer(line[ind + 1])` returns `True`, then `allPlayers[line[ind + 1]]` is `False`. If `isPlayer(line[ind + 1])` returns `False`, then `goal[tmp]` is a list containing the tuples `(i, ind + 1)` and `(i, ind)`.**

Explanation: The code sets the variable `tmp` to 0 if the first character of `line[ind]` is 'B', otherwise it sets `tmp` to 1. The values of `i`, `ind`, `n`, `line`, `isPlayer(line[ind + 1])`, `allPlayers[line[ind + 1]]`, and `goal[tmp]` are updated according to the conditions mentioned in the problem statement.
