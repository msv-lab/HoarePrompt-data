Postcondition: `ind` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to the length of `line`, `line` is a list of strings with at least one element, and the current value of `line[ind]` is not '..', `elements[line[ind]]` is assigned the value `i` if `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `True` and `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is `False`. Otherwise, `line[ind]` is not assigned the value `i`, `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `False`, and either `line[ind][1]` equals 'G' and `goal[0]` contains the tuple `(i, ind)` with the value of `tmp` being 0, or `line[ind][1]` does not equal 'G'.
