Output State: **`obj` is the first element of the `comand` list, `com` is the second element of the `comand` list, `t` is the integer value of the first line read from standard input, `time` is 2 or 3.**

Explanation: The code `obj, com = comand` unpacks the `comand` list into two variables `obj` and `com`. Since `comand` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the second line read from standard input, `obj` will be the first string in this list and `com` will be the second string. The values of `t` and `time` remain unchanged.
