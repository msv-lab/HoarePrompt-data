Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an odd positive integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 99, `line` is a list of strings obtained from the first line of standard input after stripping and splitting it.**

Explanation: The code reads a line from standard input, strips any leading/trailing whitespace, and splits the line into a list of strings. This operation does not affect the values of `i` or `n`. Therefore, `i` remains 0 and `n` remains an odd positive integer within the specified range. The newly created variable `line` holds the split result from the input.
