Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop iterates over `ind` using `range(len(line))`. Therefore, the only variable in the loop head is `ind`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**: The loop continues as long as `ind` is within the range of `len(line)`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `n` is an odd positive integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 99
   - `line` is a non-empty list of strings
   - `grid` is a list containing one element which is the `line`
   - `ind` is either 2 or remains 1
   - Additional conditions based on the value of `line[ind]`:
     - If `line[ind] != '..'` and `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `False`, then `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is `False`.
     - Otherwise, `ind` is 2, `tmp` is 0 if the first character of `line[2]` is 'B', else `tmp` is 1, and `goal[tmp]` contains the tuple `(0, 2)`.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `ind` is either 2 or remains 1, the next value of `ind` will be incremented by 1.
   - If `ind` was 1, it will become 2.
   - If `ind` was 2, it will become 3 (assuming `line` has at least 3 elements).

5. **Check the Conditions for the Next Iteration**:
   - If `ind` becomes 2, the condition `line[ind] != '..'` and `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `False` will be checked again.
   - If `ind` becomes 3, the loop will stop because `ind` will no longer be within the range of `len(line)`.

Given these points, let's formulate the new state:

- If `ind` was 1, it will become 2.
- If `ind` was 2, it will become 3.
- All other variables (`i`, `n`, `line`, `grid`, `allPlayers`, `tmp`, `goal`) remain unchanged unless explicitly stated otherwise.

Since the problem does not specify any changes to the other variables, they remain the same.

**Final State**:
- If `ind` was 1, then `ind` becomes 2.
- If `ind` was 2, then `ind` becomes 3.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an odd positive integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 99, `line` is a non-empty list of strings, `grid` is a list containing one element which is the `line`, `ind` is 2 (if previously 1), `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is `False` if `line[ind] != '..'` and `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `False`, otherwise `ind` is 2, `tmp` is 0 if the first character of `line[2]` is 'B', else `tmp` is 1, and `goal[tmp]` contains the tuple `(0, 2)` if `ind` was 2.**

However, since `ind` can only increment by 1, the final state simplifies to:

State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an odd positive integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 99, `line` is a non-empty list of strings, `grid` is a list containing one element which is the `line`, `ind` is 2 (if previously 1), `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is `False` if `line[ind] != '..'` and `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `False`, otherwise `ind` is 3, `tmp` is 0 if the first character of `line[3]` is 'B', else `tmp` is 1, and `goal[tmp]` contains the tuple `(0, 2)` if `ind` was 2.**

If `ind` was 2, then:

State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an odd positive integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 99, `line` is a non-empty list of strings, `grid` is a list containing one element which is the `line`, `ind` is 3, `tmp` is 0 if the first character of `line[3]` is 'B', else `tmp` is 1, and `goal[tmp]` contains the tuple `(0, 2)` if `ind` was 2.**

Thus, the final state is:

State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an odd positive integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 99, `line` is a non-empty list of strings, `grid` is a list containing one element which is the `line`, `ind` is 3, `tmp` is 0 if the first character of `line[3]` is 'B', else `tmp` is 1, and `goal[tmp]` contains the tuple `(0, 2)` if `ind` was 2.**
