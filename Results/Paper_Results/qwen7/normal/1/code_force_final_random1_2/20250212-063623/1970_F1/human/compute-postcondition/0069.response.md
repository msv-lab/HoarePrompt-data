Postcondition: `i` is assigned to `elements[line[ind]]`, `ind` remains the same, `n` is an odd positive integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 99\), `line` is a non-empty list of strings. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `True`, then `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to `True`. Otherwise, `i` is assigned to `elements['G']`, `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is `False`, and `goal[tmp]` is a list containing the tuple `(i, ind)`.
