Output State: **`t` is the integer value of the first line read from standard input, `time` is 0, `command` is a list containing the stripped and split elements of the first line read from standard input, `obj`, `com`, and `el` are the first, second, and third elements of the `command` list respectively.**

Explanation: The code `obj, com, el = comand` unpacks the `command` list into three variables: `obj`, `com`, and `el`. These variables now hold the first, second, and third elements of the `command` list, respectively. The other variables (`t`, `time`) remain unchanged.
