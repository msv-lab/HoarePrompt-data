Output State: **`tmp` is 0, `i` is assigned to `elements['G']`, `ind` remains the same, `n` is an odd positive integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 99\), `line` is a non-empty list of strings, `isPlayer(line[ind])` is `False`, and the second character of `line[ind]` is 'G'.**

Explanation: The code assigns `tmp` the value `0` if the first character of `line[ind]` is 'B', otherwise it assigns `1`. Since the second character of `line[ind]` is 'G', the first character cannot be 'B'. Therefore, `tmp` is assigned the value `1`. However, the problem statement specifies that the second character is 'G', which means the first character is not 'B', so `tmp` is assigned `1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
