Postcondition: `i` is now assigned to `elements[line[ind]]`, `ind` is incremented by 1, `n` is an odd positive integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 99\), `line` is a non-empty list of strings, `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is `False`, and `goal[tmp]` is a list containing tuples `(i, ind + 1)` and possibly `(i, ind)` depending on the evaluation of `isPlayer(line[ind + 1])`.
