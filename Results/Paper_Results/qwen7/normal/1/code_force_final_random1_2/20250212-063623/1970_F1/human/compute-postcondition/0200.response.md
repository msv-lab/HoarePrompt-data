Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t`: This is the integer value of the first line read from standard input.
   - `time`: This is initialized to 1.
   - `command`: This is a list containing the stripped and split elements of the first line read from standard input.
   - `obj`: This is the first element of the `command` list.
   - `com`: This is the second element of the `command` list.
   - `comand`: This is equal to the list obtained by stripping and splitting the first line read from standard input (same as `command`).
   - `el`: This is the third element of the `command` list.
   - `team`: This is 1 if `obj[0]` is 'B' else 0.
   - `points[team]`: This is 10 more than its previous value.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('%d %s CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' % (time, GoalName[team]))
   ```

To determine what will be printed, we need to figure out the values of `time` and `GoalName[team]`.

- **`time`**: According to the initial state, `time` is initialized to 1.
- **`GoalName[team]`**: We need to determine the value of `team` first.
  - `team` is 1 if `obj[0]` is 'B' else 0.
  - Since `obj` is the first element of the `command` list, and `command` is the result of stripping and splitting the first line read from standard input, `obj[0]` will be the first character of this line.
  - Without knowing the exact input, we cannot determine if `obj[0]` is 'B' or not. However, since the problem does not specify any particular input, we can assume a general case where `obj[0]` could be either 'B' or not 'B'.
  - If `obj[0]` is 'B', then `team` is 1; otherwise, `team` is 0.

Given these steps, the print statement will output:
- `time` is 1.
- `GoalName[team]` will be `GoalName[1]` if `obj[0]` is 'B', or `GoalName[0]` if `obj[0]` is not 'B'.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **1 GoalName[team]** (where `team` is 1 if `obj[0]` is 'B' else 0)
