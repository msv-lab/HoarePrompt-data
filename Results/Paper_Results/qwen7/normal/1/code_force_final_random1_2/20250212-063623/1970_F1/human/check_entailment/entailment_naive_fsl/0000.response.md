Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where a player throws the Quaffle into their own goal, which results in the opposing team scoring a point. Specifically, the `goalIn` function checks if the position of the Quaffle is in a goal, but it does not account for the scenario where a player throws the Quaffle into their own goal. 

For instance, consider the following input:

```
5 5
.. R1 .. B1 ..
RG .. .. .. BG
RG R0 .Q B0 BG
RG .. .. .. BG
.. R2 .. B2 ..
13
R0 R
R0 C .Q
R0 D
R0 R
R0 R
R0 T
```

In this scenario, the red player `R0` picks up the Quaffle, moves it to the right, catches it, and then throws it into the red goal, which should result in the blue team scoring a point. However, the program does not handle this case correctly, and it would incorrectly print the final score without accounting for this point.

To fix this issue, the `goalIn` function needs to check if the Quaffle is thrown into a goal of the opposite team.
