Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is 1, `n` is an odd positive integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 99, `line` is a non-empty list of strings where each element is a string split from the input, `grid` is a list containing the `line` appended with the original `line`. For each index `ind` where `line[ind]` is not `'..'` and `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `True`, `elements[line[ind]]` is set to `(i, ind)`, if `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `False` and `line[ind][1]` is `'G'`, `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1, and `goal[tmp]` is a list containing the tuple `(i, ind)`
Code of the loop:
for ind in range(len(line)):
    if line[ind] != '..':
        elements[line[ind]] = i, ind
        if isPlayer(line[ind]):
            allPlayers[line[ind]] = False
        elif line[ind][1] == 'G':
            tmp = 0 if line[ind][0] == 'B' else 1
            goal[tmp].append((i, ind))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is assigned to either `elements[line[ind]]` or `elements['G']`, `ind` remains the same, `n` is an odd positive integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 99\), `line` is a non-empty list of strings, and `isPlayer(line[ind])` is evaluated as follows: if `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `True`, then `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is `False`; otherwise, `goal[tmp]` is a list containing the tuple `(i, ind)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is assigned to either `elements[line[ind]]` or `elements['G']`, `ind` is incremented by 1, `n` is an odd positive integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 99\), `line` is a non-empty list of strings, and `isPlayer(line[ind + 1])` is evaluated as follows: if `isPlayer(line[ind + 1])` returns `True`, then `allPlayers[line[ind + 1]]` is `False`. If `isPlayer(line[ind + 1])` returns `False`, then `goal[tmp]` is a list containing the tuples `(i, ind + 1)` and `(i, ind)`, where `tmp` is 0 if the first character of `line[ind]` is 'B' else 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is now `elements[line[ind + 1]]` or `elements['G']`, `ind` is incremented by 1, `n` is an odd positive integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 99\), `line` is a non-empty list of strings, and `goal[tmp]` is a list containing the tuples `(i, ind + 1)` and `(i, ind)`, where `tmp` is 0 if the first character of `line[ind]` is 'B' else 1, regardless of whether `line[ind]` is `'..'` or not.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
