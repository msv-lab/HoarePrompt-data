Output State: **`ind` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to the length of `line`, `line` is a list of strings with at least one element, the current value of `line[ind]` is not '..', `line[ind]` is not assigned the value `i`, `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `False`, `goal[0]` contains the tuple `(i, ind)`, and the value of `tmp` is 0.**

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(i, ind)` to the list `goal[tmp]`. Given that `tmp` is 0, `goal[0]` now includes the tuple `(i, ind)`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
