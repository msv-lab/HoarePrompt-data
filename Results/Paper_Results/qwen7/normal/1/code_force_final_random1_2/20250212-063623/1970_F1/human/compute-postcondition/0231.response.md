Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t`: An integer value read from the first line of standard input.
   - `time`: An integer with a value of either 2 or 3.
   - `comand`: A list of strings obtained by splitting the second line of standard input after stripping any leading or trailing whitespace.
   - `obj`: The first element of the `comand` list.
   - `com`: The second element of the `comand` list.
   - `el`: The third element of the `comand` list.
   - `team`: 
     - If the first element of `obj` is 'B', then `team` is 1.
     - Otherwise, `team` is 0.
   - `points[team]`: This is 10 more than its previous value, but since we don't know the previous value, we only need to focus on the current value of `team`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('%d %s CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' % (time, GoalName[team]))
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - `time`: We know it is either 2 or 3.
   - `team`: It depends on the value of the first element of `obj`. If it is 'B', `team` is 1; otherwise, it is 0.
   - `GoalName[team]`: This is a string that corresponds to the team number. If `team` is 0, `GoalName[0]` is used; if `team` is 1, `GoalName[1]` is used.

Given this information, let's formulate the output:

- If `team` is 0 (which means the first element of `obj` is not 'B'), the output will be:
  ```
  2 or 3 CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH
  ```
- If `team` is 1 (which means the first element of `obj` is 'B'), the output will be:
  ```
  2 or 3 CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH
  ```

Since both cases result in the same output, we can generalize it as follows:

Output: **2 or 3 CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH**
