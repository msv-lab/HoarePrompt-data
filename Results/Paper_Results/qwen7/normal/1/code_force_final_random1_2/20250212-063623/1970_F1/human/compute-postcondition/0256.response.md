Based on the initial state provided:

- `time` is the final iteration count specified by `t`.
- `allPlayers` has been updated for each player, marking them as `True` if they caught a golden snitch ('.Q') or moved without conflict.
- `points` is a list that has accumulated scores for each team based on catching golden snitches and scoring goals.
- `elements` dictionary holds the current positions of all entities on the grid.
- `goal` dictionary retains the coordinates of the blue and green goals.

The print statement is:
```python
print('FINAL SCORE: %d %d' % (points[0], points[1]))
```

This statement will print the final scores of the two teams. Since the `points` list accumulates scores for each team, `points[0]` represents the score of the first team and `points[1]` represents the score of the second team.

Output: **FINAL SCORE: [points[0]] [points[1]] (where points[0] and points[1] are the accumulated scores of the first and second team respectively)**
