To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the print statement:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `player` is either `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` returns True, otherwise it is `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`.
   - `time` is an integer representing the current time.

2. **Print Statement**:
   ```python
   print('%d %s ELIMINATED' % (time, player))
   ```

Given this, the print statement will output a string with the value of `time` followed by a space, then the value of `player`, and finally the word "ELIMINATED".

- If `isPlayer(obj)` returns True, then `player` is `obj`.
- If `isPlayer(obj)` returns False, then `player` is `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`.

Since the exact value of `obj`, `grid`, `nxt`, and `isPlayer(obj)` are not provided, we can only describe the general form of the output.

Output: **%d [player] ELIMINATED (where [player] is either obj if isPlayer(obj) returns True, otherwise it is grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])**
