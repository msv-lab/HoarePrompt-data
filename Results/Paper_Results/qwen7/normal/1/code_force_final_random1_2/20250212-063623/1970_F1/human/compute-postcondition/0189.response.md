Postcondition: **`t` is the integer value of the first line read from standard input, `time` is 0, `command` is a list containing the stripped and split elements of the first line read from standard input, `obj` is the first element of the `command` list, `com` is the second element of the `command` list, `pos` is the value of the element in the `elements` list at index specified by `obj`, `nxt` is a tuple with the value of `pos[0] + mov[com][0]` as its first element and `pos[1] + mov[com][1]` as its second element. If `obj` is a black piece ('.B') and the next position (`nxt`) is occupied by another player's piece, then `player` is set to the piece at `nxt`. If `obj` is a player's piece and the black piece ('.B') is at the next position (`nxt`), then `player` is set to `obj`. If `com` is 'T', then `allPlayers[obj]` is set to `False`. If the current position (`pos`) is in a goal area, then `points[team]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged. If `com` is not 'T', then `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`, and if `obj` is a player's piece, then `obj` is marked as inactive.**
