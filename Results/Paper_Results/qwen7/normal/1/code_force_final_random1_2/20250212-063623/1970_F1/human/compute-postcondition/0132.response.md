Output State: **`ind` is 4, `tmp` is 0 if `line[4][0]` equals 'B' else 1, `goal[tmp]` includes a tuple `(i, ind)`.**

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(i, ind)` to the list `goal[tmp]`. The value of `tmp` is determined by whether `line[4][0]` equals 'B'. If it does, `tmp` is 0; otherwise, `tmp` is 1. The values of `ind` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, `goal[tmp]` now contains the tuple `(i, ind)`.
