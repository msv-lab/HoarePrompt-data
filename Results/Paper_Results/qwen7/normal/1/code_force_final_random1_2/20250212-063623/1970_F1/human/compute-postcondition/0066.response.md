Output State: **`tmp` is 0, `i` is elements['G'], `ind` remains the same, `n` is an odd positive integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 99\), `line` is a non-empty list of strings, `isPlayer(line[ind])` is `False`, and the second character of `line[ind]` is 'G'; `goal[tmp]` is a list containing the tuple `(i, ind)`**.

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(i, ind)` to the list `goal[tmp]`. Since `tmp` is 0, `goal[0]` is updated to include the tuple `(i, elements['G'], ind)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
