Output State: **`obj` is the first element of the `comand` list, `com` is the second element of the `comand` list, `t` is the integer value of the first line read from standard input, `time` is 2 or 3, `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`, `nxt` is the tuple (pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])**.

Explanation: The code updates the variable `nxt` by calculating a new position based on the current position `pos` and the movement vector `mov[com]`. The new position `nxt` is a tuple representing the updated coordinates. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
