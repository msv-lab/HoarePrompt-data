Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `ind` and `line`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs for each index in `line`, meaning `ind` will iterate from `0` to `len(line) - 1`.

3. **Determine the State Adjustments**:
   - **`ind`**: This variable starts at `0` and increments by `1` with each iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `ind` will be `1`.
   - **`line`**: The state of `line` does not change within the loop; it remains the same list of strings.

4. **Consider the Postconditions**:
   - `i` remains `0` unless `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `True` and `line[ind]` is not `'..'`.
   - `elements[line[ind]]` is updated based on the value of `line[ind]` and the return value of `isPlayer(line[ind])`.
   - `tmp` and `goal` are only updated if `line[ind]` is not `'..'` and `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `False`, and `line[ind][1]` is `'G'`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `i` remains `0` unless certain conditions are met, and these conditions are not specified to change with each iteration, `i` will remain `0` at the start of the next iteration.
   - `elements[line[ind]]` will be updated if `line[ind]` is not `'..'` and `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `False`, but this update does not affect the overall state since `i` remains `0`.

Given the above analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `ind`, which will increment by `1`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an odd positive integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 99, `line` is a non-empty list of strings, `grid` is a list containing one element which is the `line`, `ind` is 1**.
