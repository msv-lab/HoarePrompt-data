Output State: **`current_year` is equal to `next_year`, and `next_year` is either `current_year + ai` if `current_year` is divisible by `ai`, or `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai` otherwise, and `current_year` is now equal to `next_year`.**

Explanation: The code `current_year = next_year` simply assigns the value of `next_year` to `current_year`. Since `next_year` was defined based on the conditions involving `current_year` and `ai`, the new value of `current_year` is now the same as the previous value of `next_year`. Therefore, the output state remains consistent with the initial postcondition, just with the updated value of `current_year`.
