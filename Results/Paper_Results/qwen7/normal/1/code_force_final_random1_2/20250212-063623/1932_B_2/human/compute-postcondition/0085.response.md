Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `t`, a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and `test_cases`, a list of test case descriptions. Each test case description consists of an integer `n` between 1 and 100 and a list of `n` integers `a_i` each between 1 and 10^6. For each test case, the function calculates a sequence of years based on the given integers `a_i` and returns a list of the final year value for each test case.**
