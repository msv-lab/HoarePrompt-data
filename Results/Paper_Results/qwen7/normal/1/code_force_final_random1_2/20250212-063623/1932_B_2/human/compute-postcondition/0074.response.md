Output State: **`ai` is the third element of `a`, `current_year` is the value of `next_year - ai`, `results` includes the updated `current_year` for the current iteration, `a` remains the same, `n` remains the same**.

Explanation: The code updates `next_year` to be the sum of `current_year` and `ai`. Since `ai` is the third element of `a`, `current_year` now becomes `next_year - ai`. All other variables remain unchanged.
