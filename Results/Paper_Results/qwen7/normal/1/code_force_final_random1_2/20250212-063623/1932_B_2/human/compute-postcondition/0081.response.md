Output State: The `results` list contains the final value of `current_year` for each test case after the loop has executed for all iterations. For each test case, `current_year` is updated based on the logic provided within the inner loop, considering all elements in the list `a`. The `current_year` value for each test case is appended to `results`. The `a` list and the variable `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
