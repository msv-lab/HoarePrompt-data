Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is the value from `test_cases`, `a` is the second value from `test_cases`, `current_year` is 0, `next_year` is equal to `current_year`, `results` is a list containing the final value of `current_year` for each iteration including the new one.
Code of the loop:
for ai in a:
    if current_year % ai == 0:
        next_year = current_year + ai
    else:
        next_year = (current_year // ai + 1) * ai
    current_year = next_year


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is the value from `test_cases`, `a` is the second value from `test_cases` and must have at least one element, `current_year` is either `ai` (where `ai` is the first element of `a`) or `ai` updated based on the condition `current_year % ai == 0`, `next_year` is either `2*ai` or `(ai // ai + 1) * ai` depending on the condition, `results` is a list containing the final value of `current_year` for each iteration including the new one, and `ai` is the first element of `a`, `current_year` is now equal to `next_year`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ai` is now the second element of `a`; `current_year` is updated based on the condition: if `current_year % ai == 0`, then `current_year` is set to `next_year` which is `current_year + ai`; otherwise, `current_year` is set to `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`; `results` includes the updated `current_year` for the current iteration; `a` remains the same; `n` remains the same; `current_year` is reassigned to `next_year`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ai` is the third element of `a`, `current_year` is either the value of `next_year - ai` if `current_year % ai == 0`, or the value of `next_year` if it does not satisfy the condition, `results` includes the updated `current_year` or `next_year` for the current iteration, `a` remains the same, `n` remains the same, and `current_year` is now equal to `next_year`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
