Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for test in test_cases:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `test` and `test_cases`.

2. **Determine the State After the Previous Iteration**:
   - `current_year` is the final value after processing all elements in `a` according to the given logic.
   - `next_year` is equal to `current_year`.
   - `results` is a list containing the final value of `current_year` for each iteration.

3. **Understand the Loop Execution**:
   - In each iteration of the loop, `test` takes the value of an element from `test_cases`.
   - The loop processes `test` and updates `current_year` accordingly.
   - `next_year` is updated to be equal to `current_year` after processing `test`.
   - The result of the current iteration is added to the `results` list.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `test` is used to iterate over `test_cases`, it will take the next value from `test_cases` in the next iteration.
   - `current_year` and `next_year` will be updated based on the processing of the next `test` value.
   - `results` will include the updated `current_year` value for the new iteration.

5. **Formulate the New State**:
   - `test` will be the next value from `test_cases`.
   - `current_year` and `next_year` will be updated based on the processing of the next `test` value.
   - `results` will include the updated `current_year` value for the new iteration.

Given the above reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`current_year` is the final value after processing the next element in `test_cases` according to the given logic; `next_year` is equal to `current_year`; `results` is a list containing the final value of `current_year` for each iteration including the new one.**

However, since we don't know the exact values yet, we can represent it as:

State: **`current_year` is the final value after processing the next element in `test_cases` according to the given logic; `next_year` is equal to `current_year`; `results` is a list containing the final value of `current_year` for each iteration including the new one.**
