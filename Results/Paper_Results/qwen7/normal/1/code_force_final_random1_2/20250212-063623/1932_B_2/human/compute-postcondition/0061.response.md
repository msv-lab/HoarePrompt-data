Postcondition: `n` is the value from `test_cases`, `a` is the second value from `test_cases` and must have at least one element, `current_year` is 0, `next_year` is 0, `results` is a list containing the final value of `current_year` for each iteration including the new one, `ai` is the first element of `a`. The current year (`current_year`) is divisible by the first element of `a` (`ai`).
