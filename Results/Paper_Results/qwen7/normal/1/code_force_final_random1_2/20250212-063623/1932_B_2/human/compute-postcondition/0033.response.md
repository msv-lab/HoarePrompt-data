Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `a` is a list of integers that must have at least one element.
   - `year` is updated to `year + (year % ai or ai)`, where `ai` is the first element of the list `a`.

2. **Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over each element `ai` in the list `a`.

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - The only variables in the loop head are `ai` and `a`.
   - After the first iteration, `ai` would be the first element of the list `a`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `a` must have at least one element remaining.

4. **Updating the State:**
   - Since `ai` is the first element of the list `a`, it will be removed from the list for the next iteration.
   - Therefore, `a` must now be a list with at least one element remaining.
   - `ai` will be the new first element of the list `a`.

5. **New State:**
   - `a` must have at least one element remaining.
   - `ai` will be the new first element of the list `a`.

Given these steps, the new state for the next iteration is:

**State: **`a` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `ai` is the second element of the list `a`**.
