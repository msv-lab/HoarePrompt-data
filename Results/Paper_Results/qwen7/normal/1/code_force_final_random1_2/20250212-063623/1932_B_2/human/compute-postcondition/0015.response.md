Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an empty list, `year` is the sum of the smallest elements in the original list `a` for each iteration of the loop, `n` is an input integer**.

The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input integer to `n`. The other variables (`t`, `a`, and `year`) remain unchanged from their initial state. The precondition that `t` must be greater than or equal to 0 and the description of `a` and `year` remain valid.
