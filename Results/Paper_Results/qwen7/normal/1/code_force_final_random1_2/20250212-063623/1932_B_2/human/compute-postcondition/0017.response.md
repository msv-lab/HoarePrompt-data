Output State: **`year` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `t` must be greater than or equal to 0.**

The code initializes the variable `year` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `year` is set to 0, while `n` remains an input integer, `a` remains a list of integers entered by the user, and `t` must still be greater than or equal to 0.
