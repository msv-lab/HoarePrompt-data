### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and its function summary step-by-step to verify the original assessment.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to find the year when all \( n \) signs will occur sequentially.
- Each sign \( i \)-th occurs every \( a_i \) years.
- The tribe starts waiting for the next sign immediately after the current sign occurs.

#### Given Program Code:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        year = 0
        for ai in a:
            year += year % ai or ai
        print(year)
```

#### Function Summary Recap:
- The function processes multiple test cases.
- For each test case, it reads \( n \) and a list of integers \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \).
- It iteratively updates a variable `year` starting from 0, using the formula `year += year % ai or ai` for each integer \( ai \) in the list.
- After processing all integers in the list for all test cases, it prints the final value of `year` for each test case.

#### Analysis:
1. **Initialization**: The variable `year` is initialized to 0.
2. **Loop through each sign**:
   - For each sign \( ai \), the formula `year += year % ai or ai` is used.
   - If `year % ai == 0`, then `year += ai` (i.e., `year` is already a multiple of `ai`).
   - Otherwise, `year += ai - (year % ai)` (i.e., `year` is not a multiple of `ai`, so we add the difference to make it a multiple).

This logic ensures that `year` is always a multiple of the current sign's periodicity \( ai \). Since the loop processes each sign in order, `year` will be the smallest common multiple (LCM) of all \( a_i \)'s.

Given this, the program correctly calculates the year in which all signs will occur sequentially. The provided examples and the general logic align with the problem requirements.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to find the year when all signs will occur sequentially.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
