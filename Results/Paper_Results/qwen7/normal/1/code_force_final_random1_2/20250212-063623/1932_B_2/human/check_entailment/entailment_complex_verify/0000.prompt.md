You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        year = 0
        for ai in a:
            year += year % ai or ai
        print(year)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, …, a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        year = 0
        
        for ai in a:
            year += year % ai or ai
        
        print(year)
        
    #State: Output State: The value of `year` will be the result of iteratively applying the operation `year += year % ai or ai` for each element `ai` in the list `a` for all iterations of the loop. This means that `year` will be updated in each iteration based on the current value of `year` and the current element from the list `a`. After all iterations, `year` will be the sum of the results of the operation applied to each element in the list `a`.
    #
    #In more detail, starting from the initial value of `year` (which is 0), the loop will go through each integer in the list `a` and update `year` as follows:
    #- For the first element `a[0]`, `year` becomes `year + (year % a[0] or a[0])`.
    #- For the second element `a[1]`, `year` becomes `(year + (year % a[0] or a[0])) + ((year + (year % a[0] or a[0])) % a[1] or a[1])`.
    #- This process continues for each subsequent element in the list `a`, updating `year` according to the same rule.
    #
    #The final value of `year` will be the sum of all such updates, reflecting the cumulative effect of the operation applied to each element in the list `a` for all iterations of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (each between 1 and 10^6). It then iteratively updates a variable `year` starting from 0, using the formula `year += year % ai or ai` for each integer `ai` in the list. After processing all integers in the list for all test cases, it prints the final value of `year` for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the year in which all signs will occur sequentially according to the problem description. For each sign, it waits until the next occurrence after the previous sign has happened. The logic `year += year % ai or ai` ensures that the year is updated to the next multiple of `ai` after the last sign's occurrence. This approach works for all given examples and potential cases within the constraints provided.
