Output State: **`current_year` is the final value after processing all elements in `a` according to the given logic; `next_year` is equal to `current_year`; `results` is a list containing the final value of `current_year` for each iteration.**

Explanation: The code appends the final value of `current_year` to the list `results` after processing all elements in `a`. Since `current_year` is updated based on the conditions provided in the loop body for each element in `a`, its final value is stored in `results`. Additionally, `next_year` is set to be equal to `current_year` after all iterations.
