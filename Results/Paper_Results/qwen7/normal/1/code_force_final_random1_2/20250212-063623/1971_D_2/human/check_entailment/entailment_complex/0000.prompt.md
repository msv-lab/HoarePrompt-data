Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and for each test case, s is a binary string with 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        
        count = 1
        
        flag = False
        
        j = 0
        
        while j < len(s) - 1:
            if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
                count += 1
                if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                    flag = True
            j += 1
        
        if flag:
            count -= 1
        
        print(count)
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `j` is equal to the length of the string `s`, `count` is the total number of transitions from '0' to '1' or from '1' to '0' in the string `s` minus one, `flag` is True if there was at least one transition from '0' to '1' during the loop's execution, otherwise `flag` is False, and `i` is equal to `t - 1`.
    #
    #This means that after the loop has completed all its iterations (from 0 to `t-1`), the variable `i` will be `t - 1`. The variable `j` will be equal to the length of the string `s` because the while loop increments `j` until it reaches the end of the string. The variable `count` will be the total number of transitions between different characters in the string `s`, adjusted by subtracting one if a '0' is followed by a '1' at any point. Finally, `flag` will be True if there was at least one instance where a '0' was immediately followed by a '1' in the string `s`, and False otherwise.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `t` and a binary string `s`. For each test case, it counts the total number of transitions between different characters in the string `s`, adjusting the count by subtracting one if a '0' is immediately followed by a '1'. It also checks if there was at least one instance where a '0' was immediately followed by a '1'. The function prints the adjusted count for each test case and does not return any value.
