You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 1
        flag = False
        j = 0
        while j < len(s) - 1:
            if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
                count += 1
                if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                    flag = True
            j += 1
        if flag:
            count -= 1
        print(count)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `t` and a binary string `s`. For each test case, it counts the total number of transitions between different characters in the string `s`, adjusting the count by subtracting one if a '0' is immediately followed by a '1'. It also checks if there was at least one instance where a '0' was immediately followed by a '1'. The function prints the adjusted count for each test case and does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `s`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - `count` is initialized to 1. This variable will keep track of the number of pieces.
   - `flag` is a boolean variable initialized to `False`. It will be used to detect if there is a transition from '0' to '1'.
   - `j` is an index variable starting at 0.

3. **Loop Through String:**
   - The loop iterates through the string `s` until `j` reaches the second last character (`len(s) - 1`).
   - Inside the loop, it checks if the current character `s[j]` is different from the next character `s[j + 1]`.
     - If they are different, it increments `count` by 1.
     - If the current character is '0' and the next character is '1', it sets `flag` to `True`.

4. **Adjust Count Based on Flag:**
   - After the loop, if `flag` is `True`, it decrements `count` by 1. This adjustment is intended to handle the case where there is a single transition from '0' to '1'.

5. **Output Result:**
   - Finally, it prints the value of `count`.

### Correctness Check:

1. **Handling Transitions:**
   - The logic correctly identifies transitions from '0' to '1'. However, the decrement of `count` when `flag` is `True` might not always be necessary. Consider the following example:
     - Input: "010"
     - Expected Output: 2 (since we need to split into "0" and "10")
     - The program would output 1 because it detects the transition and decrements `count`.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - If the string is already sorted ("00000000"), the program correctly outputs 1.
   - If the string has no transitions (e.g., "11111111"), the program also correctly outputs 1.
   - If the string has multiple transitions (e.g., "010101"), the program might output an incorrect result due to the unnecessary decrement.

3. **General Logic:**
   - The logic of incrementing `count` every time there is a change in characters is generally correct.
   - However, the decrement logic is flawed because it does not account for the fact that a single transition might require more than one piece.

### Conclusion:

The program does not handle all edge cases correctly and may produce incorrect results for certain inputs. Therefore, the given program is not fully correct.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**
