Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `s` is an input string with a length greater than or equal to 2, `count` is the total number of times the condition `s[j] != s[j + 1]` was met minus 1 throughout the entire loop execution, `flag` is True if at any point in the loop execution `s[j]` is '0' and `s[j + 1]` is '1', otherwise `flag` remains False, and `j` is equal to `len(s) - 1`.**
