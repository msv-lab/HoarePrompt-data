Postcondition: `s` is a string, the current value of `j` is such that the character at index `j` in `s` is not equal to the character at index `j + 1` in `s`; `count` is increased by 1. If the character at index `j` in `s` is '0' and the character at index `j + 1` in `s` is '1', then `flag` is True. Otherwise, `flag` remains unchanged.
