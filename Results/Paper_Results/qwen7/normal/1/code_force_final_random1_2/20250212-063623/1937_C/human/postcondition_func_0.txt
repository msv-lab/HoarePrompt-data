The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it determines two values: `k` and `best`. It does this by interacting with an external entity through queries. In the first phase, it finds a value `k` such that for all `i` (where `2 ≤ i < n`), the query result is `<`. In the second phase, it finds a value `best` such that for all `i` (where `1 ≤ i < n`), the query result is `<` when comparing `k` with `best` and `i`. Finally, it outputs the values of `k` and `best` for each test case.
