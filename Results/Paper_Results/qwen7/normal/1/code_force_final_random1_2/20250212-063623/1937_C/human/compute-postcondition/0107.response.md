Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 3
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 2
   - `res` is an input string (this variable is not part of the loop head and does not affect the loop continuation)

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 3, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 4.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop body and the loop condition depends on `i < n`.
   - The value of `res` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is 4
- `n` is still greater than or equal to 2

So, the final state is:
State: **`i` is 4, `n` is greater than or equal to 2**
