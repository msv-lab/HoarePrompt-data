The function processes an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4) and performs a series of operations involving indices and calls to other functions (`func_1` and `func_2`). It identifies specific indices based on comparisons and updates lists and variables accordingly. Finally, it calls `func_2` with two updated indices. The function does not return any value.
