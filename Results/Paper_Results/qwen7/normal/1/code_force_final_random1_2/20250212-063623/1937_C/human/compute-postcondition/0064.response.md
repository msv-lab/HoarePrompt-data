Output State: **`res` is a new string from the input, `i` is `k`, `k` is `i_end + 1`, and `n` must be greater than `i_end + 2`**.

Explanation: The code `k = i` assigns the value of `i` to `k`. Since `i` was previously `i_end + 2`, `k` now holds the same value, which is `i_end + 1`. The other variables (`res`, `i`, `k`, and `n`) are updated accordingly.
