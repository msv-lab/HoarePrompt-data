Output State: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to the original value of `n`, `k` is `n - 1`, `i` is `n`, and `res` is the last input string received, if `res` equals '<', `k` is set to `n - 1`.

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 2` to `i = n-1`. After all iterations, the value of `i` will be `n-1`. If the condition `res == '<'` was met for any `i`, `k` would be updated to the current value of `i`. Therefore, `k` will be `n-1` if the condition was met for the last iteration or `n-1` if it was never met. The value of `t` remains greater than 0 as no operation inside the loop affects `t`.
