Output State: **`best` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, `k` is `n-1`, and `res` is the last string received from the input.**

Explanation: The line `best = 0` initializes the variable `best` to 0. This does not affect the values of `i`, `k`, or `res`. Therefore, the values of `i` and `k` remain `n-1`, and `res` remains the last string received from the input.
