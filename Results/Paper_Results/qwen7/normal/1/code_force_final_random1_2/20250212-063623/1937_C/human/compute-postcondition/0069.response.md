Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is currently set to `n-1`.
   - `n` is not explicitly given its value, but it is used in the range function.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute if `1 <= i < n`. Given that `i` starts at `n-1`, the loop will not execute because `n-1` is not within the range `1` to `n-1`.

4. **Adjust the state to ensure the loop can execute**:
   - To make the loop execute, `i` must start within the range `1` to `n-1`.
   - Therefore, `i` should be set to `1` (the smallest value in the range).

5. **Ensure `n` is consistent with the range**: Since `i` is now `1`, `n` must be at least `2` for the loop to execute properly.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`best` is 0, `i` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, `k` is `n-1`, and `res` is the last string received from the input.**
