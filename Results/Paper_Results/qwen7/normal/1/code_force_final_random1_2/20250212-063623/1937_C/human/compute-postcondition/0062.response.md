Output: **'? 0 k 0 i' (where k is i_end + 1 and i is i_end + 2)**

Explanation:
- `i` is defined as `i_end + 2`.
- `k` is defined as `i_end + 1`.

Therefore, when the `print` statement executes, it will print the string `'? 0 k 0 i'` with `k` being `i_end + 1` and `i` being `i_end + 2`. The other values (`0`) are literal strings and do not change. The `flush=True` parameter ensures that the output is flushed immediately, but it does not affect what is printed.
