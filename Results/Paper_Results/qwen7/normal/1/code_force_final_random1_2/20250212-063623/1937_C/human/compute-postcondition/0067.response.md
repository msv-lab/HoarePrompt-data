Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n-1`, `k` will be equal to `n-1`, and `res` will be the last string received from the input.**

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 2` to `i = n-1`. For each iteration, the value of `i` is printed and a new value for `res` is read. If `res` is `<`, then `k` is updated to the current value of `i`. After the loop completes, `i` will have reached `n-1`, and since the loop updates `k` to `i` whenever `res` is `<`, `k` will also be `n-1`. The value of `res` will be the last string received from the input during the loop's final iteration.
