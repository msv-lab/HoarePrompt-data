Based on the initial state provided:
- `i` is explicitly given as 4.
- `n` is greater than or equal to 2, but its specific value is not needed to determine the output of the print statement.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', 0, k, 0, i, flush=True)
```

Here's the breakdown:
- `'?'` is a string literal.
- `0` is an integer literal.
- `k` is not defined in the initial state, so it cannot be determined from the given information. Since no value is provided for `k`, it will remain as `k` in the output.
- `0` is another integer literal.
- `i` is explicitly given as 4.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **'? 0 k 0 4'**
