Output State: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to the original value of `n`, `k` is equal to `n`, `i` is equal to `n-1`, and `res` is the last input string received during the loop execution, if `res` equals '<', `k` is set to `n-1`.

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 2` to `i = n-1`. After each iteration, `i` is incremented, and `k` is updated to the current value of `i` if the input `res` is '<'. Therefore, after the loop completes, `i` will be `n-1`, and `k` will be the last value assigned to it, which is `n-1` if the condition was met in the last iteration. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop. The value of `n` remains the same as it is used as the upper limit for the loop but is not modified within the loop.
