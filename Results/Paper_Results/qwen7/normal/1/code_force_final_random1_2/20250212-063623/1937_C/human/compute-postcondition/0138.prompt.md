Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: None of the input variables are explicitly defined in the function signature. However, the problem implies that the function will interact with an external entity to perform queries and receive responses. The input variables are the number of test cases \( t \) and for each test case, the size of the permutation \( n \) and the results of the queries.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    k = 1
    for i in range(2, n):
        print('?', 0, k, 0, i, flush=True)
        res = input()
        if res == '<':
            k = i
    best = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        print('?', k, best, k, i, flush=True)
        res = input()
        if res == '<':
            best = i
    print('!', k, best, flush=True)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: i is 3, n is greater than 3, res is an input string, and if res equals '<', then best is 3.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `best` is `n-1`, `i` is `n`, `n` must be at least 2, `k` is `n-1`, and `res` is an input string.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is `n`, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, and `best` is `n-1` if `res` is equal to '<' for each iteration from 1 to `n-1`. Otherwise, the value of `best` remains 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
