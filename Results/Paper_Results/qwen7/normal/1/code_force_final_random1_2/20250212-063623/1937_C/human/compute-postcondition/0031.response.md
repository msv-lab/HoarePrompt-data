Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.
2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `n`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is greater than 1
   - `res` is an input string (this variable is not part of the loop head)
   - `best` is 1 if the current value of `res` is equal to '<' (this variable is not part of the loop head)

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1 and `n` is greater than 1, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will become 2.
   - The condition for `n` remains the same; it must still be greater than 1.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be updated to 2.
   - `n` remains unchanged and must still be greater than 1.

6. **Final state**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` must be greater than 1

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1**
