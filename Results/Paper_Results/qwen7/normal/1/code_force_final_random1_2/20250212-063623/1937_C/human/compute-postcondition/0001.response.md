Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The variable `t` remains unchanged and still must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is not defined in the code, so its state remains unchanged. The output state includes the updated value of `n` and the unchanged conditions and values of `t` and `_`.
