Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Postcondition: `tmp` is 1000000000, `d` is a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, `processing` is a list of length equal to the maximum key in `d`, containing only 0s and 1s indicating whether a node has been processed, `da` is an integer representing a key in the dictionary `d`, `rank` is a list of integers with the same length as the maximum key in `d`, initialized to 0s, and the length of `d[da]` is not equal to 1.
Code of the loop:
for di in d[da]:
    if processing[di - 1] == 0:
        processing[di - 1] = 1
        tmp = min(tmp, func_12(d, processing, di, rank))
        processing[di - 1] = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `d[da]` must have at least one element. If `processing[di - 1]` is 0, then `tmp` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and the result of `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)`. Since there is no else part, `tmp` remains unchanged if `processing[di - 1]` is not 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `da` remains the same, `di` is incremented by 1, `processing[di - 2]` is 1, `tmp` is assigned the minimum value between `tmp` and `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)`, and `processing[di - 1]` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `da` remains the same, `di` is incremented by 1, `processing[di - 2]` is 1, `processing[di - 1]` is 0, and `tmp` is updated to be the minimum value between its original value and `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
