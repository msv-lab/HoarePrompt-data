### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the given program and the problem statement step-by-step to determine if the provided solution is correct.

#### Problem Statement Recap
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
- \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Given Code Recap
The code contains several functions, but the relevant ones are:
1. **`func_10()`**: Reads an integer from stdin.
2. **`func_15()`**: This function seems to be the main logic for calculating the number of valid pairs.
3. **`func_16()`**: This function reads the number of test cases and calls `func_15()` for each test case.

#### Function `func_15()`
```python
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        i += 1
    return ans - 1
```

#### Explanation of `func_15()`
- It reads \(n\) and \(m\) using `func_7()`.
- It initializes `ans` to 0.
- It iterates over `i` starting from 1 up to \(\sqrt{n + i}\).
- For each `i`, it adds \((n + i) // (i * i)\) to `ans`.
- Finally, it returns `ans - 1`.

### Correctness Check
To verify the correctness, let's compare the logic of `func_15()` with the problem requirements.

#### Problem Requirements
- We need to count pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Implementation Analysis
- The current implementation in `func_15()` does not check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- Instead, it counts the number of integers \(i\) such that \(i \leq \sqrt{n + i}\) and adds \((n + i) // (i * i)\) to `ans`.

This logic does not align with the problem requirements. Specifically, it does not account for the condition involving the greatest common divisor (\(\gcd\)) and the divisibility requirement.

### Conclusion
The provided function `func_15()` does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
