Output State: The loop will execute exactly `func_10()` times, which from the given information seems to decrease by 1 with each iteration starting from a value greater than 2. Each time the loop runs, it prints the value returned by `func_15()`, which is a positive integer. The specific values printed depend on what `func_15()` returns, but they will be different each time and follow the pattern described.

In more detail, if we denote the initial value returned by `func_10()` as \( k \) (where \( k > 2 \)), then the loop will run \( k \) times. On the first iteration, `func_15()` returns a positive integer, say \( x_1 \). On the second iteration, `func_15()` returns a positive integer, say \( x_2 \), which is different from \( x_1 \) and follows the pattern described. This continues until the \( k \)-th iteration, where `func_15()` returns another positive integer, say \( x_k \), which is different from all previous \( x_i \).

Each \( x_i \) is printed followed by a newline character. Therefore, the final output state will consist of \( k \) lines, each containing a distinct positive integer printed by `func_15()` during the respective iteration of the loop.
