You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6.
def func_15():
    n, m = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        
        i += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `ans` is 5, `i` is 4, `n` must be greater than or equal to 0.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be 4 because it starts at 1 and increments by 1 each iteration. The loop continues as long as `i * i <= n + i`. After 3 iterations, `i` is 3, so for the loop to continue, we need `(3 + 1) * (3 + 1) <= n + (3 + 1)`, which simplifies to `16 <= n + 4` or `n >= 12`. 
    #
    #For the fourth iteration, the condition becomes `4 * 4 <= n + 4`, which simplifies to `16 <= n + 4` or again `n >= 12`. If `n` meets this condition, `ans` will be incremented by `(n + 4) // (4 * 4)`. Assuming `n` is at least 12, `(n + 4) // 16` will be 1 (since `n + 4` is at least 16), thus `ans` increases by 1. Therefore, `ans` will be 1 (from the first iteration) + 1 (from the second iteration) + 1 (from the third iteration) + 1 (from the fourth iteration) = 5. The value of `i` will be 4 after the loop completes.
    return ans - 1
    #The program returns 4
#Overall this is what the function does: The function does not accept any parameters and returns the integer 4.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns 4


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
