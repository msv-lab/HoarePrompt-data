Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to calculate the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
- \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Given Code Analysis
The code provided contains many functions, but most of them are not used in solving the problem. We need to focus on the functions that are relevant to solving the problem.

#### Relevant Functions
1. **`func_10()`**: Reads an integer from stdin.
2. **`func_15()`**: This function seems to be the main logic for calculating the number of valid pairs.
3. **`func_16()`**: This function reads the number of test cases and calls `func_15()` for each test case.

### Function `func_15()`
```python
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        i += 1
    return ans - 1
```

#### Explanation
- It reads \(n\) and \(m\) using `func_7()`.
- It initializes `ans` to 0.
- It iterates over `i` starting from 1 up to \(\sqrt{n + i}\).
- For each `i`, it adds \((n + i) // (i * i)\) to `ans`.
- Finally, it returns `ans - 1`.

### Correctness Check
To check the correctness of `func_15()`, let's compare its logic with the problem statement.

#### Problem Requirements
- We need to count pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Implementation Analysis
- The current implementation does not seem to directly address the problem requirements.
- The logic in `func_15()` does not involve checking the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- Instead, it seems to be counting something related to divisors or multiples, which is not aligned with the problem statement.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the provided function `func_15()` does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **False**
