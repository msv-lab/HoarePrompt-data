The function `func_13` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b`, both satisfying \(1 \leq a \leq n\) and \(1 \leq b \leq m\). It returns three values: either `x` which is 1, `y` which is 0, and `a` which is a positive integer within the given range, or `y`, `x - a // b * y`, and `g`, where `y`, `x`, and `g` are the results of a recursive call to `func_13` with arguments `b` and `a % b`.
