Output State: **`ans` is increased by `(n + i) // (i * i)`, `i` is increased by 1, and `n` must be adjusted such that `(i + 1) * (i + 1) <= n + (i + 1)`**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. The conditions and values of `ans` and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes that `i` is increased by 1, while the conditions and values of `ans` and `n` stay the same as per the initial state.
