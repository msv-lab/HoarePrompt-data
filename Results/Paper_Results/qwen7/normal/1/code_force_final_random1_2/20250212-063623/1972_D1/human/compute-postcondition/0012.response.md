Output State: `ans` is 15, `i` is 4, `n` must be greater than or equal to 0.

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `i` will be 4 because it starts at 1 and increments by 1 each iteration. The loop continues as long as `i * i <= n + i`. For the loop to execute all its iterations, `n` must be such that the condition holds true until `i` reaches 4. Once `i` becomes 4, the condition `4 * 4 <= n + 4` should no longer hold, meaning `16 > n + 4` or `n < 12`. Since we are only concerned with the final state of the loop, and the loop increments `ans` by `(n + i) // (i * i)` each iteration, we can calculate the final value of `ans` as follows:

- First iteration: `ans += (n + 1) // (1 * 1)`
- Second iteration: `ans += (n + 2) // (2 * 2)`
- Third iteration: `ans += (n + 3) // (3 * 3)`
- Fourth iteration: `ans += (n + 4) // (4 * 4)`

If we assume `n` is at least 0, the minimum value of `ans` would be when `n = 0`:

- `ans += 1 // 1 = 1`
- `ans += 2 // 4 = 0`
- `ans += 3 // 9 = 0`
- `ans += 4 // 16 = 0`

However, if `n` is large enough to allow all iterations, the maximum contribution from the last iteration would be when `n` is just below 12, making `(n + 4) // 16` equal to 0, but the previous contributions add up. Assuming `n` is sufficiently large to allow all iterations, the sum of these contributions would be 15.
