Output State: **`da` remains the same, `di` is `di + 1`, `processing[di - 2]` is 1, `processing[di - 1]` is 0, `tmp` is the minimum value between `tmp` and `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)`**

Explanation: The code changes the value of `processing[di - 1]` from 1 to 0. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
