Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly solve the given problem. Specifically, the function `func_15` and the overall logic do not match the requirements of the problem statement. Here's why:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires counting ordered pairs `(a, b)` such that `1 ≤ a ≤ n`, `1 ≤ b ≤ m`, and `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

2. **Function `func_15` Analysis**: 
   - The function `func_15` calculates a value using a loop but does not implement the logic required to count the valid pairs `(a, b)`.
   - It increments `ans` by `(n + i) // (i * i)` which seems unrelated to the problem constraints.

3. **Missing Core Logic**: The core logic to check the condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` is missing. This involves calculating the greatest common divisor (gcd) for each pair `(a, b)` and checking the condition.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem, you need to iterate through all possible pairs `(a, b)` and check the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. Here’s a corrected version of the solution:

```python
from math import gcd

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

def main():
    t = func_10()
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = func_2()
        print(count_valid_pairs(n, m))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This approach iterates through all pairs `(a, b)` within the given ranges and checks the condition directly. This ensures correctness according to the problem statement.
