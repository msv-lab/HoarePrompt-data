Output State: **`sys.stdout.write` writes the value returned by `func_15()` followed by a newline character. The value written is a positive integer greater than 1, which is the same as the value returned by `func_10()` initially.**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')` writes the string representation of the value returned by `func_15()` followed by a newline character to the standard output. Since `func_10()` returns a positive integer greater than 1, and there's no indication that `func_15()` returns a different value, we assume `func_15()` also returns a positive integer greater than 1. Therefore, `sys.stdout.write` will write a positive integer greater than 1 to the standard output.
