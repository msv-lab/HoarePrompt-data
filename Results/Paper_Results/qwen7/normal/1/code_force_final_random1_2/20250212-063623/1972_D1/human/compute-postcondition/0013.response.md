Output State: `ans` is 5, `i` is 4, `n` must be greater than or equal to 0.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be 4 because it starts at 1 and increments by 1 each iteration. The loop continues as long as `i * i <= n + i`. After 3 iterations, `i` is 3, so for the loop to continue, we need `(3 + 1) * (3 + 1) <= n + (3 + 1)`, which simplifies to `16 <= n + 4` or `n >= 12`. 

For the fourth iteration, the condition becomes `4 * 4 <= n + 4`, which simplifies to `16 <= n + 4` or again `n >= 12`. If `n` meets this condition, `ans` will be incremented by `(n + 4) // (4 * 4)`. Assuming `n` is at least 12, `(n + 4) // 16` will be 1 (since `n + 4` is at least 16), thus `ans` increases by 1. Therefore, `ans` will be 1 (from the first iteration) + 1 (from the second iteration) + 1 (from the third iteration) + 1 (from the fourth iteration) = 5. The value of `i` will be 4 after the loop completes.
