Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is the first integer from the input split by space, `b` is the second integer from the input split by space, `i` is `i + 1`, and the integer input from `int(input())` remains the same.**

Explanation: The code splits the input into two integers `a` and `b`. It also increments `i` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
