Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, a and b are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    a, b = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
        print('yes')
    elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):
        print('no')
    elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:
        print('yes')
    else:
        print('no')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is the first integer input split from the input string, and `b` is the second integer input split from the input string. If both `a` and `b` are even, then the difference between `a` and `b` is divisible by 2. If at least one of `a` or `b` is odd, or if the conditions for the difference being divisible by 2 are not met, then the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is the negative of the larger number.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is the first integer from the input split by space, `b` is the second integer from the input split by space, `i` is incremented by 1, and the integer input from `int(input())` remains the same, regardless of whether `a` and `b` are both even or not.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is the first integer from the input split by space, `b` is the second integer from the input split by space, `i` is `i + 1`, and the integer input from `int(input())` remains the same, regardless of whether `a` and `b` are both even or not.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
