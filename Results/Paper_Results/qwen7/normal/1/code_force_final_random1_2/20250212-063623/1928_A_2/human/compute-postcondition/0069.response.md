Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t < 10^4\), `a` is the integer entered first after the space, `b` is the integer entered second after the space, and if either `a` or `b` is even, `a` and `b` are divided by 2 repeatedly until `b` equals `a`, at which point the function terminates with the updated values of `a` and `b`. If neither `a` nor `b` is even, `a` and `b` retain their original values.**
