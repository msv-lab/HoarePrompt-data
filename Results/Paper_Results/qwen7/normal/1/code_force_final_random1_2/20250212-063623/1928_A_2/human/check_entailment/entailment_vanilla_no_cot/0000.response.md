Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if Bob can obtain another rectangle. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Conditions for Printing 'yes' and 'no':**
   - The condition `if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:` checks if both dimensions are even. If they are, it prints 'yes', which is incorrect according to the problem statement. For example, a 2x2 rectangle can be cut into two 1x2 rectangles, but the current logic would incorrectly print 'yes'.
   
   - The condition `elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):` is incorrect and will always evaluate to `False` due to the tuple creation `(a - b == -a, a)` and `(b - a == -b, b)`. It should check if either dimension minus the other results in an odd value.
   
   - The condition `elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:` is redundant and incorrect. The modulus operation `%` will never return a negative value, so `(a - b) % 2 < 0` is always `False`.

2. **Lack of Proper Logic:**
   - The program needs to check if the original rectangle can be split into two smaller rectangles such that those smaller rectangles can be rearranged to form a new distinct rectangle.
   - A more appropriate approach would be to check if either dimension is divisible by the other, or if the difference between the dimensions is odd, as this would allow forming a new rectangle.

### Correct Implementation:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        if a == b:
            print('No')
        elif a % b == 0 or b % a == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')

func()
```

This implementation checks if the dimensions are equal (in which case no new rectangle can be formed), or if one dimension is a multiple of the other (which allows forming a new rectangle).
