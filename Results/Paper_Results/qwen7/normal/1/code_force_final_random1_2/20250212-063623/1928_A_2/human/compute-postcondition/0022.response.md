Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is the first integer input split from the input string, and `b` is the second integer input split from the input string. If both `a` and `b` are even, then the difference between `a` and `b` is divisible by 2. If at least one of `a` or `b` is odd, or if the conditions for the difference being divisible by 2 are not met, then the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is the negative of the larger number.
