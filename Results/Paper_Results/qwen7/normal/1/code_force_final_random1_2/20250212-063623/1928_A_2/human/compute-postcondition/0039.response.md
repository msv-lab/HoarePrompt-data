Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is the first integer from the input split by space, `b` is the second integer from the input split by space, `i` is `i + 1`, and the integer input from `int(input())` remains the same.**

This postcondition remains the same for both the if and else parts since both parts do not change the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `i`, or the integer input from `int(input())`. Therefore, the overall postcondition is simply the combination of the preconditions provided for both parts.
