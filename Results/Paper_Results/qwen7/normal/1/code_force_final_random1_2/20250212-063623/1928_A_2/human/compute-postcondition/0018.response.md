Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is the first integer input split from the input string, `b` is the second integer input split from the input string, and both `a` and `b` are even. If the difference between `a` and `b` is not divisible by 2, the postcondition remains as the one specified in the if part. Otherwise, the difference between `a` and `b` is divisible by 2.
