Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `a` is the first integer from the input split by space.
- `b` is the second integer from the input split by space.
- `i` is `i + 1`, but since `i` is not explicitly defined, it is not relevant to the print statement.
- The integer input from `int(input())` remains the same.

The print statement is:
```python
print('no')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'no'`.

Output: **no**
