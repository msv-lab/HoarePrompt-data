Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `a` is the first integer input split from the input string.
- `b` is the second integer input split from the input string.
- At least one of `a` or `b` is odd.
- The absolute difference between `a` and `b` is equal to the negative of the larger number.

Given the print statement:
```python
print('no')
```

The output of this print statement is directly specified within the quotes. It does not depend on the values of `a`, `b`, or any other variables.

Output: **no**
