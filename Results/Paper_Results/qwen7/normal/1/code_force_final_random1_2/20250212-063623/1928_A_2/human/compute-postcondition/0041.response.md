Output State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and for each test case, `a` and `b` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\). The value of `i` will be equal to `t` since the loop runs `t` times. For each iteration, the program reads a line with two integers `a` and `b`, and prints either 'yes' or 'no' based on the given conditions. After all iterations, the output consists of `t` lines, each containing either 'yes' or 'no' depending on the inputs provided for each test case.**

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the final output will consist of `t` lines, where each line corresponds to the result ('yes' or 'no') of processing each pair of integers `(a, b)` according to the specified conditions in the loop body.
