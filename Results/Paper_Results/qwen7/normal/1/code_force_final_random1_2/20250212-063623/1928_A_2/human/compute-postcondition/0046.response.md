Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `a` is the integer entered first after the space.
- `b` is the integer entered second after the space.
- If `b` is even, `b` is divided by 2, resulting in `b1` and `b2`, where `b1` and `b2` are equal.
- If `b1` (which is `b // 2`) is not equal to `a`, the condition holds as is.

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('No')
```

This print statement does not depend on any of the variables `a`, `b`, `b1`, `b2`, or `t`. It directly prints the string `'No'`.

Output: **No**
