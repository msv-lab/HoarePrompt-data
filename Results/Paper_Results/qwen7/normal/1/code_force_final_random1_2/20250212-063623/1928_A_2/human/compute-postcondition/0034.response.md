Output: **yes**

Explanation: The initial state provides us with the following information:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `a` is the first integer from the input split by space.
- `b` is the second integer from the input split by space.
- `i` is `i + 1`, but since `i` is not explicitly defined, it does not affect the output.
- The integer input from `int(input())` remains the same, but this input is not used in the print statement.

The print statement simply outputs the string `'yes'`, regardless of the values of `a`, `b`, `i`, or any other variables. Therefore, the output is **yes**.
