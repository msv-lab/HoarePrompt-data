Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `a` is the first integer input split from the input string.
- `b` is the second integer input split from the input string.
- Both `a` and `b` are even.
- \((a - b) \% 2 == 0\).

The print statement is simply `print('no')`.

Since the print statement directly outputs the string `'no'`, regardless of the values of `a`, `b`, and `t`, the output will be exactly that string.

Output: **no**
