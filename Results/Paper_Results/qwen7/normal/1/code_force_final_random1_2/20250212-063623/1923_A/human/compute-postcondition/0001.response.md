State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop `for _ in range(t):` depends on the value of `t`.
2. The loop will execute if `t` is a positive integer.
3. Given the constraint `1 ≤ t ≤ 1000`, `t` must be within this range for the loop to execute.
4. Since `_` is just a placeholder and does not affect the loop condition, no adjustments are needed for it.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t` to ensure it meets the condition for the loop to execute.
