Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. Each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, followed by an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) indicating the number of cells, and then a list of n integers (each either 0 or 1) indicating whether each cell is free (0) or contains a chip (1). The function returns the index of the first cell containing a chip for each test case, or an error message if no cell contains a chip.**
