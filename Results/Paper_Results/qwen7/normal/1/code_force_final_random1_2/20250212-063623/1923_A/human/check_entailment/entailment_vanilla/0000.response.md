Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` representing the number of cells.
   - It then reads a string of `n` characters (either '0' or '1') representing the state of the cells, where '1' indicates a chip and '0' indicates a free cell.

2. **Finding Chip Positions:**
   - The program converts the input string into a single string using `''.join(input('').split())`.
   - This conversion is unnecessary because the split operation will not change the string since there are no spaces in the input.
   - The program then finds the index of the first '1' (`x`) and the index of the last '1' when reversed (`y`).
   - It calculates the substring `z` between these indices.

3. **Counting Free Cells:**
   - The program counts the number of '0's in the substring `z` using `z.count('0')`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the count of free cells in the substring `z`.

### Issues with the Program:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Minimum Operations:**
   - The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to move all chips into a single block.
   - The logic for finding the positions of the first and last '1' and counting the free cells in between is flawed. This approach does not account for the need to move chips to the leftmost possible position to form a single block.

2. **Handling Test Cases:**
   - The program should handle multiple test cases as specified, but the current implementation only processes one test case per call to `func()`.

### Correct Approach:

To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
- Identify the leftmost and rightmost chips.
- Calculate the distance each chip needs to be moved to the leftmost chip.
- Sum these distances to get the minimum number of operations.

### Corrected Program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = input()
        leftmost_chip = None
        rightmost_chip = None
        
        for i, cell in enumerate(arr):
            if cell == '1':
                if leftmost_chip is None:
                    leftmost_chip = i
                rightmost_chip = i
        
        # Calculate the minimum number of operations
        min_operations = 0
        for i, cell in enumerate(arr):
            if cell == '1' and i > leftmost_chip:
                min_operations += i - leftmost_chip - 1
        
        print(min_operations)

# Example usage
func()
```

### Conclusion:

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to move all chips into a single block. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
