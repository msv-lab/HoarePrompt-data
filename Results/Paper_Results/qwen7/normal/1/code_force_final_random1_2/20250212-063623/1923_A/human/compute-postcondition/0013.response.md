Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 999, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the input string with spaces removed, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`, or -1 if '1' is not found, `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in `arr` when read from the end, `z` is a substring of `arr` starting from index `x` and ending at index `n - y - 1` (if `x` and `y` are valid indices), `z` is updated to `arr[x:n - y]`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `z` to be a substring of `arr` starting from the index of the first occurrence of '1' (`x`) and ending at the index `n - y - 1`. The values of `t`, `n`, `arr`, `x`, `y`, and `z` remain otherwise unchanged. If `x` and `y` are valid indices, `z` will be the substring accordingly. If '1' is not found, `x` will remain -1, and `z` will be an empty string.
