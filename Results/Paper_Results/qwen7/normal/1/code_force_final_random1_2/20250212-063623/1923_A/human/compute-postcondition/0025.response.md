Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer t (number of test cases), an integer n (number of cells), and a sequence of n binary values indicating whether each cell is free (0) or contains a chip (1). For each test case, it finds and counts the number of consecutive free cells between the first and last chip, printing the count of free cells. After processing all test cases, it outputs the counts for each case.**
