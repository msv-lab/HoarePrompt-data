Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50; the second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is either 0 or 1, indicating whether the i-th cell is free (0) or contains a chip (1); in each test case, at least one cell contains a chip.
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        
        arr = ''.join(input('').split())
        
        x = arr.find('1')
        
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        
        print(z.count('0'))
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, `n` is the integer input by the user for each iteration, `arr` is the input string with spaces removed for each iteration, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found for each iteration, `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in the reversed string `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found for each iteration, `z` is the substring from `arr` starting at index `x` and ending at index `n - y - 1` if `x` is not -1 and `n - y - 1` is within the bounds of `arr`, otherwise `z` remains unchanged for each iteration.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will be reduced to 0 because it starts as an input integer `t` and decreases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0. For each of the `t` inputs, the variables `n`, `arr`, `x`, `y`, and `z` will be set based on the specific input for that iteration. The final state will reflect the processing of all `t` inputs through the loop, with `t` being 0 and all other variables reflecting their last computed values from the respective iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer t (number of test cases), an integer n (number of cells), and a sequence of n binary values indicating whether each cell is free (0) or contains a chip (1). For each test case, it finds and counts the number of consecutive free cells between the first and last chip, printing the count of free cells. After processing all test cases, it outputs the counts for each case.
