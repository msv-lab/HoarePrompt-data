You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50; the second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is either 0 or 1, indicating whether the i-th cell is free (0) or contains a chip (1); in each test case, at least one cell contains a chip.
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        
        arr = ''.join(input('').split())
        
        x = arr.find('1')
        
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        
        print(z.count('0'))
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, `n` is the integer input by the user for each iteration, `arr` is the input string with spaces removed for each iteration, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found for each iteration, `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in the reversed string `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found for each iteration, `z` is the substring from `arr` starting at index `x` and ending at index `n - y - 1` if `x` is not -1 and `n - y - 1` is within the bounds of `arr`, otherwise `z` remains unchanged for each iteration.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will be reduced to 0 because it starts as an input integer `t` and decreases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0. For each of the `t` inputs, the variables `n`, `arr`, `x`, `y`, and `z` will be set based on the specific input for that iteration. The final state will reflect the processing of all `t` inputs through the loop, with `t` being 0 and all other variables reflecting their last computed values from the respective iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. Each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, followed by an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) indicating the number of cells, and then a list of n integers (each either 0 or 1) indicating whether each cell is free (0) or contains a chip (1). The function returns the index of the first cell containing a chip for each test case, or an error message if no cell contains a chip.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
