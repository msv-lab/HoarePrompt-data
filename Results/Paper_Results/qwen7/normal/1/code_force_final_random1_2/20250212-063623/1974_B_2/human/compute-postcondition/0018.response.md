Postcondition: `i` is either 1 or 2, `j` is either `len(unique_chars)` or `len(unique_chars) + 1`, `s` is modified such that if `char` is in `unique_chars`, the first character of `s` is replaced by the last character in `unique_chars`; otherwise, `char` is inserted into `unique_chars` at index 1, and `s` is modified accordingly.
