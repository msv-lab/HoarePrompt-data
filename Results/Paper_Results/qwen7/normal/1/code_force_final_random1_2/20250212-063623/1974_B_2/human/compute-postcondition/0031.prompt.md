You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The string s represents the result of encoding some original string using the specified algorithm, and the length of s is at least 1.
def func_1(s):
    unique_chars = sorted(list({char for char in s}))
    i, j = 0, len(unique_chars) - 1
    for char in s:
        if char in unique_chars:
            s = s.replace(char, unique_chars[j])
            j -= 1
        else:
            unique_chars.insert(i, char)
            i += 1
            j += 1
        
    #State: The loop will continue until all characters in `s` have been processed or `j` becomes less than 0. After all iterations, `i` will be equal to the number of unique characters in `s` (or 1 if there are no unique characters), `j` will be equal to `len(unique_chars)`, and `s` will be modified such that any character in `s` that exists in `unique_chars` will be replaced according to the last value of `j` before the replacement operation. Characters not in `unique_chars` will be inserted into `unique_chars` at the correct position, and `j` will be adjusted accordingly.
    return ''.join(unique_chars)
    #The program returns a string where each character in the original string `s` that exists in `unique_chars` is replaced by the corresponding character from `unique_chars` based on its last occurrence index, and characters not in `unique_chars` are inserted into `unique_chars` at their correct positions with `j` being set to the length of `unique_chars`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `s`, which is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It returns a new string where each character in `s` that exists in `unique_chars` is replaced by the corresponding character from `unique_chars` based on its last occurrence index, and characters not in `unique_chars` are inserted into `unique_chars` at their correct positions with `j` being set to the length of `unique_chars`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a string where each character in the original string `s` that exists in `unique_chars` is replaced by the corresponding character from `unique_chars` based on its last occurrence index, and characters not in `unique_chars` are inserted into `unique_chars` at their correct positions with `j` being set to the length of `unique_chars`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
