Postcondition: `i` is either 1, 2, or 3; `j` is either `len(unique_chars) - 1`, `len(unique_chars)`, `len(unique_chars) + 1`, or `len(unique_chars) + 2`; the first character of `s` is replaced by `unique_chars[j]` if `char` is in `unique_chars`. Otherwise, `unique_chars` is updated to insert `char` at index `i`, and `j` is increased by 1.
