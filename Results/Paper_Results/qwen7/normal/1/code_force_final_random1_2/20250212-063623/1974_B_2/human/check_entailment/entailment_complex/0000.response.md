Reasoning:
The given program does not correctly implement the decoding algorithm. Here's why:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1` is intended to decode the string `s` back to the original string. However, the logic inside the function does not correctly decode the string.

2. **Logic Analysis**:
   - The function first creates a list of unique characters in `s` and sorts them alphabetically.
   - It then iterates through each character in `s`, replacing it with the corresponding character from the sorted list based on the last occurrence index of the character in `s`.
   - This approach is flawed because it does not correctly handle the decoding process. Specifically, the function does not maintain the correct mapping between the encoded and decoded characters.

3. **Correct Decoding Approach**:
   - To decode, we need to create an auxiliary string `r` which consists of all distinct letters of the string `s` in alphabetical order.
   - Then, for each character in the encoded string `b`, we should replace it with the character from `r` that is symmetrically opposite to it (i.e., the first character in `r` should map to the last character in `r`, the second character in `r` should map to the second last character in `r`, and so on).

4. **Correct Implementation**:
   - We need to construct the auxiliary string `r` and then use a dictionary to map each character in `b` to its corresponding character in `r`.

Given these points, the provided function does not correctly implement the decoding logic. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
