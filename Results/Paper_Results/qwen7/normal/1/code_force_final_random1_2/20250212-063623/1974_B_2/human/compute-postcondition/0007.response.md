Output State: **`i` is 0; `j` is len(unique_chars) - 1; `char` is inserted into `unique_chars` at index `i`.**

Explanation: The code inserts the variable `char` into the list `unique_chars` at index `i`, which is 0. The value of `j` remains unchanged as it was initially set to `len(unique_chars) - 1`. The value of `s` and whether `char` is not in `unique_chars` remain unchanged as they were part of the initial conditions and not affected by the code.
