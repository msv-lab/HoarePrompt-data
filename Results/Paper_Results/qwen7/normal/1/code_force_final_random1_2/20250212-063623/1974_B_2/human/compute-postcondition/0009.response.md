Output State: **`i` is 1; `j` is len(unique_chars); `char` is inserted into `unique_chars` at index 0.**

Explanation: The variable `j` was initially set to `len(unique_chars) - 1`. After executing `j += 1`, `j` is now set to `len(unique_chars)`. The values of `i` and the insertion of `char` into `unique_chars` at index 0 remain unchanged.
