Output State: **`i` is either 2 or 3; `j` is either `len(unique_chars) + 1` or `len(unique_chars) + 2`; `unique_chars` is updated to insert `char` at index `i`, and `j` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The value of `j` is incremented by 1. Since `j` was originally either `len(unique_chars)` or `len(unique_chars) + 1`, after incrementing, `j` becomes either `len(unique_chars) + 1` or `len(unique_chars) + 2`. The values of `i` and `unique_chars` remain unchanged from their initial state.
