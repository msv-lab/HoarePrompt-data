Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is `len(unique_chars)`, `s` is modified such that the first character of `s` is replaced by the last character in `unique_chars`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `i` is set to 1.
- The variable `j` is set to `len(unique_chars)`.
- The code replaces the first occurrence of `char` in `s` with the character at index `j` in `unique_chars`. Since `j` is `len(unique_chars)`, it tries to replace `char` with the last character in `unique_chars`. If `char` is in `unique_chars`, the first character of `s` is replaced by the last character in `unique_chars`. If `char` is not in `unique_chars`, it is inserted at index 0, and `i` would be set to 1 and `j` to `len(unique_chars)`, which is already the case here.
