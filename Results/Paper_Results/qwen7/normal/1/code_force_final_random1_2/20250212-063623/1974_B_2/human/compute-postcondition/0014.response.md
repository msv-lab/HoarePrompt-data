Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is `len(unique_chars) - 1`, `s` is modified such that the first character of `s` is replaced by the last character in `unique_chars`.**

Explanation: The value of `j` is decremented by 1, so `j` becomes `len(unique_chars) - 1`. The values of `i` and the modification to `s` remain unchanged from the initial state.
