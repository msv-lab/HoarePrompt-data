Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `m` is an input integer, `i` will be `0`, `n` will be greater than 2, `d2[0]` will be the final value determined by the loop based on the comparisons of differences between consecutive elements in the list `l`. Specifically, `d2[0]` is updated iteratively from `d2[n-1]` down to `d2[0]` according to the rule: if the difference between `l[i]` and `l[i - 1]` is less than the difference between `l[i + 1]` and `l[i]`, then `d2[i]` is set to `1 + d2[i + 1]`; otherwise, `d2[i]` is set to `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(m):
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    if y > x:
        print(d1[y] - d1[x])
    else:
        print(d2[y] - d2[x])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `j` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is an input integer, and `y` is an input integer. If `y` is greater than `x`, then no changes are made to `j` and `m`. If `y` is less than or equal to `x`, then no changes are made to `j` and `m`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an integer obtained from splitting the input and converting it to an integer. The value of `y` remains unchanged regardless of whether the condition `y > x` is true or false.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `j` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
