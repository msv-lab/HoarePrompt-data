Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for j in range(m)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `j` and `m`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is 0
   - `m` is greater than or equal to 1
   - `x` is an input integer
   - `y` is an input integer
   - If `y` is greater than `x`, no changes are made to `j` and `m`.
   - If `y` is less than or equal to `x`, no changes are made to `j` and `m`.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `j < m`.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts at 0 and the loop increments `j` by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `j` would be 0 (if it just started) or some positive value if it had run for multiple iterations.
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must be less than `m`. Given that `m` is greater than or equal to 1, and assuming `j` was incremented by 1 in the previous iteration, `j` would now be 1.
   - Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be 1 and `m` must still be greater than or equal to 1.

5. **Construct the new state**:
   - `j` is now 1 (since it was incremented by 1 in the previous iteration).
   - `m` remains greater than or equal to 1.
   - `x` and `y` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

**Final State**:
State: **`j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer**
