Output State: **`i` is `n - 3`; `d2[i]` is `1 + d2[i + 1]`; `n` must be greater than 3**

Explanation: The code updates the dictionary `d2` such that the value at key `i` (where `i` is `n - 3`) is set to `1 + d2[i + 1]`. The initial value of `i` is `n - 3`, and the condition that `n` must be greater than 3 remains unchanged. The value of `d2[i + 1]` is not specified in the initial state, so it is left as `d2[i + 1]` in the output state.
