Given the initial state:
- `j` is 0
- `m` must be greater than or equal to 1
- `x` is an input integer
- `y` is an input integer
- `y` is less than or equal to `x`

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(d2[y] - d2[x])`.

From the initial state, we know:
- `x` and `y` are input integers where `y <= x`.
- `d2` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its exact form or contents.

However, since `d2[y]` and `d2[x]` are elements of `d2`, and we only know the relationship between `x` and `y`, we can describe the output in terms of these elements.

Output: **d2[y] - d2[x]** (where `d2[y]` and `d2[x]` are elements of the list `d2` with indices `y` and `x` respectively, and `y <= x`)
