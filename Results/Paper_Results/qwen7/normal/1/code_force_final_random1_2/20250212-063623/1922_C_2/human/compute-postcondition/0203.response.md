Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is explicitly given as 2.
- `m` is greater than or equal to 1, but its exact value is not needed to determine the output of the print statement.
- `x` is an input integer.
- `y` is an input integer.
- `d2` is a dictionary, but its contents are not specified.

The print statement is:
```python
print(d2[y] - d2[x])
```

To determine what will be printed, we need to evaluate the expression `d2[y] - d2[x]`.

Since `d2` is a dictionary and its contents are not specified, we cannot determine the exact numerical values of `d2[x]` and `d2[y]`. Therefore, the output will be a difference between the values associated with keys `y` and `x` in the dictionary `d2`.

Output: **d2[y] - d2[x]** (where `d2[y]` and `d2[x]` are the values associated with keys `y` and `x` in the dictionary `d2`, respectively)
