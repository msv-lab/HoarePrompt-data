Output State: **The loop has executed all its iterations, with `j` being equal to `m-1`. `m` remains greater than or equal to 1. `x` and `y` are the last pair of integers inputted by the user during the loop's final iteration.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `j` will be equal to the initial value of `m` minus one. The value of `m` will still be at least 1. The variables `x` and `y` will hold the values of the last two integers that were inputted when the loop was running for the last time.
