Given the initial state:
- `j` is 2
- `m` is an input integer
- `x` is an integer from the input split
- `y` is an integer from the input split

The code snippet is:
```python
print(d2[y] - d2[x])
```

Here, `d2` is a dictionary, and `x` and `y` are keys from this dictionary. The expression `d2[y] - d2[x]` calculates the difference between the values associated with keys `y` and `x` in the dictionary `d2`.

Since the exact values of `d2[y]` and `d2[x]` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical result. However, we know that the output will be the difference between the values of `d2[y]` and `d2[x]`.

Output: **d2[y] - d2[x]**
