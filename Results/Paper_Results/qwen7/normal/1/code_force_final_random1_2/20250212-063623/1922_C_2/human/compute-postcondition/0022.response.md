Postcondition: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 4, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`, and `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`. If `l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]`, then `d1[i + 2]` is set to `1 + d1[i + 1]`. Otherwise, `d1[i + 2]` is updated to `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]`, and `d2` remains unchanged.**
