Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer. These integers are then stored in the list `l`. The variable `n` remains unchanged from its initial state as an input integer.
