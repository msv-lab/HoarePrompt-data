Output State: **`i` is 2 or 3; `d1[4]` is 2 (since `d1[i + 2] = 1 + d1[i + 1]` and `d1[3]` is 1); `n` must be greater than 1; `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer; `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `d1[i + 2]` to `1 + d1[i + 1]`. Given that `i` is either 2 or 3, if `i` is 2, then `d1[4]` is calculated as `1 + d1[3]`, which is `1 + 1 = 2`. If `i` is 3, then `d1[5]` would be calculated, but since no such entry exists initially, it is not updated. The other variables (`n`, `l`, and `d2`) remain unchanged.
