Output State: **`m` is an input integer, `j` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated inputs from the user and converts them to integers. These values are then assigned to `x` and `y`. The initial value of `m` and `j` remains unchanged. Therefore, `m` is still an input integer, `j` is still 0, and now `x` and `y` are the input integers provided by the user.
