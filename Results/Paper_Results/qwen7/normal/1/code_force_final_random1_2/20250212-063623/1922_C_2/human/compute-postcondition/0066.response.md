Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and it is initialized using `range(int(input()))`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than the value generated by `int(input())`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is equal to `m-1`
   - `m` is greater than `m-1`
   - `x` and `y` are input integers, and their values remain unchanged after all iterations.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented within the loop, the value of `i` at the start of the next iteration will be `i + 1`.
   - The value of `m` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop.
   - The values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged as per the given information.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `j` will be `m-1` (unchanged).
   - `m` will still be greater than `m-1` (unchanged).
   - `x` and `y` will remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

6. **Determine the new value of `i`**:
   - Let's assume `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`j` is equal to `m-1`, `m` is greater than `m-1`, `x` and `y` are input integers, and `i` is `k + 1`**.

Since `k` is not explicitly given, we can represent it as `i + 1` where `i` is the current value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration.

Final Answer:
State: **`j` is equal to `m-1`, `m` is greater than `m-1`, `x` and `y` are input integers, and `i` is `i + 1`**.
