Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10000, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`.**

Explanation: The code initializes `d2` as a `defaultdict` with the default factory set to `int`. This means `d2` is now a dictionary where any key that does not exist will automatically have its value set to `0` (an integer). The values of `i`, `n`, `l`, and `d1` remain unchanged from their initial states.
