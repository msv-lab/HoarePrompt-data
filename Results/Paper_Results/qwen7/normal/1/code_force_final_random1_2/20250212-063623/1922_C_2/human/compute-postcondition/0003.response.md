Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10000, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`.**

Explanation: The code initializes `d1` as a `defaultdict` with the default factory set to `int`. This means that `d1` is a dictionary where any key that does not exist will default to an integer value (0). The values of `i`, `n`, and `l` remain unchanged from their initial states.
