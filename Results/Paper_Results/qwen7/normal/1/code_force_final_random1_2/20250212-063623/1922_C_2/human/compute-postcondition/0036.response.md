Output State: **`i` is `n-1` and `i` must be greater than or equal to 0; `d2[i]` is `1 + d2[i + 1]`.**

Explanation: The code updates `d2[i]` to be `1 + d2[i + 1]`. Since `i` is `n-1`, `i + 1` would be `n`, which is out of bounds for the list `d2` if `n-1` is the last valid index. However, the condition `i must be greater than or equal to 0` remains unchanged. Therefore, the only change is in `d2[i]`, which is now `1 + d2[i + 1]`. Given that `i + 1` is out of bounds, the exact value of `d2[i]` depends on the initial values of `d2` and the indices before `i`. But the key point is that `d2[i]` has been updated according to the given formula.
