Output State: **Postcondition: `m` is an input integer, `j` is equal to `m-1`, `x` and `y` are integers from the input split for each iteration of the loop. After all iterations, if for any iteration `y` is greater than `x`, `y` remains unchanged; otherwise, `y` also remains unchanged. The values of `d1` and `d2` are unchanged from their initial state.**

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `j` will be equal to `m-1`. The variables `x` and `y` will be the last integers split from the input during the last iteration of the loop. Since the loop does not modify `x` or `y` based on the comparison but rather prints the result of the comparison, the values of `x` and `y` will reflect the most recent inputs provided by the user. The values of `d1` and `d2` remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop.
