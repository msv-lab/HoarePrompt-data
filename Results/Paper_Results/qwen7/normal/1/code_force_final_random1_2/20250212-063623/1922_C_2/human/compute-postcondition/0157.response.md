Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 2, `d1[i + 2]` is equal to `1 + d1[i + 1]`**.

Given the initial state where `i` is 3 and `n` is greater than 2, the code `d1[i + 2] = 1 + d1[i + 1]` updates the dictionary `d1`. Since `i` is 3, `i + 2` equals 5 and `i + 1` equals 4. Therefore, `d1[5]` is set to `1 + d1[4]`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged, and the condition `n > 2` still holds true.
