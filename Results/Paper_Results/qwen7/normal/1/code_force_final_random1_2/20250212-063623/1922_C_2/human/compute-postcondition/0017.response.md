Postcondition: **`i` is either 2 or 3, `n` must be greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`. If `l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]`, then `d1[4]` is 2. Otherwise, `d1[4] = l[3] - l[2] + d1[3]`, and `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`.**
