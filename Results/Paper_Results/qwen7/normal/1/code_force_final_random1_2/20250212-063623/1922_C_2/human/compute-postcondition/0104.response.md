Output State: **`i` is `n - 3`, `d2[i]` is updated to `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`, `n` must be greater than 3**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `d2[i]` to `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`. Here, `i` is initially `n - 3`, so the value of `d2[n - 3]` is set to `l[n - 3] - l[n - 4] + d2[n - 2]`. The conditions and values of `n` and `i` are preserved, and only `d2[i]` is updated.
