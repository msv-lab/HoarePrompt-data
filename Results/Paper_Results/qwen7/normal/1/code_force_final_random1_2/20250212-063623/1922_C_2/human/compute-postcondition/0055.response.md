The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `m`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and `m` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `m`.

Since `j` starts at 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, for the loop to execute again, `j` must become 1. Therefore, `m` must remain greater than 1.

State: **`j` is 1, `m` is greater than 1**
