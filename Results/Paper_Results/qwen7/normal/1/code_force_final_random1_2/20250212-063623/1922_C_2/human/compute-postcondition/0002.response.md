Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10000, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `l` by taking input as a string, splitting it into individual elements, and converting each element to an integer using the `map` function. The original values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged. The new variable `l` is a list of integers derived from the input string.
