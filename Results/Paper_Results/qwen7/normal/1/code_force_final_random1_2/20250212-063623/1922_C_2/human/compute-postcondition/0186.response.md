Output State: **`j` is 0, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer**

The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated inputs from the user and converts them into integers, assigning the first input to `x` and the second input to `y`. The initial state of `j` and `m` remains unchanged.
