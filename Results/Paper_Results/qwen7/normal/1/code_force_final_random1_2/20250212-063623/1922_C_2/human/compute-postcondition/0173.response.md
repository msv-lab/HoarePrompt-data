Output State: **`i` is `n - 3`, `n` is at least 3, and `d2[i]` is `1 + d2[i + 1]`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `d2[i] = 1 + d2[i + 1]` updates the value of `d2[i]` to be `1 + d2[i + 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes the new value for `d2[i]` while keeping the values of `i` and `n` as they were initially.
