Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is 0.
- `m` must be greater than 0.
- `x` is an input integer.
- `y` is an input integer.
- The current value of `y` is greater than the current value of `x`.

The print statement is `print(d1[y] - d1[x])`.

From the initial state, we know that `d1` is not explicitly defined, but it is a dictionary. We need to determine the values of `d1[x]` and `d1[y]` to proceed. Since no specific values for `d1[x]` and `d1[y]` are given, we can only describe them in terms of their relationship with `x` and `y`.

Given that `y > x`, the difference `d1[y] - d1[x]` will be the value of `d1[y]` minus the value of `d1[x]`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **d1[y] - d1[x]**
