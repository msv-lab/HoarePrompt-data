Output State: **`j` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer**

The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated inputs from the user and converts them to integers, assigning them to `x` and `y` respectively. The values of `j` and `m` remain unchanged from their initial state.
