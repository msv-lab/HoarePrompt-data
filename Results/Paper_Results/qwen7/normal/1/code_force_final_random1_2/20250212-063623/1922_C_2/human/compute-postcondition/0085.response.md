Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given for loop is `for i in range(1, n - 1)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is within the range `1` to `n-2` (since `range(1, n-1)` generates values from 1 up to but not including `n-1`). 

3. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**: 
   - `i` is `i + 1 + 2`, meaning `i` has been incremented by 3.
   - `d1[i + 2]` is set based on a condition involving `l[i + 1]` and `l[i]`.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `l` is a list of integers.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` was incremented by 3, the new value of `i` will be the current value of `i` plus 3.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n-1`.
   - Therefore, the new value of `i` should be `current_i + 3`, and `n` must still be greater than 1.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` needs to be adjusted to `current_i + 3`.
   - `n` must remain greater than 1.

Given the above reasoning, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is `current_i + 3`, `n` must be greater than 1**.
