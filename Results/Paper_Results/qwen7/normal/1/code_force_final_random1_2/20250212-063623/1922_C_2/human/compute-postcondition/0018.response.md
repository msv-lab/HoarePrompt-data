Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is within the range `1` to `n-1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is either `2` or `3`.
   - `n` must be greater than `1`.
   - `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
   - `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`.
   - If `l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]`, then `d1[4]` is `2`. Otherwise, `d1[4] = l[3] - l[2] + d1[3]`.
   - `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`.

4. **Determine the new value of `i` for the next iteration**:
   - If `i` was `2` in the previous iteration, it will be incremented to `3` for the next iteration.
   - If `i` was `3` in the previous iteration, the loop will terminate because `i` will no longer be in the range `1` to `n-1`.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `i` will be incremented to `3` for the next iteration (assuming `i` was `2`), we need to set `i` to `3`.
   - `n` must still be greater than `1`.
   - The values of `l`, `d1`, and `d2` remain unchanged unless the loop body modifies them, but since the loop body is omitted, we assume they remain as they were.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`**.
