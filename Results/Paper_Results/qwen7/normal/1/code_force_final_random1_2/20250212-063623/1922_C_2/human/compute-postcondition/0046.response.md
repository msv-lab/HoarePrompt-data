Output State: **`m` is an input integer, `i` is 0, `d1[n]` is determined by the final condition of the loop, and `d2` is a defaultdict with its entries updated according to the loop's logic from `i = n-1` down to `i = 0`.**

Explanation: The code `m = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `m`. This changes the value of `m` to the input integer. The other variables (`i`, `d1`, and `d2`) remain unchanged from their initial states as described.
