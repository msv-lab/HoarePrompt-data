Given the initial state:
- `j` is 1
- `m` is an input integer
- `x` and `y` are integers from the input split

The code snippet is:
```python
print(d1[y] - d1[x])
```

To determine what will be printed, we need to understand the context of `d1`. Since `d1` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact form. However, we know that `d1` is a dictionary, and `x` and `y` are keys in this dictionary.

The expression `d1[y] - d1[x]` subtracts the value associated with key `y` from the value associated with key `x`.

Since the exact values of `d1[x]` and `d1[y]` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these values.

Output: **d1[y] - d1[x]**
