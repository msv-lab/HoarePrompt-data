Output State: **`d2[i]` is updated to 1 + `d2[i + 1]`, `i` is `n - 4`, `n` must be at least 3**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `d2[i]` to be `1 + d2[i + 1]`. Given that `i` was initially `n - 4`, this relationship remains unchanged. Additionally, the condition that `n` must be at least 3 is still valid.
