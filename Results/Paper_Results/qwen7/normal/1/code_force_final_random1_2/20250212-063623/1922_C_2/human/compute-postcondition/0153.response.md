Output State: **`i` is 2; `n` is greater than 2; `d1[i + 2]` is `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]`**

Explanation: The code updates the dictionary `d1` by setting the key `i + 2` (which is 4) to the value `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]`. Since `i` is 2, the updated value for `d1[4]` is `l[3] - l[2] + d1[3]`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged, and the list `l` is not defined or altered within the given code snippet.
