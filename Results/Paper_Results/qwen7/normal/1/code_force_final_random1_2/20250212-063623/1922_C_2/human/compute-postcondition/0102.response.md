Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `n-2` to `1` (inclusive) in reverse order, decrementing `i` by 1 each time.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `n - 2`
   - `n` must be greater than 3
   - The postcondition for the loop body execution is based on the values of `l[i]`, `l[i-1]`, and `l[i+1]`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop decrements `i` by 1, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `n - 3`.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop body.

5. **Postcondition for the next iteration**:
   - The postcondition will now apply to `i = n - 3`.
   - The condition checks the differences between the elements in the list `l` and updates `d2[i]` accordingly.

Given these points, let's formulate the new state:

- `i` will be `n - 3` because the loop decrements `i` by 1.
- `n` remains greater than 3 since it is not modified in the loop.
- The postcondition will now apply to `i = n - 3`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is `n - 3`, `n` must be greater than 3**.
