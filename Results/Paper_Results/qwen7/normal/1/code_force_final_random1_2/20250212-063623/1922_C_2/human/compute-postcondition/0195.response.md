Output State: **`j` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an integer obtained from splitting the input and converting it to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes an input from the user, splits it into two parts, and converts each part to an integer. The first part is assigned to `x`, and the second part is assigned to `y`. The values of `j` and `m` remain unchanged from their initial state.
