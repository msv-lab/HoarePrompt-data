Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`.**

Explanation: The code initializes a `defaultdict` named `d1` with the default factory set to `int`. This means that `d1` is a dictionary that returns `0` for any key that does not exist. The values of `n` and `l` remain unchanged from their initial state.
