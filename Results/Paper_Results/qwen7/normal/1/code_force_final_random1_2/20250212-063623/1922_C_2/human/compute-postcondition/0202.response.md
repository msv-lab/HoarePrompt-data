Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is explicitly given as 2.
- `m` is greater than or equal to 1 but no specific value is given.
- `x` is an input integer.
- `y` is an input integer.
- `d1` is a dictionary, but its contents are not specified.

Given these conditions, the expression `d1[y] - d1[x]` involves accessing keys `x` and `y` from the dictionary `d1`. Since the values of `d1[x]` and `d1[y]` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical result. However, we can describe the output in terms of the dictionary values.

Output: **d1[y] - d1[x]**
