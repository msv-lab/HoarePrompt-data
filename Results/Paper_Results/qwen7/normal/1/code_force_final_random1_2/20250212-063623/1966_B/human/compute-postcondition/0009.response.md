Output State: **`tc` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `gr` is a list containing three elements which are the input from the user, `i` is 2**

Explanation: The code `gr.append(input())` appends the result of `input()` to the list `gr`. Since `gr` initially contains two elements (which are the input from the user), after appending another input, `gr` now contains three elements. All other variables (`tc`, `n`, `m`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
