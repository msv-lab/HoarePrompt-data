Postcondition: **`j` is 1, `m` must be greater than 1, and `impossible` remains `False` if the first element of the first row in `gr` is not equal to the second element of the first row in `gr` or the last element of the last row in `gr` is not equal to the second last element of the last row in `gr`. Otherwise, `impossible` remains unchanged.**
