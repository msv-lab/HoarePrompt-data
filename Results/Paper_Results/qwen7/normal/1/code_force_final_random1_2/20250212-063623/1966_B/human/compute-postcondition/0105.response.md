Postcondition: ***`j` is `m-1`, `m` must be greater than 0, `impossible` is `False`, `ans` is 'NO', `n` must be greater than 0, the current value of `gr[i][0]` is not equal to `gr[i+1][0]` or the current value of `gr[i][m-1]` is not equal to `gr[i+1][m-1]`, `i` is `-1`.***

This postcondition summarizes the state of all variables after the execution of the if-else block. Given the precondition and the fact that the else part is not present, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition since the if condition does not change any of the variable states.
