Postcondition: `tc` is 2, `t` remains the same, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `m` remains the same, `gr` will contain exactly `n` elements, each being an input provided during the loop's execution, `i` will be `n-1` (the last index of the list `gr`), `ans` is 'YES', `impossible` is `False`, and `j` is `j + 1`. If the first and the next element in the first list of `gr` at index `j` are not equal or the last and the next element in the first list of `gr` at index `j` are not equal, the conditions remain unchanged.
