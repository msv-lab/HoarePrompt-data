Output State: **`j` is `m-2`, `gr` is a 2D list where either the first row's j-th element is not equal to the (j+1)-th element of the first row, or the last row's j-th element is not equal to the (j+1)-th element of the last row, `ans` is 'NO', and `impossible` is `True`.**

The code simply sets the variable `impossible` to `True`. This does not affect the values of `j`, `gr`, `ans`, or the condition involving `gr`. Therefore, these variables retain their previous values and conditions.
