Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `tc` is 1
   - `t` is the same as before
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `m` is an input integer
   - `gr` is a list containing two elements which are the input from the user
   - `i` is 1

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented to 2 for the next iteration.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` (which is now 2) must still be less than `n`.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `tc` remains unchanged at 1.
   - `t` remains unchanged.
   - `n` must still be greater than 0.
   - `m` remains the same input integer.
   - `gr` remains the same list containing two elements.
   - `i` is updated to 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`tc` is 1, `t` is the same as before, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `gr` is a list containing two elements which are the input from the user, `i` is 2**
