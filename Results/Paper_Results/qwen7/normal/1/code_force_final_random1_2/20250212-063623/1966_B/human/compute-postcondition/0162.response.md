Postcondition: **`tc` is 2, `t` remains the same, `n` must be at least 3, `m` remains the same, `gr` will contain exactly `n` elements, each being an input provided during the loop's execution, `i` is `n`, `ans` is 'NO', `impossible` is `True`, and `j` equals `m - 1`.**

This means that after the if-else block executes, the values of the variables `tc`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `gr`, `i`, `ans`, and `j` remain as specified in the precondition. Specifically, `impossible` is set to `True` if the condition inside the if statement is met, which is the only change from the precondition.
