Postcondition: **`tc` is 2, `t` remains the same, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `m` remains the same, `gr` will contain exactly `n` elements, each being an input provided during the loop's execution, `i` will be `n-1` (the last index of the list `gr`), `ans` is 'NO' if `impossible` is `True`, and `j` equals `m - 1`.**
