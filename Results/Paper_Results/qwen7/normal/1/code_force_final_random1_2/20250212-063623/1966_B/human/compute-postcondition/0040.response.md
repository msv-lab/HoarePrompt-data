Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables**: The loop variable in the given code is `i`, and it ranges from `0` to `n-2` (since `range(n-1)` generates values from `0` to `n-2`). 

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop condition checks if the first element of row `i` is not equal to the first element of row `i + 1`, or the last element of row `i` is not equal to the last element of row `i + 1`. If either of these conditions is true, the variable `impossible` should remain `False`.

3. **Initial States**: At the end of the previous iteration, the postcondition is that `gr` is a grid, and `impossible` remains `False`. Additionally, the postcondition specifies that if the first element of row `i` is not equal to the first element of row `i + 1`, or the last element of row `i` is not equal to the last element of row `i + 1`, then `impossible` remains `False`.

4. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become `i + 1`.

5. **Adjusting the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - The grid `gr` remains unchanged.
   - The variable `impossible` remains `False` as long as the conditions specified in the postcondition are met.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`gr` is a grid, `impossible` remains `False`, and `i` is `i + 1`**.
