Output State: **`j` is `m-2`, `gr` is a 2D list where either the first row's j-th element is not equal to the (j+1)-th element of the first row, or the last row's j-th element is not equal to the (j+1)-th element of the last row, `ans` is 'NO', and `impossible` remains `True`.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the string `'NO'` to the variable `ans`. This does not affect the values of `j`, `gr`, or `impossible`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
