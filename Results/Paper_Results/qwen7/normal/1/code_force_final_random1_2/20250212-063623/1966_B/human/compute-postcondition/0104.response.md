Output State: **`j` is `m-1`, `m` must be greater than 0, `impossible` is `False`, `ans` is 'NO', `n` must be greater than 0, the current value of `gr[i][0]` is not equal to `gr[i+1][0]` or the current value of `gr[i][m-1]` is not equal to `gr[i+1][m-1]`, `i` is `-1`**

Explanation: The line `ans = 'NO'` simply assigns the string `'NO'` to the variable `ans`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `j`, `m`, `impossible`, `n`, `gr[i][0]`, `gr[i+1][0]`, `gr[i][m-1]`, `gr[i+1][m-1]`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
