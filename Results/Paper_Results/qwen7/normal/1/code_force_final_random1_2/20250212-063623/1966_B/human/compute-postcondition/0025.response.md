Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `j` is 1
- `gr` is a 2D list where either the first row's j-th element is not equal to the (j+1)-th element of the first row, or the last row's j-th element is not equal to the (j+1)-th element of the last row.
- `impossible` remains `False`.

### Loop Head
```
for j in range(m - 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Variable `j`**: The loop variable `j` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `m - 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1. Therefore, in the next iteration, `j` will be incremented to 2.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop continues as long as `j < m - 1`. Since `j` is currently 1, the condition `j < m - 1` will still hold true if `m > 2`.

### Adjusting the States
- **Variable `j`**: It will be incremented to 2.
- **2D List `gr`**: The condition for `gr` remains the same because the loop body is omitted and no changes are made to `gr` based on the given information.
- **Variable `impossible`**: Since the loop body is omitted and there are no conditions that would set `impossible` to `True`, `impossible` remains `False`.

### Final State
State: **`j` is 2, `gr` is a 2D list where either the first row's j-th element is not equal to the (j+1)-th element of the first row, or the last row's j-th element is not equal to the (j+1)-th element of the last row, and `impossible` remains `False`.**
