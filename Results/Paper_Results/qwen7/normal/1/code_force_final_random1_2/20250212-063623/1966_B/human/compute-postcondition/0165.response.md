Based on the initial state provided:

- `tc` is 2
- `t` remains the same (though its value is not explicitly stated, it does not affect the print statement)
- `n` must be at least 3
- `m` remains the same (though its value is not explicitly stated, it does not affect the print statement)
- `gr` contains exactly `n` elements, each being an input provided during the loop's execution
- `i` is `n-1` (the last index of the list `gr`)
- `ans` is 'NO'
- `impossible` is `True`
- `j` equals `m - 1`

The print statement is `print(ans)`. Given that `ans` is explicitly stated to be 'NO', this is what will be printed.

Output: **'NO'**
