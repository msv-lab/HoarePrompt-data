Output State: `tc` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements which are the inputs from the user, `i` is `n-1`.

In natural language: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `tc` remains unchanged at 1. The variable `n` remains as the input integer it was initialized with. The variable `m` also remains unchanged. The list `gr` will contain `n` elements, each being an input from the user, and the variable `i` will be `n-1`, as the loop increments `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
