Output State: **`tc` is 2, `t` remains the same, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `gr` is an empty list, `i` is -1, `ans` is 'NO'**.

The code initializes `gr` as an empty list, which means all the elements previously stored in `gr` are removed. The other variables remain unchanged.
