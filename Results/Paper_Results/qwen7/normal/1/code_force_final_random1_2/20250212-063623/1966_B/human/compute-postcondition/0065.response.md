Output State: `tc` is 1, `t` is the same as before, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements which are the inputs from the user, `i` is `n-1`.

In this final state, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `tc` remains unchanged at 1, `t` remains the same as before, `n` must still be greater than 0, and `m` remains an input integer. The list `gr` will contain exactly `n` elements, each being an input provided by the user during the loop's iterations. The variable `i`, which is used in the loop, will be set to `n-1` after the last iteration.
