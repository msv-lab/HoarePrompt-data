Postcondition: `tc` is 2, `t` remains the same, `n` must be at least 3, `m` remains the same, `gr` will contain exactly `n` elements, each being an input provided during the loop's execution, `i` is `n-1` (the last index of the list `gr`), `ans` is 'NO', `impossible` is `True`, and `j` equals `m - 1`. If `gr[0][0]` is not equal to `gr[n - 1][m - 1]`, then `ans` is set to 'NO' and `impossible` is set to `True`.
