Output State: **`j` is 2, `m` must be greater than 2, and `impossible` remains False.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns `False` to the variable `impossible`. Since the initial state of `impossible` was `False` under the given conditions, it remains `False` after executing the code. The values of `j` and `m` are not affected by this assignment.
