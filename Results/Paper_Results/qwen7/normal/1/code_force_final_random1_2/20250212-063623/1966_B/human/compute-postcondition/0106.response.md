Postcondition: `tc` is 1, `t` remains the same, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements which are the inputs from the user during the loop's iterations, `i` is `-1`, `ans` is 'NO'. If the first element of the first sublist in `gr` is not equal to the last element of the last sublist in `gr`, then `j` is `m-1`, `m` must be greater than 0, `impossible` is `False`, and `ans` is 'NO'.
