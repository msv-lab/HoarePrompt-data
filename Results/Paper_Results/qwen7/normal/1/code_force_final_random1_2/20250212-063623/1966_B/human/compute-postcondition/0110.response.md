Output State: **`tc` is 2, `t` remains the same, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements which are the inputs from the user during the loop's iterations, `i` is -1, `ans` is 'NO'**.

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `m` respectively. The other variables (`tc`, `t`, `gr`, `i`, `ans`) remain unchanged. The initial values of `n` and `m` are now specific input integers, but their exact values are not known until runtime.
