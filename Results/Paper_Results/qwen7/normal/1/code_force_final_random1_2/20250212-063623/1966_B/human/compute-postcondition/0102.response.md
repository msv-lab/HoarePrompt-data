Output State: `j` is `m-1`, `m` must be greater than 0, `impossible` is `False`, `ans` is 'NO', `n` must be greater than 0, the current value of `gr[i][0]` is not equal to `gr[i+1][0]` or the current value of `gr[i][m-1]` is not equal to `gr[i+1][m-1]`, `i` is `-1`.

**Explanation:** After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` starts from `0` and increments by `1` in each iteration. The loop runs `n - 1` times, so after all iterations, `i` will be set to `-1`. The other variables (`j`, `m`, `impossible`, `ans`, and `n`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop. The condition inside the loop checks if the first element of one row is not equal to the first element of the next row or if the last element of one row is not equal to the last element of the next row. If any such pair of rows does not satisfy this condition, `impossible` is set to `False`. Since the output state after the third iteration already shows `impossible` as `False`, it remains `False` after all iterations.
