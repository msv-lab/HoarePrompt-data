Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for j in range(m - 1)`. The variables involved in this loop head are `j` and `m`.

2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the postcondition states that `j` is 0, `gr` is a 2D list where either the first row's j-th element is not equal to the (j+1)-th element of the first row, or the last row's j-th element is not equal to the (j+1)-th element of the last row, and `impossible` remains `False`.

3. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `j < m - 1`. Since `j` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.

4. **Adjusting the State**: After incrementing `j` by 1, `j` will become 1. The condition for the loop to continue will now be checked with `j = 1`.

5. **Maintaining Other States**: The other states (`gr` and `impossible`) remain unchanged unless the loop body modifies them. Since no modifications are mentioned in the loop body, these states stay the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`j` is 1, `gr` is a 2D list where either the first row's j-th element is not equal to the (j+1)-th element of the first row, or the last row's j-th element is not equal to the (j+1)-th element of the last row, and `impossible` remains `False`**.
