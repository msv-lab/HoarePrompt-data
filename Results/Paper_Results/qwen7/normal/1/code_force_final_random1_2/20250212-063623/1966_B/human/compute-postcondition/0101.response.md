Output State: `j` is `m-1`, `m` must be greater than 0, `impossible` is `False`, `ans` is 'NO', `n` must be greater than 0, the current value of `gr[i][0]` is not equal to `gr[i+1][0]` or the current value of `gr[i][m-1]` is not equal to `gr[i+1][m-1]`, `i` is `-1`.

**Explanation:**
After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` starts from `0` and increments by `1` each time through the loop. The loop runs `n - 1` times, so after all iterations, `i` will become `n - 1`. However, since `i` is incremented before it is checked in the loop condition, the final value of `i` will be one less than `n - 1`, which is `-1`. All other variables remain in their postconditions from the last iteration of the loop, with `impossible` being `False` because the loop did not set it to `True` again (it was initially `False` and only becomes `False` if the condition inside the loop is met, which happened in the previous iterations).
