Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that prevent it from correctly determining whether it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Checking Impossibility**: The logic used to check if it's impossible to make all squares the same color is flawed. Specifically, the conditions `if gr[0][j] != gr[0][j + 1] or gr[n - 1][j] != gr[n - 1][j + 1]` and `if gr[i][0] != gr[i + 1][0] or gr[i][m - 1] != gr[i + 1][m - 1]` do not cover all necessary cases to determine if the grid can be made uniform. 

2. **Insufficient Checks**: The solution only checks the boundary conditions and does not consider other configurations where it might still be possible to make all squares the same color. For example, a grid with alternating colors in a checkerboard pattern cannot be made uniform using the allowed operations.

3. **Early Exit**: The solution prematurely exits when it finds a pair of adjacent squares with different colors, which is too restrictive. It should continue checking other possible operations that could lead to a uniform grid.

A more robust approach would involve checking if there exists any row or column where all elements are the same, as this would indicate that the entire grid can be made uniform. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for tc in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        gr = [input() for _ in range(n)]
        
        # Check if all elements in any row or column are the same
        for i in range(n):
            if len(set(gr[i])) == 1:
                print("YES")
                break
        else:
            for j in range(m):
                col = ''.join(gr[i][j] for i in range(n))
                if len(set(col)) == 1:
                    print("YES")
                    break
            else:
                print("NO")

func()
```

This solution iterates through each row and column to check if all elements are the same. If it finds such a row or column, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO". This approach ensures that all possible configurations are considered.
