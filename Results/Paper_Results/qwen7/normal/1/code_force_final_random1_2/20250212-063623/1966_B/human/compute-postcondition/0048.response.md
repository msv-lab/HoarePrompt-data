Output State: `gr` is a grid, `impossible` remains `False`, and `i` is `n - 2`. The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = n - 2`, checking if the first or last elements of consecutive rows are not equal. If any such pair of rows does not meet the condition (`gr[i][0] != gr[i + 1][0]` or `gr[i][m - 1] != gr[i + 1][m - 1]`), `impossible` remains `False`. Since the loop runs until `i` reaches `n - 2`, it checks all possible pairs of consecutive rows in the grid. If no such pair violates the condition, `impossible` will still be `False` after the loop completes.
