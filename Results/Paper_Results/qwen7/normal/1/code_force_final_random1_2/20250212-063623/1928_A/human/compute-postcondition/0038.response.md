Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is the first integer from the input split by space, `b` is the second integer from the input split by space, `i` is `i + 1`, and the integer input from `int(input())` remains the same.**

Explanation: The if condition `(a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0` is always true because `(a - b) % 2 > 0` or `(a - b) % 2 < 0` is equivalent to saying that `(a - b) % 2 != 0`, which means `a - b` is not divisible by 2. Since the if part and the else part have the same postcondition, the overall postcondition is simply the postcondition of either part, as both parts lead to the same state of the variables.
