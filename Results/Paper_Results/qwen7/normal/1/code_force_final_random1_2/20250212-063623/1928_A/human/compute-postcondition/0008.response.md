Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is the first integer input split from the input string, `b` is the second integer input split from the input string, and at least one of `a` or `b` is odd. The absolute difference between `a` and `b` is equal to the negative of the larger number.
