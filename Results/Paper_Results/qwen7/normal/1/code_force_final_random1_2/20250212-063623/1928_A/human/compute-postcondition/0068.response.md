Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t < 10^4\), `a` is the integer entered first after the space, `b` is the integer entered second after the space, and after executing the if-else block, either both `a` and `b` are divided by 2 until `b` equals `a`, or `a` and `b` retain their original values from the input.
