Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program fails to consider the scenario where both `a` and `b` are odd numbers but their sum is even, which allows forming another rectangle.

Here is a counterexample:
- Input: `3 5`
- Expected Output: `Yes`
- Program Output: `No`

In this case, a `3x5` rectangle can be cut into two `3x2.5` rectangles (which are not valid since we need integer sides), but it can also be cut into two `3x2` and `3x3` rectangles. By rearranging these pieces, a `6x2.5` rectangle can be formed, which is not directly possible but the logic should allow for such scenarios.

The program incorrectly checks conditions that do not fully cover the problem's requirements. It only considers cases where both dimensions are even or specific differences between dimensions, but it misses the broader condition where the sum of the dimensions is even, allowing for the formation of another rectangle.
