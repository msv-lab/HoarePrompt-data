Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t < 10^4\), `a1` is `a` // 2, `a2` is `a` // 2**.

Explanation: The code divides the value of `a` by 2 using integer division (`//`) and assigns both `a1` and `a2` the same value, which is `a` divided by 2. The values of `t` and `b` remain unchanged from their initial state.
