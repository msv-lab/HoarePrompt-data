Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head:**
   - The loop variable `i` is used in the loop condition `i < int(input())`.
   - There are no other variables directly involved in the loop head.

2. **Understand the loop condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `i` is less than the integer input obtained from `int(input())`.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is some value less than the integer input.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.

4. **Adjust the state:**
   - The integer input from `int(input())` remains the same for each iteration.
   - The initial values of `t`, `a`, and `b` are not affected by the loop itself and remain as they were at the start of the loop.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is the value of `i`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is the first integer input split from the input string, `b` is the second integer input split from the input string, `i` is incremented by 1 (i.e., `i + 1`), and the integer input from `int(input())` remains the same.**
