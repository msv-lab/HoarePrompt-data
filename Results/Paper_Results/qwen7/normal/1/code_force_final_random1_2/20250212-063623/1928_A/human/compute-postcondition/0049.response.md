Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is the integer entered first after the space, `b` is the integer entered second after the space. If `a` or `b` is even, `b` is divided by 2, and the result is stored back in `b`. If `b` is even, it is split into two equal parts `b1` and `b2`, where `b1 = b2 = b // 2`. The condition `b1 != a` is checked, and if it holds, `b` remains unchanged.
