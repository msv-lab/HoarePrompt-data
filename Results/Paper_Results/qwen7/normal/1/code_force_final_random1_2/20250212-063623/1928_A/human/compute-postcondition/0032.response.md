Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `a` is the first integer from the input split by space.
   - `b` is the second integer from the input split by space.
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
   - The integer input from `int(input())` remains the same.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range of the integer input from `int(input())`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - The integer input from `int(input())` remains the same, so it will be the same as the value of `int(input())` at the start of the current iteration.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `t` remains the same because it is not involved in the loop head.
   - `a` and `b` remain the same because they are not involved in the loop head.
   - `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - The integer input from `int(input())` remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is the first integer from the input split by space, `b` is the second integer from the input split by space, `i` is incremented by 1, and the integer input from `int(input())` remains the same.**
