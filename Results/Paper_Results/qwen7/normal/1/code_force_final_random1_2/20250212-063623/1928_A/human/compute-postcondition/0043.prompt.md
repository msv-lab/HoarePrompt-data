You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, a and b are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        a, b = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):
            print('no')
        elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and for each test case, `a` and `b` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\). The value of `i` will be equal to `t` since the loop runs `t` times. For each iteration, the program reads a line with two integers `a` and `b`, and prints either 'yes' or 'no' based on the given conditions. After all iterations, the output consists of `t` lines, each containing either 'yes' or 'no' depending on the inputs provided for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes a series of test cases where each test case consists of three integers: t, a, and b. For each test case, it checks if t is within the range of 1 to 10^4, and a and b are within the range of 1 to 10^9. Based on these conditions, the function processes each test case and returns specific outputs for each case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
