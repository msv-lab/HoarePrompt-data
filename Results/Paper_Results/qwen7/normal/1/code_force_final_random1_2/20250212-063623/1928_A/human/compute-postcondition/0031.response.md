Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is the first integer from the input split by space, `b` is the second integer from the input split by space, `i` is incremented by 1, and the integer input from `int(input())` remains the same, regardless of whether `a` and `b` are both even or not.**
