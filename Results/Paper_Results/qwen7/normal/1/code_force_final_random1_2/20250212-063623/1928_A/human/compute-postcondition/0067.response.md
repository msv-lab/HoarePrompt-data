Output: **No**

Explanation: According to the initial state, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t < 10^4\). The variables `a` and `b` are assigned the values from the input split by a space and converted to integers. However, the print statement simply outputs the string 'No', regardless of the values of `a` and `b`. Therefore, the output is **No**.
