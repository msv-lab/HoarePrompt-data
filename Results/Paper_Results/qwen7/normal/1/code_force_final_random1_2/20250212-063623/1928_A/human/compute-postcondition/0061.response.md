Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t < 10^4\), `a` is the integer entered first after the space, `b` is the integer entered second after the space, `a1` is `a // 2`, `a2` is `a // 2`, `b1` is `b // 2`, `b2` is `b // 2`, we continue the loop or process.**

The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but instead moves to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, and `b2` remain unchanged from their initial states.
