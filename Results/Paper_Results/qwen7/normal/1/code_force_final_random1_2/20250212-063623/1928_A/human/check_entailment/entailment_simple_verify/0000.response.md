### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and the problem statement to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Statement Analysis:
- Bob needs to determine if he can form another rectangle from a given \(a \times b\) rectangle by cutting it into two smaller rectangles and rearranging them.
- The key point is that the resulting rectangles must have integer side lengths, and rotations are allowed.

#### Given Program Analysis:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):
            print('no')
        elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
```

#### Annotations:
- The program iterates over `t` test cases, reading pairs of integers `a` and `b` for each test case.
- It checks several conditions to decide if a new rectangle can be formed:
  1. If both `a` and `b` are even, it prints 'yes'.
  2. If the difference between `a` and `b` is such that one dimension is negative and the other is positive (which is impossible with positive integers), it prints 'no'.
  3. If the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is odd, it prints 'yes'.
  4. Otherwise, it prints 'no'.

#### Issues with the Program:
1. **Condition for Even Dimensions**: The condition `if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:` is correct for handling the case where both dimensions are even.
2. **Incorrect Handling of Odd Dimensions**: The program incorrectly handles the case where both dimensions are odd but their sum is even. For example, a `3x5` rectangle can be cut into two `3x2` and `3x3` rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form a `6x2` rectangle. However, the program does not account for this scenario.
3. **Unnecessary Conditions**: The conditions `(a - b == -a, a)` and `(b - a == -b, b)` are incorrect and unnecessary. They check for impossible conditions (negative dimensions).

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the following:
- If both dimensions are even, we can always form another rectangle.
- If one dimension is even and the other is odd, we can still form another rectangle by cutting the even dimension in half.
- If both dimensions are odd but their sum is even, we can form another rectangle by cutting and rearranging.

#### Revised Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
```

### Final Evaluation:
The original program does not correctly handle all cases, particularly the scenario where both dimensions are odd but their sum is even. The revised program correctly addresses this issue.

**Final: False**
