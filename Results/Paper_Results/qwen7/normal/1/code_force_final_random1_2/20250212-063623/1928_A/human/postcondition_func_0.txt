The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of three integers \(t\), \(a\), and \(b\), where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\). For each test case, it reads the values of \(a\) and \(b\), and prints 'yes' or 'no' based on specific conditions. After processing all test cases, it outputs a sequence of 'yes' or 'no' for each test case.
