Output: **yes**

Explanation: The initial state describes that `t` is a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). The variables `a` and `b` are the first and second integers from an input split by space, respectively. The variable `i` is incremented by 1, but its value is not relevant to the `print` statement. Additionally, an integer is taken as input using `int(input())`, but this value is not used in the `print` statement either. The `print` statement itself simply outputs the string `'yes'`, so the output is **yes**.
