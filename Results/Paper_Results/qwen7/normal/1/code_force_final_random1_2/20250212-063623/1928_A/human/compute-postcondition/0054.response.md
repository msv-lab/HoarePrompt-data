Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t < 10^4\), `a1` is `a` // 2, `a2` is `a` // 2, we continue the loop.**

The `continue` statement does not modify the values of the variables but instead moves the flow of the program to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the values of `t`, `a1`, and `a2` remain unchanged, and the program continues the loop.
