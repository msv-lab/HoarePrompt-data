The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer t (number of test cases), an integer n (number of books), and a list of n integers representing the number of pages in each book. For each test case, it calculates and prints the sum of the maximum page count of the first n-1 books and the page count of the last book. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value.
