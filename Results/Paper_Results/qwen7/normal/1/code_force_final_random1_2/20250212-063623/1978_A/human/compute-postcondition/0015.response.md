Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a list of integers representing the number of pages in each book for each test case. Each test case includes a positive integer t (1 <= t <= 500) indicating the number of test cases, followed by an integer n (2 <= n <= 100) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9) representing the number of pages in each book. The function returns the sum of pages for each book in each test case.**

Note: The actual computation or processing logic is not described here, only the parameters and expected return value based on the given constraints and relationships.
