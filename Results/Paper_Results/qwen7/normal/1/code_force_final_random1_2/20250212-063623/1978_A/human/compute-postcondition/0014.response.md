Output State: `t` is greater than 0 and an integer between 1 and 1 (inclusive), `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` will be reduced to 1 and then decremented to 0, meaning the loop condition `t > 0` will no longer be true. Therefore, the loop will stop executing. At this point, `t` will be 0, which is still within the range of 1 to 1 (inclusive), `n` will be the last input integer received, and `nums` will be the list of integers from the last input string split and converted.
