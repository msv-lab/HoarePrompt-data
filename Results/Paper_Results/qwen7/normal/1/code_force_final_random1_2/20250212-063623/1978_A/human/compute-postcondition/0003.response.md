Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `nums = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, converts each integer to an int type using `map(int, ...)` and then creates a list `nums` from these converted integers. The initial states of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
