Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the function `func()` is flawed because it simply takes the last element of the list and adds it to the second-largest element in the list (excluding the last element). This approach does not guarantee that the maximum total number of pages can be read by optimally dividing the books into two piles.

To correctly solve this problem, you need to consider all possible ways to divide the books into two piles and choose the division that maximizes the sum of the largest book in each pile. Here's a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())), reverse=True)
        max_pages = 0
        for i in range(1, n):
            max_pages = max(max_pages, nums[i-1] + nums[i])
        results.append(max_pages)
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This solution works as follows:
1. Read the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, read the number of books and their page counts.
3. Sort the list of books in descending order.
4. Iterate through the list, considering each possible split point between the two piles.
5. Calculate the sum of the largest book in each pile for each split point and keep track of the maximum sum.
6. Print the maximum sum for each test case.
