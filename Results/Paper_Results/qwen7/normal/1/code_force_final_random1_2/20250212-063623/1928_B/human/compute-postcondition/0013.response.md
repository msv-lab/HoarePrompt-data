Output State: `arr` is a list of positive integers, `i` is `-1`, `tem` is the product of all elements in `arr` when traversed from the last element to the first, `ans` is a list containing the cumulative product of elements of `arr` starting from the last element to the first, with each subsequent element being the product of all preceding elements.

In simpler terms, `ans` will contain the cumulative product of elements of `arr` from the end to the beginning, where each element in `ans` is the product of all elements in `arr` that come after it in the original list.
