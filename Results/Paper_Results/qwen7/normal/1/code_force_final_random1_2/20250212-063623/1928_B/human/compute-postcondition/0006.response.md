Output State: **`i` is `len(arr) - 3`, `tem` is `tem * arr[i]`, `ans` is a list with one element which is `tem * arr[-1]` after the previous iteration.**

Explanation: The variable `i` remains unchanged as the code does not modify it. The variable `tem` is updated by multiplying its current value with `arr[i]`. The variable `ans` is not directly affected by the given line of code, so it retains its previous state, which is a list with one element equal to `tem * arr[-1]` from the previous iteration.
