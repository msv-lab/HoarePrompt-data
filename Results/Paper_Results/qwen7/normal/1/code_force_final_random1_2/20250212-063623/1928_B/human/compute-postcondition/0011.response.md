Output State: **`i` is `len(arr) - 5`, `tem` is `tem * arr[len(arr) - 4] * arr[len(arr) - 5]`, `ans` is a list with three elements where the first element is `tem * arr[-2]`, the second element is `tem * arr[-1]`, and the third element is `tem`.**

Explanation: The code snippet appends the value of `tem` to the list `ans`. Initially, `ans` contains two elements: `tem * arr[-2]` and `tem * arr[-1]`. After executing `ans.append(tem)`, `ans` now contains three elements: `tem * arr[-2]`, `tem * arr[-1]`, and `tem`. The values of `i` and `tem` remain unchanged from their initial states.
