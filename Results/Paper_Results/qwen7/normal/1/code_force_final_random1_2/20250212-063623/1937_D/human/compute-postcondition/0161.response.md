Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `i` is `i + 1`: This means `i` is incremented by 1.
   - `n` is greater than 0: This provides no direct information about the value of `n`, but it is mentioned for context.
   - `a` is the value of `A[l]`: Here, `A` is a list, and `a` is the element at index `l`.
   - `x` is `r - (l + 2)`: This calculates the difference between `r` and the value of `l + 2`.
   - `b` is the value of `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)` if `x >= 0`: This means `b` is calculated only if `x` is non-negative. If `x` is negative, `b` is not defined according to the given formula.

2. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   - The print statement is `print(a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1, end=' ')`.

Given this breakdown, let's determine the values:

- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `i + 1`.
- `a` is the value of `A[l]`.
- `x = r - (l + 2)`. Since `x` is used to determine `b`, we need to check if `x >= 0`.
- If `x >= 0`, then `b = (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`. Otherwise, `b` is undefined.

Since the exact values of `A`, `l`, `r`, `idx_B`, and `i` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `b`. However, we know that `b` will only be defined if `x >= 0`.

Therefore, the expression `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1` will include `a * 2` and `i + 1`, and potentially `b * 2` if `x >= 0`.

Output: **a * 2 + i + 1 + b * 2 (where a is the value of A[l], i is the incremented value, and b is (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1) if r - (l + 2) >= 0)**
