Step-by-step reasoning:

1. From the initial state, we know:
   - `i` is 3
   - `n` is greater than 0 (but its exact value is not specified, so we'll leave it as `n`)
   - `l` is 2
   - `a` is 1
   - `r` is 1
   - `b` is -1

2. The expression to be evaluated in the `print` statement is `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)`.

3. Substituting the known values:
   - `a * 2` becomes `1 * 2` which is `2`
   - `b * 2` becomes `-1 * 2` which is `-2`
   - `(n - i)` becomes `(n - 3)`

4. Combining these, the expression simplifies to:
   - `2 + (-2) + (n - 3)`

5. Simplifying further:
   - `2 - 2 + n - 3` which is `n - 3`

6. Since `n` is greater than 0 but its exact value is not specified, we keep it as `n`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be `n - 3`.

Output: **n - 3**
