Output State: **`i` is less than `n`, `n` is greater than 0, the character at index `i` in string `s` is not '>', `r` is not decreased by 1, `r` is not equal to 0, `a` is the value of `B[r]`, `b` is the value of `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)` if `l - r - 1 > 0`. If `l - r - 1 <= 0`, the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b` by adding `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)` to its current value. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged from the initial state.
