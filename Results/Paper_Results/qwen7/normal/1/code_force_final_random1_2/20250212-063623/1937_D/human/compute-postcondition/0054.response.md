Output State: **`i` is equal to `n-1-3-3`, `j` is 3, `n` must be greater than 0, `A` is a list of integers, `idx_A` is a list of all indices in `s` where the character is '>', in the order they appear, `B` is a list of integers, `idx_B` is a list of all indices in `s` where the character is '<', in the order they appear, and now `idx_B` includes the index `i` if `s[i] == '<'`**

Explanation: The value of `i` is updated to `n - 1 - j`. Given that `j` is 3, `i` becomes `n - 1 - 3 - 3`, which simplifies to `n - 4`. The values of `j`, `n`, `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, and `idx_B` remain unchanged from their initial states.
