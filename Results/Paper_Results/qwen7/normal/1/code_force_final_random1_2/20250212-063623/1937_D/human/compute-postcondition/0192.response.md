Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is the value of `B[r]`, `b` is the value of `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 2]`**.

Explanation: The code subtracts `A[l - r - 2]` from `b`. Since `b` was previously the value of `A[l - 1]`, it now becomes `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 2]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
