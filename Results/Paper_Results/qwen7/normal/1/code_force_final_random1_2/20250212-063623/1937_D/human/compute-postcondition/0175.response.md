Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `l` is `l + 1`, if `l < r`, then `a` is the value of `A[l]`, `x` is `r - (l + 2)`, and `b` is the value of `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)` if `x >= 0`. Otherwise, if `r` equals 0, no additional variables are changed. If `r` is not 0, then `a` is set to `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, and `b` is set to `A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`.**

Explanation: The code `l += 1` increments the value of `l` by 1. All other conditions and variable assignments remain unchanged from the initial state. Therefore, the updated state includes the incremented value of `l`, while the rest of the conditions and variables stay as they were described initially.
