Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n`, `n` is the length of the string `s`, consisting only of the characters '<' and '>', `A` is an empty list, `idx_A` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The line `idx_A = []` creates an empty list and assigns it to the variable `idx_A`. This does not affect the values of `s`, `n`, or `A`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions with the addition of `idx_A` being an empty list.
