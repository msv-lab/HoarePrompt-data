Output State: **`i` is less than `n`, `n` is greater than 0, the character at index `i` in string `s` is not '>', `r` is not decreased by 1, `r` is not equal to 0, `a` is the value of `B[r]`, `b` is the value of `A[l - r - 3] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b` by subtracting `(idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)` from the current value of `b`. The other variables remain unchanged.
