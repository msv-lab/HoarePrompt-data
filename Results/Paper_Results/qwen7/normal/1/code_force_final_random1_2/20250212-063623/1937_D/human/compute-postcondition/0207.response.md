Output State: **`b` is -2, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, `l` is 2, `r` is 2, `x` is -2**

Explanation: The variable `b` is updated by subtracting the value of `(idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)`. However, the values of `idx_B[x]`, `idx_B[r - 1]`, and `idx_B` are not provided. Since `x` is -2, `r` is 2, and `idx_B` is not defined, we cannot calculate the exact new value of `b`. Given the initial value of `b` is 0, and without the specific values of `idx_B[x]` and `idx_B[r - 1]`, we can only say that `b` is updated by a certain expression involving these undefined values. Since no specific values are provided for `idx_B`, we assume the unchanged state of other variables. Thus, `b` is updated but remains unspecified due to missing information, while other variables retain their initial values.
