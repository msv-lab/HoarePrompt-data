Output State: **Postcondition: `i` is less than `n`, `n` is greater than 0, the character at index `i` in string `s` is not '>', `r` is decreased by 1, and `l` is greater than 0; `a` is the character at index `l-1` in string `r`, the current value of `a` is `ord(a) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, `b` is the character at index `r` in string `B`, and `r - l` is greater than or equal to 0; `b` is the character at index `r - l` in string `B` minus 1.**

Explanation: The code `b = b - B[r - l]` subtracts the character at index `r - l` in string `B` from `b`. Since `B[r - l]` is a character, `b` is also treated as a character here, and the subtraction is performed based on their ASCII values. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial postcondition.
