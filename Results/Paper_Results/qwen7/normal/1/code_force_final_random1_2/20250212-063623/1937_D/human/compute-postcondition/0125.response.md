Output State: **`i` is less than `n`, `n` is greater than 0, the character at index `i` in string `s` is not '>', `r` is decreased by 1, and `l` is greater than 0; `a` is the character at index `l-1` in string `r`, the current value of `a` is `ord(a) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, `b` is the character at index `r - l` in string `B` minus 1, and `b` is decreased by `(idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)`**.

Explanation: The code subtracts `(idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)` from `b`. Given the initial conditions, `b` was previously defined as the character at index `r - l` in string `B` minus 1. After executing the code, `b` now has its value reduced by the specified amount. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
