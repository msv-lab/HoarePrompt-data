Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and the character at index `i` of `s` is '>', `idx_A` is [0], `A` is [0]**.

Explanation: The code `idx_A.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` (which is 0) to the list `idx_A`. Since `idx_A` was initially empty, appending 0 to it results in `idx_A` being [0]. The value of `A` remains unchanged as it was already set to [0] based on the given conditions. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `s`) remain in their original state.
