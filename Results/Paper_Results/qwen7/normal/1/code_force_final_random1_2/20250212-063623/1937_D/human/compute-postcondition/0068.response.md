Output State: **`idx_B` is a list containing `i`, `i` is equal to `n-5`, `j` is 4.**

Explanation: The code `idx_B.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `idx_B`. Given the initial state, `i` is equal to `n-5` and `j` is 4. Since `idx_B` was initially an empty list (based on the postcondition), after appending `i`, `idx_B` will contain the value of `i`. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged, and the condition regarding `B` does not affect the current state.
