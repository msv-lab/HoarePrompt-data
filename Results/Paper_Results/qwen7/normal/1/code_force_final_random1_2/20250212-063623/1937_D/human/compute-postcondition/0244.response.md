Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, `l` is 2, `a` is 1, `r` is 1, `b` is -1**

Explanation: Initially, `b` is -2 because `l - r - 1` is greater than 0. The code updates `b` by adding `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)` to its current value. Given the initial conditions, `idx_A[l - 1]` would be `idx_A[1]`, which is not defined in the initial state but doesn't affect the calculation since `i` is 3 and `r` is 1, making the expression `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)` simplify to `2 * 2 = 4`. However, since `b` was already -2, the new value of `b` becomes `-2 + 4 = 2 - 2 = 0 - 1 = -1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
