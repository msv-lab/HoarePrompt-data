Output State: **`i` is equal to `n-5`, `j` is 4, `x` is undefined**.

Explanation: The code snippet provided tries to assign a value to `x` using `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`. However, the variables `B`, `idx_B`, `len(B)`, and `len(idx_B)` are not defined in the initial state or within the given code snippet. Therefore, these variables cannot be evaluated, and `x` remains undefined. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code snippet.
