Output State: **`i` is equal to `n-7`, `j` is 3, `n` must be greater than 0, `A` is a list of integers, `idx_A` is a list of all indices in `s` where the character is '>', in the order they appear, `B` is a list of integers, `idx_B` is a list of all indices in `s` where the character is '<', in the order they appear, and `x` is `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`**.

Explanation: 
- The value of `i` is calculated as `n-1-3-3`, which simplifies to `n-7`.
- The value of `j` remains unchanged at 3.
- The condition that `n` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged.
- The lists `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, and `idx_B` remain unchanged.
- The variable `x` is assigned the value `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`. This calculation uses the last element of `B` and the difference between the last index in `idx_B` and `i`, multiplied by the length of `idx_B`.
