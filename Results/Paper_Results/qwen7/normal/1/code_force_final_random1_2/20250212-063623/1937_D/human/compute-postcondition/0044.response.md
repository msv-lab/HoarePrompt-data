Output State: **`i` is equal to `n-1-j`, `j` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `A` is a list of integers calculated based on the conditions inside the loop, `idx_A` is a list of all indices in `s` where the character is '>', in the order they appear; `B` is a list of integers with the first element being 0, `idx_B` is a list of all indices in `s` where the character is '<', in the order they appear, and the current value of `s[i]` is '<', and the length of `idx_B` is 1.**

Explanation: The code snippet `B.append(0)` appends the value `0` to the list `B`. Initially, `B` is empty, so after appending `0`, `B` becomes `[0]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
