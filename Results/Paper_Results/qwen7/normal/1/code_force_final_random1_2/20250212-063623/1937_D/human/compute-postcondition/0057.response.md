Output State: **`i` is equal to `n-7`, `j` is 3, `n` must be greater than 0, `A` is a list of integers, `idx_A` is a list of all indices in `s` where the character is '>', in the order they appear, `B` is a list of integers with the last element being `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`, `idx_B` is a list of all indices in `s` where the character is '<', in the order they appear, and `x` is `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`**.

Explanation: The code appends the value of `x` to the list `B`. The value of `x` is given by the expression `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`. Since `B` was initially a list before the append operation, appending `x` to `B` means the last element of `B` is now `x`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
