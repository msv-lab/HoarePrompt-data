Let's break down the given code and initial state step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 3.
   - `n` is greater than 0 (but its exact value is not specified).
   - `l` is 2.
   - `r` is 1.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Understanding the Expression:**
   - `idx_A[l - 1]`: Since `l` is 2, `idx_A[l - 1]` becomes `idx_A[1]`. We don't know the value of `idx_A[1]`, so let's denote it as `x`.
   - The expression inside the print statement becomes: `n - i + (i - x) * 2`.

4. **Substitute Known Values:**
   - `i` is 3.
   - So the expression simplifies to: `n - 3 + (3 - x) * 2`.

5. **Final Expression:**
   - The expression is `n - 3 + (3 - x) * 2`, where `x = idx_A[1]`.

6. **Output:**
   - The print statement will output the result of the expression `n - 3 + (3 - idx_A[1]) * 2`.

Given the above steps, the output will be:

Output: **n - 3 + (3 - idx_A[1]) * 2 (where n is greater than 0 and idx_A[1] is the value of idx_A at index 1)**
