Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `r` is decreased by 1.**

The value of `i` remains unchanged from its initial state as it was defined as `i + 1`, which is a constant expression. The value of `n` is still greater than 0. The value of `r` is decreased by 1 due to the operation `r -= 1`.
