Postcondition: **`i` is equal to `n-7`, `j` is 3, `n` must be greater than 0, `A` is a list of integers, `idx_A` is a list of all indices in `s` where the character is '>', in the order they appear, `B` is a list of integers, `idx_B` is updated to include the current value of `i` if `s[i] == '<'`**.

This postcondition describes that after the execution of the if-else block, the variable `i` is set to `n-7`, `j` remains 3, `n` is still greater than 0, `A` and `idx_A` remain unchanged, `B` and `idx_B` are unchanged unless `s[i] == '<'`, in which case `idx_B` includes the current value of `i`.
