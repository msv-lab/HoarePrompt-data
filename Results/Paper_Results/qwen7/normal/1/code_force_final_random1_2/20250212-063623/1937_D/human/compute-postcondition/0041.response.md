Postcondition: `i` is equal to `n-1-j`, `j` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `A` is a list of integers calculated based on the conditions inside the loop, `idx_A` is a list of all indices in `s` where the character is '>', in the order they appear; `B` is an empty list, `idx_B` is an empty list, the current value of `s[i]` is '<'.
