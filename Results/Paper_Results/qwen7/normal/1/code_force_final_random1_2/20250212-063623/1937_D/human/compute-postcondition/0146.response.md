Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is less than `n`, and `n` is greater than 0.
- The character at index `i` in string `s` is not '>'.
- `r` is not decreased by 1, and `r` is not equal to 0.
- `a` is the value of `B[r]`.
- `b` is the value of `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)` if `l - r - 1 > 0`. Otherwise, `a` and `b` remain unchanged.

The expression to be evaluated and printed is `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)`.

Let's break down the components:
- `a` is `B[r]`.
- `b` is either `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)` if `l - r - 1 > 0`, otherwise it remains unchanged.
- `(n - i)` is simply the difference between `n` and `i`.

Since the exact values of `B[r]`, `b`, `n`, `i`, `idx_A`, `l`, and `r` are not specified, we cannot determine precise numerical values for `a` and `b`. However, we can describe the expression in terms of these variables.

Output: **2 * B[r] + 2 * (b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)) if l - r - 1 > 0 else 2 * B[r] + 2 * b + (n - i)**
