The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`. `s` is a string of length `n` where `1 ≤ n ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^5`, and the string consists only of the characters '<' and '>'. The function does not provide specific outputs for different cases but rather processes the string `s`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` composed of '<' and '>' characters and process it according to its internal logic without detailed description here.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s` consisting only of '<' and '>' characters and processes it according to its internal logic.**
