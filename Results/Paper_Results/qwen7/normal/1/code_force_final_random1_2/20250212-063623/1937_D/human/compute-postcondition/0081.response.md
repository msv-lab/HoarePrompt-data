Output State: **`i` must be less than `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, the current value of `s[i]` is equal to '>', `l` is less than `r`, `a` is equal to `A[l]`, `x` is equal to `r - (l + 2)`**.

This means that the value of `x` is calculated as `r - (l + 2)`, while the other variables retain their original conditions and values.
