Postcondition: **`i` is equal to `n-7`, `j` is 3, `n` must be greater than 0, `A` is a list of integers, `idx_A` is a list of all indices in `s` where the character is '>', in the order they appear, `B` is a list of integers. If `len(idx_B) == 0`, then `B` has an additional element `0` appended. Otherwise, the last element of `B` is `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`, and `idx_B` is a list of all indices in `s` where the character is '<', in the order they appear.**
