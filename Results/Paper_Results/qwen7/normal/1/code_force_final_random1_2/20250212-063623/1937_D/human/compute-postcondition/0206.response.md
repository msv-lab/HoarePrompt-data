Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, `l` is 2, `r` is 2, `x` is -2, `b` is 0**

Explanation: Initially, `b` is equal to `r - 1`, which is 1. The code updates `b` to `b - B[x]`. Since `B` is not defined, we assume `B` is the same as the previously defined variables. Given `x` is -2, and there's no specific definition for `B[-2]`, we consider `B[-2]` to be the same as `r - 1` (which is 1) for the sake of calculation. Thus, `b` becomes `1 - 1`, which is 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
