Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is less than `n`, and `n` is greater than 0.
- `s[i]` is equal to '>'.
- `l` is less than `r`.
- `a` is equal to `A[l]`.
- `x` is greater than or equal to 0.
- `b` is equal to `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`.

We need to determine the value of the expression `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1`.

1. `a` is `A[l]`.
2. `b` is `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`.
3. `i + 1` is simply `i + 1`.

Since `a` and `b` are not explicitly defined with specific values, we will keep them as they are. The expression becomes:

\[ \text{result} = A[l] \times 2 + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) \times (l + 1) \times 2 + i + 1 \]

Given the format requirement, the output will be:

Output: **A[l] * 2 + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1) * 2 + i + 1**
