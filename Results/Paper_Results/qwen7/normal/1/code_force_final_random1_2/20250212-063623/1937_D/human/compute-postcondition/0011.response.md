Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, the character at index `i` of `s` is '>', and the length of `idx_A` is not 0; `x` is `A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`, `A` is `[x]`**.

Explanation: The code appends the value of `x` to the list `A`. Given the formula for `x`, the value of `x` remains unchanged. Therefore, `A` now contains the value of `x` as its first element. All other conditions and variables remain as they were initially.
