Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and the character at index `i` of `s` is '>', and the length of `idx_A` is not 0; `x` is `A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`**.

This means that the value of `x` is calculated as the last element of `A` plus `(i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1])` times the length of `idx_A`. The values of `i`, `n`, `s`, and `idx_A` remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
