Output State: `i` is equal to `n-1`, `j` is 4, `n` must be greater than 0, `A` is a list of integers, `idx_A` is a list of all indices in `s` where the character is '>', in the order they appear; `B` is a list of integers, `idx_B` is a list of all indices in `s` where the character is '<', in the order they appear, and now `idx_B` contains all the indices `i` where `s[i] == '<'`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will have reached `n-1` (since it starts from `n-1` and decreases by 1 in each iteration until `j` reaches `n`). The variable `j` will be 4 because the loop runs from `0` to `n-1`. The conditions for `n` being greater than 0 and the lists `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, and `idx_B` remain as described, with `idx_B` containing all indices where the character in `s` is '<'.
