Output State: **s is a string of length n, n is the length of the string s, consisting only of the characters '<' and '>', A is an empty list.**

The code `A = []` creates an empty list `A`. This does not affect the values of `s` or `n`. Therefore, the length of the string `s` remains `n`, and the string `s` itself remains unchanged, consisting only of the characters '<' and '>'. The variable `A` is now an empty list.
