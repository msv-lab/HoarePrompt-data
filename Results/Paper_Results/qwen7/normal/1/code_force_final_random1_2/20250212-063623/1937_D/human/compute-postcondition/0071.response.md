Output State: `i` is equal to `n-1`, `j` is 5, `n` must be greater than 0, `A` is a list of integers, `idx_A` is a list of all indices in `s` where the character is '>', in the order they appear, `B` is a list of integers, `idx_B` is a list of all indices in `s` where the character is '<', in the order they appear.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `j` will be equal to `n` because the loop runs from `0` to `n-1`. The variable `i` will be set to `n-1` after the last iteration of the loop. The lists `idx_B` and `B` will contain all the indices and corresponding values where the condition `s[i] == '<'` was met during the loop's execution.
