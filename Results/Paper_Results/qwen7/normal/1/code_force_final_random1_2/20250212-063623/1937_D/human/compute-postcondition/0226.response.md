Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state defines that `i` is 3.
2. `n` is greater than 0, but its exact value is not needed for this specific print statement.
3. `l` is 2.
4. `r` is 1.
5. The print statement is `print(i + 1, end=' ')`.

Given that `i` is explicitly defined as 3, we can directly substitute this value into the expression `i + 1`.

So, `i + 1` becomes `3 + 1`, which equals 4.

The `end=' '` parameter in the print function specifies that there should be a space instead of a newline after the printed value.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **4 **
