Output State: **`i` is less than `n`, `n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is equal to '>', `l` is increased by 1, `a` is equal to `A[l]` if `l < r`, `x` is greater than or equal to 0, `b` is equal to `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)` if `l < r`, and `b` is equal to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r` if `l - r > 0` and `r` is not 0, otherwise the conditions remain as initially stated.**

Explanation: The line `l += 1` increments the value of `l` by 1. All other variables and their relationships remain unchanged according to the initial conditions provided.
