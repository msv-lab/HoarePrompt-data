Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is the value of `B[r]`, `b` is the value of `A[l - 1]`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `A[l - 1]` to the variable `b`. The values of `i`, `n`, `r`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `i` is still `i + 1`, `n` is still greater than 0, `r` is still decreased by 1, and `a` is still the value of `B[r]`. The new variable `b` is now set to the value of `A[l - 1]`.
