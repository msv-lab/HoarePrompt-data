Output State: **`i` is equal to `n-7`, `j` is 3, `n` must be greater than 0, `A` is a list of integers, `idx_A` is a list of all indices in `s` where the character is '>', in the order they appear, `B` is a list of integers with an additional element `0` appended, `idx_B` is a list of all indices in `s` where the character is '<', in the order they appear, and now `idx_B` includes the index `i` if `s[i] == '<'`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `B.append(0)` appends the integer `0` to the list `B`. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
