Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, `l` is 3, `r` is 2, `b` is -15.**

Explanation: Initially, `l` is 2 and `r` is 2. Since `l` is less than `r`, `b` is calculated as -15. After executing `l += 1`, the value of `l` becomes 3. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `r`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes `l` being increased to 3 while keeping the condition `b` is -15 due to the initial condition check.
