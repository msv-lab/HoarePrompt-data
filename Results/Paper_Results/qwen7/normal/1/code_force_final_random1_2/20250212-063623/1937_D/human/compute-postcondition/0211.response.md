Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state provides us with the following information:
   - `i` is 3
   - `n` is greater than 0 (but the exact value of `n` is not specified)
   - `l` is 2
   - `r` is 2

2. The print statement is `print(n - i, end=' ')`.

3. We need to determine the value of `n - i`:
   - Since `i` is explicitly given as 3, we substitute this value into the expression.
   - The value of `n` is not explicitly given, but it is stated to be greater than 0. Therefore, `n` can be any positive integer.

4. The expression `n - i` simplifies to `n - 3`.

5. The `end=' '` parameter in the print function means that instead of printing a newline character (`\n`) after the output, a space character (`' '` will be used).

6. Therefore, the print statement will output the value of `n - 3` followed by a space.

Output: **n - 3 (where n is a positive integer greater than 0)**
