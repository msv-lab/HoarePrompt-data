Output: **12 2**

Explanation:
- `i` is explicitly given as 3.
- `a` is explicitly given as 8.
- `b` is explicitly given as -12.
- The expression `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1` evaluates as follows:
  - `a * 2` is `8 * 2` which equals 16.
  - `b * 2` is `-12 * 2` which equals -24.
  - Adding these together with `i + 1` gives `16 - 24 + 3 + 1`, which simplifies to -4 + 4, resulting in 12.
- The `end=' '` parameter in the `print` function ensures that the output is followed by a space instead of a newline. Since there is no second argument to the `print` function, it only prints the calculated value, which is 12, followed by a space.
