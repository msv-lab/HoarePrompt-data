Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the value of `A[l]`, `x` is `r - (l + 2)`, `b` is the value of `B[r - 1]`**.

The code assigns the value of `B[r - 1]` to the variable `b`. No other changes are made to the existing variables. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, `a`, and `x` remain unchanged, and the new variable `b` is assigned the value of `B[r - 1]`.
