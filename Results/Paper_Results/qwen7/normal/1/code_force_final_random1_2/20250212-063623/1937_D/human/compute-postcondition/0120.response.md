Output State: **`i` must be less than `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, the character at index `i` in string `s` is not '>', `r` is decreased by 1, and `l` is greater than 0; `a` is the character at index `l-1` in string `r`; `a` is updated to `ord(a) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `a` by adding `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l` to the ASCII value of `a`. Since `idx_A[l - 1]` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot simplify it further. However, the conditions and relationships between the variables remain unchanged.
