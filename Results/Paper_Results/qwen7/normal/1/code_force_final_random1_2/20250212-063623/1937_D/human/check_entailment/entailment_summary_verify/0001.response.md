### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires calculating the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell. The pinball's movement is determined by the characters in the string `s`, where `<` means move left and `>` means move right. After each move, the direction at the current cell is reversed.

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the grid and the string `s` representing the directions.
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to compute the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell.
   - The code uses two arrays `A` and `B` to store intermediate results for the left and right traversals respectively.
   - The logic for computing the time involves iterating through the string `s` and using the precomputed values in `A` and `B` to determine the time for each cell.

3. **Function Summary Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` first processes the string from left to right to compute and store values in `A` and `idx_A`.
   - Then, it processes the string from right to left to compute and store values in `B` and `idx_B`.
   - Finally, it iterates through the string again, using the computed values in `A`, `B`, `idx_A`, and `idx_B` to determine and print a series of integers. These integers are derived from the positions and counts of `<` and `>` characters in the string, and their calculations involve arithmetic operations based on the indices and lengths of these characters.

4. **Verification**:
   - The code correctly handles the left traversal by storing the cumulative times in array `A`.
   - The code correctly handles the right traversal by storing the cumulative times in array `B`.
   - The main loop in `func_1` correctly computes the time for each cell by combining the left and right traversal times.
   - However, there are several issues with the logic in the main loop:
     - The logic for combining the left and right traversal times is overly complex and does not accurately reflect the pinball's movement.
     - The boundary conditions are not handled correctly, especially when the pinball reaches the edges of the grid.
     - The use of `idx_A` and `idx_B` to compute the times is incorrect, as it does not account for the reversal of directions properly.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not handle the case where the pinball starts at the edge of the grid correctly.
   - The code does not handle the case where the pinball moves in a single direction without reversing, leading to incorrect time calculations.

Given the detailed analysis, the provided code does not correctly implement the solution for the problem. The logic for combining the left and right traversal times is flawed, and the boundary conditions are not handled correctly.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in combining the left and right traversal times and the incorrect handling of boundary conditions.
