To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the expression being evaluated:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `i + 1`: This means `i` is incremented by 1.
   - `n` is greater than 0: This means `n` is a positive integer.
   - `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`: Here, `a` is a combination of the last element of `B` (or `B[r-1]`), adjusted by the difference between `idx_B[r-1]` and `i`, multiplied by `r`.
   - `b` is `A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`: Here, `b` is a complex expression involving elements from `A`, indices from `idx_A`, and the difference `i - idx_A[l-1]`.

2. **Expression to Evaluate:**
   ```python
   print(a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i), end=' ')
   ```

Given the complexity of `a` and `b`, let's simplify the expression step-by-step:

- `a * 2 + b * 2` simplifies to `2 * (a + b)`.
- The term `(n - i)` is straightforward, where `n` is a positive integer and `i` is incremented by 1.

Since the exact values of `B`, `idx_B`, `A`, `idx_A`, `r`, `l`, and `i` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical values of `a` and `b`. However, we can describe the expression in terms of these variables.

Thus, the expression to be printed is:
\[ 2 \times (a + b) + (n - i) \]

Output: **2 * (B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r + A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r) + (n - i)**
