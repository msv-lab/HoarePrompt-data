Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Variables:**
   - `i` is 3.
   - `n` is greater than 0 (though `n` is not used in the print statement).
   - `l` is 2.
   - `r` is 2.
   - `x` is -2.
   - `b` is explicitly calculated as \((-2 - 3) * (2 + 1)\), which equals \(-5 * 3 = -15\).

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The expression being printed is `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1`.
   - Since `a` is not defined in the initial state, it must be a typo or a placeholder. Given the context, it's likely that `a` should be `x` (since `x` is the only other variable with a value).
   - Substituting the known values:
     - `a` is assumed to be `-2` (the value of `x`).
     - `b` is `-15`.
     - `i` is `3`.

3. **Expression Calculation:**
   - `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1` becomes \(-2 * 2 + (-15) * 2 + 3 + 1\).
   - Simplifying the expression:
     - \(-2 * 2 = -4\).
     - \(-15 * 2 = -30\).
     - So, \(-4 - 30 + 3 + 1 = -30\).

Therefore, the print statement will output the result of the expression, which is \(-30\).

Output: **-30**
