Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is the value of `A[l]`, `x` is `r - (l + 2)`, `b` is the value of `B[r - 1] - B[x] - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b` by subtracting `(idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)` from its current value. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated value of `b` is the original value of `b` minus the specified expression.
