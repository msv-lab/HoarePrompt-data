Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is the value of `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, `b` is the value of `B[r]`**.

This means that the value of `b` is now assigned to the value of `B[r]`, while the other variables retain their previous conditions and values.
