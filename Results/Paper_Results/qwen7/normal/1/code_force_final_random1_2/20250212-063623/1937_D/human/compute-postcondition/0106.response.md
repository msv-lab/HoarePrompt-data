Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is less than `n`, and `n` is greater than 0.
- The current value of `s[i]` is '>'.
- `l` is greater than `r`.
- `b` is updated according to the condition: `b = b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r` if `l - r > 0`. Otherwise, the condition remains as initially stated.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i), end=' ')
```

Here's the breakdown:
- `a` is not mentioned in the initial state, so it is unknown.
- `b` is updated based on the condition involving `idx_A[l - 1]`, but the exact value of `b` is not provided.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is less than `n`.

Given these details, we can only express the output in terms of the known quantities.

Output: **a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)**
