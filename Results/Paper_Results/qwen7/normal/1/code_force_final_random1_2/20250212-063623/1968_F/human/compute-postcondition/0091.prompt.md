Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `idx` is equal to `n + 5`, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `n` must be at least 1, `q` is an integer value from `data[4]`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element from `a[1]` to `a[n + 1]` is an integer value from `data` starting from `data[5]`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element from `pf[1]` to `pf[n + 1]` is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `a` up to that index, `mp` is a dictionary where keys are unique XOR values of subarrays of `a` and values are lists of indices where these XOR values occur.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `idx` will be incremented to `n + 5` because it starts at 5 and increments by 1 in each iteration of the loop, which runs `n` times. The loop constructs the list `a` and the prefix XOR list `pf` as described. The dictionary `mp` will contain all unique XOR values of subarrays of `a` as keys, and their corresponding indices as values.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(q):
    l = int(data[idx])
    r = int(data[idx + 1])
    idx += 2
    x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]
    if x == 0:
        results.append('YES')
        continue
    v1 = mp.get(pf[r], [])
    v2 = mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])
    it1 = bisect.bisect_left(v1, l)
    it2 = bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
    if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] <= r and v2[it2] >= l:
        results.append('YES')
    else:
        results.append('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `idx` is equal to `n + 7`, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is a list that may contain 'YES' and/or 'NO', `n` must be at least 1, `q` is a positive integer value from `data[4]`, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index of the leftmost insertion point of `l` in the sorted list `v1`, `it2` is `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`. If the condition `(it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] <= r) and (v2[it2] >= l))` is true, then the function ensures that `results` contains 'YES'. Otherwise, `results` contains 'NO'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `idx` is equal to `n + 9`, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing either 'YES' or 'NO' and possibly other elements, `n` must be at least 1, `q` is a positive integer value from `data[4]` minus 1, `l` is now the integer value of `data[idx]`, `r` is now the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is now assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index of the leftmost insertion point of `l` in the sorted list `v1`, `it2` is `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`. If certain conditions (it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] <= r and v2[it2] >= l) are met, `results` contains 'YES'. Otherwise, `results` contains 'NO'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `idx` is equal to `n + 11`, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing either 'YES', 'YES' or 'YES', 'NO' as its last elements, `n` must be at least 1, `q` must be greater than 0, `l` is now the integer value of `data[idx]`, `r` is now the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `x` is updated to `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is now assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it2` is the index of the leftmost insertion point of `r` in `v2` minus 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
