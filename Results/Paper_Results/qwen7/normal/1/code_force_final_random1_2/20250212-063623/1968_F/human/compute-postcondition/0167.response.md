The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. It does not change the values of any variables but rather continues the loop based on the conditions defined outside the scope of the `continue` statement. Therefore, the values of `data`, `idx`, `results`, `l`, `r`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, and `it2` remain unchanged from their previous states.

Output State: **`data` remains unchanged, `idx` is increased by 6 (4 * q + 2), `results` is a list of length q + 1 with one additional element 'YES', `l` is now an integer value from `data` at the index `idx`, `r` is an integer value from `data` at the index `idx + 1`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` and `v2` will be updated based on the new `pf[r]` and `pf[l - 1]`, `it2` will be recalculated based on the new `v2`.**
