Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop uses `_` as an iterator, but since it is a dummy variable, it doesn't affect the initial state. The only object involved in the loop is `q`, which determines how many times the loop will run.

2. **Determine the necessary adjustments**: The loop will execute based on the value of `q`. If `q` is 0, the loop will not execute at all. Therefore, we need to ensure that `q` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

3. **State the modified state**: We need to adjust the state such that the loop can execute. This means ensuring that `q` is greater than 0.

**State:**
**`q` must be greater than 0**
