Output State: **`data` remains unchanged, `idx` is increased by 4 * q, `results` is a list of length q with one additional 'YES', `l` is not defined, `r` is not defined, `x` is assigned the value of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code snippet appends the string `'YES'` to the list `results`. Since `results` was initially a list of length `q` containing either 'YES' or 'NO', after appending `'YES'`, the list now has a length of `q + 1` with the last element being 'YES'. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
