Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the solution for the given problem. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and then processes it. This approach is efficient for handling multiple test cases and queries.

2. **Prefix XOR Calculation**: It calculates the prefix XOR values (`pf`) for the array. This is crucial for determining the XOR of any subarray efficiently.

3. **Mapping XOR Values**: It uses a dictionary (`mp`) to map each unique prefix XOR value to its indices. This helps in quickly finding the indices where the prefix XOR matches a specific value.

4. **Query Processing**: For each query, it computes the XOR of the subarray and checks if it can be divided into parts with equal XOR values. The logic handles both the case where the XOR of the subarray is zero and the case where it is non-zero.

5. **Binary Search**: The use of binary search (`bisect.bisect_left`) ensures that the program can efficiently find the relevant indices in the mapped list.

6. **Output Formatting**: The program formats the output correctly, appending an empty string after processing each test case.

Given that the program follows the problem description accurately and handles all edge cases (such as subarrays with XOR equal to zero), the correctness of the program is confirmed.
