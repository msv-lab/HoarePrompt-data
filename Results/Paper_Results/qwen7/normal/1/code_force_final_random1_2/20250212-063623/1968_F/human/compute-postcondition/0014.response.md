Output State: **`idx` is 6, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `n` must be at least 1, `q` is an integer value from `data[4]`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` with the first element being `int(data[idx-1])`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, `mp` is a dictionary with key (0) and value [0], `i` is 2**.

Explanation: The value of `idx` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 5 to 6. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
