Output State: **`q` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `idx` is 2 * n + 3, `data` is a list of values, `a` is an empty list, `pf` is an empty list, `mp` is an empty dictionary, `l` is the value of `data[2 * n + 1]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[2 * n + 2]`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`**

In this output state, the variable `x` is assigned the value of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`. All other variables retain their initial states as described in the initial state.
