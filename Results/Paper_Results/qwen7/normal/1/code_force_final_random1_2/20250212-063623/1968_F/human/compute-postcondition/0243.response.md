Output State: **`idx` is now 2 * n + 5, `l` is the value of `data[2 * n + 1]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index found by bisecting the leftmost position in `v1` where `l` can be inserted while maintaining the sorted order of `v1`, `it2` is the index found by bisecting the leftmost position in `v2` where `r` can be inserted while maintaining the sorted order of `v2` minus 1, `results` is `['YES', 'NO']` if `x == 0` and the condition `it1 < len(v1)` and `it2 >= 0` and `v1[it1] <= r` and `v2[it2] >= l` is true, otherwise `results` is `results.append('NO')`, `x` is updated to `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index found by bisecting the leftmost position in `v1` where `l` can be inserted while maintaining the sorted order of `v1`, `it2` is the index found by bisecting the leftmost position in `v2` where `r` can be inserted while maintaining the sorted order of `v2` minus 1.**

In natural language: The value of `idx` remains 2 * n + 5, `l` remains the value of `data[2 * n + 1]`, and `r` remains the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`. The value of `x` is updated to `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`. The value of `v1` is updated to `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, and `v2` is updated to `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`. The value of `it1` is the index found by bisecting the leftmost position in `v1` where `l` can be inserted while maintaining the sorted order of `v1`. The value of `it2` is the index found by bisecting the leftmost position in `v2` where `r` can be inserted while maintaining the sorted order of `v2` minus 1. The list `results` is set to `['YES', 'NO']` if `x == 0` and the condition `it1 < len(v1)` and `it2 >= 0` and `v1[it1] <= r` and `v2[it2] >= l` is true, otherwise `results` appends 'NO'. The value of `x` is updated again to `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`. The value of `v2` is updated to `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`. The value of `it1` is the index found by bisecting the leftmost position in `v1` where `l` can be inserted while maintaining the sorted order of `v1`. The value of `it2` is the index found by bisecting the leftmost position in `v2` where `r` can be inserted while maintaining the sorted order of `v2` minus 1.
