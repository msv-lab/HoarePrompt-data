Output State: **`data` remains unchanged, `idx` is increased by 4 * q, `results` is a list of length q containing either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions inside the loop, `l` is not defined, `r` is not defined**.

Explanation: The code `idx += 2` increments the value of `idx` by 2. Since `idx` was initially increased by `2 * q`, after executing this line, `idx` will be increased by an additional 2, making it increased by `4 * q` in total. The values of `data`, `results`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.
