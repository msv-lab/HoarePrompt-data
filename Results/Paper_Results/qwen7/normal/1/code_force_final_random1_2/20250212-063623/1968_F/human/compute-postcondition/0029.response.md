Output State: **`idx` is 7, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `n` must be at least 1, `q` is an integer value from `data[4]`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` with the first element being `int(data[5])` and the fourth element being `int(data[idx])`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` with the second element being `pf[1] ^ int(data[5])`, `mp` is a dictionary with key (0) and value [0], `i` is 4, `pf[i]` is now `pf[3] ^ int(data[5])`, `mp[pf[i]].append(i)` is executed, and `mp` now contains the key `pf[i]` with the value `[3, 4]` since `pf[3] ^ int(data[5])` was already a key in `mp` before and its value was an empty list, which is now appended with `4`.**

This means that the dictionary `mp` now contains the key `pf[3] ^ int(data[5])` with the value `[3, 4]` because `4` was appended to the existing list associated with that key.
