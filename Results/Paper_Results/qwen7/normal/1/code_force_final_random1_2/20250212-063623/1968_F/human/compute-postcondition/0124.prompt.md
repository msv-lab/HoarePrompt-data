Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `idx` is equal to `2 * n + 7`, `t` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `results` contains 'NO', `n` is now the value of `int(data[idx])`, `q` is the value of `int(data[idx + 1])`, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index of the leftmost insertion point of `l` in the sorted list `v1`, `it2` is `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`, `a` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`, `pf` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`, `mp` is updated to {(0): [0]}, `t` is decremented by 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    a[i] = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]
    if pf[i] not in mp:
        mp[pf[i]] = []
    mp[pf[i]].append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a[i]' is now the value of `int(data[idx])', `idx` is increased by 1, `pf[i]' is `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]' and `pf[i]` is added to `mp` with an empty list as its value, and `mp[pf[i]]` contains the list `[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a[i]` is now the value of `int(data[idx])`, `idx` is `idx + 2`, `pf[i]` is `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`, `pf[i + 1]` is `pf[i] ^ a[i + 1]`, `mp[pf[i + 1]]` contains the list `[i + 1]`, and `mp[pf[i]].append(i)` appends `i` to the list associated with `pf[i]` in `mp`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a[i]` is now the value of `int(data[idx])`, `idx` is `idx + 5`, `pf[i]` is `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]` where `i` is `k + 1`, `pf[i + 1]` is `pf[i] ^ a[i + 1]` where `i + 1` is `k + 2`, and `mp[pf[i]]` does not contain `[k + 1]` anymore; `mp[pf[i + 1]]` is an empty list if `pf[i + 1]` is not in `mp`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
