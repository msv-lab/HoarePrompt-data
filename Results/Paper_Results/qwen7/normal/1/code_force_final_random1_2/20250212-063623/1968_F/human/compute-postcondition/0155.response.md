Output State: **`data` remains unchanged, `idx` is increased by 4 * q, `results` is a list of length q with one additional 'YES', `l` is not defined, `r` is not defined, `x` is assigned the value of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index found by bisecting the left side of `v1` starting from 0 up to the position of `l`.**

Explanation: The code `it1 = bisect.bisect_left(v1, l)` performs a binary search to find the insertion point for `l` in the sorted list `v1`. Since `v1` is obtained from `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, its value depends on the dictionary `mp` and the key `pf[r]`. The variable `it1` is assigned the index where `l` would be inserted to keep `v1` sorted. The other variables remain unchanged as no further operations are performed on them.
