Output State: **`i` is 1; `n` is a non-negative integer; `idx` is increased by 1; `pf[1]` is `pf[0] ^ a[1]`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `pf[i]` to be the bitwise XOR of `pf[i - 1]` and `a[i]`. Given that `i` is initially 1, `pf[1]` is set to `pf[0] ^ a[1]`. The other variables (`n` and `idx`) remain unchanged as per the initial state.
