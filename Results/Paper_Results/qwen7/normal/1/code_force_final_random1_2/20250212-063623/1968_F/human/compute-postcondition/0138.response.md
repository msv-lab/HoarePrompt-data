Output State: **`data` remains unchanged, `idx` is increased by 2, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx - 2]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index found by `bisect.bisect_left(v1, l)`, `it2` is the index found by `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`**.

Explanation: The code calculates the index `it2` which is the index found by performing `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`. The values of `data`, `idx`, `l`, `r`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1` are updated according to the operations performed. The other variables remain unchanged.
