Output State: **`idx` is now 2 * n + 5, `l` is the value of `data[2 * n + 1]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index found by bisecting the leftmost position in `v1` where `l` can be inserted while maintaining the sorted order of `v1`, `it2` is the index found by bisecting the leftmost position in `v2` where `r` can be inserted while maintaining the sorted order of `v2` minus 1, `results` is `['YES']` appended with 'NO', `x` is updated to `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`**

Explanation: The line `results.append('YES')` appends the string `'YES'` to the list `results`. Since `results` was either `['YES']` or had the condition `['YES']` followed by 'NO', appending `'YES'` changes its state to `['YES', 'NO']`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
