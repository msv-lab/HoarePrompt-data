State: **`idx` is 5, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `n` must be at least 1, `q` is an integer value from `data[4]`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, `mp` is a dictionary with key (0) and value [0], `i` is 1** 

Explanation:
- The loop variable `i` is initialized to 1 in the range function (`range(1, n + 1)`).
- The loop will start executing if `n` is at least 1, as the range function will generate values starting from 1 up to `n`.
- All other variables (`idx`, `t`, `results`, `q`, `a`, `pf`, `mp`) do not affect the loop's execution condition and are already correctly described in their initial states.
