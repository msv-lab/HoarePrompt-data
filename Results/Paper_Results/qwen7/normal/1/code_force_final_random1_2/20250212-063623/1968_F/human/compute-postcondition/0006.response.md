Output State: **`idx` is 3, `t` must be greater than 0, results is an empty list, `n` is an integer value from `data[2]`**.

Explanation: The variable `n` is assigned the value of `data[idx]` converted to an integer. Since `idx` was initially 2, `n` now holds the integer value of `data[2]`. The other variables (`idx`, `t`, and `results`) remain unchanged according to their initial states.
