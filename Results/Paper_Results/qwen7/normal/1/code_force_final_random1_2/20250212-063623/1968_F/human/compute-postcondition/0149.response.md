Output State: **`data` remains unchanged, `idx` is increased by 4 * q, `results` is a list of length q containing either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions inside the loop, `l` is not defined, `r` is not defined, `x` is assigned the value of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`**.

In this output state, the variable `x` is assigned the value of the bitwise XOR operation between `pf[r]` and `pf[l - 1]`. All other variables remain in their initial states as described.
