Output State: **`data` remains unchanged, `idx` is increased by 4 * q, `results` is a list of length q with one additional 'NO', `l` is not defined, `r` is not defined, `x` is assigned the value of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it2` is the index found by bisecting the left side of `v2` starting from -1 up to the position of `r - 1`.**

Explanation: The code snippet appends 'NO' to the `results` list. The length of `results` was previously `q`, and now it is `q + 1` with the last element being 'NO'. All other variables (`data`, `idx`, `l`, `r`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it2`) remain unchanged with their previous values.
