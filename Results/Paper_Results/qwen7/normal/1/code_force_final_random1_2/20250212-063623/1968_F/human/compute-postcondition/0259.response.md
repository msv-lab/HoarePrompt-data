Output State: **`idx` is now \(2 \times n + 9\), `l` is now the value of `data[2 \times n + 1]`, `r` is now the integer value of `data[idx + 1] + 1\), `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index found by bisecting the leftmost position in `v1` where `l` can be inserted while maintaining the sorted order of `v1`, `it2` is the index found by bisecting the leftmost position in `v2` where `r` can be inserted while maintaining the sorted order of `v2` minus 1, and `it2` is updated to be `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1` and `_` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code updates `it2` to be the index found by bisecting the leftmost position in `v2` where `r` can be inserted while maintaining the sorted order of `v2` minus 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
