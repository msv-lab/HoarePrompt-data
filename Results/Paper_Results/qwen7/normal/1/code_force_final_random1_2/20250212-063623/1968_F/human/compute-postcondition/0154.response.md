Output State: **`data` remains unchanged, `idx` is increased by 4 * q, `results` is a list of length q with one additional 'YES', `l` is not defined, `r` is not defined, `x` is assigned the value of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`**.

This means that the variable `v2` is now assigned the value returned by `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`. Similarly, `v1` was already assigned the value returned by `mp.get(pf[r], [])`. The other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
