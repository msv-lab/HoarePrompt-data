Output State: **`idx` is equal to `n + 7 + n`, `t` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `results` contains 'NO', `n` is now the value of `int(data[idx])`, `q` is the value of `int(data[idx + 1])`, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index of the leftmost insertion point of `l` in the sorted list `v1`, `it2` is `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`, `a` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`, `pf` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`.**

Explanation: The code initializes the `pf` array to a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`. All other variables retain their previous states as described in the initial state.
