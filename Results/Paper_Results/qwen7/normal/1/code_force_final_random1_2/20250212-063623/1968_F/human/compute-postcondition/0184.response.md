Output State: **`data` list remains unchanged, `idx` is increased by 2 * q + 2, `results` is a list of length `q` with each element being either 'YES' or 'NO', and an empty string is appended to `results`; `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where every element is 0; `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` where every element is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes a new list `pf` with `n + 1` elements, all set to 0. This does not affect the values of `data`, `idx`, `results`, or `a`. Therefore, their states remain as described in the initial state.
