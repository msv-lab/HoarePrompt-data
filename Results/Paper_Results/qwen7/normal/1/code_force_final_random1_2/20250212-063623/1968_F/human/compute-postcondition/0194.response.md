Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a non-negative integer, `idx` is increased by 1, `pf[1]` is `pf[0] ^ a[1]`, `mp[pf[2]]` is a list containing `[2]`**.

Explanation: The code snippet `mp[pf[i]].append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 2) to the list `mp[pf[i]]`. Since `i` is 2, `mp[pf[2]]` is created and contains the value `[2]`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
