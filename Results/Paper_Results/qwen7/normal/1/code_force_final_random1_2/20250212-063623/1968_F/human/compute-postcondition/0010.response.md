Output State: **`idx` is 5, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer value from `data[2]`, `q` is an integer value from `data[4]`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes a new list `pf` with `n + 1` elements, all set to 0. This changes the value of `pf` but does not affect the other variables mentioned in the initial state.
