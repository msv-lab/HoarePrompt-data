Output State: **`a[i]` is now the value of `data[idx]` converted to an integer; `idx` is increased by 1; `pf[i]` is `pf[i - 1]` XOR `a[i]`; `mp[pf[i]]` is a list with no elements.**

Explanation: The line `mp[pf[i]] = []` creates an empty list at the key `pf[i]` in the dictionary `mp`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the updated states of the variables are as described above.
