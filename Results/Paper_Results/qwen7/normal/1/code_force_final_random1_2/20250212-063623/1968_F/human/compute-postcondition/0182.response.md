Output State: **`data` list remains unchanged, `idx` is increased by 2 * q + 2, `results` is a list of length `q` with each element being either 'YES' or 'NO', and an empty string is appended to `results`; `q` is an integer from the list `data` at index `idx + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `idx += 2` increases the value of `idx` by 2. The initial increase by `2 * q` is already accounted for, so we add 2 more to that. All other variables and their conditions remain the same as the initial state.
