Postcondition: `a[i]` is now the value of `int(data[idx])`, `idx` is `idx + 5`, `pf[i]` is `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]` where `i` is `k + 1`, `pf[i + 1]` is `pf[i] ^ a[i + 1]` where `i + 1` is `k + 2`, and `mp[pf[i]]` does not contain `[k + 1]` anymore. If `pf[i]` is not in `mp`, then `mp[pf[i + 1]]` is an empty list; otherwise, no change is made to `mp`.
