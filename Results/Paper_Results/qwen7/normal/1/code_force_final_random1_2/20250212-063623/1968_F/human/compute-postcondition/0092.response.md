Output State: **`idx` is equal to `n + 5 + n`, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` contains 'NO', `n` must be at least 1, `q` is a non-negative integer value from `data[4]` after decrementing by the number of iterations, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index of the leftmost insertion point of `l` in the sorted list `v1`, `it2` is `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`.**

Explanation: The code appends an empty string to the `results` list. Since the condition for appending 'YES' to `results` was not met, `results` remains unchanged and still contains 'NO'. All other variables and their states remain the same as the initial state.
