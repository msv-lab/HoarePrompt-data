Output State: **`i` is 3; `idx` is 4; `a` list has an element at index 3 assigned to `int(data[idx])`.**

Explanation: The variable `idx` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 3 to 4. The values of `i` and the list `a` remain unchanged. The element at index 3 in the list `a` is still assigned to `int(data[idx])`, which means it is now assigned to `int(data[4])`.
