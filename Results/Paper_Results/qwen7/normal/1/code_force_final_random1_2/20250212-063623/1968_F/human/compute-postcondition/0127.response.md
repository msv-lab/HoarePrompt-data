Output State: **`data` is unchanged, `idx` is unchanged, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`**.

This means that the value of `r` is set to the integer value of the element at index `idx + 1` in the list `data`. The values of `data`, `idx`, and `l` remain unchanged from their initial states.
