Postcondition: `idx` is 7, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `n` must be at least 1, `q` is an integer value from `data[4]`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` with the first element being `int(data[5])` and the fourth element being `int(data[idx])`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` with the second element being `pf[1] ^ int(data[5])`, `mp` is a dictionary with key (0) and value [0], `i` is 4, `pf[i]` is now `pf[3] ^ int(data[5])`, if `pf[i]` is not in `mp`, then `mp[pf[i]]` is an empty list.
