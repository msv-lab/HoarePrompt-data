Output State: **`a[i]' is now the value of `int(data[idx])', idx is increased by 1, and the values of `data' remain unchanged**.

This means that the index `idx` has been incremented by 1, but the values of `a[i]`, `data`, and `idx` (other than the increment) remain as they were in the initial state.
