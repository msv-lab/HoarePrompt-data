The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not change any variable values or affect the program flow in a way that would alter the initial state.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`idx` is equal to `n + 11`, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing 'YES' as its last element, `n` must be at least 1, `q` must be greater than 0, `l` is now the integer value of `data[idx]`, `r` is now the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is now assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index of the leftmost insertion point of `l` in the sorted list `v1`, `it2` is `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`, `x` is updated to `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`.**
