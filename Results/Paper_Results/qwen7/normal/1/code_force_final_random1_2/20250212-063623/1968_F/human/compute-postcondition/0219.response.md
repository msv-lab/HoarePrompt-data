The code appends the string 'YES' to the `results` list. Since `results` was not mentioned in the initial state, we assume it is an empty list before this operation. After appending 'YES', the list `results` now contains 'YES'. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`q` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `idx` is 2 * n + 3, `data` is a list of values, `a` is an empty list, `pf` is an empty list, `mp` is an empty dictionary, `l` is the value of `data[2 * n + 1]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[2 * n + 2]`, the current value of `x` is 0, `results` is ['YES']**
