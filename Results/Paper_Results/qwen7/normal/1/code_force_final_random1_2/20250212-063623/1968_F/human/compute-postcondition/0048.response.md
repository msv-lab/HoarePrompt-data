The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since there is no loop context provided, the variables outside of any loop remain unchanged. The states of the variables `idx`, `t`, `results`, `n`, `q`, `l`, `r`, and `x` are not affected by the `continue` statement. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`idx` is equal to `n + 7`, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is now ['YES'], `n` must be at least 1, `q` is a positive integer value from `data[4]`, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, and `x` is equal to 0.**
