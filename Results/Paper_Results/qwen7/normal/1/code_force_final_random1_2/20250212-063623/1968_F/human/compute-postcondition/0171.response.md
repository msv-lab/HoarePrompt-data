Output State: **`data` remains unchanged, `idx` is increased by 6 (4 * q + 2), `results` is a list of length q + 1 with one additional element 'YES', `l` is now an integer value from `data` at the index `idx`, `r` is an integer value from `data` at the index `idx + 1`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of the list obtained from `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is now `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index of the first position in `v1` where `l` can be inserted while maintaining the sorted order of `v1`.**

This means that the variable `it1` is updated to reflect the position where `l` would fit in the sorted list `v1`, without changing the values of the other variables.
