Output State: The `data` list remains unchanged, `idx` is increased by `2 * q`, `results` is a list of length `q` with each element being either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions checked within the loop for each iteration. After all iterations, `idx` will be at its final position, which is `2 * q` more than its initial position. For each iteration `_` in the range of `q`, the loop calculates `l` and `r` from the `data` list, computes `x` as `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, and checks if there exist indices in `mp[pf[r]]` and `mp[pf[l - 1]]` that satisfy the given conditions. If the conditions are met, 'YES' is appended to `results`; otherwise, 'NO' is appended. The final `results` list contains the outcomes of these checks for all `q` iterations.
