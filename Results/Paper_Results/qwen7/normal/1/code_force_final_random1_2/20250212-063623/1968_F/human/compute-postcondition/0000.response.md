Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, data is a list of strings representing the split input, each element corresponding to either t, n, q, or the n integers a_1,...,a_n.**

Explanation: The code `data = input().split()` reads a line of input from the standard input and splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace. The variables `t`, `n`, `q`, and the list of integers `a_1,...,a_n` are not directly updated by this line of code; instead, the input is stored in the variable `data`. The initial conditions for `t` remain unchanged, and the structure of `data` reflects the split input.
