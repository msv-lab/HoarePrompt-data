Output State: **`idx` is equal to `n + 5`, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `n` must be at least 1, `q` is a positive integer value from `data[4]`, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `data[idx + 1]` to the variable `r`, where `idx` is `n + 5`. Since `data[idx + 1]` is being converted to an integer using `int()`, `r` now holds the integer value of the element at index `idx + 1` in the `data` list. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
