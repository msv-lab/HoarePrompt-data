Output State: **`idx` is equal to `n + 7`, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is now either an empty list or a list containing 'YES', `n` must be at least 1, `q` is a positive integer value from `data[4]`, `l` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index of the leftmost insertion point of `l` in the sorted list `v1`.**

Explanation: The code `it1 = bisect.bisect_left(v1, l)` calculates the index of the leftmost position where `l` can be inserted into the sorted list `v1` without violating the order. This operation does not change the values of any other variables. Therefore, all the variables remain in their previous states except for `it1`, which is updated to reflect the index calculated by the `bisect_left` function.
