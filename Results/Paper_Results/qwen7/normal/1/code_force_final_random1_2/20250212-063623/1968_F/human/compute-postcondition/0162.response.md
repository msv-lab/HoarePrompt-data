Output State: **`data` remains unchanged, `idx` is increased by 4 * q, `results` is a list of length q + 1 with one additional element, which is either 'YES' or 'NO', `l` is now an integer value from `data` at the index `idx`, `r` and `x` are not yet defined, `v1` and `v2` will be updated based on the new `pf[r]` and `pf[l - 1]`, `it2` will be recalculated based on the new `v2`.**

This output state reflects that the value of `l` has been assigned the integer value from `data` at the index specified by `idx`, while other variables remain in their previous states or are yet to be defined.
