Output State: **`data` list remains unchanged, `idx` is increased by `2 * q`, `results` is a list of length `q` with each element being either 'YES' or 'NO', and an empty string is appended to `results`; `q` is an integer from the list `data` at index `idx + 1`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of the element at index `idx + 1` in the `data` list to the variable `q`. The other variables remain in their previous states. The value of `q` is updated to the value of the element in the `data` list at the new index `idx + 1`.
