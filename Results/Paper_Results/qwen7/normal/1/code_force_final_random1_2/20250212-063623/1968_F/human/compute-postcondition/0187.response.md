Output State: **`i` is 1; `n` is a non-negative integer; `a[1]` is int(data[idx])**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `int(data[idx])` to the element `a[1]`. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 1, and `n` remains a non-negative integer. The value of `data[idx]` is converted to an integer before being assigned to `a[1]`.
