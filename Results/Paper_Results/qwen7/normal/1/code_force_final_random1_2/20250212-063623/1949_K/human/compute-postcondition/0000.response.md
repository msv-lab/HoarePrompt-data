Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are integers such that 1 ≤ `na`, `nb`, `nc` ≤ `n`-2 and `na` + `nb` + `nc` = `n`, and `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers such that 1 ≤ `numbers[i]` ≤ 10^9 for all 0 ≤ i < `n`; the list `numbers` is sorted in descending order.**

This means that the list `numbers` has been sorted in reverse order (from largest to smallest), while the values of `n`, `na`, `nb`, `nc`, and the list `numbers` itself have been updated accordingly.
