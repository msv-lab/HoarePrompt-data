Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: n (an integer between 3 and 200,000), na, nb, and nc (integers between 1 and n-2 such that their sum equals n), and a list of n positive integers called numbers. If it's possible to divide the list into three groups with sizes na, nb, and nc respectively, where the sums of the elements in each group are equal, it returns 'YES' along with the sizes of the three groups. Otherwise, it returns 'NO'.**
