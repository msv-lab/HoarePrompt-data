Output State: **`sum_a` is 0, `sum_b` is 0, `sum_c` is 0, `numbers` is a non-empty list, `distribute_number(num)` has been called with an argument `num`**

The code `distribute_number(num)` has been called, but the function itself is not defined in the provided code snippet. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact changes it makes to the variables. However, we know that the function call has been made with the argument `num`. The values of `sum_a`, `sum_b`, `sum_c`, and the list `numbers` remain unchanged from their initial states.
