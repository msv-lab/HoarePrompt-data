Let's break down the task step by step:

1. Identify the variables involved in the loop head:
   - The loop variable is `num`.
   - The iterable is `numbers`.

2. Determine the initial state of these variables before the loop starts:
   - `sum_a` is 0.
   - `sum_b` is 0.
   - `sum_c` is 0.

3. Consider what is necessary for the loop to execute:
   - The loop will execute as long as there are elements in the `numbers` list.
   - The loop variable `num` will take on each value from the `numbers` list in sequence.

4. Adjust the states of the variables mentioned in the loop head:
   - Since the loop variable `num` will be assigned values from the `numbers` list, we need to ensure that the `numbers` list is non-empty.
   - The states of `sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c` are not directly relevant to the loop's ability to execute, but they might be modified within the loop body. For the purpose of ensuring the loop can start, we don't need to change their values.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the `numbers` list to ensure it contains at least one element.

State: **`sum_a` is 0, `sum_b` is 0, `sum_c` is 0, `numbers` must be a non-empty list**
