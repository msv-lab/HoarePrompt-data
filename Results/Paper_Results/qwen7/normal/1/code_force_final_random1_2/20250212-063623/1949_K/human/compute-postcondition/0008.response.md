Output State: **`sum_a` is 0, `sum_b` is 0, `sum_c` is 0, `numbers` is a non-empty list with one less element, `distribute_number(num)` has been called with an argument `num`**.

The function `distribute_number(num)` has been called with an argument `num`, but the specifics of what `distribute_number` does are not provided. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact changes to the variables `sum_a`, `sum_b`, `sum_c`, or `numbers`. However, we know that `distribute_number(num)` has been executed, and the list `numbers` has one less element after its execution.
