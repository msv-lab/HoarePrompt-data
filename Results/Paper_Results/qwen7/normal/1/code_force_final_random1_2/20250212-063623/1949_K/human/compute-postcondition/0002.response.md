Output State: **`sum_a` is 0, `sum_b` is 0, `sum_c` is 0**

Explanation: The code initializes three variables `sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c` to 0. The values of `n`, `na`, `nb`, `nc`, `numbers`, `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, after executing the code, `sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c` are set to 0, while all other variables retain their initial values.
