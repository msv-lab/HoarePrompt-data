Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for x in a:`. The variables involved here are `x` and `a`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `a` is a list of integers entered by the user.
   - `cnt` is 1 (though `cnt` is not directly used in the loop).
   - The number of remaining iterations is the input value minus 1.

3. **Understand the loop condition**:
   - For the loop to execute, `a` must contain at least one element because the loop iterates over each element in `a`.
   - The number of iterations will be equal to the length of the list `a`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, we need to ensure that `a` contains at least one element.
   - We don't need to adjust `cnt` as it is not used in the loop itself.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is that the list `a` must contain at least one integer.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`a` is a list of integers that must have at least one integer**
