Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `a` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements.
   - The first three elements of `a` are equal and each is an odd integer.
   - `cnt` is the sum of the floor division of each of the first three elements of `a` by 2.

2. Let's denote the first three elements of `a` as `a[0]`, `a[1]`, and `a[2]`. Since they are equal and each is an odd integer, let's say `a[0] = a[1] = a[2] = k`, where `k` is an odd integer.

3. The calculation for `cnt`:
   - Each of these elements is divided by 2 and then the floor division is taken. For any odd integer `k`, `k // 2` results in an integer.
   - Therefore, `cnt = (k // 2) + (k // 2) + (k // 2) = 3 * (k // 2)`.

4. Since `k` is an odd integer, `k // 2` will result in an integer that is half of `k` rounded down. For example, if `k = 5`, then `5 // 2 = 2`.

5. Hence, `cnt` will be `3 * (k // 2)`, which is always an integer.

Given this, the `print(cnt)` statement will print the value of `cnt`.

Output: **3 * (k // 2) (where k is an odd integer and the first three elements of the list a are equal to k)**
