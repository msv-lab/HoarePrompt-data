Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `x` and the list `a`.

2. **Determine the initial conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will iterate over each element in the list `a`.
   - For the loop to start, `a` must contain at least one element.

3. **Analyze the postcondition**:
   - The postcondition states that `cnt` will be 1 if the first three elements of `a` are equal and each of these elements is an odd integer.
   - If there are fewer than three elements in `a`, `cnt` will remain 0.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since the loop will start iterating over `a`, `a` must have at least one element.
   - To satisfy the postcondition, the first three elements of `a` must be checked, so `a` must have at least three elements.
   - Each of the first three elements must be an odd integer and equal to each other.

Given these points, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure that `a` has at least three elements, all of which are odd integers and equal.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`a` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, and the first three elements of `a` must be equal and each must be an odd integer**.
