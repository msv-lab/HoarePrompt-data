You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))
        print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, p_i is a list of four non-negative integers representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the initial sequence, where 0 ≤ p_i[0] + p_i[1] + p_i[2] + p_i[3] ≤ 200.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))
        
        print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)
        
    #State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and \(t = \text{initial\_t} - n\), `p` is a list of integers where each element is the largest even number less than or equal to the corresponding input integer, the input is processed and converted into a list of integers where each element is the largest even number less than or equal to the corresponding input integer, and the loop has executed `n` times, where `n` is the total number of test cases provided.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, where for each test case, it takes a list of four integers (representing counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s) and computes a value based on specific conditions. It prints a result for each test case, indicating whether the sum of the odd counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s equals 3 and adding half the sum of all elements in the list. The function effectively reduces the count of test cases and updates the internal state by processing each input list and printing the computed value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads four integers `p_i` representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the initial sequence.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - The program processes each test case by converting the counts into a list `p` using a map function.
   - Specifically, it uses `lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2`, which essentially converts each count to either 0 or 1 depending on whether the count is odd or even. This transformation is unnecessary because the original counts are already integers and can be directly used to determine the parity (odd or even).

3. **XOR Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the sum of elements in `p` where each element is checked if it is odd (`x % 2 > 0`).
   - It then checks if this sum equals 3.
   - If the sum equals 3, it prints 1 (indicating Bob wins once).
   - Otherwise, it prints the integer division of the sum by 2.

4. **Winning Condition**:
   - The goal is to maximize the number of times Bob wins.
   - Bob wins if the XOR of all numbers in the sequence is zero.
   - The key insight is that Bob wins if there is an odd number of 1s, 3s, and no 2s or 4s (since 2 and 4 do not affect the XOR result).

5. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should remove numbers such that the remaining sequence has an odd number of 1s and 3s and no 2s or 4s.
   - The number of times Bob can win is determined by the number of 1s and 3s initially present, as these are the only numbers that affect the XOR result.

### Correctness Check:

- The program correctly identifies the condition for Bob to win (odd number of 1s and 3s).
- However, the logic for calculating the maximum number of Bob's wins is flawed. The current implementation does not accurately reflect the optimal strategy for Eve to maximize Bob's wins.

### Correct Solution:

To correctly solve the problem, we need to count the total number of 1s and 3s and ensure that the sequence maintains an odd number of these elements. The optimal strategy involves removing pairs of 1s and 3s to keep the count odd.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        ones = p[0]
        threes = p[2]
        # Calculate the maximum number of Bob's wins
        max_bob_wins = min(ones, threes)
        # Print the result
        print(max_bob_wins)
```

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the original program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic to maximize Bob's wins. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
