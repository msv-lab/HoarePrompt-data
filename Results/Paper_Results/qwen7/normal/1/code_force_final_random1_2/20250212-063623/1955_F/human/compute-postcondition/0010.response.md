Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a list of four non-negative integers (p_i) representing counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the initial sequence for each test case, where the sum of these counts does not exceed 200. It returns a value based on the given conditions for each test case.**
