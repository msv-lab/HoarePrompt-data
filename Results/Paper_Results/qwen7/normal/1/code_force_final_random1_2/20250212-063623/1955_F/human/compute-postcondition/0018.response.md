Output State: **`a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `cnt` is 1, and the number of remaining iterations is the input value minus 1.**

The code `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. Initially, `cnt` is 0, so after executing this line, `cnt` becomes 1. The list `a` and the number of remaining iterations remain unchanged.
