Output State: **cnt is the sum of the floor division of each integer in the list `a` by 2, after all elements have been processed.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, the list `a` will be empty because all elements have been processed, and the variable `cnt` will hold the total sum of the floor division of each integer in the original list `a` by 2.
