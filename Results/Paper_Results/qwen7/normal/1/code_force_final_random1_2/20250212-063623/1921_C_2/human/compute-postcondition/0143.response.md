Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers n, f, a, b, and a list m of n integers. For each test case, it constructs a new list array2 based on specific conditions involving the differences between consecutive elements of m and the values of a and b. Finally, it checks if the sum of array2 plus the product of the remaining elements count and b is less than f. If true, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.**
