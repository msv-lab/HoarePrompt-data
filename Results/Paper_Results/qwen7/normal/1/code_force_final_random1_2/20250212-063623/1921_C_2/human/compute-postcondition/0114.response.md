Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `array2` is a list containing one element which is `(arr[1] - arr[0]) * a`, and the difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[i - 1]` is less than `b / a`**.

This means that after executing the if-else block, the list `arr` remains unchanged, `i` is set to 2, `n` remains greater than 0, and `array2` contains the element `(arr[1] - arr[0]) * a`. Additionally, if the condition `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a` is true, the difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[i - 1]` being less than `b / a` is maintained. If the condition is false, the same postcondition still holds as no changes are made in the else part.
