Output State: **`arr` is an array of integers, `i` is `n`, `a` is a non-zero value, `b` is a value, `array2` contains one element which is `(arr[n] - arr[n - 1]) * a` if the difference between `arr[n]` and `arr[n - 1]` is less than `b / a`, otherwise `array2` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code appends an element to `array2` based on the condition that the difference between `arr[i]` (which is `arr[n]`) and `arr[i - 1]` (which is `arr[n - 1]`) is less than `b / a`. Since the initial values of `a`, `b`, and the elements of `arr` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of the element added to `array2`. However, we know that if the condition is met, `array2` will contain the calculated value; otherwise, it remains unchanged.
