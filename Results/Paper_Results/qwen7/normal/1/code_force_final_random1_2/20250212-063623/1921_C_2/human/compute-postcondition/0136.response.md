Based on the initial state provided:

- `arr` is a list of integers.
- `i` is equal to `n`, where `n` is the original length of `arr`.
- `f` is `feat[1]`.
- `a` is `feat[2]`.
- `b` is `feat[-1]`.
- `array2` is initially an empty list.

The loop iterates over indices from 0 to `n-1`:

1. For `i == 0` and `arr[0] < b / a`, `array2` includes `arr[0] * a`.
2. For any other index `i` where `0 < i < n` and `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`, `array2` includes `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`.

Given that `i` is equal to `n`, the loop does not execute because the condition `0 <= i < n` is false. Therefore, `array2` remains an empty list.

The final expression evaluated is the sum of `array2` plus the product of `(n - len(array2))` and `b`, which simplifies to `0 + (n - 0) * b = n * b`. This expression is compared to `f` and the result is `Yes` if `n * b < f`.

Output: **Yes**
