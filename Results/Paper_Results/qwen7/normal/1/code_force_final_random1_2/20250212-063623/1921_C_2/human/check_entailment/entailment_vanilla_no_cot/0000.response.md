Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Charge Calculation Mismatch**: The program calculates the total charge used incorrectly. It should consider both the continuous usage and the cost of turning the phone on and off. Specifically, the charge consumption should account for the difference between consecutive message times and the cost of turning the phone on and off.

2. **Logic Flaw**: The logic to determine whether Stepan can send all messages is flawed. The program only considers the difference between consecutive message times and the cost of turning the phone on and off, but it doesn't correctly account for the total charge consumed over time.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled**: The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when the initial charge `f` is insufficient even with optimal turning on and off strategies.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    test_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(test_cases):
        feat = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
        n = feat[0]
        f = feat[1]
        a = feat[2]
        b = feat[3]
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
        
        # Calculate the total charge needed to send all messages
        total_charge_needed = sum(arr[i] - arr[i-1] for i in range(1, n))
        total_charge_needed += (n - 1) * a  # Charge lost during the entire process
        
        # Calculate the total cost of turning the phone on and off
        total_turn_on_off_cost = (n - 1) * b
        
        # Calculate the effective charge available after accounting for turning on and off
        effective_charge = f - total_turn_on_off_cost
        
        if effective_charge >= total_charge_needed:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')

func()
```

This corrected version properly calculates the total charge needed to send all messages and compares it with the effective charge available after accounting for the cost of turning the phone on and off.
