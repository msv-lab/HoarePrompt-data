### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Variable Initialization**: The variables `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b` are correctly initialized from the input for each test case.
3. **Message Times Calculation**: The program calculates the time intervals between consecutive message sending times (`arr[i] - arr[i - 1]`) and checks if these intervals are less than the threshold `b / a`.
4. **Energy Consumption Calculation**: If the interval is less than `b / a`, the program adds the cost of sending messages during that interval (`(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`) to `array2`. Otherwise, it considers the cost of turning the phone off and on (`b`).
5. **Final Energy Check**: The program sums up the total energy consumed and compares it with the initial charge `f`. If the total energy consumed is less than `f`, it prints 'Yes', indicating that Stepan can send all messages. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

Given the logic and the steps outlined, the program appears to correctly implement the problem's requirements.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if Stepan can send all messages without the phone's charge dropping to zero.
