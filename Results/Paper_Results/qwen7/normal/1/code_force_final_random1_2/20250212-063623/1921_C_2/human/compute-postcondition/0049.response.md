Output State: **`i` is `feat[0] + 3`, `n` is greater than `feat[0] + 2`, `array2` has an additional element which is `(arr[feat[0] + 3] - arr[feat[0] + 2]) * a`**

Explanation: The code appends to `array2` a new element calculated as `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`. Given that `i` is `feat[0] + 3`, the expression becomes `(arr[feat[0] + 3] - arr[feat[0] + 2]) * a`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
