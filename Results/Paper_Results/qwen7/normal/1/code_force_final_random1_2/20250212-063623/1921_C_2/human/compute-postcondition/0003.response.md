Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `n` is the first element of the list `feat`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the first element of the list `feat` to the variable `n`. The values of `test_cases` and `i` remain unchanged, and `feat` is still a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces.
