Output State: **`i` is `feat[0] + 1`, `n` must be greater than `feat[0] + 1`, the value of `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]` is less than `b / a`, and `array2` is appended with the value `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` to the list `array2`. Here, `i` is `feat[0] + 1`, and the condition `n > feat[0] + 1` must still hold true. The value of `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]` must be less than `b / a`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
