Postcondition: `arr` is a list of integers, `i` is either 1 or 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, and `array2` is a list. If `arr[0] < b / a`, then `array2` contains the element `arr[0] * a`. If `arr[0] >= b / a` and `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a` (with `i` being 2 in this case), then `array2` contains an additional element `(arr[2] - arr[1]) * feat[2]`. Otherwise, `array2` remains unchanged.
