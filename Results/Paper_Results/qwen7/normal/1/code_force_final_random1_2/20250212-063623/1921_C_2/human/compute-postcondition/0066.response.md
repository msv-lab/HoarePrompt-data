Output State: **`feat` is a list of integers obtained from input().split(' '), `n` is equal to `feat[0]`, `i` is `feat[0] + (n - 1) + 1` to ensure it is less than `test_cases`, `f` is equal to `feat[1]`, `a` is equal to `feat[2]`, `b` is equal to `feat[-1]`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from input().split(' ')**.

Explanation: The code creates a new list `arr` by converting each element of the input string into an integer. This conversion does not affect the values of the existing variables (`feat`, `n`, `i`, `f`, `a`, `b`). Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged, and the new list `arr` is added to the state.
