Functionality: **The function processes input data from standard input, where each line contains two integers \(n\) and \(k\). For each line, it calculates and prints one of three possible values based on the relationship between \(n\) and \(k\): \(\lceil k/2 \rceil\), \(2n - 1\), or \(2n\). After processing all lines, it stops without returning any value.**
