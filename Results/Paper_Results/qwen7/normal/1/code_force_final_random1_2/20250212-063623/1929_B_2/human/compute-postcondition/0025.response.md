Based on the initial state provided:

- `s` is the next line from the standard input.
- `n` is the integer value of the first part of `s` split by spaces.
- `k` is the integer value of the second part of `s` split by spaces.

The code snippet `print(2 * n)` will print twice the value of `n`.

Since `n` is the integer value of the first part of `s` split by spaces, and `s` is obtained from the standard input, the exact value of `n` depends on the user's input. However, we know it is an integer.

Output: **2 * n (where n is the integer value of the first part of s split by spaces)**
