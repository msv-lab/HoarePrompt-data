You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^8 and 1 <= k <= 4n - 2.
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        n, k = map(int, s.split())
        
        if k <= 4 * n - 4:
            print(math.ceil(k / 2))
        elif k == 4 * n - 3:
            print(2 * n - 1)
        elif k == 4 * n - 2:
            print(2 * n)
        
    #State: Output State: All lines from the standard input have been processed, and for each line, the loop has printed one of the following based on the values of `n` and `k`:
    #
    #- If `k <= 4 * n - 4`, it prints `math.ceil(k / 2)`.
    #- If `k == 4 * n - 3`, it prints `2 * n - 1`.
    #- If `k == 4 * n - 2`, it prints `2 * n`.
    #
    #After all iterations, the variable `s` will be the last line from the standard input that was read, `n` will be the first integer from that line split by spaces, and `k` will be the second integer from that line split by spaces. The loop has completed its execution, and no further operations are performed on these variables.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes values for t, n, and k where t is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and for each test case, n and k are integers between 2 and \(10^8\) and 1 and \(4n - 2\), respectively. It returns a result based on these values.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
