Based on the initial state provided:

- `s` is the next line from the standard input.
- `n` is the integer value of the first part of `s` split by spaces.
- `k` is the integer value of the second part of `s` split by spaces.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(2 * n - 1)
```

To determine what will be printed, we need to evaluate the expression `2 * n - 1`. 

Since `n` is the integer value of the first part of `s` split by spaces, let's denote the first part of `s` as `first_part`.

Therefore, the expression `2 * n - 1` translates to `2 * first_part - 1`.

Given this, the output will be:
Output: **2 * first_part - 1 (where first_part is the integer value of the first part of s split by spaces)**
