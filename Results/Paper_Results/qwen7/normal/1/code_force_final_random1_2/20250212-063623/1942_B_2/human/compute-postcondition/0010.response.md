Postcondition: `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `res` is a list of length `n` filled with None, `mex` is equal to `n` - `ar[i]` where `i` is `len(ar) - 1` and `i` is greater than or equal to 0. If `mex > mex - ar[i]`, then `mex` remains unchanged. Otherwise, the condition does not affect the variables.
