Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves constructing a permutation \( p \) of integers from 0 to \( n-1 \) such that the array \( a \) is derived from the MEX (Minimum EXcluded) values of the prefix of \( p \). Specifically, \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \).

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code iterates over the test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the size \( n \) and the array \( a \).
   - It initializes a result list `res` of length \( n \) with `None`.
   - It calculates the MEX value dynamically as it constructs the permutation.
   - The loop starts from the end of the array `ar` and works backwards, updating the `res` list based on the MEX value and the current element of `ar`.

3. **Key Points**:
   - The code correctly updates the `mex` value as it goes through the array `ar` in reverse order.
   - The `res[i]` is set to `mex - ar[i]` if `mex` is greater than `mex - ar[i]`. This ensures that the MEX condition is satisfied.
   - The construction of `res` ensures that each element in `res` corresponds to a valid permutation of integers from 0 to \( n-1 \).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the constraints and guarantees that at least one valid permutation exists.
   - The logic correctly ensures that the MEX condition is met for each step.

5. **Output**:
   - The final output is a valid permutation \( p \) that satisfies the given conditions.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
