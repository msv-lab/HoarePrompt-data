Output State: **Postcondition: `i` is `-1`, `ar` is a list of integers, `n` is an input integer, `mex` is equal to `n - ar[-1]`, `res` is a list of length `n` where each element `res[i]` is equal to `mex - ar[i]` if `mex > mex - ar[i]`, otherwise `res[i]` remains unchanged.**

In this final state, the loop has completed all its iterations with `i` becoming `-1`. The value of `mex` will be adjusted based on the last element of the list `ar` such that `mex` equals `n - ar[-1]`. The list `res` will contain elements calculated as `mex - ar[i]` for each index `i`, but only if the condition `mex > mex - ar[i]` holds true during the loop's execution. If the condition does not hold, the original value of `res[i]` remains unchanged.
