Output State: **`i` is `len(ar) - 1`, `ar` is a list of integers, `n` is an input integer, `mex` is equal to `n - ar[i]`, `res` is a list of length `n` where each element `res[i]` is equal to `mex - ar[i]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `mex` by subtracting `ar[i]` from it. Initially, `mex` was equal to `n`. After executing `mex = mex - ar[i]`, `mex` now becomes `n - ar[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
