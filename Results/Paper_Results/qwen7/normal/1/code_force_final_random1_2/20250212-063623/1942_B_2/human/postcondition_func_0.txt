The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `ar`. For each test case, it computes a new list `res` where each element `res[i]` is calculated based on the maximum excluded number (`mex`) and the corresponding element in `ar`. Specifically, `res[i]` is set to `mex - ar[i]` if `mex > mex - ar[i]`, otherwise `res[i]` remains unchanged. Finally, it prints the elements of `res` for each test case.
