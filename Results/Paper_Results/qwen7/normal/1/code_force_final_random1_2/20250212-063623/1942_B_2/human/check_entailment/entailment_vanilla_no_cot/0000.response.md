Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided solution attempts to solve the problem but contains several logical errors and issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `mex`**: The logic for calculating `mex` is flawed. The code tries to calculate `mex` in reverse order, which is not necessary and leads to incorrect results. 

2. **Incorrect Update of `mex`**: The update of `mex` inside the loop is also incorrect. It should be updated based on the current value of `res[i]` rather than directly subtracting `ar[i]`.

3. **Logic Flaw**: The approach of setting `res[i]` to `mex - ar[i]` and then updating `mex` is not sufficient to ensure that the resulting `p` is a valid permutation. This method does not guarantee that all values from 0 to n-1 will be used exactly once.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve this problem, we need to construct the permutation `p` step-by-step while ensuring that the MEX condition is satisfied. Here's a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = [-1] * n  # Initialize result array with -1
        mex = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            if ar[i] >= 0:
                res[i] = ar[i]
                mex = max(mex, ar[i] + 1)
            else:
                while mex in res:
                    mex += 1
                res[i] = mex
                mex += 1
        
        print(' '.join(str(x) for x in res))

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Solution:

1. **Initialization**: We initialize the result array `res` with `-1` and set `mex` to 0.
2. **Iterate through the array `ar`**: For each element in `ar`, if it is non-negative, we place it directly in the corresponding position in `res` and update `mex`. If it is negative, we find the smallest available `mex` that is not already used in `res` and place it there, then increment `mex`.
3. **Print the result**: Finally, we print the constructed permutation `res`.

This approach ensures that the resulting permutation `p` satisfies the MEX condition for each index.
