Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `mex` is reduced by the next element in `ar`, and `res` is updated to include the new value of `mex - ar[i]` for the next index `i`.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This operation does not affect the values of `mex` or `ar`, nor does it change the way `res` is updated. Therefore, the initial conditions regarding `mex`, `ar`, and `res` remain valid, with the addition that `n` now holds the value of the input integer.
