Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `y` will be 0, `max_p` will remain as the integer value of `nf[1]`, `num_fila` will remain as `int(nf[0])`, `b` will remain an empty list, `b_values` will be a list containing the integer values of all elements in the original list `b`, `custos` will be a list containing the value of `custo` for each iteration, and `custo` will be the final sum calculated by adding either `a_values[y]` or `b_values[y]` for each iteration based on the condition `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]`. If `y` equals 1, `custo` is further increased by `a_values[0]` and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, `y` will decrement from `max_p - 1` to 0. The value of `max_p` and `num_fila` will stay as they were initially set. The list `b` will still be empty, and `b_values` will contain the integer values of the original list `b`. The list `custos` will store the value of `custo` after each iteration, and `custo` itself will hold the total sum calculated according to the given conditions within the loop.
