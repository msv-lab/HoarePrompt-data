Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- Kirill needs to minimize the cost to move to one of the first `m` positions in the queue.
- For each position `i`, there are two costs: `a_i` (cost to swap with the person in front of him) and `b_i` (cost to pass through the person in front of him).
- Kirill can only swap with people in front of him and must eventually end up in one of the first `m` positions.

### Key Points to Verify:
1. **Cost Calculation**: Ensure the logic correctly calculates the minimum cost to reach one of the first `m` positions.
2. **Boundary Conditions**: Ensure the program handles edge cases properly.
3. **Logic Flow**: Ensure the logic flow matches the problem requirements.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of people in the queue (`n`) and the maximum allowable final position (`pos_final`).
   - It then reads the costs `a_i` and `b_i` for each person in the queue.

2. **Initialization**:
   - It initializes `total` to 0 and `best` to a large value (`10 ** 12`).

3. **Backward Iteration**:
   - The program iterates backward from the last person to the first.
   - For each position `v`:
     - If `v` is within the allowed final positions (`v <= pos_final`):
       - Updates `best` to the minimum between `best` and the current total cost plus `a_v`.
       - Updates `total` to include either `a_v` or `b_v` based on which is cheaper.
     - If `v` is beyond the allowed final positions:
       - Adds the cheaper cost (`a_v` or `b_v`) to `total`.

4. **Output**:
   - Prints the minimum cost stored in `best`.

### Verification:
- The program correctly handles the backward iteration and updates the minimum cost.
- The logic ensures that the cost to swap (`a_i`) is considered before passing (`b_i`), which aligns with the problem statement.
- The boundary conditions are handled appropriately by checking if the current position is within the allowed final positions.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost for Kirill to move to one of the first `m` positions in the queue.

**Correctness: True**
