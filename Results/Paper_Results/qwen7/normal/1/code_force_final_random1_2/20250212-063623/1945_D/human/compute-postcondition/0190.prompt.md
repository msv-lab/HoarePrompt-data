Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cases` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ `cases` ≤ 10^4. All other variables retain their initial conditions.
Code of the loop:
for c in range(cases):
    na_frente, pos_final = map(int, input().split())
    custo_pra_trocar_a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    custo_pra_passar_b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    na_frente -= 1
    pos_final -= 1
    total = 0
    best = 10 ** 12
    for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1):
        if v <= pos_final:
            if best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]:
                best = total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
            if custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
                total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
            else:
                total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
        elif custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
            total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
        else:
            total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
    print(best)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: All iterations of the loop have been executed, `na_frente` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ `na_frente` ≤ 10^4, `total` is the sum of the minimum costs accumulated from `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` lists based on the conditions specified in the loop, `v` is now 0 (since the loop decrements `v` from `na_frente` to 0), and `best` is the lowest possible value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` encountered during the loop iterations, or remains 10 if no valid `v` was found that meets the condition `best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: All iterations of the loop have been executed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `total` is the sum of the minimum costs between `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` for all `v` in the range from `na_frente` to `-1`, inclusive. `na_frente` is a non-negative integer, `n` is `na_frente + 1`, `pos_final` is the integer input from the user minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` are lists of integers, and `best` is the smallest value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]` for all `v` in the range from `na_frente` to `pos_final`, inclusive, that is less than or equal to `pos_final`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `total` will be the cumulative cost of the optimal path chosen at each step, where the path can either "trocar_a" (change to the left) or "passar_b" (pass to the right), depending on which option has the lower cost. The value of `na_frente` will be updated to reflect the end of the range considered, `n` will be one more than `na_frente`, `pos_final` will remain unchanged, and `best` will hold the lowest possible accumulated cost up to `pos_final`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
