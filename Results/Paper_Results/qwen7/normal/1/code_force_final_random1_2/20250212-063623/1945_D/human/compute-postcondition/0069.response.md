Output State: **`na_frente` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ `na_frente` ≤ 10^4, `total` is the sum of the minimum costs accumulated from `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` lists, `v` is now 0, `c` is `c` (one more than the previous value of `c`), `pos_final` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `na_frente` and `pos_final`. The values of `total`, `v`, and `c` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `na_frente` is updated to the value of the first input integer, and `pos_final` is updated to the value of the second input integer.
