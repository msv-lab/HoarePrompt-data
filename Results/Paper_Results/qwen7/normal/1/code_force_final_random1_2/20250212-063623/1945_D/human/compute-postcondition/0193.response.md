Output State: **`b` is an empty list, `y` is the last element in the list `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in the original list `b`, `custos` is a list containing the value of `custo`, `custo` is 0, `a_values` is a list containing all the integer values of elements in `a`, `num_fila` is an integer obtained from `int(nf[0])`, `max_p` is the integer value of `nf[1]`**.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `b` will be an empty list because we are iterating over `b` and appending its elements to `b_values`, thus consuming all elements from `b`. The variable `y` will be set to the last element of the list `a` since it is updated in each iteration but `a` remains unchanged. The list `b_values` will contain the integer values of all elements originally in `b` because each string element of `b` is converted to an integer and appended to `b_values` in each iteration. All other variables (`custos`, `custo`, `a_values`, `num_fila`, `max_p`) remain in their initial or updated states as described in the initial state and the output states after the first few iterations.
