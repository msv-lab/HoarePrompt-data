Output State: **`total` is 0, `v` is 0, `na_frente` is greater than or equal to 0, `best` is `total` + `custo_pra_trocar_a[0]`**.

Explanation: The variable `best` is assigned the value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. Given that `v` is 0, `best` becomes `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[0]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
