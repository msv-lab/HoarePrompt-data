Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `y`, `num_fila`, `max_p`, `b`, `b_values`, and `a_values`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `num_fila - 1` to `max_p - 1` in reverse order (decrementing by 1 each time).

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `custo` is increased by either `a_values[y]` or `b_values[y]` depending on whether `a_values[y]` is less than `b_values[y]`.
   - `y` is the last element in the list `a` minus 1.
   - `num_fila` is `int(nf[0])`.
   - `max_p` is the integer value of `nf[1]`.
   - `b` is an empty list.
   - `b_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in the original list `b`.
   - `a_values` is a list containing all the integer values of elements in `a`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop decrements `y` by 1 each iteration, `y` will be reduced by 1 from its current value.
   - `num_fila` and `max_p` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
   - `b`, `b_values`, and `a_values` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.

Given the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `y` will be reduced by 1.
- `custo` remains unchanged as it is updated inside the loop based on the condition and not directly affected by the loop itself.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

**State: **`custo` is increased by either `a_values[y]` or `b_values[y]` depending on whether `a_values[y]` is less than `b_values[y]`, `y` is the last element in the list `a` minus 2, `num_fila` is `int(nf[0])`, `max_p` is the integer value of `nf[1]`, `b` is an empty list, `b_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in the original list `b`, and `a_values` is a list containing all the integer values of elements in `a`**.
