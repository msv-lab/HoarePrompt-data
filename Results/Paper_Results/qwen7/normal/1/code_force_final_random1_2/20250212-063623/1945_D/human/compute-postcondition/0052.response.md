Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable is `v`.
   - The loop runs from `na_frente` to `-1` in steps of `-1`.

2. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `na_frente` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq na_frente \leq 10^4\).
   - `total` is increased by either the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` depending on the condition.
   - `v` is now `na_frente - 1`.
   - `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, otherwise `best` remains unchanged.

3. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop runs in reverse order (from `na_frente` to `-1`), the next value of `v` will be `v - 1`.
   - Therefore, `v` will be `na_frente - 2` in the next iteration.
   - The loop will continue as long as `v` is greater than or equal to `-1`.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `v` should be set to `na_frente - 2`.
- `best` should remain unchanged unless the condition `custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]` is met during the next iteration.

Since the loop condition depends on `v` being greater than or equal to `-1`, and the other variables (`total`, `na_frente`, `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`) are not directly modified by the loop itself but depend on the condition inside the loop, we only need to adjust `v`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`total` is increased by either the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` depending on the condition; `v` is now `na_frente - 2`; `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, otherwise `best` remains unchanged.**
