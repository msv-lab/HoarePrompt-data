Let's analyze the given state and the for loop step by step.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `y` is `max_p - 2`
- `max_p` must be an integer greater than 1
- `custo` is increased by either `a_values[0] + b_values[max_p - 2]` if `y == 1`, or by `b_values[max_p - 2]` if `y != 1` and `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]`. If `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] > a_values[y]`, then `custo` is increased by `a_values[y]`, and `a_values[0]` is considered if `y` equals 1.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for y in range(max_p - 1, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial Values:**
   - `y` is `max_p - 2`
   - `max_p` is an integer greater than 1
   - `custo` has been updated based on the conditions provided.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop starts with `y = max_p - 2` and decrements `y` until `y` reaches 1 (inclusive).

3. **Next Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `y` was `max_p - 2`.
   - For the next iteration, `y` will be `max_p - 3`.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - `y` will be `max_p - 3`.
   - `max_p` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `custo` may have been updated, but its exact value is not specified, so we cannot change it without additional information.

### Conclusion:
The only variable that needs to be adjusted for the next iteration of the loop is `y`.

### Updated State:
- `y` is `max_p - 3`
- `max_p` must be an integer greater than 1
- `custo` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.

**State:**
**`y` is `max_p - 3`, `max_p` must be an integer greater than 1, and `custo` remains unchanged.**
