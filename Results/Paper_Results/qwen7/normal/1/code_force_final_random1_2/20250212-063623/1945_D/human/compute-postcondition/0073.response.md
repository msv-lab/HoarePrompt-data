Output State: **`na_frente` is an integer within the range 0 â‰¤ `na_frente` < 10^4, `total` is the sum of the minimum costs accumulated from `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` lists, `v` is 0, `c` is `c` (one more than the previous value of `c`), `pos_final` is one less than the original input integer, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers created from user input.**

Explanation: The line `pos_final -= 1` subtracts 1 from the value of `pos_final`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `pos_final` is updated to be one less than its original value, while the other variables retain their initial conditions.
