Postcondition: `total` is 0, `v` is 0, `na_frente` is greater than or equal to 0, and if the cost to change `a` at index `v` is less than the cost to pass `b` at index `v`, then `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[0]`, otherwise, the values of `total`, `v`, and `na_frente` remain unchanged.
