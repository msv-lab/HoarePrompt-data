Postcondition: `custo` is increased by either `b_values[y]` (if `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]` and `y` is not 1, or if `y` is 1 and `custo` is further increased by `a_values[0]`), or `a_values[y]` (if the condition is false). We break out of the most internal loop or if statement in both cases.
