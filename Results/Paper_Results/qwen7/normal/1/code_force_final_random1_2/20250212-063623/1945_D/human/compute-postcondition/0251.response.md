State:
```
for c in custos:
    # the loop body is omit
```

Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time? Only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is `for c in custos`. The only variable in the loop head is `c`.

2. **Determine the initial value of `c`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `c` was one of the elements in `custos`.

3. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `c` must be the next element in `custos`.

4. **Adjust the state**: Since `c` is the only variable in the loop head, it needs to be updated to the next element in `custos`.

Final Answer:
State: **`c` is the next element in `custos`**
