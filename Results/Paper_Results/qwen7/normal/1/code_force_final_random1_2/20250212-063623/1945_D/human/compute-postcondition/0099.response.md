Postcondition: `total`, `v`, and `na_frente` are such that `v` is 0, `na_frente` is greater than or equal to 0, and `best` is updated to the minimum of `best` and `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[0]` if `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final` and `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. Otherwise, `v` is greater than `pos_final` if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, or `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final` and `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is greater than or equal to `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.
