Output State: **`cases` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ `cases` ≤ 10^4, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is one less than the original value of `na_frente`, `pos_final` is `pos_final - 1`, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `total` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `total` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
