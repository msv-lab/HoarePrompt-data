Output State: **`y` is `max_p - 2`, `custo` is increased by `a_values[0] + b_values[max_p - 2]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of `y` or `custo`. It only indicates that the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was inside. Therefore, the values of `y` and `custo` remain unchanged from their initial states.
