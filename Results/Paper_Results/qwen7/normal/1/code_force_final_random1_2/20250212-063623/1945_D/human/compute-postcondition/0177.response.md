Output State: **`total` is `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, `na_frente` is a non-negative integer, `n` is `na_frente + 1`, `v` is `v - 1`, and `best` remains unchanged if it is greater than the respective `total` value after considering whether to `trocar_a[v]` or `passar_b[v]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `total` by adding `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` to its current value. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given conditions.
