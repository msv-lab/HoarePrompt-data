Let's break down the task step by step:

1. Identify the objects in the loop head:
   - The loop variable `c` is being initialized and incremented within the loop.
   - The loop runs based on the value of `cases`.

2. Determine the initial state required for the loop to execute:
   - The loop will execute as long as `c` is less than `cases`.
   - Therefore, `c` must start from 0 (the default starting point for `range`) and `cases` must be a positive integer.

3. Consider the given initial state:
   - `cases` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ `cases` ≤ 10^4.
   - This means `cases` is already a valid positive integer, so no adjustment is needed for `cases`.

4. Adjust the state of the loop variable `c`:
   - Since `c` starts from 0 and the loop will run until `c < cases`, we need to ensure `c` is 0 initially.

5. Combine the necessary adjustments:
   - We need to ensure `c` is 0 and `cases` is a valid positive integer.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

State: **`cases` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ `cases` ≤ 10^4, `c` is 0**
