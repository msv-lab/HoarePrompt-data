Output State: **`y` is `max_p - 2`, `max_p` must be an integer greater than 1, `custo` is increased by `a_values[y]`, `a_values[0]` is only considered if `y` equals 1.**

Explanation: The code `custo += a_values[y]` increments the value of `custo` by `a_values[y]`. The initial conditions for `y` and `max_p` remain unchanged. Additionally, the condition for optionally adding `a_values[0]` to `custo` if `y` equals 1 is not directly addressed by this line of code, so it remains as part of the precondition.
