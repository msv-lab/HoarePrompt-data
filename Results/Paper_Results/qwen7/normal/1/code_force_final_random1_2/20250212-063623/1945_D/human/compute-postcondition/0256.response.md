Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases, where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), followed by n and m (1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000) for each test case, and two lists of positive integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n and b_1, b_2, ..., b_n (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9 for all i from 1 to n). The function returns a result based on the conditions provided for each test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each with specific parameters and lists of integers, and it processes these according to the given constraints without needing any direct parameters in its definition.
