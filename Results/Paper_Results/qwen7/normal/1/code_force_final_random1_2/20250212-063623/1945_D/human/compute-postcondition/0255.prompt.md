Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After the loop executes all iterations, `y` will be 0, `max_p` will remain as the integer value of `nf[1]`, `num_fila` will remain as `int(nf[0])`, `b` will remain an empty list, `b_values` will be a list containing the integer values of all elements in the original list `b`, `custos` will be a list containing the value of `custo` for each iteration, and `custo` will be the final sum calculated by adding either `a_values[y]` or `b_values[y]` for each iteration based on the condition `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]`. If `y` equals 1, `custo` is further increased by `a_values[0]` and the most internal loop or if statement is exited; `custos.append(custo)` appends the final value of `custo` to the list `custos`.
Code of the loop:
for c in custos:
    print(c)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: - Since the loop is iterating over `custos`, the initial value of `c` should be one of the elements in `custos`.
   - The other variables (`y`, `max_p`, `num_fila`, `b`, `b_values`, `custo`, `a_values`) do not need to be adjusted because they are not part of the loop head and their values will be determined within the loop body.

### Final Answer:
State:

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `c` is the next element in `custos`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `c` is the next element in `custos`, `custos` must have at least one more element




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
