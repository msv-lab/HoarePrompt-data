Output State: **`total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `na_frente` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ `na_frente` ≤ 10^4, `v` is greater than `pos_final`, and `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is greater than or equal to `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.**

Explanation: The code `total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]` increases the value of `total` by the value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state and the given condition.
