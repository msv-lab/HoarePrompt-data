Output State: **`na_frente` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ na_frente ≤ 10^4, `v` is a value such that v is less than or equal to pos_final, `best` remains greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, and `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.**

Explanation: The variable `total` is incremented by the value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. All other variables (`na_frente`, `v`, and `best`) remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
