Output State: **`total` is 0 + `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, `na_frente` is a non-negative integer, `n` is `na_frente + 1`, and the condition `v > pos_final` is true. Additionally, `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.**

In this output state, the variable `total` is updated to be the sum of its original value (which was 0) and the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. All other variables retain their original values and conditions.
