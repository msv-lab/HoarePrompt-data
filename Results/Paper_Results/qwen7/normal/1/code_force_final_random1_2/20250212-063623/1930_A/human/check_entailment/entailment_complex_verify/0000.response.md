### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and the annotated code to verify the original assessment.

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to maximize the score by selecting pairs of integers and adding the smaller one to the score.
   - Sorting the list ensures that we always pick the smallest available pair, which is the optimal strategy.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program iterates over the sorted list in steps of 2, effectively picking the smallest available pair and summing their minimum values.
   - This approach is correct because sorting the list ensures that the smallest elements are paired together, maximizing the score at each step.

3. **Annotated Code Explanation**:
   - The annotated code correctly describes the behavior of the program. It mentions that the list is sorted, and the score is calculated by summing every second element starting from the first element.
   - The loop iterates over the sorted list in steps of 2, ensuring that the smallest elements are always chosen.

4. **Original Assessment**:
   - The original assessment states that the program correctly implements the strategy to maximize the score by always choosing the smallest two numbers available on the whiteboard.
   - It also notes that since the list is sorted, selecting the elements at indices `i` and `i+1` for each iteration ensures that the minimum of the two is added to the score, which is the optimal choice at each step.

Given the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the optimal strategy for maximizing the score.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct as it follows the optimal strategy of always choosing the smallest available pair, which is ensured by sorting the list before processing.
