Output State: **`score` is increased by the value of `l[i]`, `i` remains unchanged**.

In this code snippet, `score` is incremented by the value of `l[i]`. The value of `i` is not modified by this operation, so it remains unchanged. The exact new value of `score` depends on the current value of `score` and the value of `l[i]`, but the key point is that `score` is updated and `i` stays the same.
