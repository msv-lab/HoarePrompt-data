Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `range(0, 2 * n, 2)`.

2. **Analyze the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < 2 * n`. Since `i` starts at 0 and increments by 2 each time, the loop will run for values of `i` such as 0, 2, 4, ..., up to but not including `2 * n`.

3. **Determine necessary adjustments**:
   - **Variable `i`**: It starts at 0 and will increment by 2 each iteration. Therefore, after the first iteration, `i` will be 2. After the second iteration, `i` will be 4, and so on.
   - **Variable `n`**: The value of `n` determines the upper limit of the loop. If `n` is less than or equal to 0, the loop will not execute at all because `i` would never reach `2 * n`.
   - **List `l`**: Although `l` is a sorted list of integers, its state does not directly affect the loop's execution based on the given information. The loop itself does not modify `l`, so no adjustment is needed for `l`.

Given these points, the only variables that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`. Specifically, `n` must be greater than 0 to ensure the loop can execute at least once.

Therefore, the required state adjustments are:
- `i` should be 0 (as it starts at 0).
- `n` must be greater than 0 to ensure the loop can execute.

**State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
