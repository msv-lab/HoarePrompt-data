Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 5000, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input.**

Explanation: The code takes an input of multiple space-separated integers, converts them into a list of integers using `map(int, input().split())`, and then sorts this list using `sorted()`. The sorted list is assigned to the variable `l`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
