Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the strategy to maximize the score by always choosing the smallest two numbers available on the whiteboard. Since the list is sorted, selecting the elements at indices `i` and `i+1` for each iteration ensures that the minimum of the two is added to the score, which is the optimal choice at each step. This approach guarantees the maximum possible score for any given set of 2n positive integers. Therefore, the program works correctly for all potential cases described in the problem.
