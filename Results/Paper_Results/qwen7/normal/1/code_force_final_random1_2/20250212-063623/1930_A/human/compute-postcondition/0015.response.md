Output State: **`score` will be recalculated based on the remaining number of iterations, `t` remains unchanged, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a sorted list of integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code takes a series of integers as input from the user, splits them into a list, converts each element to an integer using `map(int, ...)` and then sorts the list using `sorted(...)`. The sorted list is then assigned to `l`. The variables `score`, `t`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
