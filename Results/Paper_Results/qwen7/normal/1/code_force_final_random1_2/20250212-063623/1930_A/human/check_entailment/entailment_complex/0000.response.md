Reasoning:
- The problem requires finding the maximum score by pairing the smallest available numbers in each step.
- The annotated program correctly sorts the list of numbers, which is essential for always picking the minimum values when pairing.
- The loop iterates over the sorted list in steps of 2, summing the elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...), which corresponds to pairing the smallest available numbers in each step.
- This approach ensures that the score is maximized because the smallest numbers are paired first, minimizing the loss in each step.
- The program handles multiple test cases as required and prints the correct score for each test case based on the given logic.

Correctness: **True**
