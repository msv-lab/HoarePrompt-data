Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- **State at the end of the previous iteration:**
  - `score` is increased by the value of `l[i]`.
  - `i` remains unchanged.

- **For Loop Statement:**
  ```python
  for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2):
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable is `i`.
   - The loop iterates over `range(0, 2 * n, 2)`, meaning `i` takes values 0, 2, 4, ..., up to `2 * n - 2`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `2 * n - 2`.
   - Since `i` remains unchanged from the previous iteration, the only way for the loop to continue is if `i + 2` (the next value of `i`) is still within the range.

3. **Adjust the State:**
   - `score` is updated by adding `l[i]` in each iteration.
   - `i` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.
   - To ensure the loop can execute again, `i` must be such that `i + 2` is still within the range `0` to `2 * n - 2`.

Given that `i` remains unchanged, let's denote the current value of `i` as `i_current`. For the loop to execute again, `i_current + 2` must be less than `2 * n`.

### Conclusion:
- The only state that needs to be adjusted is the condition for `i` to ensure the loop can execute again.

### Final State:
- `score` is increased by the value of `l[i]` (where `i` is the same as the previous iteration).
- `i` remains unchanged.
- For the loop to execute again, `i` must be such that `i + 2 < 2 * n`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect these conditions.

**State: **`score` is increased by the value of `l[i]`, `i` remains unchanged, and `i + 2 < 2 * n`**.
