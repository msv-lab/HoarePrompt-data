### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the score by selecting pairs of integers from the list and adding the minimum of the pair to the score.
   - The optimal strategy is to always pick the smallest available integers to ensure the highest possible score.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The function `func()` processes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case:
     - It reads the value of \( n \).
     - It reads \( 2n \) integers and sorts them.
     - It iterates over the sorted list in steps of 2, summing up the elements at even indices (which correspond to the smallest elements in each pair).

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - Sorting the list ensures that the smallest elements are paired together.
   - Summing the elements at even indices effectively sums the first element of each pair (since the list is sorted, these are the smallest elements in each pair).

4. **Validation Against Examples:**
   - For the first test case (`1 2 3`), the sorted list is `[2, 3]`. The score is \(2\).
   - For the second test case (`1 1 2 1`), the sorted list is `[1, 1, 1, 2]`. The score is \(1 + 1 = 2\).
   - For the third test case (`1 1 1 1 1 1`), the sorted list is `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`. The score is \(1 + 1 + 1 = 3\).

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The logic in the program correctly implements the optimal strategy for maximizing the score.
