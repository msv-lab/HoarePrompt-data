Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the input split by spaces, `k` is the second integer from the input split by spaces, `s` is the next line from the standard input.**

Explanation: The code splits the input string `s` into two integers using `split()` and `map(int, ...)`. It assigns the first integer to `n` and the second integer to `k`. The original string `s` remains unchanged and is still available for future use.
