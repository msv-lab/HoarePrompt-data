Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 999 inclusive, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, and `n`, `k` are assigned the values from the input split and converted to integers.**

The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated inputs, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. The initial state of `t` remains unchanged.
