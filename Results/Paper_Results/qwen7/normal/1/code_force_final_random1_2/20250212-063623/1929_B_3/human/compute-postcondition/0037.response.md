Postcondition: **`n` is the first integer from the input split by spaces, `k` is the second integer from the input split by spaces, `s` is the next line from the standard input. If `k` is less than or equal to `4 * n - 4`, the values of `n`, `k`, and `s` remain unchanged. If `k` equals `4 * n - 3`, the values of `n`, `k`, and `s` are modified according to the if part. If `k` equals `4 * n - 2`, the values of `n`, `k`, and `s` remain unchanged.**
