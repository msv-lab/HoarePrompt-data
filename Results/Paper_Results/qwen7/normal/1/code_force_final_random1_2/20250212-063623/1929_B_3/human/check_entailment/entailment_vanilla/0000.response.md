Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.

2. **Condition Check**:
   - The program checks if `4 * n - 2` equals `k`.
     - If true, it prints `k // 2 + 1`.
     - Otherwise, it prints `ceil(k / 2)`.

3. **Mathematical Justification**:
   - The total number of diagonals in an \( n \times n \) grid is \( 4n - 2 \).
   - To minimize the number of cells colored while ensuring at least `k` diagonals have at least one colored cell, we need to understand how coloring affects the diagonals.

4. **Case Analysis**:
   - **Case 1**: When `4 * n - 2 == k`
     - This means we need exactly `k` diagonals to have at least one colored cell.
     - Each diagonal can be covered by coloring one cell.
     - Since there are `4n - 2` diagonals, we need to color `4n - 2` cells to cover all diagonals.
     - However, we need to ensure that these cells are optimally placed to cover the required diagonals.
     - By placing cells in a strategic manner (e.g., along the main diagonals), we can achieve this with fewer cells.
     - The formula `k // 2 + 1` ensures that we cover the required diagonals efficiently.

   - **Case 2**: When `4 * n - 2 != k`
     - We need to find the minimum number of cells to color such that at least `k` diagonals are covered.
     - The formula `ceil(k / 2)` ensures that we cover at least `k` diagonals by coloring the minimum necessary cells.

### Conclusion

The program correctly handles both cases:
- When `4 * n - 2 == k`, it prints `k // 2 + 1` which is the optimal number of cells needed.
- When `4 * n - 2 != k`, it prints `ceil(k / 2)` which ensures at least `k` diagonals are covered.

Given the example and the problem constraints, the program appears to be correct.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
