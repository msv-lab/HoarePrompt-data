Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is the first integer from the input split by spaces.
   - `k` is the second integer from the input split by spaces.
   - `s` is the next line from the standard input.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(2 * n - 1)
   ```

From the initial state, we know that `n` is an integer obtained from the first part of the input split by spaces. Since the exact value of `n` is not specified, we will keep it as `n`.

The expression `2 * n - 1` calculates twice the value of `n` and then subtracts 1 from it.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be the result of this calculation.

Output: **2 * n - 1**
