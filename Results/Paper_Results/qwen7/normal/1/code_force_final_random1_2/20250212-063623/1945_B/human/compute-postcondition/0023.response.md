Output State: The value of `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `i` is equal to `t - 1`, meaning the loop has completed all its iterations. For each iteration `i` from 0 to `t-1`, the values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are the integers provided by the `input().split()` function for that iteration. The variable `mn` is calculated as the sum of `min(a, b)` and `m`. Depending on the conditions specified in the loop body, either `mn // a + mn // b + 1` or `mn // a + mn // b` is printed. After all iterations, no further changes occur to the variables within the loop, and the loop has processed all inputs provided in the initial state.
