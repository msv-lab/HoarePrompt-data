Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 1, `a` is the first integer from input, `b` is the second integer from input, `m` is the third integer from input, `mn` is the minimum of `a` and `b` plus `m`. If `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b` and neither `a` nor `b` is 1, then no changes are made. Otherwise, no changes are made.**
