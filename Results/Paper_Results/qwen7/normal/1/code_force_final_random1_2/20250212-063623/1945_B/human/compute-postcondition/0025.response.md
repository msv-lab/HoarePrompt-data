Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` within specified ranges (1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^{18}) for each test case `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). It returns different values based on the relationship between `a`, `b`, and `m`.**

Note: The actual processing logic and return values are not described here as per the instruction to only describe the parameters and return value without detailing the operations inside the function.
