Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 1, `a` is the first integer from input, `b` is the second integer from input, `m` is the third integer from input, `mn` is the sum of `min(a, b)` and `m`.**

The code reads three integers from the input using `map(int, input().split())` and assigns them to `a`, `b`, and `m` respectively. It also calculates `mn` as the sum of `min(a, b)` and `m`. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged.
