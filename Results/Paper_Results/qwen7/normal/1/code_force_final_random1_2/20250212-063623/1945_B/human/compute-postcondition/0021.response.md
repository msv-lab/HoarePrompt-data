Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
- `i` is 2.
- `a` is the first integer from input.
- `b` is the second integer from input.
- `m` is the third integer from input.
- `mn` is the minimum of `a` and `b` plus `m`.

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(mn // a + mn // b)`.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the value of `mn`:**
   - `mn` is defined as the minimum of `a` and `b` plus `m`.
   - Therefore, `mn = min(a, b) + m`.

2. **Determine the expression to be printed:**
   - The expression to be printed is `mn // a + mn // b`.
   - Substitute `mn` into the expression: `(min(a, b) + m) // a + (min(a, b) + m) // b`.

Now, let's consider the values of `a` and `b`:
- Since `a` and `b` are the first and second integers from input, their values are not explicitly defined in the initial state. However, we know they are integers.

3. **Evaluate the expression:**
   - We need to evaluate `(min(a, b) + m) // a + (min(a, b) + m) // b`.
   - This expression involves integer division (`//`), which means the result is the quotient of the division without the remainder.

To provide a general answer, we need to consider the possible values of `a` and `b` relative to `m`:

- If `a` and `b` are such that `min(a, b) <= m`, then both divisions will yield 1 because `min(a, b) + m` will be greater than or equal to `a` and `b`.
- If `a` and `b` are such that `min(a, b) > m`, then the result depends on the specific values of `a`, `b`, and `m`.

However, without specific values for `a`, `b`, and `m`, we can only describe the expression in a general form.

Output: **(min(a, b) + m) // a + (min(a, b) + m) // b (where `a` and `b` are the first and second integers from input, and `m` is the third integer from input)**
