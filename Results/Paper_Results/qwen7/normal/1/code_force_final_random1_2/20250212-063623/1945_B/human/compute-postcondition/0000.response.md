Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, the value of `t` remains within this range after the code execution. All other variables (`a`, `b`, and `m`) are not affected by this code snippet, so they retain their unspecified initial conditions.
