Reasoning:
The provided solution aims to calculate the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time. The logic is as follows:

1. Calculate `mn` as the minimum of `a` and `b` plus `m`.
2. Check if `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b` and if neither `a` nor `b` is 1.
   - If true, the formula `mn // a + mn // b + 1` is used because there would be an additional overlap due to the divisibility condition.
   - If false, the formula `mn // a + mn // b` is used.

This approach correctly accounts for the overlap of firework visibility intervals when `m` is a common multiple of both `a` and `b`.

Given the problem constraints and the provided example, the logic appears to be sound. The code processes each test case correctly and outputs the expected results based on the provided examples.

Correctness: **True**
