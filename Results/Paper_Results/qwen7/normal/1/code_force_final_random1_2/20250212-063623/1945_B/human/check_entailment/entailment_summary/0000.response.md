Reasoning:
To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the logic used to calculate the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have two installations launching fireworks at intervals \(a\) and \(b\) respectively.
   - Each firework is visible for \(m + 1\) minutes.
   - We need to find the maximum number of fireworks visible at any given time.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The key insight is that the number of fireworks visible at any given time is determined by the least common multiple (LCM) of \(a\) and \(b\).
   - If \(m\) is a multiple of both \(a\) and \(b\), the number of fireworks visible is \(\text{lcm}(a, b) / a + \text{lcm}(a, b) / b + 1\).
   - Otherwise, it is \(\text{lcm}(a, b) / a + \text{lcm}(a, b) / b\).

3. **Analysis of the Provided Code:**
   - The code calculates `mn = min(a, b) + m`.
   - It checks if \(m\) is divisible by both \(a\) and \(b\) and neither \(a\) nor \(b\) is 1.
   - If the condition is met, it prints \(\frac{mn}{a} + \frac{mn}{b} + 1\).
   - Otherwise, it prints \(\frac{mn}{a} + \frac{mn}{b}\).

4. **Issues Identified:**
   - The calculation of `mn` should be based on the LCM of \(a\) and \(b\), not just the minimum of \(a\) and \(b\).
   - The condition `if m % a == 0 and m % b == 0 and (a != 1) and (b != 1)` is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the LCM and the visibility period.
   - The formula used to calculate the number of fireworks is incorrect. It should use the LCM of \(a\) and \(b\) instead of `mn`.

5. **Correct Approach:**
   - Calculate the LCM of \(a\) and \(b\).
   - Use the LCM to determine the number of fireworks visible.

Given the issues identified, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
