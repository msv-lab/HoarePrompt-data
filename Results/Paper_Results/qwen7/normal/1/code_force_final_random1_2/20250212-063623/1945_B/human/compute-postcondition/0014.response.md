Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
   - `i` is 1.
   - `a` is the first integer from input.
   - `b` is the second integer from input.
   - `m` is the third integer from input.
   - `mn` is the minimum of `a` and `b` plus `m`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(mn // a + mn // b + 1)
   ```

3. **Determine the Value of `mn`:**
   - `mn` is defined as the minimum of `a` and `b` plus `m`.
   - Let's denote the minimum of `a` and `b` as `min_ab`.
   - Therefore, `mn = min_ab + m`.

4. **Evaluate the Print Statement:**
   - The expression inside the print statement is `mn // a + mn // b + 1`.
   - Substitute `mn` with `min_ab + m`:
     \[
     \text{print}((\text{min\_ab} + m) // a + (\text{min\_ab} + m) // b + 1)
     \]

5. **Simplify the Expression:**
   - The expression simplifies to:
     \[
     \left(\frac{\text{min\_ab} + m}{a}\right) + \left(\frac{\text{min\_ab} + m}{b}\right) + 1
     \]
   - This means we need to compute the integer division of `min_ab + m` by `a` and `b`, and then add 1.

6. **Final Output:**
   - The exact value depends on the specific values of `a`, `b`, and `m`, but the general form is clear.

Given the general form, the output can be described as follows:

Output: **\(\left(\frac{\text{min\_ab} + m}{a}\right) + \left(\frac{\text{min\_ab} + m}{b}\right) + 1\)**

Where `min_ab` is the minimum of `a` and `b`, and `m` is the third integer from input.
