Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
   - `i` is 1.
   - `a` is the first integer from input.
   - `b` is the second integer from input.
   - `m` is the third integer from input.
   - `mn` is the minimum of `a` and `b` plus `m`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(mn // a + mn // b)
   ```

3. **Determine the Value of `mn`:**
   - `mn` is defined as the minimum of `a` and `b` plus `m`.
   - Let's denote the minimum of `a` and `b` as `min_ab`. Therefore, `mn = min_ab + m`.

4. **Evaluate the Print Statement:**
   - The expression inside the `print` function is `mn // a + mn // b`.
   - Substituting `mn` with `min_ab + m`, we get `(min_ab + m) // a + (min_ab + m) // b`.

5. **Simplify the Expression:**
   - Since `min_ab` is either `a` or `b`, let's consider both cases:
     - If `a <= b`, then `min_ab = a` and the expression becomes `(a + m) // a + (a + m) // b`.
     - If `b < a`, then `min_ab = b` and the expression becomes `(b + m) // a + (b + m) // b`.

6. **Final Output:**
   - The exact value depends on the specific values of `a`, `b`, and `m`, but the general form of the output is `(min_ab + m) // a + (min_ab + m) // b`.

Given the format requirement, the output should be described as follows:

Output: **(min_ab + m) // a + (min_ab + m) // b (where min_ab is the minimum of a and b, and m is the third integer from input)**
