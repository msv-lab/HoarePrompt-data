### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program step by step using the provided problem description and function summary.

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, reading `n` and `k`.

2. **Condition Check**:
   - The program checks if `4 * n - 2` equals `k`.
     - If true, it prints `k // 2 + 1`.
     - Otherwise, it prints `ceil(k / 2)`.

3. **Mathematical Justification**:
   - The total number of diagonals in an \( n \times n \) grid is indeed \( 4n - 2 \).
   - To minimize the number of cells colored while ensuring at least `k` diagonals have at least one colored cell, we need to consider the following:
     - In the worst case, each diagonal requires at least one colored cell.
     - If `4 * n - 2 == k`, we need to cover exactly `k` diagonals. Placing cells along the diagonals optimally can be done with `k // 2 + 1` cells.
     - If `4 * n - 2 != k`, we need to find the minimum number of cells to cover at least `k` diagonals. Using `ceil(k / 2)` ensures that we cover at least `k` diagonals.

4. **Case Analysis**:
   - **Case 1**: When `4 * n - 2 == k`
     - The formula `k // 2 + 1` is derived from the fact that each pair of diagonals can be covered by one cell. Since there are `4n - 2` diagonals, we need to cover them optimally.
     - This formula ensures that we cover the required diagonals efficiently.
   - **Case 2**: When `4 * n - 2 != k`
     - The formula `ceil(k / 2)` ensures that we cover at least `k` diagonals by coloring the minimum necessary cells.

### Example Verification

Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

- **Test Case 1**: \( n = 3 \), \( k = 4 \)
  - Total diagonals: \( 4 \times 3 - 2 = 10 \)
  - Since \( 10 \neq 4 \), the program prints `ceil(4 / 2) = 2`.
  - Correct answer: 2 (as shown in the example).

- **Test Case 2**: \( n = 3 \), \( k = 3 \)
  - Total diagonals: \( 4 \times 3 - 2 = 10 \)
  - Since \( 10 \neq 3 \), the program prints `ceil(3 / 2) = 2`.
  - Correct answer: 2 (as shown in the example).

- **Test Case 3**: \( n = 3 \), \( k = 10 \)
  - Total diagonals: \( 4 \times 3 - 2 = 10 \)
  - Since \( 10 == 10 \), the program prints `10 // 2 + 1 = 6`.
  - Correct answer: 6 (as shown in the example).

- **Test Case 4**: \( n = 3 \), \( k = 9 \)
  - Total diagonals: \( 4 \times 3 - 2 = 10 \)
  - Since \( 10 \neq 9 \), the program prints `ceil(9 / 2) = 5`.
  - Correct answer: 5 (as shown in the example).

- **Test Case 5**: \( n = 4 \), \( k = 7 \)
  - Total diagonals: \( 4 \times 4 - 2 = 14 \)
  - Since \( 14 \neq 7 \), the program prints `ceil(7 / 2) = 4`.
  - Correct answer: 4 (as shown in the example).

- **Test Case 6**: \( n = 7 \), \( k = 11 \)
  - Total diagonals: \( 4 \times 7 - 2 = 26 \)
  - Since \( 26 \neq 11 \), the program prints `ceil(11 / 2) = 6`.
  - Correct answer: 6 (as shown in the example).

- **Test Case 7**: \( n = 2 \), \( k = 3 \)
  - Total diagonals: \( 4 \times 2 - 2 = 6 \)
  - Since \( 6 \neq 3 \), the program prints `ceil(3 / 2) = 2`.
  - Correct answer: 2 (as shown in the example).

### Conclusion

The program correctly handles both cases and produces the expected results based on the problem description and the provided examples.

### Final Answer

Final: **True**
