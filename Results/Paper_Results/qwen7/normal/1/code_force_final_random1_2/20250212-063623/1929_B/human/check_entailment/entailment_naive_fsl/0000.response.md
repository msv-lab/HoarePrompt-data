Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when `k` is greater than `4 * n - 2`. According to the problem description, `k` should be within the range `[1, 4 * n - 2]`, but the program does not account for this scenario. For example, if `n = 3` and `k = 10`, the program will still attempt to calculate the result using the formula `k // 2 + 1`, which leads to an incorrect answer. The correct approach would be to ensure that `k` does not exceed `4 * n - 2` before performing the calculation.
