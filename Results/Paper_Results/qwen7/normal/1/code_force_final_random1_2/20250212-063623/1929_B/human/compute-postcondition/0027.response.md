Postcondition: `s` is the next line from the standard input, `n` is the integer value of the first part of `s` split by spaces, and `k` is the integer value of the second part of `s` split by spaces. If `k` equals `4 * n - 2`, then the condition is met. Otherwise, no change is made to the values of `s`, `n`, and `k`.
