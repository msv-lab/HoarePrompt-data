Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer between 0 and 999 inclusive.
- `n` is an input integer converted to an integer.
- `k` is an input integer converted to an integer.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(ceil(k / 2))
```

Here, `ceil(k / 2)` means the ceiling of the division of `k` by 2. The ceiling function rounds up to the nearest integer if the result of the division is not an integer.

Since the value of `k` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact numerical result of `ceil(k / 2)`. However, we know it will be the smallest integer greater than or equal to `k / 2`.

Therefore, the output will be the ceiling of `k / 2`.

Output: **ceil(k / 2)**
