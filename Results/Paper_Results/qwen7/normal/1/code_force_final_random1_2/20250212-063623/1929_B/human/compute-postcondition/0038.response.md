Output State: All lines from the standard input have been processed, and the loop has executed for each line. For each line, the values of `n` and `k` are determined based on the conditions provided in the loop body. Specifically:

- If `k` is less than or equal to `4 * n - 4`, the output is `math.ceil(k / 2)`.
- If `k` is exactly `4 * n - 3`, the output is `2 * n - 1`.
- If `k` is exactly `4 * n - 2`, the output is `2 * n`.

After processing all lines, the final values of `n` and `k` will be those of the last line read from the standard input, and `s` will be the last line (excluding the first line) read from the standard input. The loop has completed its execution, and no further operations are performed on `n`, `k`, or `s`.
