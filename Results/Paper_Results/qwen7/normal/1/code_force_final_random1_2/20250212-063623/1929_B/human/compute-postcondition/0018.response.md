Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 999 inclusive.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `n` and `k` are assigned the values from the input split and converted to integers.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(k // 2 + 1)
```

Here, `k // 2` performs integer division of `k` by 2, and then 1 is added to the result. Since `k` is an integer, the expression `k // 2 + 1` will yield an integer value.

Given that `k` is an integer input, the exact value of `k` is not specified, but it will be processed as described. The output will be the result of this operation.

Output: **k // 2 + 1 (where k is the input integer)**
