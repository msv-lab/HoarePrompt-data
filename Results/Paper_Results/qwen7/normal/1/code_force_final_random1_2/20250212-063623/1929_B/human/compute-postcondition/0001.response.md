Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and the variable `t`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.

3. **Initial State**: The initial state is given as `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.

4. **Adjust the State**: For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. Since `t` is guaranteed to be an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, it already satisfies this condition. However, we need to explicitly state this condition.

5. **Final State**: The state of `t` should be adjusted to reflect that it is a positive integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive**.
