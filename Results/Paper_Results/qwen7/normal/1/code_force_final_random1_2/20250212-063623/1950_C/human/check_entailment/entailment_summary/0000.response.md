Reasoning:

1. The program correctly handles the conversion of hours from 24-hour format to 12-hour format.
2. For hours starting at '00', it correctly prints '12'.
3. For hours from '01' to '12', it prints the hour as is.
4. For hours from '13' to '23', it correctly prints the hour minus 12 with a leading zero.
5. The program correctly appends the AM/PM indicator based on whether the hour is greater than or equal to 12.
6. The program prints the results directly without returning any value, which matches the problem statement's requirement.

Given that the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and produces the expected output as per the execution summary, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
