Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t < 1440\).
   - `t` is incremented by 1.
   - `s` is an input string from the user.
   - `h` is the first two characters of the input string `s`.

2. **Conditions:**
   - If `h` is '00', no change is made to `t` and `h`.
   - Otherwise, if the integer value represented by `h` is less than or equal to 12, no change is made to `t` and `h`.

3. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(s[2:], ['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12])
   ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **String Slicing:**
   - `s[2:]` will return the substring starting from the third character (index 2) to the end of the string `s`.

2. **Condition Evaluation:**
   - `int(h) >= 12`: This checks if the integer value of the first two characters of `s` is greater than or equal to 12.
   - `['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12]`: This returns either 'AM' or 'PM' based on the result of the condition. If `int(h) >= 12` is `True`, it returns 'PM'; otherwise, it returns 'AM'.

### Possible Scenarios:

- **Scenario 1:** `h` is '00'
  - No change is made to `t` and `h`.
  - `s[2:]` will be the substring starting from the third character of `s`.
  - `int('00') >= 12` evaluates to `False`, so `['AM', 'PM'][False]` returns 'AM'.
  - Output: **s[2:], 'AM'**

- **Scenario 2:** `h` is not '00' and the integer value of `h` is less than or equal to 12
  - No change is made to `t` and `h`.
  - `s[2:]` will be the substring starting from the third character of `s`.
  - `int(h) >= 12` evaluates to `False`, so `['AM', 'PM'][False]` returns 'AM'.
  - Output: **s[2:], 'AM'**

- **Scenario 3:** `h` is not '00' and the integer value of `h` is greater than 12
  - No change is made to `t` and `h`.
  - `s[2:]` will be the substring starting from the third character of `s`.
  - `int(h) >= 12` evaluates to `True`, so `['AM', 'PM'][True]` returns 'PM'.
  - Output: **s[2:], 'PM'**

### Conclusion:

Given the conditions and the code snippet, the output will depend on the value of `h`. However, since the exact value of `s` is not specified, we can generalize the output as follows:

Output: **s[2:], ['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12]**
