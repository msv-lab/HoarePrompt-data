Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `t` and the value obtained from `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `t` is less than the value obtained from `int(input())`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440.
   - `s` is an input string.
   - `h` is the first two characters of `s`.
   - If `h` is '00', no changes are made.
   - If `h` is not '00', no changes are made as well.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is controlled by `t` and the value of `int(input())`, we need to update `t` to `t + 1`.
   - The value of `int(input())` remains the same for the next iteration unless it changes externally (which is not specified in the problem).

5. **Construct the new state**:
   - `t` will be incremented by 1.
   - `s` and `h` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head and their values do not affect the loop continuation condition.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t < 1440, `s` is an input string, and `h` is the first two characters of `s`**.
