Based on the initial state and the code snippet provided:

1. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440.
2. `s` is an input string.
3. `h` is the first two characters of `s`.

The code snippet is:
```python
print(s[2:], ['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12])
```

Let's break it down:

- `s[2:]`: This slice operation extracts the substring starting from the third character (index 2) to the end of the string `s`.
- `['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12]`: This checks if the integer value of `h` is greater than or equal to 12. If true, it returns `'PM'`; otherwise, it returns `'AM'`.

Given the postcondition, `h` is the first two characters of `s`. The postcondition also states that if `h` is '00', no changes are made. If `h` is not '00', no changes are made either. This implies that `h` can be any two-character string except '00'.

Since `h` cannot be '00', let's consider a general case where `h` is some other two-character string, say '12'. 

- If `h` is '12', then `int(h) >= 12` evaluates to `True`, so `['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12]` will return `'PM'`.
- If `h` is any other string, the same logic applies, and the result will still be `'PM'` because `int(h) >= 12` will evaluate to `False` for any `h` that is not '00', and thus return `'AM'`.

Therefore, the output will always be the substring of `s` starting from the third character followed by either `'AM'` or `'PM'`.

Output: **s[2:] + 'AM' or s[2:] + 'PM' (depending on the value of h)**
