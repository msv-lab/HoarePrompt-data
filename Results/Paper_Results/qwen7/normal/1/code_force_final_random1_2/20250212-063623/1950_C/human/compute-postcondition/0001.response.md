Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is an input string**.

Explanation: The variable `s` is assigned the value of the input string from the user. The precondition that `int(input())` must be greater than `t` is not checked or enforced by the given code snippet. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and it is still within the range of 1 to 1440. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `s` and retains the original range of `t`.
