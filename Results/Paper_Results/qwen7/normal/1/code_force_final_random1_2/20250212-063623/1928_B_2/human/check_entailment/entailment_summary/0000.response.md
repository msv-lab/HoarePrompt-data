Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the maximum number of elements equal to the same number in the array after adding a permutation to the array.
2. The provided solution uses a different set of functions than those described in the execution summary. Instead, it directly uses `func_1`, `func_3`, and `func_2` (which is not explicitly defined in the execution summary but seems to process input similar to `func_3`).
3. Let's analyze the logic of the provided code:
   - `func_1()` returns the number of test cases.
   - `n = func_1()` is used to get the length of the array.
   - `arr = sorted(list(set(func_3())))` sorts and removes duplicates from the array.
   - `m = max(arr)` finds the maximum value in the array.
   - The loop iterates through the unique values in the array and calculates the maximum number of elements that can be made equal by adding a permutation.
   - `bisect_left(arr, arr[i] + n)` is used to find the position where the value `arr[i] + n` would fit in the sorted array.
   - The difference between this position and the current index `i` gives the count of elements that can be made equal to `arr[i]`.

Given the problem statement and the logic of the provided code, the code attempts to solve the problem correctly by ensuring that the maximum number of elements can be made equal by adding a permutation. The approach of sorting and removing duplicates before processing ensures that we only consider unique values, and the use of `bisect_left` helps in determining the count of elements that can be made equal.

However, the code does not fully align with the provided execution summaries, which suggest a different set of functions. Despite this discrepancy, the logic of the code matches the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
