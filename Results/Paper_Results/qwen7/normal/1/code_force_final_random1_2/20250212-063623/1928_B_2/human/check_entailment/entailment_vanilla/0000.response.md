### Reasoning:

The provided program does not contain any functions that directly solve the problem described. Instead, it defines several utility functions that do not align with the requirements of the problem. The problem requires us to determine the maximum number of elements equal to the same number in the array after adding a permutation to the array. However, the given functions are not relevant to this task.

To solve the problem correctly, we would need to:
1. Read the input values for the number of test cases and the array for each test case.
2. For each test case, sort the array and use a permutation to maximize the frequency of the most common element.
3. Determine the maximum frequency of any element in the transformed array.

Given the current set of functions, none of them contribute to solving the problem as described. Therefore, the provided program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
