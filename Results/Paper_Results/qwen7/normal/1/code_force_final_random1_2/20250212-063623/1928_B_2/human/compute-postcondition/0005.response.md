Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `arr` is a list of positive integers that must have at least 1 element.
   - `i` is `len(arr) - 2`.
   - `tem` is multiplied by the last element of `arr`.
   - `ans` is a list with one element which is `tem * arr[-1]`.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1):
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop starts from `len(arr) - 1` and decrements `i` by 1 until `i` becomes -1.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `len(arr) - 2`.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be `len(arr) - 3`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `i >= -1`, so `i` must be `len(arr) - 3` or greater.

5. **Adjusting States:**
   - `i` needs to be adjusted to `len(arr) - 3`.
   - `tem` is updated in the loop body, but we don't know the exact value yet.
   - `ans` is updated based on the value of `tem` and the current element of `arr`.

6. **Final State:**
   - `arr` remains unchanged as it is not modified in the loop head.
   - `i` is now `len(arr) - 3`.
   - `tem` is updated but its exact value is unknown without seeing the loop body.
   - `ans` is updated but its exact value is unknown without seeing the loop body.

Given the information provided, the only state that can be directly adjusted is `i`.

**State: **`i` is `len(arr) - 3`, `arr` is a list of positive integers that must have at least 1 element, `tem` is an unknown value, `ans` is a list with one element which is `tem * arr[-1]` after the previous iteration.**
