Output State: **`arr` is a list of positive integers that must have at least 1 element, `i` is `len(arr) - 2`, `tem` is multiplied by the last element of `arr`, `ans` is a list with one element which is `tem * arr[-1]`**.

Explanation: The code appends the value of `tem * arr[-1]` to the list `ans`. Here, `arr[-1]` refers to the last element of the list `arr`, and `tem` is already multiplied by this last element. The values of `arr`, `i`, and `tem` remain unchanged, but `ans` now contains the calculated value.
