Output State: **`i` is `len(arr) - 5`, `tem` is `tem * arr[len(arr) - 4] * arr[len(arr) - 5]`, `ans` is a list with two elements where the first element is `tem * arr[-2]` and the second element is `tem * arr[-1]`**.

Explanation:
- Initially, `i` is set to `len(arr) - 4`.
- The line `tem *= arr[i]` multiplies `tem` by the value of `arr[i]`. Since `i` was `len(arr) - 4`, after executing the line, `i` becomes `len(arr) - 5`.
- `tem` is updated to `tem * arr[len(arr) - 4] * arr[len(arr) - 5]`.
- The list `ans` remains unchanged as the code does not modify its elements. It still contains two elements: the first element is `tem * arr[-2]` and the second element is `tem * arr[-1]`.
