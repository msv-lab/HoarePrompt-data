Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `winner` is the result of `func_1(a, b)`, `results` is a list containing the value of `winner`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `winner` to the list `results`. Since `winner` is the result of `func_1(a, b)`, the list `results` now contains this value. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `winner` remain unchanged from their initial states.
