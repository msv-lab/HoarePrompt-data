Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head**: The loop head is defined by the `for _ in range(t):` statement. This means that the loop variable is `_` (an underscore, which is often used as a throwaway variable when the value is not needed), and the loop will run `t` times.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `t` was greater than 0 and was decreased by 1.

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `t` is a loop control variable, it needs to be adjusted for the next iteration. After each iteration, `t` is decreased by 1.
   - The other variables (`a`, `b`, `winner`, and `results`) remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body, but they are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted here.

Given this information, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `t` has been decreased by 1 from its previous value.

**State: **`t` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `winner` is the result of `func_1(a, b)`, `results` is a list containing the value of `winner`, `a`, and `b`**. 

Since `t` is the only variable directly controlled by the loop, the new value of `t` should be `t - 1`.

**State: **`t` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `winner` is the result of `func_1(a, b)`, `results` is a list containing the value of `winner`, `a`, and `b`**. 

So, the final state is:

**State: **`t` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `winner` is the result of `func_1(a, b)`, `results` is a list containing the value of `winner`, `a`, and `b`**.
