Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `winner` is the result of `func_1(a, b)`, `results` is a list containing the value of `winner`, `a`, and `b`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `winner` to the list `results`. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `winner`, and `results` are updated as follows:
- `t` remains greater than 0 and is decreased by 1.
- `a` and `b` remain as input integers.
- `winner` remains as the result of `func_1(a, b)`.
- `results` now contains the value of `winner`, the new value of `a`, and the new value of `b` after they have been updated to new integer values from user input.
