Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `t` is equal to 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `winner` is the result of `func_1(a, b)` for the last iteration, `results` is a list containing the `winner` values from each iteration, the original `a` and `b` values from each iteration, and the `winner` is added to the list after each iteration until `t` becomes 0.

In this final state, `t` has reached 0 after all iterations of the loop have completed, meaning all `t` input integers have been processed. The `results` list contains the `winner` value determined by `func_1(a, b)` for each pair of integers `(a, b)` entered by the user, along with the original values of `a` and `b` for each iteration.
Code of the loop:
for result in results:
    print(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is 0, `results` is a list containing tuples (or other collections) where each tuple includes the `winner`, the original values of `a` and `b`, and possibly other information.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is 0, `results` is a list containing at least one tuple (or other collection)

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is 0, `results` is a list containing at least one tuple (or other collection)




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
