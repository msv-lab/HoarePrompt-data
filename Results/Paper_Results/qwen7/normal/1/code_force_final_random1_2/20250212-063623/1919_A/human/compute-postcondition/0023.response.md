Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes a positive integer `t` such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, two positive integers `a` and `b` such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9. Based on these inputs, the function performs some operations and returns a result.**

Note: The exact operations and the nature of the return value are not specified in the given information. The description focuses on the constraints and the fact that the function processes multiple test cases within the specified range.
