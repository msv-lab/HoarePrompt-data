Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `a, b = map(int, input().strip().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input, converts them to integers, and assigns them to variables `a` and `b`. The initial condition that `t` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged. Therefore, `t` must still be greater than 0, while `a` and `b` are now specific integers obtained from user input.
