Output State: `t` is equal to 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `winner` is the result of `func_1(a, b)` for the last iteration, `results` is a list containing the `winner` values from each iteration, the original `a` and `b` values from each iteration, and the `winner` for the last iteration.

In this final state, `t` has been decremented to 0 after all iterations of the loop have completed. The `results` list contains the `winner` value returned by `func_1(a, b)` for each iteration, along with the original `a` and `b` values provided during each iteration.
