Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The given solution correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Game Logic Analysis**:
   - Each player can either swap wallets or remove a coin from their own wallet.
   - The key observation is that the game essentially reduces the total number of coins by one in each turn until one player cannot make a move.
   - If the initial sum of coins `(a + b)` is even, Bob will always win because he can always mirror Alice's moves. Conversely, if the sum is odd, Alice will always win because she can force the sum to become even on her turn, ensuring Bob eventually loses.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd using `(a + b) % 2`.
   - If the sum is even, it returns 'Bob'.
   - If the sum is odd, it returns 'Alice'.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each pair of test case inputs `(a, b)`, it calls `func_1` to determine the winner and appends the result to the list `results`.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

Given this analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the game rules and the given constraints. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
