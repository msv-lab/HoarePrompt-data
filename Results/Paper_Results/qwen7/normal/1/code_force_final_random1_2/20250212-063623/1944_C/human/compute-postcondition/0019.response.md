Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `start` is explicitly given as 1.
   - `vis` is a set containing the elements 0 and 1.
   - `nums[1]` is modified to `nums[1] - 1`, but this modification does not affect the `print` statement since it is not used in the print statement itself.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   - The code snippet contains a single line: `print(start + 1)`.

3. **Calculation**:
   - `start` is 1.
   - Therefore, `start + 1` equals 2.

4. **Output**:
   - The `print` statement will output the result of `start + 1`, which is 2.

Output: **2**
