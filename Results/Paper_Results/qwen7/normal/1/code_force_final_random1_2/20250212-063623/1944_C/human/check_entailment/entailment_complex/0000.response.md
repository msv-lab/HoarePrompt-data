### Reasoning:

The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Misunderstanding of the Game Rules**:
   - **Alice's Turn**: Alice picks one element from `arr`, appends it to `c`, and removes it from `arr`.
   - **Bob's Turn**: Bob picks one element from `arr` and removes it without appending it to `c`.

2. **Function `func_1` Implementation**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to simulate the game and determine the MEX of the resulting array `c`.
   - However, the function does not simulate the game correctly. Instead, it tries to find the smallest index `start` such that `start + 1` is not present in the original list `arr`. This is not equivalent to finding the MEX of the array `c` after the game is played.

3. **Incorrect Logic**:
   - The function uses a counter (`nums`) to keep track of the frequency of elements in `arr`.
   - It then iterates through the indices to find the smallest index `start` that is not present in `arr`.
   - This logic is flawed because it does not account for the turns taken by Alice and Bob and the specific rules of the game.

4. **Expected Behavior**:
   - The program should simulate the game according to the rules and then compute the MEX of the resulting array `c`.
   - The current implementation does not follow these rules and thus cannot produce the correct output.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic and therefore does not produce the correct output. Hence, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
