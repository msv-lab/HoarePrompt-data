Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information
- The loop condition is `nums.get(start, 0)`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `start` is 1, `vis` is a set containing 0, and `nums[start + 1]` is greater than 0.

### Loop Condition Analysis
The loop continues as long as `nums.get(start, 0)` is truthy (non-zero). This means that the loop will continue as long as `nums[start]` is non-zero.

### Current State
- `start` is 1.
- `vis` is a set containing 0.
- `nums[start + 1]` is greater than 0.

### Next Iteration Requirement
For the loop to execute one more time, `nums[start]` must be non-zero. Currently, `start` is 1, so we need to check `nums[1]`.

### Adjusting the State
- The variable `start` is the only one directly involved in the loop condition `nums.get(start, 0)`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `nums[start]` is non-zero for the next iteration.
- Since `start` is currently 1, we need to ensure that `nums[1]` is non-zero.

### Conclusion
To ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to adjust the state such that `nums[1]` is non-zero. No other states need to be adjusted because they are not part of the loop condition.

### Final Answer
State: **`start` is 1, `vis` is a set containing 0, and `nums[1]` must be non-zero**.
