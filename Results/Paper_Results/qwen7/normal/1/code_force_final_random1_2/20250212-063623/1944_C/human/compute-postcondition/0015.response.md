Output State: **`start` is 1; `vis` is a set containing 0 and 1; `nums[1]` must be non-zero**

The code `vis.add(start)` adds the value of `start` (which is 1) to the set `vis`. Initially, `vis` contains the value 0. After adding `start` to `vis`, `vis` now contains both 0 and 1. All other variables remain unchanged, so `start` is still 1 and `nums[1]` must be non-zero.
