Output State: **`start` is 0, `vis` is a set containing 0, `nums[0]` is `nums[0] - 2`, and `nums[start + 1]` is greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code `nums[start + 1] -= 1` decrements the value of `nums[start + 1]` by 1. Given that `start` is 0, `nums[start + 1]` is `nums[1]`. Initially, `nums[1]` is greater than 0. After executing the code, `nums[1]` is now `nums[1] - 1`, which is still greater than 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
