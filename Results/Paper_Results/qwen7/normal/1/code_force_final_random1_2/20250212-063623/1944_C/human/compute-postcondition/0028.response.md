Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Initial State:
   - `start` is 2.
   - `vis` is a set containing 0, 1, and 2.
   - `nums[start]` is decreased by 1. Since `start` is 2, `nums[2]` is decreased by 1. However, the value of `nums[2]` after this operation is not needed to determine the output of the print statement.

2. The print statement is `print(start + 1)`.
   - `start` is explicitly given as 2.
   - Therefore, `start + 1` is `2 + 1`, which equals 3.

Output: **3**
