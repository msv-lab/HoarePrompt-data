Output State: **`start` is 2; `vis` is a set containing 0, 1, and 2**

Explanation: The code `vis.add(start)` adds the value of `start` (which is 2) to the set `vis`. Initially, `vis` contains the elements 0 and 1. After adding 2 to the set, `vis` now contains 0, 1, and 2. The value of `start` remains unchanged.
