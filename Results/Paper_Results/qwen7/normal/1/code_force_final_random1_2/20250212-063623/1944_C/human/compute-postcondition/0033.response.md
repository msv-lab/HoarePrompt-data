Output State: `start` is 4, `vis` is a set containing 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, and `nums[4]` is either 0 or None (since it was decremented by 1 during the last iteration and the loop condition no longer holds).

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `start` would be incremented to 4 because the loop continues as long as `nums.get(start, 0)` is truthy. Since we know from the given conditions that the loop runs exactly 4 times, `start` will be 4 at the end. The set `vis` contains all indices from 0 to 3 because each index was visited exactly once. Finally, `nums[4]` is either 0 or None because it was decremented by 1 during the last iteration, and the loop condition `nums.get(start, 0)` becomes false, causing the loop to terminate.
