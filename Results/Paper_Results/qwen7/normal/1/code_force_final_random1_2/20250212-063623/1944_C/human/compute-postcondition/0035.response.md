The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of non-negative integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \le a_i < n\) and the length of the list is \(n\) (i.e., 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5). The function does not contain any return statements, so it does not return any value. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `arr` and perform operations on it without returning any result.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `arr` of non-negative integers and performs operations on it without returning any result.**
