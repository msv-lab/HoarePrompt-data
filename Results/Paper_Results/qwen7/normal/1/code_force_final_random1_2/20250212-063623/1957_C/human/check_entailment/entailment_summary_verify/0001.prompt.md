You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an n \times n chessboard where you and the computer take turns
alternatingly to place white rooks & black rooks on the board respectively.
While placing rooks, you have to ensure that no two rooks attack each other.
Two rooks attack each other if they share the same row or column regardless of
color.

A valid move is placing a rook on a position (r , c ) such that it doesn't
attack any other rook.

You start first, and when you make a valid move in your turn, placing a white
rook at position (r , c ), the computer will mirror you and place a black rook
at position (c , r ) in its turn. If r = c , then the computer can't mirror
your move, and skips its turn.

You have already played k moves with the computer (the computer tries to
mirror these moves too), and you must continue playing the game until there
are no valid moves remaining. How many different final configurations are
possible when you continue the game after the k moves? It is guaranteed that
the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid. Since the answer may be
large, print it modulo 10^9+7 .

Two configurations are considered different if there exists a coordinate (r ,
c ) which has a rook in one configuration, but not in the other or the color
of the rook on the coordinate is different.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq
3 \cdot 10^5 , 0 \leq k \leq n ) — the size of the chessboard and the number
of moves you have already played respectively.

Each of the next k lines of the test case contains two integers r_i and c_i ,
denoting the i -th move you made.

It is guaranteed that the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the total number
of possible final configurations modulo 10^9+7 .

Example

Input

    3
    
    4 1
    
    1 2
    
    8 1
    
    7 6
    
    1000 4
    
    4 4
    
    952 343
    
    222 333
    
    90 91

Output

    3
    331
    671968183
    
Note

In the first test case, we have a 4 \times 4 grid and you've already played 1
move. After you and the computer play a turn, we have a white rook at (1 , 2
), and a black rook at (2 , 1 ). There are three possible configurations from
this state —

  1. You place a white rook at (3 , 4 ) and the computer places a black rook at (4 , 3 ) as a response. 
  2. You place a white rook at (4 , 3 ) and the computer places a black rook at (3 , 4 ) as a response. 
  3. You place a white rook at (3 , 3 ) and then at (4 , 4 ), or the other way around. They both result in the same configuration.

- Program:
import sys

sys.setrecursionlimit(400000)
dp = [-1 for _ in range(300007)]
func_1(300000)
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    invalid = set([])
    for _ in range(k):
        (r, c) = map(int, input().split())
        invalid.add(r)
        invalid.add(c)
    print(max(1, dp[n - len(invalid)]))

def func_1(n):
    dp[1] = 1
    dp[2] = 3
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts an integer `n` and calculates a sequence of integers stored in the list `dp`, where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to tile a 2 × i rectangle with 1 × 2 dominoes and 2 × 2 squares, modulo 1000000007. After calculating up to `dp[n]`, the function does not return any specific value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the number of different final configurations of an \( n \times n \) chessboard after \( k \) moves, where each move places a rook and the opponent mirrors the move.
   - The configurations are considered different if there is any cell with a rook in one configuration but not in the other, or if the colors differ.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - Each move invalidates positions in rows and columns.
   - The number of valid positions decreases as more rooks are placed.
   - The problem reduces to finding the number of ways to place rooks in the remaining valid positions.

3. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - The function `func_1` initializes a DP array to store the number of ways to place rooks in a smaller board.
   - The recurrence relation used is \( dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + 2 \cdot (i-1) \cdot dp[i-2]) \mod 1000000007 \).

4. **Implementation Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( k \), and tracks the invalid positions using a set.
   - The number of valid positions is \( n - \text{len(invalid)} \).
   - The result is computed using the precomputed DP values.

5. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The DP initialization and recurrence relation seem correct for counting configurations.
   - The use of modulo \( 1000000007 \) ensures the result fits within standard integer limits.
   - The logic to compute the number of valid positions and use the DP table is sound.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem. It uses dynamic programming to count the number of valid configurations and handles the constraints appropriately.
