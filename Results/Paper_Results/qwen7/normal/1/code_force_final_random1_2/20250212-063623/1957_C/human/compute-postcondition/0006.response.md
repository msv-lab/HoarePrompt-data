Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i`, `n`, and `k`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 3 to `n + 1`. This means `i` starts from 3 and increments by 1 until it reaches `n + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `dp[1]` is 1
   - `dp[2]` is 3
   - `dp[3] is 5`
   - `dp[5]` is 23
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (not relevant for this adjustment)
   - `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n (not directly relevant for this adjustment)
   - `i` is 5

4. **Determine the next value of `i`**: Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time, and `i` was 5 at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` will be 6.

5. **Adjust the state**: We only need to adjust the state of `i` to reflect the next value of `i` in the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 5, `dp[5]` is 23, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n, `i` is 6**
