Output State: `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 5, `dp[4]` is 11, `dp[5]` is 23, `dp[6]` is 35, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n, `i` is greater than or equal to `n` + 1.

This output state describes the final values of the `dp` array after the loop has executed all its iterations. The loop starts from `i = 3` and continues until `i` exceeds `n`. For each iteration, the value of `dp[i]` is calculated using the formula `(dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`, and then `i` is incremented. Once `i` surpasses `n`, the loop terminates, and the `dp` array will contain the computed values up to `dp[n]`.
