Output State: **`dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3] is 5, `dp[5]` is 23, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n, `i` is 5**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `dp[5]` using the formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`. Given the initial values of `dp[1]`, `dp[2]`, and `dp[3]`, we calculate `dp[5]` as follows:

- First, we know `dp[4]` would be calculated as `(dp[3] + 2 * 3 * dp[2]) % 1000000007`, but since `dp[4]` is not needed for the final calculation of `dp[5]`, we can skip it.
- For `dp[5]`: 
  \[
  dp[5] = (dp[4] + 2 * 4 * dp[3]) \% 1000000007
  \]
  Since `dp[4]` is not explicitly given, we can infer it from the pattern or directly calculate it using the previous values:
  \[
  dp[4] = (dp[3] + 2 * 3 * dp[2]) \% 1000000007 = (5 + 2 * 3 * 3) \% 1000000007 = (5 + 18) \% 1000000007 = 23 \% 1000000007 = 23
  \]
  Now, substituting `dp[4]` and `dp[3]` into the formula for `dp[5]`:
  \[
  dp[5] = (23 + 2 * 4 * 5) \% 1000000007 = (23 + 40) \% 1000000007 = 63 \% 1000000007 = 63
  \]

However, the problem only asks to update `dp[5]` and keep the other variables unchanged. Thus, the updated value of `dp[5]` is 23, and all other variables remain as they were initially.
