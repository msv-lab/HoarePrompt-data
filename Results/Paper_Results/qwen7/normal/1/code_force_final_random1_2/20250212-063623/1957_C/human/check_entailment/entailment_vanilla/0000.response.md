Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the number of different final configurations of an \( n \times n \) chessboard after \( k \) moves, where each move places a rook and the opponent mirrors the move.
   - The configurations are considered different if there is any cell with a rook in one configuration but not in the other, or if the colors differ.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - Each move invalidates positions in rows and columns.
   - The number of valid positions decreases as more rooks are placed.
   - The problem reduces to finding the number of ways to place rooks in the remaining valid positions.

3. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - The function `func_1` initializes a DP array to store the number of ways to place rooks in a smaller board.
   - The recurrence relation used is \( dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + 2 \cdot (i-1) \cdot dp[i-2]) \mod 1000000007 \).

4. **Implementation Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( k \), and tracks the invalid positions using a set.
   - The number of valid positions is \( n - \text{len(invalid)} \).
   - The result is computed using the precomputed DP values.

5. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The DP initialization and recurrence relation seem correct for counting configurations.
   - The use of modulo \( 1000000007 \) ensures the result fits within standard integer limits.
   - The logic to compute the number of valid positions and use the DP table is sound.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem. It uses dynamic programming to count the number of valid configurations and handles the constraints appropriately.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
