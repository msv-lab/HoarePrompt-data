Output State: The `resultats` list will contain the results of all the valid cases processed by the loop. For each valid case, the value appended to `resultats` will be `egalites // 2`, where `egalites` is calculated as `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`. If any case does not meet the conditions specified in the loop (i.e., `total_points` is odd, `total_matchs` is greater than 3, or `p3` is greater than `total_matchs`), then `-1` will be appended to `resultats` instead.

In summary, `resultats` will be a list of all valid `egalites // 2` values for each set of `[p1, p2, p3]` in `cas_de_test`, with `-1` appended wherever the conditions are not met.
