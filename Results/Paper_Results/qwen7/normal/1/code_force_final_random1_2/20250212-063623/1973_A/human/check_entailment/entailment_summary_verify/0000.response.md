Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary step-by-step to determine the correctness of the original assessment.

### Analysis of the Program

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - Takes two parameters: `t` (number of test cases) and `cas_de_test` (a list of test cases).
   - Initializes an empty list `resultats` to store the results.
   - Iterates over each test case `(p1, p2, p3)` in `cas_de_test`.
   - Checks if the total points (`total_points = p1 + p2 + p3`) are even. If not, appends `-1` to `resultats` and continues.
   - Calculates the total number of matches (`total_matchs = total_points // 2`).
   - Checks if `total_matchs` is greater than 3 or if `p3 > total_matchs`. If either condition is true, appends `-1` to `resultats` and continues.
   - Calculates the number of draws (`egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`).
   - Checks if `egalites` is less than 0. If true, appends `-1` to `resultats`.
   - Otherwise, appends `egalites // 2` to `resultats`.

2. **Test Cases**:
   - The test cases are hardcoded in the main part of the program.
   - The program runs `func_1` with these test cases and prints the results.

### Checking the Logic

Let's manually verify the logic for each test case:

- **Case (0, 0, 0)**:
  - Total points: \(0 + 0 + 0 = 0\)
  - Total matches: \(0 // 2 = 0\)
  - No draws needed.
  - Result: `0`

- **Case (0, 1, 1)**:
  - Total points: \(0 + 1 + 1 = 2\)
  - Total matches: \(2 // 2 = 1\)
  - One draw.
  - Result: `1`

- **Case (0, 2, 3)**:
  - Total points: \(0 + 2 + 3 = 5\)
  - Total matches: \(5 // 2 = 2\)
  - Not possible since `p3 = 3` and `p2 = 2` implies more than 2 matches.
  - Result: `-1`

- **Case (1, 1, 2)**:
  - Total points: \(1 + 1 + 2 = 4\)
  - Total matches: \(4 // 2 = 2\)
  - Difference in points: \(2 - 1 = 1\)
  - Wins/losses: \(2 \times 1 = 2\)
  - Remaining points: \(4 - 2 \times 1 = 2\)
  - Draws: \(2 // 2 = 1\)
  - Result: `1`

- **Case (3, 3, 3)**:
  - Total points: \(3 + 3 + 3 = 9\)
  - Total matches: \(9 // 2 = 4.5\) (not an integer, hence invalid)
  - Result: `-1`

- **Case (3, 4, 5)**:
  - Total points: \(3 + 4 + 5 = 12\)
  - Total matches: \(12 // 2 = 6\)
  - Difference in points: \(5 - 4 = 1\), \(5 - 3 = 2\)
  - Wins/losses: \(2 \times 1 + 2 \times 2 = 6\)
  - Remaining points: \(12 - 6 = 6\)
  - Draws: \(6 // 2 = 3\)
  - Result: `3`

- **Case (1, 1, 10)**:
  - Total points: \(1 + 1 + 10 = 12\)
  - Total matches: \(12 // 2 = 6\)
  - Difference in points: \(10 - 1 = 9\)
  - Not possible since more than 6 matches.
  - Result: `-1`

### Conclusion

The program correctly handles all the test cases according to the problem statement and the function summary. The original assessment incorrectly stated that the program was incorrect because it did not handle the case (1, 1, 2) correctly. However, upon manual verification, the program correctly calculates the number of draws for the case (1, 1, 2) as 1.

Final: **False**
