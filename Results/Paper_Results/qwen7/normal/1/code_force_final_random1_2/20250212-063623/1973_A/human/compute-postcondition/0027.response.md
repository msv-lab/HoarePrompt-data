The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since no loop was specified in the initial state or the code snippet, the behavior of `continue` is undefined in this context. Given that no variables are modified and no new conditions are introduced by `continue`, the output state remains unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`, `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`, `egalites` is either `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)` with `resultats` containing three `-1`, or `egalites` is `3 * (p1 + p2 - p3)` with `resultats` being a list containing `3 * (p1 + p2 - p3) // 2` and two `-1`.**
