Output State: The `resultats` list will contain the results of applying the formula `egalites // 2` for each valid set of scores `[p1, p2, p3]` in `cas_de_test`, provided that the conditions `total_points % 2 == 0`, `total_matchs <= 3`, and `p3 <= total_matchs` are met for each set. If any of these conditions fail for a given set, `-1` will be appended to `resultats` instead. If all sets of scores are valid, `resultats` will be a list of non-negative integers; otherwise, it may contain `-1`.

The `total_points`, `total_matchs`, and `egalites` variables will reflect the calculations performed for the last set of scores processed in the loop, but their exact values are not specified without knowing the specific input data.
