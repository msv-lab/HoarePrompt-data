Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly initializes the number of test cases and the test cases themselves.
2. The function `func_1` iterates over each test case and checks the conditions as described in the problem statement.
3. The logic for determining the maximum number of draws is correct:
   - It first checks if the total points are even, which is necessary because each match contributes an even number of points.
   - It then calculates the total number of matches played.
   - It ensures that the number of matches is feasible (not more than 3) and that the highest score is within the bounds of possible matches.
   - It calculates the number of draws using the formula `egalites // 2`.
4. The function handles invalid cases by appending `-1` to the result list when the conditions are not met.
5. The provided examples in the annotated program match the expected outputs based on the logic implemented in the function.

Given the above reasoning, the function correctly implements the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
