Output State: **`cas_de_test` must not be an empty list; `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`, and the current value of `total_points` is odd; `resultats` contains -1.**

The code appends `-1` to the `resultats` list. Since `cas_de_test` must not be an empty list and the current value of `total_points` is odd, these conditions remain unchanged. The only new information is that `resultats` now contains the value `-1`.
