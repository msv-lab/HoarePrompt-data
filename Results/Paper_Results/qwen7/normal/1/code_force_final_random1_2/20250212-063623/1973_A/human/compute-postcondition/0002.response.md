Output State: **`cas_de_test` must not be an empty list; `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`**

Explanation: The code `total_points = p1 + p2 + p3` calculates the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` and assigns it to `total_points`. The precondition that `cas_de_test` must not be an empty list remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `total_points` and retains the initial condition about `cas_de_test`.
