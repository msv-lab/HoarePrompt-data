Output State: **`total_points` is the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`; `egalites` is `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`, `total_matchs` is now `total_points // 2`; `resultats` is a list containing `-1 // 2`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `egalites // 2` to the list `resultats`. Since `egalites` is calculated based on the initial conditions, it remains unchanged. However, when appending to the list, the value `-1 // 2` is computed, which equals `-1` because integer division of `-1` by `2` results in `-1`. The states of the other variables (`total_points`, `egalites`, and `total_matchs`) remain the same as they were before the code execution.
