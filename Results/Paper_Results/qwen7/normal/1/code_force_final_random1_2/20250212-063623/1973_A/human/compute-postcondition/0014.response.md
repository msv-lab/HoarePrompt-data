Output State: **`total_matchs` is `total_points` // 2, `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`, `egalites` is `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`**.

Explanation: The code calculates the value of `egalites` using the formula `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`. The values of `total_matchs` and `total_points` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `total_matchs` is still `total_points` // 2, `total_points` is still `p1 + p2 + p3`, and `egalites` is calculated based on the given formula.
