Output State: **`total_points` is the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`; `egalites` is `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`, `total_matchs` is now `total_points // 2`; if `total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs`, `resultats` is a list containing `-1`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `total_matchs` to be half of `total_points`. It also calculates the value of `egalites` based on the given formula. The condition for `resultats` is checked after these calculations, but since the exact values of `total_points` and `p3` are not specified, we cannot determine if `resultats` is set to `[-1]` or not. Therefore, we keep the condition as part of the output state.
