The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since there is no loop context provided, the variables `total_matchs`, `total_points`, `egalites`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and `resultats` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`, `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`, `egalites` is either `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)` with `resultats` containing `-1` and a new `-1`, or `egalites` is `3 * (p1 + p2 - p3)` with `resultats` being a list containing `3 * (p1 + p2 - p3) // 2` and `-1`.**
