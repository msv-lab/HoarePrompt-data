Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the maximum number of draws. Specifically, the calculation of `total_matchs` and the subsequent checks are not sufficient to determine the maximum number of draws accurately. The program should be revised to properly calculate the maximum number of draws based on the given constraints and conditions. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(t, cas_de_test):
    resultats = []
    for (p1, p2, p3) in cas_de_test:
        # Check if the total points are even
        if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        
        # Calculate the maximum possible number of matches
        max_matches = (p1 + p2 + p3) // 2
        
        # Check if the scores are consistent with the maximum number of matches
        if p3 > max_matches or p1 + p2 + p3 > 3 * max_matches:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        
        # Calculate the number of draws
        # Let d be the number of draws, w be the number of wins for the third player
        # We know that p3 = d + w, p2 = d + (w - x), p1 = d + (w - y)
        # where x and y are the number of wins for the second and first player respectively
        # We need to maximize d
        d = min(p3 - p2, p2 - p1)
        
        # Check if the remaining points can be distributed among wins
        remaining_points = (p1 + p2 + p3) - 3 * d
        if remaining_points % 2 == 1 or remaining_points < 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
        else:
            resultats.append(d)
    
    return resultats
```

This corrected function properly calculates the maximum number of draws based on the given constraints and ensures that the scores are consistent with the number of games played.
