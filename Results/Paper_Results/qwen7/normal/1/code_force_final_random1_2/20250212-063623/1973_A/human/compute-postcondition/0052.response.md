Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t`, a positive integer between 1 and 500, and `cas_de_test`, a list of lists where each inner list contains three integers [p1, p2, p3] sorted non-decreasingly. For each inner list, the function calculates and returns a list `resultats` containing half the number of equalities (`egalites // 2`) for each set of [p1, p2, p3], appending -1 wherever the conditions are not met.**
