Output State: **`cas_de_test` must not be an empty list; `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`, and the current value of `total_points` is odd; `resultats` contains -1; we continue the loop.**

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to the variables and the loop continues, the values of the variables remain the same as they were before the statement was executed.
