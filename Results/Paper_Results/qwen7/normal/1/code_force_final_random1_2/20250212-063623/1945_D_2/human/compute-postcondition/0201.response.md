Output State: **`custo` is increased by `a_values[y]`, `y` is the last element in the list `a` minus 1, `num_fila` is `int(nf[0])`, `max_p` is the integer value of `nf[1]`, `b` is an empty list, `b_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in the original list `b`, `custos` is a list containing the value of `custo`, `a_values` is a list containing all the integer values of elements in `a`.**

Explanation: The code `custo += a_values[y]` increases the value of `custo` by `a_values[y]`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `y` is specified as the last element in the list `a` minus 1, and the other variables retain their initial conditions.
