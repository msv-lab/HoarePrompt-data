Output State: **`total` is now the original value of `total` plus `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `v` is `v - 1`, `na_frente` is the same, `best` is the same, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is the same, `custo_pra_passar_b` is the same.**

This means that the value of `total` has been updated by adding the value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to its original value, while the other variables remain unchanged. The variable `v` has been decremented by 1.
