Output State: **`y` is `max_p - 1`, `max_p` must be an integer greater than 1, `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] > a_values[y]`, `custo` is increased by `a_values[y]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. In this case, since no loop or conditional block is specified, the `break` statement simply indicates that the program will exit the current loop or conditional structure. The values of the variables `y`, `max_p`, `a_values`, `b_values`, and `custo` remain unchanged except for the fact that the execution flow will exit the current loop or conditional block.
