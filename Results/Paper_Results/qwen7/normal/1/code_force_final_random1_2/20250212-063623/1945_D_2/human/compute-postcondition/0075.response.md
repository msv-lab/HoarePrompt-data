Output State: **`total` is 0, `v` is 0, `c` is one more than the previous value of `c`, `pos_final` is one less than the original input integer, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers created from user input, `best` is 10000000000.**

Explanation: The line `best = 10 ** 12` sets the variable `best` to the value 10000000000 (which is 10 raised to the power of 12). None of the other variables (`total`, `v`, `c`, `pos_final`, `custo_pra_passar_b`) are affected by this line of code. Therefore, their states remain unchanged except for `best`, which is now set to 10000000000.
