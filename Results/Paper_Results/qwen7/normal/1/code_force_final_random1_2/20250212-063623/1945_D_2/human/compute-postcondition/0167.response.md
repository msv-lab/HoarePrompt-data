Output State: **`total` is now `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, `na_frente` is a non-negative integer, `n` is `na_frente + 1`, `v` is `v - 1` and `v` must be greater than `-1`**.

Explanation: The variable `total` is updated by adding `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` to its current value. The other variables (`na_frente`, `n`, and `v`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
