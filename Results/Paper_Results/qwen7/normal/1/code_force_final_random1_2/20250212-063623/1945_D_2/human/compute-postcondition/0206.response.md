Output State: **`custo` is increased by `a_values[y]`, `y` is the last element in the list `a` minus 2, `num_fila` is `int(nf[0])`, `max_p` is the integer value of `nf[1]`, `b` is an empty list, `b_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in the original list `b`, and `a_values` is a list containing all the integer values of elements in `a`.**

Explanation: The code `custo += a_values[y]` increases the value of `custo` by the value of `a_values[y]`. Here, `y` is defined as the last element in the list `a` minus 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
