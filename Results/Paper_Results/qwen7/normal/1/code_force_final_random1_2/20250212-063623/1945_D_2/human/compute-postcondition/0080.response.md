Postcondition: `total`, `v`, and `na_frente` retain their initial values where `total` is 0, `v` is 0, and `na_frente` is greater than or equal to 0. If `best` is greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, then `best` remains unchanged. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of `total`, `v`, and `na_frente`.
