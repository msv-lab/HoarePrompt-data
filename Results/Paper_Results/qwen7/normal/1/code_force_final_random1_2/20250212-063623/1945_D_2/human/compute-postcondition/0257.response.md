Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case involves an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), followed by n and m (1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000), and two lists of positive integers a and b (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9 for all i from 1 to n). For each test case, it calculates a cost based on specific conditions involving elements from lists a and b. The function then prints the calculated cost for each test case.**
