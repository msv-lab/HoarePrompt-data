Output State: **`total` is now `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `na_frente` is a non-negative integer, `n` is `na_frente + 1`, `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, and `best` remains unchanged or is `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]` if the condition `best >= total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]` is true.**

Explanation: The line `total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]` increments the value of `total` by `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. All other variables (`na_frente`, `n`, `v`, and `best`) remain unchanged from their initial states unless the condition `best >= total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]` is true, in which case `best` would be updated to `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. However, since no such condition is explicitly mentioned to trigger a change in `best`, `best` remains unchanged.
