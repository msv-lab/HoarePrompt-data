Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `y` will be 0, `max_p` will remain as the integer value of `nf[1]`, `num_fila` will remain as `int(nf[0])`, `b` will remain an empty list, `b_values` will be a list containing the integer values of all elements in the original list `b`, `custos` will be a list containing the value of `custo` for each iteration, and `custo` will be the final sum calculated by adding either `a_values[y]` or `b_values[y]` for each iteration based on the condition `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]`. If `y` equals 1, `custo` is further increased by `a_values[0]` and the most internal loop or if statement is exited; `custos.append(custo)` appends the final value of `custo` to the list `custos`.**

In simpler terms, after executing the line `custos.append(custo)`, the list `custos` now includes the final value of `custo`, which is the sum calculated based on the conditions described. All other variables retain their previous states.
