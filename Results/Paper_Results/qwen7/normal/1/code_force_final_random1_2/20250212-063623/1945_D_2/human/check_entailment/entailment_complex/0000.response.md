Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`cases`) and processes each test case individually. It correctly extracts `na_frente` (number of people in front of Kirill) and `pos_final` (maximum allowable final position for Kirill).

2. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The program initializes `total` to 0 and `best` to a large value (10^12).
   - It iterates backward from `na_frente` to 0, calculating the cumulative cost based on whether it's cheaper to swap positions with the current person or to pass through them.
   - The logic for updating `total` and `best` is correctly implemented according to the problem statement.

3. **Boundary Conditions**:
   - When `v` is within the range `[0, pos_final]`, the program correctly updates `best` and `total` to reflect the minimum cost.
   - When `v` is outside this range, the program correctly adds the appropriate cost to `total`.

4. **Output**:
   - After processing all necessary positions, the program prints the minimum cost (`best`) for each test case.

Given the annotations and the implementation details, the program appears to correctly follow the logic described in the problem statement. There are no apparent logical errors or missing steps.

Correctness: **True**
