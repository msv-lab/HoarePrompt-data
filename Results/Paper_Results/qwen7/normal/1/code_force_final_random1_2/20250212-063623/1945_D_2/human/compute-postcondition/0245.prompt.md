Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `y` will be equal to `max_p - num_fila`, `num_fila` remains as `int(nf[0])`, `max_p` remains as the integer value of `nf[1]`, `b` remains an empty list, `b_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in the original list `b`, `custos` is a list containing the value of `custo`, `custo` is the sum of either `a_values[y]` or `b_values[y]` for each iteration based on the condition `a_values[y] < b_values[y]`, and `a_values` is a list containing all the integer values of elements in `a`.
Code of the loop:
for y in range(max_p - 1, 0, -1):
    if a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]:
        custo += b_values[y]
        if y == 1:
            custo += a_values[0]
            break
    else:
        custo += a_values[y]
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `y` is `max_p - 1`, `max_p` must be an integer greater than 1, `custo` is increased by either `b_values[y]` if `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]` and optionally by `a_values[0]` if `y` equals 1, or by `a_values[y]` if `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] > a_values[y]`. The most internal loop or if statement is exited in the else case.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `y` is `max_p - 2`, `max_p` must be an integer greater than 1, and `custo` is increased by either `a_values[0] + b_values[max_p - 2]` if `y == 1`, or by `b_values[max_p - 2]` if `y != 1` and `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]`. If `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] > a_values[y]`, then `custo` is increased by `a_values[y]`, and `a_values[0]` is considered if `y` equals 1. In both cases, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `custo` is increased by either `b_values[y]` or `a_values[y]`. If `y` is equal to 1, `custo` is further increased by `a_values[0]` and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
