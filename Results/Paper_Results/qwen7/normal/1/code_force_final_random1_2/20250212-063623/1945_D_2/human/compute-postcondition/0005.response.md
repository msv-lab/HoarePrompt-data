Output State: **`cases` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ `cases` ≤ 10^4, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is one less than the original value of `na_frente`, `pos_final` is an integer from the input, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `na_frente -= 1` decrements the value of `na_frente` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
