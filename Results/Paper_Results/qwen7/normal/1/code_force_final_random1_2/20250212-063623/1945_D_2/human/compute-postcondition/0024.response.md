Postcondition: `na_frente` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ na_frente ≤ 10^4, `v` is a value such that v is less than or equal to pos_final, `best` remains unchanged if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is not less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, otherwise `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, and `total` is increased by either `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` depending on the condition.
