Postcondition: **`y` must be initialized to a value such that `y >= max_p - 1`, `num_fila` is `int(nf[0])`, `max_p` is the integer value of `nf[1]`, `b` is an empty list, `y` is the last element in the list `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in the original list `b`, `custos` is a list containing the value of `custo`, `custo` is 0, `a_values` is a list containing all the integer values of elements in `a`, `num_fila` is an integer obtained from `int(nf[0])`, `max_p` is the integer value of `nf[1]`, and `a_values[y] >= b_values[y]`**
