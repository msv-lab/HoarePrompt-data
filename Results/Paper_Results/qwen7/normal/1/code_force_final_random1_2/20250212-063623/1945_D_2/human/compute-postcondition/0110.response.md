Postcondition: `total` is the same as the initial value. If `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. Otherwise, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. `v` is `v - 1`, `na_frente` remains the same, `best` remains the same, `custo_pra_trocar_a` remains the same, and `custo_pra_passar_b` remains the same.
