Output State: **`y` is initialized to a value such that `y >= max_p - 1`, `num_fila` is `int(nf[0])`, `max_p` is the integer value of `nf[1]`, `b` is an empty list, `y` is the last element in the list `a`, `b_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in the original list `b`, `custos` is a list containing the value of `custo`, `custo` is 0, `a_values` is a list containing all the integer values of elements in `a`, `custo` is increased by `a_values[y]`**.

Explanation: The code `custo += a_values[y]` increments the value of `custo` by the value of `a_values[y]`. Since `a_values[y]` is less than `b_values[y]` and `custo` was initially 0, `custo` now equals `a_values[y]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
