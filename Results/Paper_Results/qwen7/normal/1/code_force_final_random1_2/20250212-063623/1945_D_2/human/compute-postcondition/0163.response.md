Output State: **`total` is now `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, `na_frente` is a non-negative integer, `n` is `na_frente + 1`, `v` is `v - 1`, and if `best` is greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, the value of `best` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` updates the value of `total` by adding `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` to its current value. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state and the given code snippet.
