Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `v` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `na_frente` to `-1` in reverse order, decrementing `v` by 1 each iteration.

3. **Determine the New Value of `v`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `v` was decremented by 1. Therefore, for the next iteration, `v` should be `v - 1`.

4. **Determine the New Value of `n`**: The value of `n` is defined as `na_frente + 1`. Since `na_frente` does not change within the loop, `n` remains the same.

5. **Consider the Postconditions**: The postconditions state that `total` can either be `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, and `best` remains unchanged if it is greater than the respective total value. However, since these values are determined within the loop body, they do not directly affect the loop head variables.

6. **Adjust the States**: The only variables that need to be adjusted for the next iteration of the loop are `v` and `n`.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`total` is either `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `na_frente` is a non-negative integer, `n` is `na_frente + 1`, `v` is `v - 1`, and `best` is unchanged if it is greater than the respective total value after considering whether to `trocar_a[v]` or `passar_b[v]`**. 

Since `n` remains the same and `v` is decremented by 1, the updated state is:

**State: **`total` is either `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `na_frente` is a non-negative integer, `n` is `na_frente + 1`, `v` is `v - 1`, and `best` is unchanged if it is greater than the respective total value after considering whether to `trocar_a[v]` or `passar_b[v]`**.
