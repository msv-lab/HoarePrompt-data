Output State: **`custo' is increased by `a_values[y]' and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The code `break` is executed, which means we exit the innermost loop or conditional block without changing the value of `custo`. The value of `custo` remains as it was increased by `a_values[y]` before the `break` statement.
