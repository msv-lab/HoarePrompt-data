Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `y` will be equal to `max_p - num_fila`, `num_fila` remains as `int(nf[0])`, `max_p` remains as the integer value of `nf[1]`, `b` remains an empty list, `b_values` is a list containing the integer values of all elements in the original list `b`, `custos` is a list containing the value of `custo`, `custo` is the sum of either `a_values[y]` or `b_values[y]` for each iteration based on the condition `a_values[y] < b_values[y]`, and `a_values` is a list containing all the integer values of elements in `a`.**

This means that after the loop completes, `y` will have been decremented until it reaches `max_p - num_fila`. The variable `custo` will hold the cumulative sum determined by the loop's condition over all iterations. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or intermediate states as described.
