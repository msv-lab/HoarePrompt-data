Output State: **The loop will iterate over all elements in the list `custos`. The variable `c` will take on the value of each element in `custos` in sequence.**

Natural Language Explanation: 
After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `c` will have taken on the value of each element in the list `custos` exactly once, in the order they appear in the list. The loop does not modify any variables outside of its scope (i.e., `y`, `max_p`, `num_fila`, `b`, `b_values`, `custo`, `a_values`), so these variables will retain their final values from the last iteration or their initial values as given in the precondition. The list `custos` will contain the final values of `custo` calculated for each iteration of the loop.
