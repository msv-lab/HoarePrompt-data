Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly initializes the necessary variables and reads the input as described in the problem statement.
2. The logic inside the loop iterates through the positions from `na_frente` (number of people in front of Kirill) to 0, calculating the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position within the allowed range (`pos_final`).
3. The variable `best` keeps track of the minimum cost found so far, and `total` accumulates the cost as it iterates through the positions.
4. The conditions inside the loop ensure that the cost of moving Kirill to a new position is calculated correctly, considering whether it's cheaper to swap with the current person or to pass through them.
5. The program prints the minimum cost for each test case as required by the problem statement.

Given the above analysis, the annotated program appears to follow the logic and constraints of the problem accurately.

Correctness: **True**
