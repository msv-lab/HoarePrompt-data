Output State: **`y` is `max_p - 2`, `custo` is increased by `a_values[0] + b_values[max_p - 2]`**.

Explanation: The value of `y` remains `max_p - 2`. The value of `custo` is increased by `a_values[0]` and also by `b_values[y]`, which is `b_values[max_p - 2]`. Therefore, `custo` is now `custo + a_values[0] + b_values[max_p - 2]`.
