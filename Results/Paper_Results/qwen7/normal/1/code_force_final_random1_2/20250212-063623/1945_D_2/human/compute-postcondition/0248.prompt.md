Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `custos` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; x is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(x):
    custo = 0
    num_fila = 0
    max_p = 0
    a_values = []
    b_values = []
    nf = input().split()
    num_fila = int(nf[0])
    max_p = int(nf[1])
    a = input().split()
    b = input().split()
    for y in a:
        a_values.append(int(y))
    for y in b:
        b_values.append(int(y))
    for y in range(num_fila - 1, max_p - 1, -1):
        if a_values[y] < b_values[y]:
            custo += a_values[y]
        else:
            custo += b_values[y]
    for y in range(max_p - 1, 0, -1):
        if a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]:
            custo += b_values[y]
            if y == 1:
                custo += a_values[0]
                break
        else:
            custo += a_values[y]
            break
    custos.append(custo)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The loop terminates when y reaches 0; `custos` is a list containing the final value of `custo` calculated based on the given conditions for each iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `b` remains an empty list, `y` is 0, `custos` is a list containing the value of `custo`, and `custo` is the sum of the maximum values between `a_values[y]` and `b_values[y]` for each `y` from `num_fila - 1` down to `0`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After the loop executes all iterations, `y` will be 0, `max_p` will remain as the integer value of `nf[1]`, `num_fila` will remain as `int(nf[0])`, `b` will remain an empty list, `b_values` will be a list containing the integer values of all elements in the original list `b`, `custos` will be a list containing the value of `custo` for each iteration, and `custo` will be the final sum calculated by adding either `a_values[y]` or `b_values[y]` for each iteration based on the condition `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]`. If `y` equals 1, `custo` is further increased by `a_values[0]` and the most internal loop or if statement is exited; `custos.append(custo)` appends the final value of `custo` to the list `custos`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
