Output State: **`c` is equal to `cases`, `na_frente` is an integer input from the user, `pos_final` is an integer input from the user.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the user input and assigns them to the variables `na_frente` and `pos_final` respectively. The variable `c` remains unchanged and is still equal to `cases`.
