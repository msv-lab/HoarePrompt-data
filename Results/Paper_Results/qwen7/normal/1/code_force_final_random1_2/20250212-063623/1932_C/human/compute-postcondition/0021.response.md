Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, `b` is a list with an appended element from `a[l]`, `l` is increased by 1**.

Explanation: The variable `l` is incremented by 1. The values of `i`, `n`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `i` is still 2, `n` is still a positive integer, and `b` is still a list with an appended element from `a[l]`, where `l` has now been increased by 1.
