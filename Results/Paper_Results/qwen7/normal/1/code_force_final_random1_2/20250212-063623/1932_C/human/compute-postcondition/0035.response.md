Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for v in reversed(b)`. The variables involved in this loop are `v` and `b`.

2. **Understand the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `b` is a list of length `n`.
   - `v` is the second-to-last element of `b`.
   - `p` is `p * v % m`.
   - `ans` is a list with two elements where the first element is `p` and the second element is also `p`.

3. **Determine the Next Value of `v`**: Since the loop iterates over the list `b` in reverse order, the next value of `v` will be the last element of the list `b`.

4. **Adjust the State**:
   - `v` will now be the last element of `b`.
   - `b` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `p` will be updated based on the new value of `v` (i.e., `p = p * v % m`).
   - `ans` will remain unchanged since it does not depend on the current value of `v` in the loop.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `b` is a list of length `n`.
- `v` is the last element of `b`.
- `p` is `p * v % m`.
- `ans` is a list with two elements where the first element is `p` and the second element is also `p`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `b` is a list of length `n`, `v` is the last element of `b`, `p` is `p * v % m`, `ans` is a list with two elements where the first element is `p` and the second element is also `p`.**
