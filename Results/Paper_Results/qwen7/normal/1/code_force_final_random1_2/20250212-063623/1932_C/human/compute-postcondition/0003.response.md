Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the value `n` used in the `range()` function.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The loop will start with `i` being 0 and will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.
   - Therefore, the initial value of `i` should be 0, and `n` should be a positive integer (which is already given).

3. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0, we need to set `i` to 0.
   - The value of `n` is already stated to be a positive integer, so no adjustment is needed for `n`.

4. **Final State**:
   - `i` should be 0.
   - `n` is a positive integer (no specific value needed to be adjusted since it is already stated as a positive integer).

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer**
