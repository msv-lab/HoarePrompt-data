Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `m` (a positive integer), `a` (a list of `n` positive integers), and `s` (a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'). It constructs a new list `b` based on the values in `a` and the directions specified in `s`. Then, it calculates the product of all elements in `b` modulo `m`, storing this value in `p`. Finally, it creates a list `ans` where each element is the final value of `p`, and returns this list in reversed order.**
