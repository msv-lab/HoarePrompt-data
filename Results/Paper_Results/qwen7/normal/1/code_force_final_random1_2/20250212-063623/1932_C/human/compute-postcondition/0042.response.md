Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `m` (a positive integer), `a` (a list of `n` positive integers), and `s` (a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'). It returns a list where each element is the final value of `p` (which is the product of all elements in `b` modulo `m`), and the list is reversed.**

This means the function processes a list of integers and a specific sequence of 'L' and 'R' characters to compute a series of products modulo `m`, then reverses the order of these computed values before returning them.
