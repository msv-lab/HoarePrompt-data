Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `b` is a list with one element `a[l]` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code snippet `b.append(a[l])` appends the element `a[l]` to the list `b`. However, since `a` and `l` are not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine their specific values. The only changes are that `b` now contains the element `a[l]` appended to it. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
