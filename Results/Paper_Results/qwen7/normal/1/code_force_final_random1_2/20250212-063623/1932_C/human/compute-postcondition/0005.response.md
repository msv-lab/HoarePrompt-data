Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, the current value of `s[i]` is 'L', `b` is a list with one element which is `a[l]`.**

Explanation: The code `b.append(a[l])` appends the value of `a[l]` to the list `b`. However, the initial values of `a` and `l` are not provided, so we cannot specify the exact value added to `b`. But we know that `b` now contains `a[l]`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `s[i]` remain unchanged.
