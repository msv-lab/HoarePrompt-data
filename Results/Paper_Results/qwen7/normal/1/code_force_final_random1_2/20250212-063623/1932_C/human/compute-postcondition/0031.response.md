Output State: **`b` is a list of length `n`, `v` is the last element of `b`, `p` is `p * v % m`, `ans` is a list with one element `p`.**

Explanation: The line `ans.append(p)` appends the current value of `p` to the list `ans`. Since `ans` was initially empty, after appending `p`, `ans` now contains one element which is `p`. The values of `b`, `v`, and `p` remain unchanged from their initial states.
