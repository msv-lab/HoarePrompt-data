Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input and initializes variables.
2. The `func_1` function processes the commands and calculates the required remainders.
3. The logic for calculating the product of the array elements and taking the modulus is correct.
4. The function correctly handles the removal of elements from the array based on the commands 'L' and 'R'.
5. The function correctly appends the calculated remainders to the list `ans` in the reverse order of the commands.

However, there is a logical error in the implementation of the `func_1` function. Specifically, the function does not actually perform the required operations as described in the problem statement. Instead of calculating the product of the array elements and taking the modulus at each step, the function simply appends the elements of the array to the list `b` without any modification.

Here is the corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'L':
            b.append(a[l])
            l += 1
        else:
            b.append(a[r])
            r -= 1
        
    # State: Postcondition: `i` is `n-1`, `n` is a positive integer, `b` is a list of length `n`. For each index `j` in the range `[0, n-1]`, if `s[j]` is 'L', then `b[j]` is equal to `a[l + j]`, otherwise `b[j]` is equal to `a[r - j]`.

    ans = []
    p = 1
    for v in b:
        p = (p * v) % m
        ans.append(p)
    
    # State: Output State: `b` is a list of length `n`, `v` is the current element of `b`, `p` is the product of all elements in `b` up to the current element modulo `m`, `ans` is a list containing the remainders of the products.
    return ans
```

With this correction, the function now correctly calculates the product of the remaining elements in the array after each command and takes the modulus with `m`.

Correctness: **False**
