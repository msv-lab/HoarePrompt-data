Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 1, `a` and `b` are lists of characters and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `i`, `n`, `a`, and `b`. It only indicates that the execution will exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such block is specified in the given code snippet, the variables retain their initial states.
