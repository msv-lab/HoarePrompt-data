Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable involved here is `t`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, we need to ensure that `t` is a positive integer.

3. **Initial State of `t`**: According to the problem statement, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

4. **Adjusting the State**: To ensure the loop can execute, `t` must be greater than 0. Given the constraints, `t` will always be within the specified range, so we just need to ensure it is positive.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` must be greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
