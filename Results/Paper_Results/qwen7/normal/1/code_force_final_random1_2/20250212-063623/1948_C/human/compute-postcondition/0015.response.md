Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is an index such that `i + 2 < n` and either `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`. After the execution of the if-else block, if the condition `i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` is true, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is false, the postcondition remains unchanged.**
