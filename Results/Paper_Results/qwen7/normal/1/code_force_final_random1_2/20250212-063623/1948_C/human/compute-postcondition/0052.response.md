Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is greater than 1
   - `a` and `b` are lists of characters

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` in the range from 1 to `n` with a step of 2.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `i + 1 < n`.

3. **Loop Body Condition for Breaking:**
   - If `i + 1 < n` and either `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`, the loop breaks.

4. **Current State Analysis:**
   - Since `i` is currently 1, the condition `i + 1 < n` simplifies to `2 < n`.
   - Given that `n` is greater than 1, `2 < n` is true, so the loop will continue.

5. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - The variable `i` will be incremented by 2 (since the step size is 2).
   - Therefore, `i` will become 3.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `a` and `b` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.

6. **Final State for the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `i` is 3
   - `n` is still greater than 1
   - `a` and `b` remain the same

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 1, `a` and `b` are lists of characters**
