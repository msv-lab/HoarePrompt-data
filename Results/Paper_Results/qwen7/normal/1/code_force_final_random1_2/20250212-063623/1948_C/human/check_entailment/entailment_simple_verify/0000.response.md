### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotated code to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**:
   ```python
   for i in range(half_n - 1):
       if row1[2 * i + 1] == '<' and (row2[2 * i] == '<' or row2[2 * i + 2] == '<'):
           return 'No'
   ```
   This loop checks if the robot can be blocked from moving from the first row to the second row at certain positions. Specifically, it checks if the robot can move left in the first row and then encounter a left-pointing arrow in the second row.

2. **Final Check**:
   ```python
   if (row1[n - 1] == '<' and row2[n - 2] == '<'):
       return 'No'
   ```
   This check ensures that the robot cannot move from the last column of the first row to the second-to-last column of the second row.

3. **Return 'Yes'**:
   If the loop completes without returning 'No', the function returns 'Yes'.

#### Edge Case Handling:
The original assessment correctly points out that the function does not handle all cases where the robot can reach the bottom-right corner. Let's consider the edge case mentioned:
```plaintext
>>>>
>><
```
- The robot starts at (1, 1).
- Moves right to (1, 2).
- Moves down to (2, 2).
- Moves right to (2, 3).
- Moves down to (2, 4).

The function would incorrectly return 'No' because it checks the last column and second-to-last column conditions, which are not necessary for this path.

However, the function also has other issues:
- The loop only checks a subset of possible paths and does not account for all valid movements.
- The final check only considers the last two columns, which is insufficient.

#### Function `func_2` Analysis:
- The function reads the input and processes each test case using `func_1`.
- It collects the results and prints them.

### Correctness Evaluation:
- The function `func_1` does not handle all cases correctly. It fails to account for paths that do not involve the last two columns.
- The original assessment is accurate in identifying the logical flaw in the function.

### Final Evaluation:
Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly handle all cases where the robot can reach the bottom-right corner. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

**Final: False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle all valid paths correctly.
