Output State: The loop will execute fully based on the value of `n`. If `n` is even, the loop will run until it reaches `n-1`. If `n` is odd, it will run until `i` is equal to `n-1`.

If during any iteration of the loop (where `i` is in the range 1 to `n-1` with a step of 2), the condition `i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` is met, the loop will break and print 'No'. Otherwise, after all iterations, the loop will print 'Yes'.

In summary, if the specified condition is never met throughout the entire loop execution, the final output state will be: The loop completes all iterations and prints 'Yes'. If the condition is met at any point, the loop breaks early and prints 'No'.
