Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i`, `n`, and the range function parameters (which are derived from `n`).

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop `for i in range(1, n, 2)` will execute if `n` is at least 3 (since the range starts at 1 and increments by 2 each time). This is because the range function generates numbers starting from the first parameter up to but not including the second parameter.

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**: 
   - The variable `i` will take on odd values starting from 1 up to but not including `n`.
   - The variable `n` must be an integer and must be at least 3 for the loop to execute.
   - The initial value of `i` is 1, and it increments by 2 each time, so `n` must be such that there are at least 1 or more iterations of the loop.

4. **Adjust the given states**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0 (this is not directly related to the loop, so it remains unchanged).
   - `n` must be an integer and at least 3 for the loop to execute.
   - `a` and `b` are the values entered by the user as a string, and they do not affect the loop's execution.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` must be an integer and at least 3.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer and must be at least 3**
