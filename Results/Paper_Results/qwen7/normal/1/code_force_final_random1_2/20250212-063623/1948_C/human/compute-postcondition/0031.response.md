Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer and must be at least 3, `a` and `b` are lists of characters, and the current value of `i` is such that either `a[i]` and `b[i + 1]` are both equal to '<', or `a[i]` and `b[i - 1]` are both equal to '<', leading to a break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
