Let's analyze the given state and the loop step by step.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `i` is an index such that `i + 2 < n`.
- Either `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`.

### Loop Condition:
- The loop iterates over `i` in steps of 2 starting from 1 up to but not including `n`.

### Loop Execution:
- The loop body is omitted, but we know that after the execution of the if-else block, the loop breaks if the condition `i + 1 < n and (a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<')` is true. Otherwise, the postcondition remains unchanged.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial Conditions**:
   - `n > 1`
   - `i + 2 < n`
   - `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`

2. **Loop Iteration**:
   - The loop starts with `i = 1` and increments by 2 each time until `i + 2 >= n`.

3. **Condition for Breaking the Loop**:
   - If `i + 1 < n` and `(a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<')` is true, the loop breaks.

4. **Post-Condition**:
   - If the condition is not met, the postcondition remains the same.

### Determining the Next State:

- Since the loop increments `i` by 2 each time, the next value of `i` would be `i + 2`.
- We need to ensure that `i + 2 < n` holds true for the next iteration.
- The condition for breaking the loop must be checked with the new value of `i`.

Given that the loop increments `i` by 2, the next value of `i` will be `i + 2`. For the loop to continue, `i + 2` must still satisfy the condition `i + 2 < n`.

### New State:
- `n` must be greater than 1 (unchanged).
- `i` becomes `i + 2` (since the loop increments by 2).
- The condition `i + 2 < n` must hold true.
- The condition `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` must be checked with the new value of `i`.

### Final State:
State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is an index such that `i + 2 < n` and either `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` where `i` is incremented by 2 from the previous value.**

To be more precise:
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `i` is an index such that `i + 4 < n`.
- Either `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`.

Thus, the final state is:
State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is an index such that `i + 4 < n` and either `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`**.
