The loop head contains the variable `t`, which controls the number of iterations of the loop. Since the loop has already executed all its iterations without breaking, `t` must have been decremented to zero.

Given that the loop has completed all its iterations, `t` must now be 0. There are no other variables in the loop head that need adjustment.

State: **`t` is 0**
