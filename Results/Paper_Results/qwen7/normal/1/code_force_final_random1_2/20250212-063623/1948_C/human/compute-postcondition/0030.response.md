Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer and must be at least 3, `a` and `b` are lists of characters, and if `i + 1` is less than `n` and either `a[i]` and `b[i + 1]` are both equal to '<', or `a[i]` and `b[i - 1]` are both equal to '<', then the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If none of these conditions are met, the postcondition remains as initially described.
