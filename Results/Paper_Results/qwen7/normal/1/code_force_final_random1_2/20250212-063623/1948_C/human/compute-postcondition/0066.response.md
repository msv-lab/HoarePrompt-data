Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes two strings of length n, where n is an even integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5, consisting only of characters "<" and ">". The function then compares these strings and returns a result based on the comparison.**

Given the constraints, the function likely compares the two strings character by character and returns a result based on the comparison, but since the exact output is not specified, we can only describe the general functionality in terms of accepting and processing the input strings.
