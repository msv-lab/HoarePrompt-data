Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Logic in `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` checks if the robot can reach the last column `(2, n)` but does not fully account for the movement rules. Specifically, it only checks if certain arrows point left, which is insufficient.
   - The logic for checking if the robot can move from one cell to another is flawed because it does not correctly simulate the robot's movement based on the arrows.

2. **Incomplete Movement Simulation**:
   - The function does not properly simulate the robot's movement through the grid according to the given rules. It should check if the robot can follow the arrows to move from `(1, 1)` to `(2, n)` step-by-step.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled**:
   - The function does not handle edge cases where the robot might get stuck or unable to move to the target cell `(2, n)` due to the arrangement of arrows.

### Correct Solution:
To correctly solve this problem, you need to simulate the robot's movement step-by-step through the grid. Here’s a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func_1(n, row1, row2):
    """
    判断机器人是否能够从 (1,1) 到达 (2,n)。
    """
    position = (1, 1)
    while position[1] < n:
        x, y = position
        if row1[y-1] == '<':
            x = 1
        else:
            x = 2
        if row2[y-1] == '<':
            y -= 1
        else:
            y += 1
        position = (x, y)
    return 'Yes' if position == (2, n) else 'No'

def func_2():
    """
    读取输入并处理每个测试用例。
    """
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        row1 = input()
        row2 = input()
        results.append(func_1(n, row1, row2))
    print('\n'.join(results))

func_2()
```

This solution correctly simulates the robot's movement through the grid and checks if it can reach the target cell `(2, n)`.
