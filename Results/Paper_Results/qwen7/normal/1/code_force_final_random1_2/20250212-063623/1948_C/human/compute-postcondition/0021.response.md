Output State: The loop will continue to iterate as long as `i` (which starts from 1 and increments by 2 each time) is less than `n`. After all iterations, if the loop does not encounter any `break` statements (meaning none of the conditions `i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` were met for any `i`), it will print 'yes'. If any of these conditions are met at any point during the loop, the loop will break and print 'No'.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is: **If the loop completes without breaking (i.e., none of the specified conditions are met for any `i`), the output will be 'yes'. Otherwise, if any of the conditions `i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` are met, the output will be 'No'.**
