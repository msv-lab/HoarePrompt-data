Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer and must be at least 3, `a` and `b` are lists of characters, the current value of `i` is such that `i + 1` is less than `n` and either `a[i]` and `b[i + 1]` are both equal to '<', or `a[i]` and `b[i - 1]` are both equal to '<', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables but instead exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no variables are reassigned or altered by the `break` statement, all conditions and values from the initial state remain unchanged except for the fact that the loop or conditional block has been exited.
