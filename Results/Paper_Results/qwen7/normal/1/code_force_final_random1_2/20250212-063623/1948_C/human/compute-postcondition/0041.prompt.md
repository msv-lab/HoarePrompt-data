Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the value entered by the user as a string, `b` is the value input by the user.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n, 2):
    if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
        print('No')
        break
else:
    print('yes')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer and must be at least 3, `a` and `b` are lists of characters, and the current value of `i` is such that either `a[i]` and `b[i + 1]` are both equal to '<', or `a[i]` and `b[i - 1]` are both equal to '<', leading to a break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer and must be at least 3, `a` and `b` are lists of characters, and the current value of `i` is such that either `a[i + 2]` and `b[i + 3]` are both equal to '<', or `a[i + 2]` and `b[i + 1]` are both equal to '<', and the most internal loop or if statement has been broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer and must be at least 3, `i` is `i + 2`, and the condition for the next iteration should be checked to ensure it meets the requirement (either `a[i + 2]` and `b[i + 3]` are both equal to '<', or `a[i + 2]` and `b[i + 1]` are both equal to '<'), and either the loop breaks or the condition check continues.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
