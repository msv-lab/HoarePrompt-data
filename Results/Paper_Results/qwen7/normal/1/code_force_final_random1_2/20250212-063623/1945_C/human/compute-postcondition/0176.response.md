Output State: **`mini` is the minimum value between its current value and `abs(n/2 - elem)` for each `elem` in the original `lst`; `final` is sorted and contains all elements from `lst` that have `mini` as their minimum distance to `pk`; `c1` is `o * 100 // n`; `t` is `t - 1`; `n` is `n / 2`; `pk` is `n / 2`; `sl` is a list containing the characters of `s`; `o` is the count of '1' in the list `sl`; `z` is the count of '0' in the list `sl`; `zero` is 0; `one` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes two variables, `zero` and `one`, to 0. This does not affect the values of the other variables listed in the initial state. Therefore, the output state retains the values of `mini`, `final`, `c1`, `t`, `n`, `pk`, `sl`, `o`, and `z` as they were in the initial state, while adding the new variables `zero` and `one` with the value 0.
