Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `elem` which is being iterated over from the list `lst`.

2. **Determine the initial conditions at the start of the loop**:
   - `mini` is the minimum value between its current value and 10.
   - `ele` is 20.
   - `lst` is [5, 10, 15, 20].
   - `final` is [5].
   - `pk` is `mini` + `elem`.
   - `elem` is 5.

3. **Understand the loop condition and behavior**:
   - The loop iterates over each element in `lst`.
   - For each iteration, `elem` takes the next value from `lst`.
   - The loop body is omitted, but based on the postcondition, if `abs(pk - elem)` equals `mini`, then `mini` is updated to be the minimum value between its current value and 10, and other variables remain unchanged. Otherwise, no changes occur.

4. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since `elem` is 5 at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `elem` will be the next element in `lst`, which is 10.
   - `mini` remains unchanged unless the condition `abs(pk - elem) == mini` is met. Given the current values, `mini` is already the minimum value between its current value and 10, so it will remain the same.
   - `ele` remains 20.
   - `lst` remains [5, 10, 15, 20].
   - `final` remains [5].
   - `pk` will be recalculated as `mini` + 10 (the new value of `elem`).
   - `elem` becomes 10.

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - The only variables that change are `elem` and `pk`. `mini`, `ele`, `lst`, and `final` remain the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`mini` is the minimum value between its current value and 10; `ele` is 20; `lst` is [5, 10, 15, 20]; `final` is [5]; `pk` is `mini` + 10; `elem` is 10**
