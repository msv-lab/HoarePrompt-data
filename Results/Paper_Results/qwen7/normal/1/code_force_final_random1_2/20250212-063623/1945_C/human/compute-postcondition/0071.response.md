Output State: **`lst` must contain at least one less element than before, `mini` holds the minimum value among `abs(pk - elem)` for all `elem` in the original `lst`, `final` is now `[elem, elem]` where `elem` is the element that minimizes `abs(pk - elem)`, or `final` remains an empty list if no such `elem` exists.**

Explanation: The code snippet `final.append(elem)` appends the value of `elem` to the list `final`. According to the initial state, `final` is either `[elem]` or an empty list. After appending `elem`, `final` becomes `[elem, elem]` if it was previously `[elem]`, or it remains an empty list if no such `elem` existed before. The conditions for `mini` and `lst` remain unchanged.
