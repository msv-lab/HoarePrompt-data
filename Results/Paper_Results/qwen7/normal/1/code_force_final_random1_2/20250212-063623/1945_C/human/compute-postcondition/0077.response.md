Output State: **`lst` is empty, `mini` holds the minimum value among `abs(pk - elem)` for all `elem` in the original `lst`, and `final` contains all elements from `lst` that minimize `abs(pk - elem)` with respect to `pk`; `final` is sorted, `c1` is `o * 100 // n`.**

The code `c1 = o * 100 // n` calculates the integer division of `o * 100` by `n` and assigns the result to `c1`. Since the initial state does not provide specific values for `o` and `n`, `c1` is expressed as `o * 100 // n`. All other variables remain unchanged.
