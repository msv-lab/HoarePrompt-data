Output State: **`mini` is the minimum value between its current value and 10, `ele` is 20, `lst` is [5, 10, 15, 20], `final` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list `final`. None of the values of `mini`, `ele`, or `lst` are changed by this line of code. Therefore, they retain their initial states.
