Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for ele in lst:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `ele` and `lst`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in `lst` to iterate over.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `lst` must contain at least one element.
   - `ele` is the second element of `lst`.
   - `mini` is updated to the minimum value between the current `mini` and `abs(pk - ele)`.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `ele` is the second element of `lst`, the next element in `lst` (if it exists) will be the third element.
   - For the loop to continue, `lst` must still contain at least one element after removing the current `ele`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `lst` must now contain at least two elements (since `ele` is the second element, and the loop will remove one element).
   - `ele` will be the third element of the new `lst`.
   - `mini` will be updated based on the new `ele` and `pk`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`lst` must contain at least two elements, `ele` is the third element of `lst`, `mini` is updated to the minimum value between the current `mini` and `abs(pk - ele)`**
