Output State: **`lst` must contain at least one element, `mini` holds the minimum value among `abs(pk - elem)` for all `elem` in the original `lst`, `final` is now `[elem]` where `abs(pk - elem)` equals `mini`, or `final` remains an empty list if no such `elem` exists, and `elem` is appended to `final`.**

Explanation: The code `final.append(elem)` appends the value of `elem` to the list `final`. The conditions for `mini` and `final` remain unchanged unless `abs(pk - elem)` equals `mini`, in which case `final` would be set to `[elem]`. Since the initial state specifies that `final` is either `[elem]` where `abs(pk - elem)` equals `mini`, or an empty list if no such `elem` exists, appending `elem` to `final` means `final` is now `[elem]` if it wasn't already set to `[elem]` or was an empty list.
