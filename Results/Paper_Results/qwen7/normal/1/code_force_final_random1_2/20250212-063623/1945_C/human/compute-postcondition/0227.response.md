Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the `for elem in lst:` statement. The variables involved in the loop head are `elem` and `lst`.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `mini` is the minimum value between its current value and 10.
   - `ele` is 20.
   - `lst` is [5, 10, 15, 20].
   - `final` is [5, 10].
   - `pk` is `mini` + 10.
   - `elem` is 10.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**:
   - The loop iterates over each element in `lst`.
   - The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in `lst`.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `elem` was 10.
   - Since the loop is iterating over `lst`, the next value of `elem` will be the next element in the list `lst`, which is 15.
   - For the loop to execute again, `lst` must still contain elements.

Given these points, let's update the states accordingly:

- `mini` remains unchanged because it is not directly affected by the loop.
- `ele` remains 20 because it is not part of the loop.
- `lst` loses its first element (10), so it becomes [10, 15, 20].
- `final` remains [5, 10] because it is not affected by the loop.
- `pk` remains `mini` + 10 because it is not directly affected by the loop.
- `elem` changes to the next element in `lst`, which is 15.

So, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`mini` is the minimum value between its current value and 10; `ele` is 20; `lst` is [10, 15, 20]; `final` is [5, 10]; `pk` is `mini` + 10; `elem` is 15**
