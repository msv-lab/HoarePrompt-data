Output State: **`mini` is the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - elem)` for each `elem` in `lst` except the first element; `final` contains the first element of `lst`; `lst` contains at least one element.**

Explanation: The code snippet appends the first element of the list `lst` to the list `final`. This means that `final` now contains the first element of `lst`. The value of `mini` remains unchanged as no operations affecting `mini` are performed. The precondition that `lst` must have at least one element and the first element of `lst` is `elem` still holds true.
