Output State: **`zero` is either 1, 2, or 3, `zero_perc` is 100, `i` is 4, `one` is 1, `one_perc` is -400, `lst` contains the elements 2 and 4, `o` is 1, `one` is 1, `one_perc` is recalculated to -300**

Explanation: The code calculates `one_perc` using the formula `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`. However, since `o` is not defined in the initial state, we assume it refers to `one`, which is 1. Thus, `one_perc` is recalculated as `(1 - 1) * 100 // (4 - 4 - 1)`, which results in `-300` due to integer division and the subtraction resulting in zero. All other variables remain unchanged.
