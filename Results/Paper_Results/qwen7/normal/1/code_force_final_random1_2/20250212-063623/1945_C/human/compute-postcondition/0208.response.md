Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `n` is at least 2, `zero` is either 3 or 2 or 1 depending on whether `s[0]` is '0', `zero_perc` is now `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`, `one` and `o` remain undefined, `one_perc` is either greater than or equal to 50 or a specific value, and `lst` contains 2, 3.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block. Since the else part is not provided and there is no change in the variables outside the if part, the postcondition retains the initial conditions specified in the precondition.
