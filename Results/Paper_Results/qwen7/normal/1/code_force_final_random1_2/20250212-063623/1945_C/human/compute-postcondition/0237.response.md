Output State: **`mini` is 10, `ele` is 20, `lst` is [15, 20], `final` is [0], `pk` is 25, `elem` is 20, `c1` is undefined**

Explanation: The code `final.append(0)` appends the value `0` to the list `final`. Initially, `final` is an empty list. After appending `0`, `final` becomes `[0]`. The values of the other variables (`mini`, `ele`, `lst`, `pk`, `elem`, and `c1`) remain unchanged.
