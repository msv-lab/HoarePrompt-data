Postcondition: `mini` is the minimum value between its current value and 10; `ele` is 20; `lst` is [5, 10, 15, 20]; `final` is [5]; `pk` is `mini` + elem; `elem` is 5. If `abs(pk - elem) == mini`, then `mini` is the minimum value between its current value and 10, `ele` is 20, `lst` is [5, 10, 15, 20], `final` is [5], `pk` is `mini` + elem, and `elem` is 5. If the condition `abs(pk - elem) != mini` is true, then the values remain unchanged as per the if part.
