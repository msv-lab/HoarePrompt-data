Output State: **`zero` is increased by 1, `zero_perc` is calculated as `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`, `one_perc` is calculated as `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`, and both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50; `lst` is a list containing `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `i + 1` to the list `lst`. Since `lst` was not previously defined, it is now a list containing the single element `i + 1`. The values of `zero`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, `i`, `o`, `one`, and `n` remain unchanged from their previous states, except that `zero` is increased by 1.
