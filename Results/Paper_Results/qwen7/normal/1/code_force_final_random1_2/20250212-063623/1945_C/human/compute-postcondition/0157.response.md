Output State: **`mini` is the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - elem)` for each `elem` in the original `lst`; `final` is sorted and contains all elements from `lst` that have `mini` as their minimum distance to `pk`; `c1` is `o * 100 // n`.**

This means that the variable `c1` has been assigned the value of `o * 100 // n`, while the values of `mini`, `final`, `o`, `n`, `pk`, and `lst` remain unchanged from the initial state.
