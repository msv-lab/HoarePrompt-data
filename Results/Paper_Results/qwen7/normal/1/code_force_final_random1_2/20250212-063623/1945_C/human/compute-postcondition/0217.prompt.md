Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `i` is equal to `n - 2`, `n` is at least 2, `zero` is a value between 0 and `n - 1` inclusive, depending on the number of '0's in the string `s` up to index `i`, `zero_perc` is calculated as `zero * 100 // (i + 1)` and reflects the percentage of '0's among the characters from index 0 to `i`, `one` and `o` remain undefined since they are not updated within the loop, `one_perc` is either greater than or equal to 50 or a specific value based on the remaining characters in `s` from index `i + 1` to `n - 1`, and `lst` contains a sequence of integers starting from 2 up to `i + 1`.

This output state describes the final conditions of the variables after the loop has completed all its iterations. The value of `i` will be `n - 2` because the loop runs from `0` to `n - 2` (inclusive). The variable `zero` will reflect the count of '0's encountered in the string `s` up to the last character processed by the loop. The percentage calculations (`zero_perc` and `one_perc`) will be based on the counts of '0's and '1's respectively, up to the current index `i`. The lists `lst` will contain a sequence of integers from 2 to `i + 1`, which are the indices where the condition `zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50` was met during the loop iterations.
Code of the loop:
for ele in lst:
    mini = min(mini, abs(pk - ele))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and 10, `ele` is 15, and `lst` is [5, 10, 15]

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and 10; `ele` is 5; `lst` is [5, 10, 15]




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
