Output State: **`lst` is empty, `mini` holds the minimum value among `abs(pk - elem)` for all `elem` in the original `lst`, `final` contains all elements from `lst` that minimize `abs(pk - elem)` with respect to `pk`; `final` is sorted, `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` has an additional element 0 appended to it.**

Explanation: The code appends the value `0` to the list `final`. Since `final` was initially sorted and contained elements that minimized `abs(pk - elem)`, appending `0` does not affect the sorting property or the minimization condition. The other variables remain unchanged.
