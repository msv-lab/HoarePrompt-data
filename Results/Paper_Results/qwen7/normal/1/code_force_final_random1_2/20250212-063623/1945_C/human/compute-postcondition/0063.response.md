Output State: **`lst` must contain at least one element, `mini` holds the minimum value among abs(`pk` - `elem`) for all `elem` in the original `lst`, `final` is now `[elem]`, the current value of `mini` is equal to abs(`pk` - `elem`).**

Explanation: The code `final.append(elem)` appends the element `elem` (which is the one that made `mini` equal to `abs(pk - elem)`) to the list `final`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
