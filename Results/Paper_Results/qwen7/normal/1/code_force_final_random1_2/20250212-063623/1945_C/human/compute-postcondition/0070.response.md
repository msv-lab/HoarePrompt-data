Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for elem in lst:`. The variables involved here are `elem` and `lst`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements left in `lst`. 

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `lst` must contain at least one element.
   - `mini` holds the minimum value among `abs(pk - elem)` for all `elem` in the original `lst`.
   - `final` is now `[elem]` where `abs(pk - elem)` equals `mini`, or `final` remains an empty list if no such `elem` exists.
   - `elem` (if found) is appended to `final`.

4. **Adjusting the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop iterates over each element in `lst`, at the start of the next iteration, `elem` will be the next element in `lst`.
   - After processing the current `elem`, `lst` will have one less element.

5. **New state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - `lst` will have one less element than it had at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `mini` and `final` remain unchanged unless the new `elem` meets the criteria to update them.

Given these points, the state adjustments needed for the next iteration are:

- `lst` will have one less element.
- `elem` will be the next element in `lst`.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`lst` must contain at least one less element than before, `mini` holds the minimum value among `abs(pk - elem)` for all `elem` in the original `lst`, `final` is now `[elem]` where `abs(pk - elem)` equals `mini`, or `final` remains an empty list if no such `elem` exists, and `elem` (if found) is appended to `final`.**
