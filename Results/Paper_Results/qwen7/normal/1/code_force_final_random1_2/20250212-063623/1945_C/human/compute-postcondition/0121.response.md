Output State: **`zero` is increased by 1, `zero_perc` is calculated as `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`, `one_perc` is calculated as `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`, `i` is `n - 2`, `one` is increased by 1 if the condition `s[i] == '0'` is false, otherwise `one` remains unchanged, and `one_perc` is updated based on the new value of `one`.**

Explanation:
- `zero` is increased by 1.
- `zero_perc` is updated based on the new value of `zero`.
- `one_perc` is recalculated using the new value of `one`.
- `i` remains `n - 2`.
- `one` is increased by 1 if `s[i] == '0'` is false, otherwise `one` remains unchanged.
- `one_perc` is updated based on the new value of `one`.
