Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be at least 2, and `zero` is 1.**

Explanation: The variable `zero` is incremented by 1, starting from an unspecified initial value (which could be 0 or another number). Since the initial value of `zero` is not specified, we assume it was 0 before the code execution. After executing `zero += 1`, `zero` becomes 1. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
