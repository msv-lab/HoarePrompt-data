Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `ele` and `lst`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop iterates over each element `ele` in the list `lst`. Inside the loop, `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - The variable `ele` changes with each iteration, but it is not directly updated within the loop. Instead, it takes the next value from the list `lst`.
   - The list `lst` remains unchanged during the loop execution.
   - The variable `mini` is updated based on the current value of `ele` and `pk`, but its value is not directly relevant to the next iteration's starting state (since it is updated inside the loop).

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `ele` is the iterating variable, it will take the next value from the list `lst` in the next iteration.
   - The list `lst` remains the same.
   - The variable `mini` is updated within the loop and does not affect the starting state for the next iteration.

Given the above points, the states that need to be adjusted are `ele` and `lst`.

Since `ele` is the iterating variable, it will take the next value from the list `lst`. However, since the exact value of `ele` is not specified, we can only say that it will be the next element in the list.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`, `ele` is the next element in `lst`, and `lst` remains the same**.

To provide a concrete example, if the list `lst` was `[5, 10, 15]` and `ele` was `10` at the end of the previous iteration, then for the next iteration, `ele` would be `15`.

So, a specific state could be:
State: **`mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`, `ele` is 15, and `lst` is [5, 10, 15]**.
