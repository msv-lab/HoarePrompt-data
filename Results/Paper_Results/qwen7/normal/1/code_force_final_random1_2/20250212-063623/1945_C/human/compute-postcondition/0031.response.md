Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < n - 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `zero` is 1 or 0
   - `zero_perc` is 0
   - `i` is 2
   - `one_perc` is -100
   - `lst` contains the element 2

4. **Determine the new value of `i`**: Since `i` starts from 2 and the loop runs until `i < n - 1`, after the previous iteration, `i` would have been incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` is now 3.

5. **Determine the new value of `n`**: For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n - 1`. Since `i` is now 3, `n - 1` must be greater than 3, meaning `n` must be greater than 4.

6. **Adjust the states**:
   - `zero` remains unchanged (1 or 0)
   - `zero_perc` remains unchanged (0)
   - `i` is now 3
   - `one_perc` remains unchanged (-100)
   - `lst` remains unchanged (contains the element 2)

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`zero` is 1 or 0, `zero_perc` is 0, `i` is 3, `one_perc` is -100, and `lst` contains the element 2**
