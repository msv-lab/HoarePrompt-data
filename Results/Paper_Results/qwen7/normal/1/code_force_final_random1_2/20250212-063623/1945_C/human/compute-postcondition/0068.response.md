Postcondition: `lst` must contain at least one element, `mini` holds the minimum value among `abs(pk - elem)` for all `elem` in the original `lst`, and `final` is now `[elem]` where `abs(pk - elem)` equals `mini`, or `final` remains an empty list if no such `elem` exists, and `elem` is appended to `final` if the condition `abs(pk - elem) == mini` is met.
