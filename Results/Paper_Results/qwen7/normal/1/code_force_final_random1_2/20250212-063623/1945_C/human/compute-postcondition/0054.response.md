Output State: **`lst` must contain at least one element, `ele` is the second element of `lst`, `mini` is updated to the minimum value between the current `mini` and `abs(pk - ele)`**.

Explanation: The code updates the variable `mini` to be the minimum value between its current value and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`. The other variables remain unchanged.
