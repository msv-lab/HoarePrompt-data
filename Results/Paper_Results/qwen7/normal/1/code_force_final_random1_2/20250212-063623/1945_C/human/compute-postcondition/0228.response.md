Output State: **`mini` is the minimum value between its current value and 10; `ele` is 20; `lst` is [10, 15, 20]; `final` is [5, 10, 15]; `pk` is `mini` + 10; `elem` is 15**

Explanation: The code `final.append(elem)` appends the value of `elem`, which is 15, to the list `final`. Initially, `final` is `[5, 10]`. After appending 15, `final` becomes `[5, 10, 15]`. The other variables (`mini`, `ele`, `lst`, `pk`) remain unchanged.
