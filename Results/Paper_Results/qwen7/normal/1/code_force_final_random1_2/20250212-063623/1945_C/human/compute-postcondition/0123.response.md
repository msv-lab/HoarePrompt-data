Postcondition: `zero` is increased by 1, `zero_perc` is calculated as `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`, `one_perc` is calculated as `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`, `i` is `n - 2`, `one` is increased by 1 if the condition `s[i] == '0'` is false, otherwise `one` remains unchanged, and `one_perc` is updated based on the new value of `one`. If `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, then the condition is met and no further changes are made to the variables. If the condition is not met, the variables remain as they were after the if statement's execution.
