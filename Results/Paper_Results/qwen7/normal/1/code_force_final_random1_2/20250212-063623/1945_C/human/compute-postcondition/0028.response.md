Output State: **`zero` is 1 or 0, `zero_perc` is 0, `i` is 2, `one_perc` is -100, `lst` contains the element 2**.

Explanation: The code appends the value of `i + 1` to the list `lst`. Given that `i` is initially 1, `i + 1` equals 2. Therefore, `lst` now contains the element 2. The values of `zero`, `zero_perc`, and `one_perc` remain unchanged.
