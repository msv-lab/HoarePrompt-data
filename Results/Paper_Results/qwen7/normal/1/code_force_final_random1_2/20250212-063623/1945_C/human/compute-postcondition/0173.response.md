Output State: **`mini` is the minimum value between its current value and `abs(n/2 - elem)` for each `elem` in the original `lst`; `final` is sorted and contains all elements from `lst` that have `mini` as their minimum distance to `pk`; `c1` is `o * 100 // n`; `t` is `t - 1`; `n` is `n / 2`; `pk` is `n / 2`; `sl` is a list containing the characters of `s`.**

Explanation: The code `sl = list(s)` creates a new list `sl` that contains all the characters of the string `s`. It does not affect the values of `mini`, `final`, `c1`, `t`, `n`, `pk`, or the original string `s`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged except that `sl` is now defined as a list of characters from `s`.
