Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for elem in lst:`. The objects involved here are `elem` and `lst`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `lst` is currently `[5, 10, 15, 20]`.
   - `elem` is a variable that will take the value of each element in `lst` during each iteration of the loop.

3. **Understand the loop behavior**:
   - The loop will iterate over each element in `lst`.
   - During the first iteration, `elem` will be set to the first element of `lst`, which is `5`.
   - During the second iteration, `elem` will be set to the second element of `lst`, which is `10`.
   - And so on...

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop will start with the first element of `lst`, `elem` should be set to the first element of `lst`, which is `5`.
   - The state of `lst` itself does not change; it remains as `[5, 10, 15, 20]`.

5. **Consider other variables**:
   - `mini` is the minimum value between its current value and 10. This value does not affect the loop's execution directly, so it doesn't need to be adjusted.
   - `ele` is currently `20`, but this variable is not used in the loop, so it doesn't need to be adjusted.
   - `final` is an empty list, and since the loop body is omitted, it remains unchanged.

Based on the above steps, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

- `elem` should be `5` (the first element of `lst`).
- `lst` should remain `[5, 10, 15, 20]`.

Therefore, the final answer is:

**State: **`mini` is the minimum value between its current value and 10, `ele` is 20, `lst` is [5, 10, 15, 20], `final` is an empty list, `elem` is 5**.
