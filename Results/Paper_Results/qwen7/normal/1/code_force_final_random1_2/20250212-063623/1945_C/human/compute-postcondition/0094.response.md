Postcondition: `lst` is empty, `mini` holds the minimum value among `abs(n/2 - elem)` for all `elem` in the original `lst`, `final` contains all elements from `lst` that minimize `abs(n/2 - elem)` with respect to `n/2` and is sorted, `c1` is `o * 100 // n`, `n` is either halved or remains the same depending on whether `n` is even, `t` is `t - 1` if `t > 0, `s` is the input string.
