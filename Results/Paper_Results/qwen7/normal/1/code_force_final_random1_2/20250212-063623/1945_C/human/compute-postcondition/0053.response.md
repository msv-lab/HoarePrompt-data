Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for ele in lst:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `ele` and `lst`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `lst` contains at least one element.
   - `ele` takes on each element of `lst` in sequence.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `lst` must contain at least one element.
   - `ele` is the first element of `lst`.
   - `mini` is updated to the minimum value between the current `mini` and `abs(pk - ele)`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `ele` is the first element of `lst` at the end of the previous iteration, the next element `ele` will be the second element of `lst`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `lst` must still contain at least one element (which it does since it started with at least one element and we haven't removed any elements yet).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `lst` must contain at least one element.
- `ele` is the second element of `lst`.
- `mini` remains the same as it was updated based on the first element but hasn't been updated yet for the second element.

**Final State**:
State: **`lst` must contain at least one element, `ele` is the second element of `lst`, `mini` is updated to the minimum value between the current `mini` and `abs(pk - ele)`**
