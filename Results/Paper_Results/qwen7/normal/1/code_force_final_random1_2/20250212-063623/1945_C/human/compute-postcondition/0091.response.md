Output State: **`lst` is empty, `mini` holds the minimum value among `abs(n/2 - elem)` for all `elem` in the original `lst`, `final` contains all elements from `lst` that minimize `abs(n/2 - elem)` with respect to `n/2` and is sorted, `c1` is `o * 100 // n`, `n` is halved, `t` is `t - 1` if `t > 0, `s` is the input string**.

Explanation: The variable `pk` is assigned the value `n / 2`. This updates the value of `pk` but does not affect the values of the other variables listed in the initial state. The value of `n` is updated to `n / 2`, and `t` is decremented by 1 if `t` is greater than 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
