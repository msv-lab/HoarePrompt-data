Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is at least 2, `zero` is either 2 or 1 depending on whether `s[0]` is '0', `zero_perc` is `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`, `one` is 2, `o` is undefined, `one_perc` is either greater than or equal to 50 or a specific value, and `lst` contains 2, 2, `one_perc` remains undefined.**

Explanation: The variable `one` is incremented by 1, making its value 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states.
