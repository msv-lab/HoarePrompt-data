Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Percentages**: The program calculates `zero_perc` and `one_perc` using percentages instead of the required ceiling values. Specifically, the conditions `zero_perc >= 50` and `one_perc >= 50` should be replaced with checks for the ceiling values of the required fractions.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when all residents prefer one side or when the number of residents preferring each side is very uneven.

3. **Unnecessary Sorting and Filtering**: The program sorts and filters the list of valid positions, which is unnecessary and can be optimized.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        sl = list(s)
        zero = sl.count('0')
        one = sl.count('1')
        
        # Initialize variables to keep track of counts and positions
        left_zeros = 0
        right_ones = one
        best_position = -1
        min_diff = float('inf')
        
        for i in range(n - 1):
            if sl[i] == '0':
                left_zeros += 1
            else:
                right_ones -= 1
            
            # Check if current position satisfies the condition
            if (left_zeros >= (i + 1) // 2 + (i + 1) % 2) and (right_ones >= (n - i - 1) // 2 + (n - i - 1) % 2):
                diff = abs((n // 2) - (i + 1))
                if diff < min_diff:
                    min_diff = diff
                    best_position = i + 1
                elif diff == min_diff:
                    best_position = min(best_position, i + 1)
        
        print(best_position)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the program correctly calculates the required conditions and finds the optimal position for the road.
