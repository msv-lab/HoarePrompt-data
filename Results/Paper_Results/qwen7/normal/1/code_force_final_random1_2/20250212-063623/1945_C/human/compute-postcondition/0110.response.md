Output State: **`zero` is increased by 1; `zero_perc` is calculated as `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`, `one_perc` is calculated as `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`**.

This means that the value of `zero` has been incremented by 1, and `zero_perc` is now calculated as the new value of `zero` multiplied by 100 and then divided by `(i + 1)`. Additionally, `one_perc` is calculated as the difference between `o` and `one`, multiplied by 100, and then divided by `(n - i - 1)`. The values of `o`, `one`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged from their previous states.
