Output State: **`mini` is the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - elem)` for each `elem` in `lst` (excluding the first element), `final` now contains the first element of `lst` followed by `elem`, `lst` now contains all elements except the first element.**

Explanation: The code `final.append(elem)` appends the current `elem` to the list `final`. The variable `mini` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation. The `final` list now includes the first element of `lst` followed by `elem`, and `lst` now contains all elements except the first element.
