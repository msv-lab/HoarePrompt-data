Output State: **`mini` is the minimum value between its current value and `abs(n / 2 - elem)` for each `elem` in the original `lst`; `final` is sorted and contains all elements from `lst` that have `mini` as their minimum distance to `pk`; `c1` is `o * 100 // n`; `t` is `t - 1`; `n` is `n / 2`; `pk` is `n / 2`.**

Explanation: The value of `pk` is assigned the value of `n / 2`. All other variables remain unchanged in terms of their relationships and values, except for `n`, which is now updated to `n / 2`. The conditions and relationships involving `mini`, `final`, `c1`, and `t` remain as they were, just with `n` replaced by `n / 2` in the expressions involving it.
