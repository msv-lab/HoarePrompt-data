Output State: **`mini` is the minimum value between its current value and 10; `ele` is 20; `lst` is [5, 10, 15, 20]; `final` is [5, 10]; `pk` is `mini` + 10; `elem` is 10**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `elem` (which is 10) to the list `final`. Initially, `final` contains `[5]`. After appending `elem`, `final` becomes `[5, 10]`. The other variables (`mini`, `ele`, `lst`, `pk`) remain unchanged.
