Output State: **`mini` is the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - elem)` for each `elem` in the original `lst`; `final` is sorted and contains all elements from `lst` that have `mini` as their minimum distance to `pk`; `c1` is `o * 100 // n`; `t` is `t - 1`; `n` is an input integer; `s` is the input string.**

Explanation: The code `s = input()` reads a string input from the user and assigns it to the variable `s`. The values of the other variables (`mini`, `final`, `c1`, `t`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
