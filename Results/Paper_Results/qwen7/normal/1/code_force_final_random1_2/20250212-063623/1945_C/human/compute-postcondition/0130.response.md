Output State: **`zero` is 3, `zero_perc` is 30, `one_perc` is 50, `i` is `n - 2`, `one` is `o - 1`, `one_perc` is `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`**

Explanation: The value of `one_perc` is updated to \((o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)\). Given the initial conditions, `i` is `n - 1` and `one` is `o - 1`. However, since `i` is updated to `n - 2` in the precondition, we use `n - 2` for `i` in the calculation. The value of `o` remains unchanged, so `one` is still `o - 1`. Therefore, `one_perc` is calculated as \((o - (o - 1)) * 100 // (n - (n - 2) - 1) = 1 * 100 // 1 = 100\). However, since the exact values of `o` and `n` are not provided, we express `one_perc` in terms of `o` and `n`.
