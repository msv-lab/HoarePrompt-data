Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the `for ele in lst:` statement. This means the variables involved in the loop head are `ele` and `lst`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop iterates over each element in the list `lst`. At the end of the previous iteration, `ele` was set to 15.

3. **Determine the next value for `ele`**: Since the loop iterates over the list `lst`, the next value for `ele` will be the next element in the list after 15. Given that `lst` is `[5, 10, 15]`, the next element in the list is 5.

4. **Adjust the state**: The only variable in the loop head that needs to be adjusted is `ele`. The other variable, `lst`, remains unchanged as it is the list being iterated over, not a variable whose value changes within the loop.

5. **Consider the `mini` variable**: The `mini` variable is not part of the loop head and its value is not directly affected by the loop itself. It was updated to the minimum value between its current value and 10, but this does not impact the loop's continuation or the value of `ele`.

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and 10, `ele` is 5, and `lst` is [5, 10, 15]**
