Output State: **`mini` is the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - elem)` for each `elem` in the original `lst`; `final` is sorted and contains all elements from `lst` that have `mini` as their minimum distance to `pk`; `c1` is less than 50; `final` now includes the element `n`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `n` to the list `final`. The other variables remain unchanged. `mini` and `final` are updated to include `n`, but no specific values are provided for `mini` or `final` since they depend on the original values and the new element `n`. `c1` remains less than 50.
