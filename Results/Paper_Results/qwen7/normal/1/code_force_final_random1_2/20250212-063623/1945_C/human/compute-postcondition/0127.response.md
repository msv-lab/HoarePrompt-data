Output State: **`zero` is 2, `zero_perc` is 50, `one_perc` is 50, `i` is `n - 2`, `one` is `o - 1`, `lst` contains `i + 1`**.

The value of `one` is incremented by 1, changing its value from `o - 1` to `o`. However, since `o` is not defined in the initial state, we express the new value of `one` as `o - 1 + 1`, which simplifies to `o`. The other variables remain unchanged.
