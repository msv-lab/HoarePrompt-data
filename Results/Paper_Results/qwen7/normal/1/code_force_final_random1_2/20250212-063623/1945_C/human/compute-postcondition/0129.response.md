Output State: **`zero` is 3, `zero_perc` is 30, `one_perc` is 50, `i` is `n - 1`, `one` is `o - 1`, `lst` contains `i + 1` if `s[i]` is '0'. Otherwise, `zero` is 2, `zero_perc` is 50, `one_perc` is 50, `i` is `n - 2`, `one` is `o - 1`, `lst` contains `i + 1**.

Explanation: The code updates `zero_perc` to `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`. Given the initial state where `zero` is 3 and `i` is `n - 1`, we substitute these values into the equation:

\[ \text{zero\_perc} = 3 * 100 // (n - 1 + 1) = 300 // n = 30 \]

Since the value of `n` is not specified, we keep it as `n` in the output state. The other variables (`zero_perc`, `one_perc`, `i`, `one`, `lst`) remain unchanged from their initial state as no operation was performed on them.
