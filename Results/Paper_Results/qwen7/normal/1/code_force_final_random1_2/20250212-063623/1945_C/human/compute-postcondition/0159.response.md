Output State: **`mini` is the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - elem)` for each `elem` in the original `lst`; `final` is sorted and contains all elements from `lst` that have `mini` as their minimum distance to `pk`; `c1` is `o * 100 // n` and the current value of `c1` is greater than or equal to 50; `final` now contains an additional element `0`.**

Explanation: The code snippet appends the value `0` to the list `final`. Since `final` was previously sorted and contained elements from `lst` that had `mini` as their minimum distance to `pk`, appending `0` does not affect the sorting property or the condition that these elements have `mini` as their minimum distance to `pk`. The other variables remain unchanged.
