Postcondition: **`i` is either 0 or 1, `n` is at least 2, `zero` is 1 if `s[0]` is '0', `zero_perc` is calculated as `zero * 100 // (i + 1)` and is greater than or equal to 50, `one` is undefined, `o` is undefined, `one_perc` is calculated as `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)` and is greater than or equal to 50, `lst` contains `i + 1`**.

This means that after the execution of the if-else block, `i` remains either 0 or 1, `n` remains at least 2, `zero` is still 1 if `s[0]` is '0', `zero_perc` is still calculated as `zero * 100 // (i + 1)` and is greater than or equal to 50, `one` and `o` remain undefined, `one_perc` is still calculated as `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)` and is greater than or equal to 50, and `lst` contains `i + 1`.
