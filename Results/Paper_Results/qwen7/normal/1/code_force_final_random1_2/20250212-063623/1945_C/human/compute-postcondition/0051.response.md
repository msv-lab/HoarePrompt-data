Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `ele` which is an element from the list `lst`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `ele`**: Since the loop starts with `ele` being the first element in `lst`, the initial value of `ele` should be the first element of `lst`.

3. **Check the List `lst`**: The list `lst` contains all indices from 2 to `n` where the condition `zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50` was met. This means `lst` is non-empty if there are any indices meeting this condition.

4. **Adjust the States**: We need to ensure that `lst` is non-empty and that `ele` is set to the first element of `lst`.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `lst` must contain at least one element (non-empty).
- `ele` must be the first element of `lst`.

So, the final state adjustment would be:

**State: **`lst` must contain at least one element, `ele` is the first element of `lst`**.
