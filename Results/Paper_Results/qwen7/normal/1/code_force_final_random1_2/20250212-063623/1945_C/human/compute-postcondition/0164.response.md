Postcondition: `mini` is the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - elem)` for each `elem` in the original `lst`; `final` is sorted and contains all elements from `lst` that have `mini` as their minimum distance to `pk`; `final` either remains unchanged or includes an additional element `0` or `n` depending on the value of `c1`.
