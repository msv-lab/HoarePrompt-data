Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `lst` must contain at least one element.
- `mini` holds the minimum value among `abs(pk - elem)` for all `elem` in the original `lst`.
- `final` is either `[elem]` where `abs(pk - elem)` equals `mini`, or it remains an empty list if no such `elem` exists.

### Loop Head
The loop iterates over each element `elem` in `lst`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Determine the Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variable in the loop head is `elem`.
2. **Check the Condition for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to continue, there must still be elements left in `lst` to iterate over.
3. **Adjust the State**:
   - Since `elem` is being used in the loop, it will change with each iteration.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `lst` must still contain at least one element.
   - `mini` and `final` are not directly affected by the loop head but might be updated inside the loop body.

### Conclusion
For the loop to execute one more time, `lst` must still contain at least one element.

### Final State
- `lst` must contain at least one element (this condition remains the same).
- `mini` and `final` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration because they are not directly modified by the loop head.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`lst` must contain at least one element, `mini` holds the minimum value among `abs(pk - elem)` for all `elem` in the original `lst`, and `final` is either `[elem]` where `abs(pk - elem)` equals `mini`, or `final` remains an empty list if no such `elem` exists.**
