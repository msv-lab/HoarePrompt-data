Based on the initial state described:

- `lst` is empty.
- `mini` holds the minimum value among `abs(pk - elem)` for all `elem` in the original `lst`. Since `lst` is empty, there are no elements to consider, so `mini` would be undefined or could be considered as a special case where no elements exist.
- `final` contains all elements from `lst` that minimize `abs(pk - elem)` with respect to `pk` and is sorted. Since `lst` is empty, `final` is also empty.
- `c1` is calculated as `o * 100 // n`. Given that `lst` is empty, we don't have any specific values for `o` and `n`, but since `lst` is empty, it implies that `o` and `n` are not specified in a way that would affect the calculation of `c1` directly from the provided information.

Given these conditions, let's evaluate the print statement:

```python
print(final[0])
```

Since `final` is an empty list, attempting to access the first element (`final[0]`) will result in an `IndexError` if the list were not empty. However, the question asks us to determine what will be printed, and since `final` is empty, the expression `final[0]` does not return any value.

Output: **IndexError: list index out of range**
