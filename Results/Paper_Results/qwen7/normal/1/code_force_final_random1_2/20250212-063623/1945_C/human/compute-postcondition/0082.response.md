Output State: **`lst` is empty, `mini` holds the minimum value among `abs(pk - elem)` for all `elem` in the original `lst`, `final` contains all elements from `lst` that minimize `abs(pk - elem)` with respect to `pk` and is sorted, `c1` is less than 50, `final` now includes the element `n`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `final.append(n)` appends the value of `n` to the list `final`. Since `final` was initially sorted and contained elements that minimized `abs(pk - elem)`, appending `n` to `final` maintains the sorted order and the property that `final` contains elements minimizing the absolute difference with `pk`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
