Output State: **The program returns the tuple (d, c - a // b * d)**

Explanation: The code returns a tuple containing two elements. The first element is `d`, which is the result of calling `func_1(b, a % b)[1]`. The second element is `c - a // b * d`, where `c` is the result of calling `func_1(b, a % b)[0]`. Since `func_1` is not defined here, we cannot determine the exact values of `c` and `d`, but we know they are the results of calling `func_1` with the arguments `b` and `a % b`. The expression `a // b` represents the integer division of `a` by `b`, and `a // b * d` multiplies the result of the integer division by `d`. Finally, `c - a // b * d` calculates the difference between `c` and `a // b * d`.
