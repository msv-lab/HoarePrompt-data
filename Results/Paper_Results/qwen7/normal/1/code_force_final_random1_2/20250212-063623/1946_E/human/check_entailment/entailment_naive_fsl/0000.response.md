Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not actually solve the given problem. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not appear to be related to the problem of counting permutations based on prefix and suffix maximums. Instead, they seem to be implementing extended Euclidean algorithm and modular multiplicative inverse, which are not relevant to the problem at hand.

To correctly solve the problem, we would need to construct permutations based on the given prefix and suffix maximums and ensure that the constraints are met. The provided code does not attempt to do this, making it incorrect for the given problem description.
