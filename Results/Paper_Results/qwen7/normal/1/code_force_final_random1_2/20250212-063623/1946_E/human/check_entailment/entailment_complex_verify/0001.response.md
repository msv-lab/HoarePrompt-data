### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identified that the provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` are not relevant to solving the problem. These functions are related to modular arithmetic and do not address the combinatorial nature of the problem. Let's break down the core logic required to solve the problem and compare it with the provided code.

#### Core Logic Required:
1. **Identify Segments**: Determine the segments between the prefix and suffix maximums.
2. **Count Permutations**: For each segment, count the number of ways to arrange the elements while maintaining the prefix and suffix maximum constraints.
3. **Combine Results**: Multiply the counts of permutations for each segment to get the total number of valid permutations.

#### Provided Code Analysis:
- **facts List**: Precomputed factorials modulo \(10^9 + 7\). This is useful for calculating combinations.
- **Main Logic**:
  - Checks if the last prefix maximum is the same as the first suffix maximum and vice versa. If not, there are no valid permutations.
  - Uses the `func_2` function to calculate modular inverses, which is not directly relevant to the problem.
  - Iterates over the suffix maximums and calculates combinations for each segment.
  - Iterates over the prefix maximums in reverse order and performs similar calculations.
  - Multiplies the results of these calculations to get the final answer.

However, the main issue lies in the logic for combining the results of the segments. The provided code does not correctly handle the combinatorial counting for each segment. Specifically, the code does not ensure that the elements within each segment can be permuted freely while maintaining the prefix and suffix maximum constraints.

#### Detailed Issues:
1. **Incorrect Combination Calculation**: The code uses `func_2` to calculate combinations, but it does not correctly account for the constraints imposed by the prefix and suffix maximums.
2. **Missing Constraints Handling**: The code does not properly enforce that the elements in each segment can only be permuted in a way that respects the maximum constraints.
3. **Incorrect Multiplication of Results**: The final result is obtained by multiplying the intermediate results without ensuring that the constraints are met for each segment.

Given these issues, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem. The original assessment was accurate in identifying that the provided functions are not relevant and that the core logic is missing.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the combinatorial constraints and does not accurately count the number of valid permutations.
