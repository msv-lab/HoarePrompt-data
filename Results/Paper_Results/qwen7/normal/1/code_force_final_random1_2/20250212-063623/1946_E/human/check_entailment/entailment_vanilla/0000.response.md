Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the number of permutations that match the given prefix and suffix maximums.
   - The prefix maximums are the positions where the element is the largest in the prefix up to that position.
   - The suffix maximums are the positions where the element is the largest in the suffix starting from that position.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The prefix and suffix maximums must be unique because they define the structure of the permutation.
   - The number of suitable permutations depends on how these maximums are distributed in the permutation.

3. **Functions Provided**:
   - `func_1(a, b)`: This function seems to implement the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which finds the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the coefficients (x, y) such that \( ax + by = \text{gcd}(a, b) \).
   - `func_2(a, b)`: This function uses the result of `func_1` to compute modular multiplicative inverses, specifically \( a^{-1} \mod 1000000007 \).

4. **Relevance to the Problem**:
   - The problem requires counting permutations, which typically involves combinatorial logic rather than just GCD and modular arithmetic.
   - The functions provided do not directly relate to the core logic needed to solve the problem.

5. **Core Logic Needed**:
   - To solve the problem, we need to:
     - Identify the segments between prefix and suffix maximums.
     - Ensure that the elements in these segments can be permuted freely while maintaining the prefix and suffix maximum constraints.
     - Count the number of valid permutations using combinatorial methods.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided functions (`func_1` and `func_2`) are not relevant to solving the given problem. They are likely intended for other purposes, such as modular arithmetic operations, but do not address the combinatorial nature of the problem.
   - The solution would require a different approach, such as dynamic programming or combinatorial counting, to correctly count the number of valid permutations.

### Final Answer:
Given the analysis, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as stated. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
