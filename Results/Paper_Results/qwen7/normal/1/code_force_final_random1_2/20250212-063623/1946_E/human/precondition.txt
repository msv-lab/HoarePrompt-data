a is a list of integers representing the indices of the prefix maximums, b is a list of integers representing the indices of the suffix maximums, and both lists are sorted in increasing order. Additionally, the length of the permutation n is derived from the maximum value in both a and b, and 1 ≤ m_1, m_2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, where m_1 and m_2 are the lengths of a and b respectively.
