Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, both of which are positive integers. It returns either a tuple `(1, 0)`, a tuple `(d, c)` where `d` is the result of `func_1(b, a)` with `b` as the first argument, and `c` is the result of `func_1(b, a)` with `a` as the second argument, a tuple `(1, -(a // b - 1))`, or a tuple `(d, c - a // b * d)`.**
