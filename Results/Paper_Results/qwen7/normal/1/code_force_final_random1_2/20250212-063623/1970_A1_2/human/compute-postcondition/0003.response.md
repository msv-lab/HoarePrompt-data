Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case involves the variable `i` and the variable `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of the Variables**:
   - `s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")".
   - `n` is the length of `s`.
   - `balance` is 0.
   - `balance_info` is an empty list.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < n`. This means `i` starts at 0 and increments until it reaches `n`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since the loop starts with `i = 0`, we need to ensure that `i` is set to 0.
   - The value of `n` should be correctly reflecting the length of the string `s`.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

Therefore, the state after adjustment should be:

**State: **`i` is 0, `n` is the length of `s`**
