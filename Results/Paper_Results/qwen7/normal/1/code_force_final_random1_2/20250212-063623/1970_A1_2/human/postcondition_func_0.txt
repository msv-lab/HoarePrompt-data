The function accepts two parameters, infoA and infoB, which are objects with attributes `balance` and `position`. Depending on the values of these attributes, it returns either the difference between infoA's balance and infoB's balance if both are integers, or the difference between the position attribute of infoB and the position attribute of infoA.
