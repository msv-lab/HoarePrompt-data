Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be equal to `n-1`, `balance` will be either a non-negative or negative integer depending on the number of unmatched opening and closing parentheses in the string `s`, `n` will still be the length of `s`, and `balance_info` will be a list containing an instance of `BalanceInfo` for each iteration of the loop. Each instance in `balance_info` will have its `balance` updated according to the condition `s[i] == '('`, its `index` set to the current value of `i`, and its `char` set to the character `s[i]`.
