Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided code has several issues that make it incorrect for solving the problem:

1. **Class `BalanceInfo` Missing**: The code uses `BalanceInfo` in the `func_2` function but does not define this class anywhere. The `BalanceInfo` class should be defined to store the balance, position, and character information for each position in the string.

2. **Incorrect Lambda Function in Sort**: The lambda function used in the `sort` method is intended to sort based on the balance and position. However, the lambda function should correctly handle the sorting logic. Specifically, the `-x.position` part is correct but the overall lambda function needs to ensure that the balance is sorted in ascending order and the position in descending order when balances are equal.

3. **Joining Characters Directly**: The `result` string is constructed using a generator expression inside the `join` method. While this is generally correct, the issue lies in how the `BalanceInfo` objects are being sorted and accessed.

Here's a corrected version of the code:

```python
class BalanceInfo:
    def __init__(self, balance, position, character):
        self.balance = balance
        self.position = position
        self.character = character

def func_2(s):
    n = len(s)
    balance_info = []
    balance = 0
    for i in range(n):
        balance_info.append(BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i]))
        if s[i] == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
    # Sort the balance_info list based on balance in ascending order and position in descending order
    balance_info.sort(key=lambda x: (x.balance, -x.position))
    result = ''.join(info.character for info in balance_info)
    print(result)

# Example usage
s = "(()(()))"
func_2(s)
```

This corrected version defines the `BalanceInfo` class and sorts the list of `BalanceInfo` objects correctly. It then constructs the result string by joining the characters from the sorted list.
