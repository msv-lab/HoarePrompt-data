Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the variable `i` and the range `range(n)`. Therefore, the only variables that can be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Postcondition at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is either 1 or 2.
   - `balance` is either 1, 0, or -1.
   - `n` is the length of `s`.
   - `balance_info` is an instance of `BalanceInfo` with `balance` updated based on the condition `s[i] == '('`, `i` being the current value of `i`, and `s[i]` being the second or third character of `s` depending on whether the condition `s[i] == '('` is true or false.

3. **Determine the Next Value of `i`**:
   - Since `i` is either 1 or 2, the next value of `i` would be 2 if it was 1, and 3 if it was 2. However, since the loop is defined as `range(n)` and `n` is the length of `s`, `i` cannot exceed `n-1`.

4. **Adjust the State**:
   - If `i` was 1, the next value of `i` would be 2.
   - If `i` was 2, the next value of `i` would be 3 (since `i` cannot exceed `n-1`).

5. **Update the States**:
   - `i` will be updated to 2 if it was 1, or to 3 if it was 2.
   - `balance` and `balance_info` will be updated based on the new value of `i` and the condition `s[i] == '('`.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is determined by the length of `s`.

Given these points, let's formulate the state adjustment:

- If `i` was 1, then `i` becomes 2.
- If `i` was 2, then `i` becomes 3.
- `balance` and `balance_info` will be updated based on the new value of `i` and the condition `s[i] == '('`.
- `n` remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 2 or 3, `balance` is either 1, 0, or -1, `n` is the length of `s`, `balance_info` now contains an instance of `BalanceInfo` with `balance` being updated according to the condition `s[i] == '('`, `i` being the current value of `i`, and `s[i]` being the third character of `s` depending on whether the condition `s[i] == '('` is true or false.**
