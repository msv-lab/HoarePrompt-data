Postcondition: `i` is 2 or 3, `balance` is either 2, 3, 0, or -1, `n` is the length of `s`, `balance_info` now contains two instances of `BalanceInfo` with the first instance having the original `balance` updated according to the condition `s[i] == '('`, `i` being the current value of `i`, and `s[i]` being the third character of `s` depending on whether the condition `s[i] == '('` is true or false, and the second instance having the updated balance, current index `i`, and the character `s[i]`. If `s[i] == '('`, `balance` remains 2 or 3, otherwise `balance` becomes 0 or -1.
