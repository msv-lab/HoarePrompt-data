The function `bfs` accepts two parameters, `start` and `target`, representing the starting node and one of the two leaves in a tree, respectively. It performs a breadth-first search to find the shortest path distance from the `start` node to the `target` node. If the target node is found, it returns the distance; otherwise, it returns -1.
