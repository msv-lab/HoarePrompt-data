Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `neighbor` and `current`.

2. **Understand the postconditions**:
   - `queue` now contains an additional tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`.
   - `tree[current]` must still contain at least one element.
   - `neighbor` is added to `visited`.
   - The current value of `neighbor` is not in `visited`.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `neighbor` in `tree[current]`, at the start of the next iteration, `neighbor` will be the next element in `tree[current]`.
   - `current` remains the same as it is not being modified within the loop head.
   - `queue` will have the additional tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` from the previous iteration.
   - `neighbor` will be added to `visited` in the previous iteration, so it won't be in `visited` anymore for the next iteration.

Given these points, let's adjust the states:

- `queue` will have the additional tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` from the previous iteration.
- `tree[current]` must still contain at least one element (this condition is maintained by the loop itself).
- `neighbor` will be the next element in `tree[current]`.
- `neighbor` will not be in `visited` anymore because it was just added in the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`queue` now contains an additional tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`, `tree[current]` must still contain at least one element, `neighbor` is the next element in `tree[current]`, and the current value of `neighbor` is not in `visited`**.
