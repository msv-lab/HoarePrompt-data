Output State: `z` is an input integer, `two` is `True`, `tmp` is the last element of `rev[tmp]` after all elements have been popped.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `tmp` will eventually become an empty list (since we keep popping elements from `rev[tmp]` until it's empty). The variable `two` will be toggled with each iteration of the loop. Since the loop executes an odd number of times (at least 3 times), `two` will end up being `True`. The value of `tmp` will be the last element of the list it was reduced to, which is effectively the last element of `rev[tmp]` after all elements have been popped.
