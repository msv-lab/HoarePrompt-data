Output State: The `queue` is empty, and the `visited` set contains all nodes in the tree. The `dist` value for the node `target` is returned as the shortest path distance from the `start` node to the `target` node.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, every node in the tree has been visited, and the `queue` is empty because there are no more nodes to process. The `visited` set now includes all nodes in the tree, indicating that the entire tree has been traversed. Additionally, since the loop returns `dist` as soon as it finds the `target` node, `dist` holds the shortest path distance from the `start` node to the `target` node when the function terminates.
