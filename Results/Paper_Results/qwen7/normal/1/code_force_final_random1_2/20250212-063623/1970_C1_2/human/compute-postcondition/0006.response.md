Output State: **`x` must be greater than 1; `a` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer; `rev[b]` now contains the element `a`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `a` to the list `rev[b]`. Initially, `lst[a]` contained some elements plus `b`, but the code does not directly affect `lst`. Instead, it modifies `rev[b]` to include `a`. The values of `x`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial states.
