Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `x` must be greater than the total number of iterations (n), `a` and `b` will each be a series of input integers corresponding to the inputs provided during each iteration. The `lst` defaultdict will have keys as the `a` values and their corresponding values will be lists containing the `b` values from each iteration where `a` was the input. Similarly, the `rev` defaultdict will have keys as the `b` values and their corresponding values will be lists containing the `a` values from each iteration where `b` was the input.**

This means that `lst[a]` will contain all `b` values for which `a` was an input in any iteration, and `rev[b]` will contain all `a` values for which `b` was an input in any iteration.
