Output State: **`queue` is not empty, `tree[current]` must contain at least one element, `neighbor` is added to `visited`, and the current value of `neighbor` is not in `visited`**.

Explanation: The code adds the current value of `neighbor` to the set `visited`. Since `neighbor` was not previously in `visited`, adding it does not change the fact that its current value is not in `visited`. All other conditions remain unchanged.
