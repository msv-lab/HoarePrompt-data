Output State: `z` is an input integer; `tmp` is equal to the last element of `lst[z]` after all elements have been popped from `lst[z]`, `one` is `False`, and `tmp` is now equal to the last element of `lst[tmp]` after all elements have been popped from `lst[tmp]`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `tmp` will be set to the last remaining element in the list it was pointing to, or it will be `None` if the list is empty. The variable `one` will be `False` because it toggles between `True` and `False` with each iteration of the loop.
