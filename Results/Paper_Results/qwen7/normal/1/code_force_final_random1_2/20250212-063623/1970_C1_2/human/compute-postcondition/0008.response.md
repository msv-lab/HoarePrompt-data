Output State: **`x` must be greater than 2, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `rev[b]` now contains the value of `a`, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input and assigns them to variables `a` and `b`. The precondition that `x` must be greater than 2 remains unchanged. The value of `rev[b]` is updated to contain the value of `a`. The values of `a` and `b` are updated to the input integers.
