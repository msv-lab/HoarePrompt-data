You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: start is an integer representing the starting node, and target is an integer representing one of the two leaves in the tree. Both start and target are within the range 1 <= start, target <= n, where n is the number of nodes in the tree. The variable tree is an adjacency list representation of the tree, where tree[i] is a list of integers representing the neighbors of node i.
def bfs(start, target):
    queue = deque([(start, 0)])
    visited = set([start])
    while queue:
        current, dist = queue.popleft()
        
        if current == target:
            return dist
        
        for neighbor in tree[current]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))
        
    #State: Output State: The `queue` is empty, and the `visited` set contains all nodes in the tree. The `dist` value associated with the target node (one of the two leaves) is returned as the shortest path distance from the start node to the target node.
    #
    #In natural language: After the loop completes all its iterations, the `queue` will be empty because all nodes have been processed. The `visited` set will contain every node in the tree, indicating that the entire tree has been traversed. Additionally, the shortest path distance from the start node to the target node (one of the two leaves) will be found and returned.
    return -1
    #The program returns -1
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters, `start` and `target`, both of which are integers representing the starting node and one of the two leaves in the tree, respectively. The function returns 0 if the queue is empty and the initial value of `dist` is 0. If the target node is found during the breadth-first search, it returns the distance to the target node. If the target node is not found, it returns -1.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 0, which is the initial value of the variable `dist`.

Case_2: The program returns the distance 'dist' which is the second element of the tuple that was popleft from `queue`.

Case_3: The program returns the second element of the list `queue`, which was initially the distance (`dist`) before calling `popleft`

Case_4: The program returns -1


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Use Natural language easily understandable by humans and strictly reply with the format: Functionality: ** your response here **
