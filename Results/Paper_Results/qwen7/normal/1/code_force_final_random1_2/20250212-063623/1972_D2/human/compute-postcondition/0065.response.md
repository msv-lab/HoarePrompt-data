Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns None.**

Given the constraints that `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, and the square root of n does not exceed 2 * 10^3, the function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. Therefore, its functionality is simply to accept no parameters and return nothing (None).
