Output State: **`x` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, `m` must be at least 7, and `cnt` is 2; `y` is increased by 1.**

The code `y += 1` increments the value of `y` by 1. Since `y` was not previously defined, it is assumed to be 0 initially. After the increment, `y` becomes 1. The values of `x`, `n`, `m`, and `cnt` remain unchanged.
