You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * b \cdot \gcd(a,b) is a multiple of a+b . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    0
    1
    1
    6
    423
    5933961
    
Note

In the first test case, no pair satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case, (2,2),(3,6),(4,4),(6,3),(6,6),(8,8) satisfy the
conditions.

- Program:
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1():
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        x += 1
    print(cnt)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function processes up to 10,000 test cases. For each test case, it calls another function `func_1()`. After processing all test cases, the function ensures that the variable `t` (representing the number of remaining test cases) is still greater than 0. The function does not return any value but modifies the state of `t` to reflect the number of remaining test cases.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function takes two integers `n` and `m` as input.
   - It initializes `x` to 1 and `cnt` to 0.
   - It uses a nested loop where `x` iterates from 1 to the square root of `n`.
     - For each `x`, it initializes `y` to 1.
     - It checks if `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`. If these conditions hold, it proceeds.
     - It calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y` using `math.gcd(x, y)`.
     - If the GCD is 1, it adds the minimum of `n / ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)` to `cnt`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It iterates `t` times, calling `func_1` for each test case.

### Issues Identified

1. **Incorrect Condition Check**:
   - The condition `b \cdot \gcd(a, b)` being a multiple of `a + b` is not correctly implemented.
   - The current implementation checks if `x` and `y` have a GCD of 1, which does not necessarily mean that `y \cdot \gcd(x, y)` is a multiple of `x + y`.

2. **Incorrect Calculation**:
   - The calculation `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` is not relevant to the problem statement.
   - The problem requires counting pairs `(a, b)` such that `b \cdot \gcd(a, b)` is a multiple of `a + b`.

3. **Algorithmic Approach**:
   - The current approach does not correctly iterate through all possible pairs `(a, b)` and check the required condition.

### Correct Solution

To correctly solve this problem, we need to:
1. Iterate through all possible pairs `(a, b)` within the given ranges.
2. Check if `b \cdot \gcd(a, b)` is a multiple of `a + b`.

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
import math

def gcd(a, b):
    return math.gcd(a, b)

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (b * gcd(a, b)) % (a + b) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    print(count_valid_pairs(n, m))

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()

# Function calls for testing
# func_2()
```

### Conclusion

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
