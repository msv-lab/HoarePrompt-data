Output State: **`x` is 2, `n` must be at least 6, `m` must be at least 7, `y` is 2, `cnt` is 14**

Explanation: The code updates `cnt` by adding the minimum value between `n / ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)` to `cnt`. Given the initial values, we calculate:

- `(x + y) * x = (2 + 2) * 2 = 8`
- `n / ((x + y) * x) = 6 / 8 = 0.75`
- `(x + y) * y = (2 + 2) * 2 = 8`
- `m // ((x + y) * y) = 7 // 8 = 0`

The minimum value between `0.75` and `0` is `0`. Therefore, `cnt` is updated from `13` to `13 + 0 + 1 = 14`. The other variables remain unchanged.
