Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes three integers: t, n, and m, where t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, and for each test case, n and m are integers between 1 and 2â‹…10^6. The function does not return any value directly but seems to perform some operations based on these inputs.**
