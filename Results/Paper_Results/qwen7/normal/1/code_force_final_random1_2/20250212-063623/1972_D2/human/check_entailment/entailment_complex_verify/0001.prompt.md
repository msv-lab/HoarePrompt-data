You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * b \cdot \gcd(a,b) is a multiple of a+b . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    0
    1
    1
    6
    423
    5933961
    
Note

In the first test case, no pair satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case, (2,2),(3,6),(4,4),(6,3),(6,6),(8,8) satisfy the
conditions.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, and the square root of n does not exceed 2 * 10^3.
def func_1():
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        
        x += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `x` is 5, `n` is at least 55, `m` is at least 7, `y` is greater than 10, and `cnt` is 36.
    #
    #To understand this output state, let's break down the loop and the given information:
    #
    #1. The loop starts with `x` set to 1 and increments `x` by 1 each iteration as long as `x * x <= n`.
    #2. For each value of `x`, it initializes `y` to 1 and increments `y` as long as both `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` hold true.
    #3. If the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `x` and `y` is 1, it updates `cnt` by adding the minimum of `n / ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)` to `cnt`.
    #
    #From the provided output states after the first three iterations:
    #- After the first iteration (`x=2`), `cnt` is 12.
    #- After the second iteration (`x=3`), `cnt` is 15.
    #- After the third iteration (`x=4`), `cnt` is 24.
    #
    #We can infer that:
    #- Each increment of `x` adds to `cnt` based on the conditions of the inner while loop.
    #- The value of `cnt` increases by 3 for each additional iteration of the outer loop.
    #
    #Following this pattern:
    #- After the fourth iteration (`x=5`), `cnt` would be `24 + 3 = 27`.
    #- After the fifth iteration (`x=6`), `cnt` would be `27 + 3 = 30`.
    #- After the sixth iteration (`x=7`), `cnt` would be `30 + 3 = 33`.
    #- After the seventh iteration (`x=8`), `cnt` would be `33 + 3 = 36`.
    #
    #Since the problem does not specify the exact stopping condition but implies the loop continues until `x * x > n`, we assume the loop completes its iterations up to `x=5` based on the given information, leading to `cnt` being 36.
    #
    #Additionally, the constraints on `n` and `m` increase with each iteration, ensuring they meet the necessary conditions for the loop to continue. Thus, `n` must be at least 55 (since \(5^2 = 25\)), and `m` remains at least 7, with `y` starting from a value greater than 10 due to the increasing `x` values.
    print(cnt)
    #This is printed: 36
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two integers \( n \) and \( m \) from user input, where \( 1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6 \) and the square root of \( n \) does not exceed \( 2 \times 10^3 \). It then iterates over possible pairs of integers \( (x, y) \) such that \( x \geq 1 \) and \( y \geq 1 \), updating a counter \( cnt \) based on certain conditions. Specifically, if the greatest common divisor of \( x \) and \( y \) is 1, and both \( (x + y) \times x \leq n \) and \( (x + y) \times y \leq m \) hold, it adds the minimum of \( \frac{n}{(x + y) \times x} \) and \( \frac{m}{(x + y) \times y} \) to \( cnt \). Finally, it prints the value of \( cnt \).

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
        
    #State: Output State: `t` must be greater than 0.
    #
    #Natural Language Description: After the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `t` must still be greater than 0. This is because the loop continues as long as `t` is greater than 0, and since no operations within the loop modify `t`, its initial condition remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes up to 10,000 test cases. For each test case, it calls another function `func_1()`. After processing all test cases, the function ensures that the variable `t` (representing the number of remaining test cases) is still greater than 0. The function does not return any value but modifies the state of `t` to reflect the number of remaining test cases.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function takes two integers `n` and `m` as input.
   - It initializes `x` to 1 and `cnt` to 0.
   - It uses a nested loop where `x` iterates from 1 to the square root of `n`.
     - For each `x`, it initializes `y` to 1.
     - It checks if `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`. If these conditions hold, it proceeds.
     - It calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y` using `math.gcd(x, y)`.
     - If the GCD is 1, it adds the minimum of `n / ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)` to `cnt`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It iterates `t` times, calling `func_1` for each test case.

### Issues Identified

1. **Incorrect Condition Check**:
   - The condition `b \cdot \gcd(a, b)` being a multiple of `a + b` is not correctly implemented.
   - The current implementation checks if `x` and `y` have a GCD of 1, which does not necessarily mean that `y \cdot \gcd(x, y)` is a multiple of `x + y`.

2. **Incorrect Calculation**:
   - The calculation `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` is not relevant to the problem statement.
   - The problem requires counting pairs `(a, b)` such that `b \cdot \gcd(a, b)` is a multiple of `a + b`.

3. **Algorithmic Approach**:
   - The current approach does not correctly iterate through all possible pairs `(a, b)` and check the required condition.

### Correct Solution

To correctly solve this problem, we need to:
1. Iterate through all possible pairs `(a, b)` within the given ranges.
2. Check if `b \cdot \gcd(a, b)` is a multiple of `a + b`.

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
import math

def gcd(a, b):
    return math.gcd(a, b)

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (b * gcd(a, b)) % (a + b) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    print(count_valid_pairs(n, m))

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()

# Function calls for testing
# func_2()
```

### Conclusion

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the answer is:
