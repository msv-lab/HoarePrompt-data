Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `x * x <= n`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `x` is 3
   - `n` is at least 6
   - `m` is at least 7
   - `y` is greater than 4
   - `cnt` is 15

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - The loop can continue as long as `x * x <= n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `x` is 3.
   - To ensure the loop continues, `x * x` must still be less than or equal to `n`.
   - Since `x` is 3, `x * x` is 9.
   - Therefore, `n` must be at least 9 for the loop to continue.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - The only variables in the loop head are `x` and `n`.
   - We need to ensure `x * x <= n` holds true.
   - Given `x` is 3, `x * x` is 9.
   - Thus, `n` must be at least 9.

5. **Final state**:
   - `x` is 3 (unchanged)
   - `n` must be at least 9
   - `m` is at least 7 (unchanged)
   - `y` is greater than 4 (unchanged)
   - `cnt` is 15 (unchanged)

Therefore, the modified state for the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`x` is 3, `n` must be at least 9, `m` is at least 7, `y` is greater than 4, and `cnt` is 15**
