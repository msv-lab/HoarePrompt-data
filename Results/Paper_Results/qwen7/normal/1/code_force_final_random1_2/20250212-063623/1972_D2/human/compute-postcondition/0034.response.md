To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions in the loop head. The loop condition is:

\[
(x + y) \times x \leq n \quad \text{and} \quad (x + y) \times y \leq m
\]

Given the current states at the end of the previous iteration:
- \( x = 2 \)
- \( n \geq 6 \)
- \( m \geq 7 \)
- \( y = 3 \)
- \( cnt = 14 \)

Let's evaluate the loop condition with these values:

1. Calculate \( x + y \):
   \[
   x + y = 2 + 3 = 5
   \]

2. Evaluate the first part of the condition \( (x + y) \times x \leq n \):
   \[
   (x + y) \times x = 5 \times 2 = 10
   \]
   Since \( n \geq 6 \), this part of the condition will be true as long as \( n \) is at least 6.

3. Evaluate the second part of the condition \( (x + y) \times y \leq m \):
   \[
   (x + y) \times y = 5 \times 3 = 15
   \]
   Since \( m \geq 7 \), this part of the condition will be true as long as \( m \) is at least 7.

For the loop to execute one more time, both parts of the condition must be true. Given the current values, the condition is already satisfied because \( n \geq 6 \) and \( m \geq 7 \).

Since the loop condition is already satisfied with the current values, no adjustments are needed to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

State: **`x` is 2, `n` is at least 6, `m` is at least 7, `y` is 3, and `cnt` is 14**
