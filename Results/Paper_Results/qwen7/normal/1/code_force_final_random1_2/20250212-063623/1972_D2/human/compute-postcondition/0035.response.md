Output State: **`x` is 2, `n` is at least 6, `m` is at least 7, `y` is 3, and `cnt` is 15.**

Explanation: The code updates `cnt` by adding the minimum value between `n / ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)` to `cnt`. Given `x = 2`, `y = 3`, `n` is at least 6, and `m` is at least 7, we calculate:

- `n / ((x + y) * x) = 6 / (5 * 2) = 6 / 10 = 0.6`
- `m // ((x + y) * y) = 7 // (5 * 3) = 7 // 15 = 0` (integer division)

The minimum of these two values is `0.6`. Therefore, `cnt` is updated to `14 + 0.6 = 14.6`. Since `cnt` is stored as an integer, it rounds down to `15`.
