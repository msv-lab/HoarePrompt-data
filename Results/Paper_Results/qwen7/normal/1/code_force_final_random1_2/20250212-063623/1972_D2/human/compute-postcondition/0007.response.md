Output State: `t` must be greater than 0.

In natural language: The value of `t` must be greater than 0 after the loop has executed all its iterations. This is because the loop continues as long as `t` is greater than 0, and since the loop was able to execute up to 3 times with `t` being greater than 0, it implies that `t` started as a positive integer and remained positive throughout the iterations.
