Output State: `t` must be greater than 0.

Natural Language Description: After the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `t` must still be greater than 0. This is because the loop continues as long as `t` is greater than 0, and since no operations within the loop modify `t`, its initial condition remains unchanged.
