Reasoning:
1. **Function 1 Analysis**:
   - The function correctly calculates the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for a given \(n\) and \(m\).
   - It uses a nested loop structure where the outer loop iterates over possible values of \(a\) (from 1 to \(\sqrt{n}\)) and the inner loop iterates over possible values of \(b\) (from 1 to the maximum value that keeps \((a + b) \cdot b \leq m\)).
   - The condition \(\text{math.gcd}(a, b) == 1\) ensures that \(a\) and \(b\) are coprime.
   - The value added to `cnt` is the minimum of \(\frac{n}{(a + b) \cdot a}\) and \(\frac{m}{(a + b) \cdot b}\), which ensures that \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

2. **Function 2 Analysis**:
   - Function 2 handles multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases \(t\) and then calls `func_1()` for each test case.
   - Since `func_1()` is designed to handle individual test cases, calling it in a loop for \(t\) times will correctly process all test cases.

3. **Output Verification**:
   - The provided output states for `func_1()` match the expected behavior of the function.
   - The output states for `func_2()` indicate that it correctly processes multiple test cases without modifying the value of \(t\).

Given the analysis, the program appears to be correctly implemented according to the problem statement and the provided execution states.

Correctness: **True**
