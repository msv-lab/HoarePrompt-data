Based on the initial state and the given information, we know the following:

- `x` is 5.
- `n` is at least 55.
- `m` is at least 7.
- `y` is greater than 10.
- `cnt` is 36 after the loop has completed its iterations up to `x=5`.

The code snippet `print(cnt)` simply prints the value of the variable `cnt`.

Given that `cnt` is explicitly stated to be 36 after the loop has completed its iterations, we can directly use this value.

Output: **36**
