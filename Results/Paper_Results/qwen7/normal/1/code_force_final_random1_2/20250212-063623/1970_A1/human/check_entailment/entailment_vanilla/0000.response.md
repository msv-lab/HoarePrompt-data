Let's break down the problem and the provided code step by step to determine if the given program is correct.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input**: A balanced parentheses sequence.
2. **Task**: Apply the balanced shuffle operation to the input sequence.
3. **Balanced Shuffle Operation**:
   - Compute the balance of the prefix up to each character.
   - Sort the characters based on their prefix balance and position.
   - The resulting sequence is the balanced shuffle.

### Provided Code Analysis:
1. **BalanceInfo Class**:
   - Not explicitly defined in the provided code snippet, but it should be a class to store the balance, position, and character information for each position in the input sequence.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is used to compare two `BalanceInfo` objects. It sorts them based on balance and position.
   - The logic seems correct for sorting based on the specified criteria.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - Computes the balance of the prefix up to each character.
   - Stores this information in a list of `BalanceInfo` objects.
   - Sorts the list using `func_1`.
   - Constructs the final shuffled sequence by joining the characters from the sorted list.
   - Prints the result.

### Key Points to Verify:
1. **Balance Calculation**:
   - The balance calculation logic is correct. It increments the balance for an opening parenthesis and decrements for a closing parenthesis.

2. **Sorting Logic**:
   - The sorting logic using `func_1` is correct. It ensures that the sequence is sorted first by balance and then by position in descending order when balances are equal.

3. **Shuffling and Construction**:
   - The construction of the shuffled sequence by joining the characters from the sorted list is correct.

### Conclusion:
Based on the provided code and the problem description, the implementation correctly follows the steps required to perform the balanced shuffle operation.

**Correctness: True**
