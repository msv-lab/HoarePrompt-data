Output State: **`i` is 1 or 2, `balance` is either 1 or 0, `n` is the length of `s`, `balance_info` now contains an instance of `BalanceInfo` with `balance` being equal to the current value of `balance`, `i` being the current value of `i`, and `s[i]` being the second or third character of `s` depending on whether the condition `s[i] == '('` is true or false.**

Explanation: The code `balance_info.append(BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i]))` appends a new instance of `BalanceInfo` to the `balance_info` list. This new instance is initialized with the current values of `balance`, `i`, and `s[i]`. The values of `i`, `balance`, `n`, and `s[i]` remain unchanged from their initial states, but `balance_info` now includes this new instance.
