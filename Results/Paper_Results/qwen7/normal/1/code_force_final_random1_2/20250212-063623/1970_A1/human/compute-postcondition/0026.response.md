Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be equal to `n-1`, `balance` will be the final balance calculated after processing all characters in `s`, `n` will be the length of `s`, and `balance_info` will be a list containing an instance of `BalanceInfo` for each iteration of the loop. Each instance in `balance_info` will have its `balance` updated according to the condition `s[i] == '('`, the current value of `i`, and the character `s[i]`. The `balance` value will reflect the net count of unmatched opening parentheses '(' minus closing parentheses ')' after processing all characters in `s`.
