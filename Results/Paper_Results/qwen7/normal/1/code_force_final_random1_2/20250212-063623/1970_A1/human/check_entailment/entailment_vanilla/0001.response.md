Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Understanding the Balanced Shuffle Operation**:
   - The balanced shuffle operation involves computing the balance of each prefix of the input string.
   - These balances and their corresponding positions are stored in a list.
   - The list is then sorted based on the balance (in ascending order) and position (in descending order for ties).
   - The final sequence formed by the characters at the sorted positions is the balanced shuffle.

2. **Key Components of the Program**:
   - `func_1`: This function is used to compare two `BalanceInfo` objects. It should return the difference in balance, and if the balance is equal, it returns the difference in position.
   - `func_2`: This function performs the main logic of the balanced shuffle operation.

3. **Analysis of `func_2`**:
   - The function initializes the length of the input string `s` and creates an empty list `balance_info`.
   - It iterates through the string `s`, updating the balance and storing `BalanceInfo` objects in the list.
   - After collecting all `BalanceInfo` objects, it sorts them using the key specified (`(x.balance, -x.position)`).
   - Finally, it constructs the result string by joining the characters from the sorted `BalanceInfo` objects and prints it.

4. **Checking the Implementation**:
   - The sorting key `(x.balance, -x.position)` ensures that the list is sorted by balance in ascending order and by position in descending order for ties.
   - The construction of the result string by joining the characters from the sorted list is correct.

### Conclusion

The given program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. It computes the balance of each prefix, stores the necessary information, sorts the information based on the required criteria, and constructs the final balanced shuffle sequence.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
