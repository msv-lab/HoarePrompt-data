Output State: **`i` is 2 or 3, `balance` is 2 or 3, `n` is the length of `s`, `balance_info` now contains an instance of `BalanceInfo` with `balance` being updated according to the condition `s[i] == '('`, `i` being the current value of `i`, and `s[i]` being the third character of `s` depending on whether the condition `s[i] == '('` is true or false, and `balance_info` now includes an additional instance of `BalanceInfo` with the updated balance, current index `i`, and the character `s[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `balance += 1` increments the value of `balance` by 1. Since `balance` was either 1 or 0 initially, it will now be 2 or 1 respectively. The values of `i`, `n`, and the `balance_info` instances remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.
