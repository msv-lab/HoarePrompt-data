Output State: **After sorting, `balance_info` is a list of instances of `BalanceInfo`, sorted first by the `balance` attribute in ascending order, and then by the `-position` attribute in descending order. `i` is `n-1`, `balance` is the final balance calculated after processing all characters in `s`, and `n` is the length of `s`.**

Explanation: The code sorts the `balance_info` list based on two criteria: the `balance` attribute in ascending order and the `-position` attribute in descending order. The values of `i`, `balance`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states after the sort operation.
