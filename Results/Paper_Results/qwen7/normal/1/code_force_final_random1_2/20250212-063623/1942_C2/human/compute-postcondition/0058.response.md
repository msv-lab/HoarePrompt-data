Output State: **`len(a)` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `ans` is 1, and the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is 2**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `ans` by 1. Given the initial conditions, `ans` was initially 0 (implied by the problem context), so it becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
