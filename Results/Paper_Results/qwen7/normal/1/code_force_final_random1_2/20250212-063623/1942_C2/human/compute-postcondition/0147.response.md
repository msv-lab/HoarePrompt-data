Postcondition: `i` is equal to the length of list `a`, `ans` is the count of consecutive pairs in `a` that differ by 2 or an even number where `y` was sufficient to decrement plus 1, `tmp` contains the integer division of the differences by 2 for those pairs where the difference was even and `y` allowed it. If the first element of list `a` plus `n` minus the last element of list `a` equals 2, `ans` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `y` is decremented by `((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1)`, and `tmp` now includes the value of `((a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2)`.
