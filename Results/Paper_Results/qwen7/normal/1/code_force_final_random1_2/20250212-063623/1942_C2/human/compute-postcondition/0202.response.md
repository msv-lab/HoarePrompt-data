Postcondition: `ans` is increased by the value of the third element in the `odd` list, `y` is decreased by half the third element in the `odd` list, and `gap` is the third element in the `odd` list. If `y` is less than half of `gap`, `ans` is further increased by 2 times the value of `y` minus the third element in the `odd` list, and `y` is set to 0.
