Postcondition: `even` is a non-empty iterable, `ans` is increased by twice the value of `y` and `y` is 0. If `y` is less than `gap // 2`, then `ans` is increased by twice the value of `y`, `y` is set to 0, and `gap` remains unchanged. If `y` is not less than `gap // 2`, then no changes occur to `ans` and `y`.
