Output State: **`tt` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq tt \leq 10^4\), `ii` is 0, `n` is the first number inputted, `x` is the second number inputted, `y` is the third number inputted, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `ans` is `x + y - 2`, `tmp` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list `tmp`. This does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the output state retains the values of all the variables as they were in the initial state, except for `tmp`, which is now an empty list.
