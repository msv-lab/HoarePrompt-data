Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ans` is increased by the sum of all elements in the `odd` list plus 2 times the initial value of `y`, and `y` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for gap in even:
    if y < gap // 2:
        ans += 2 * y
        y = 0
        break
    ans += gap
    y -= gap // 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ans` is increased by the sum of all elements in the `odd` list plus 2 times the initial value of `y` (which is 0), and `ans` is increased by `gap`; `y` is decreased by `gap // 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ans` is increased by the sum of all elements in the `odd` list plus 2 times the initial value of `y` (which is 0), and `ans` is further increased by `gap`. `y` is decreased by `gap // 2`, and `gap` is the next element in the `even` list. If `y` is less than `gap // 2`, `ans` is additionally increased by 2 times the initial value of `y` (which is 0) plus the sum of all elements in the `odd` list plus `gap`, and `y` is set to 0; `ans` is increased by `gap`, and `y` is decreased by `gap // 2

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ans` is increased by `gap`, `y` is decreased by `gap // 2`, and the value of `gap` is updated to the next element in the `even` list; `y` is decreased by `gap // 2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
