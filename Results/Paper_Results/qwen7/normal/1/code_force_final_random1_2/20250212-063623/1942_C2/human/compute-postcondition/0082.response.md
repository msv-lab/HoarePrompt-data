Postcondition: `len(a)` is at least 2, `i` is either 3 or 4, `ans` is the sum of its previous value and `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` if `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0` and `y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration, and `y` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
