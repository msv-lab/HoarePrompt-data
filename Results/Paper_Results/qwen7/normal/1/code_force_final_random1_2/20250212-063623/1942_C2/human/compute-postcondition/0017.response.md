Postcondition: **`ii` is 0, `n` is the first number inputted, `x` is the second number inputted, `y` is either `y - (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 + 1` if the current value of `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is even and `y` is greater than `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, or `y` remains unchanged, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order that must have more than one element, `ans` is `x + y - 2` adjusted accordingly, `tmp` is a list containing the value of `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` if the condition is met, and the difference between consecutive elements in `a` is not 2.**
