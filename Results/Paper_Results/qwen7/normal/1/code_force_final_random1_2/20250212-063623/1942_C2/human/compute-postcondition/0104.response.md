Output State: **`ans` is `x + y - 2`, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from input().split(), `x` is an input integer, `ii` is `tt`, `n` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `tmp` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list `tmp`. None of the other variables (`ans`, `a`, `x`, `ii`, `n`, `y`) are affected by this line of code. Therefore, their values remain the same as in the initial state.
