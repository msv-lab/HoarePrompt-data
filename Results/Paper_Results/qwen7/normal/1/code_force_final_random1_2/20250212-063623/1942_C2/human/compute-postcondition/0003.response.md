Output State: **`tt` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq tt \leq 10^4\), `ii` is 0, `n` is the first number inputted, `x` is the second number inputted, `y` is the third number inputted, `a` is a list containing integers converted from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`. The initial values of `tt`, `ii`, `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
