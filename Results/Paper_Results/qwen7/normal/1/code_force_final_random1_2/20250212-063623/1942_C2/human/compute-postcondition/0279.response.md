Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `i`
   - `x`

2. **Understand the Conditions for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < x`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, the postcondition is that `x` must be greater than 0.
   - The variable `next_elem` is defined based on the value of `i` relative to `x - 1`.
   - The variable `gap` is calculated based on `next_elem` and `a[i]`.

3. **Determine the State Adjustments:**
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 at the start of each new iteration.
   - `x` does not change within the loop unless explicitly modified, but it must remain greater than 0.

Given the above points, let's adjust the states for the next iteration:

- `i` will be incremented by 1 from its current value.
- `x` must still be greater than 0.

Since `x` is a constant for this loop and must remain greater than 0, we don't need to adjust it further. We only need to update `i`.

State: **`x` must be greater than 0; `next_elem` is `a[0] + n` if `i` equals `x - 1`, otherwise `next_elem` is `a[i + 1]`; `gap` is `next_elem - a[i] - 1`. If `gap` is greater than 1 and odd, `odd` is a list containing the value of `gap`. If `gap` is greater than 0 and even, `even` is a list containing the value of `gap`. Otherwise, `even` remains unchanged. `i` is `i + 1`**.

However, since we are only asked to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, we focus on `i`:

State: **`x` must be greater than 0; `i` is `i + 1`; `next_elem` is `a[0] + n` if `i` equals `x - 1`, otherwise `next_elem` is `a[i + 1]`; `gap` is `next_elem - a[i] - 1`. If `gap` is greater than 1 and odd, `odd` is a list containing the value of `gap`. If `gap` is greater than 0 and even, `even` is a list containing the value of `gap`. Otherwise, `even` remains unchanged.**
