Postcondition: **`t` is 0, `n` is `R()`, `x` is the final value after the loop completes, `y` is `R()`, `sx` is equal to `x`, `l` is a sorted list containing elements generated by `R()` with the additional element `n + l[0]` appended to it, `c` is `i // 2`. The current value of `y` is lower than `c`**
