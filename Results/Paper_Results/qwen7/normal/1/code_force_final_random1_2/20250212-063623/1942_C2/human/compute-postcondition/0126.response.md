Postcondition: `i` is 2, `a` must have at least 2 elements, and the difference between `a[2]` and `a[1]` is either 2 or even. If the difference is 2, `ans` remains 2, `tmp` remains unchanged, and `y` remains unchanged. If the difference is even and `y` is greater than the integer division of the difference by 2 minus 1, then `tmp` is a list containing the integer division of the difference between `a[2]` and `a[1]` by 2, `ans` is incremented by the integer division of the difference by 2, and `y` is decreased by the integer division of the difference by 2 minus 1. Otherwise, `tmp`, `ans`, and `y` remain unchanged.
