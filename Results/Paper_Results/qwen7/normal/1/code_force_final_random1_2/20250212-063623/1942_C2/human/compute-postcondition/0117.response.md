Postcondition: `i` is 1, `a` must have at least 2 elements, and the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is either 2 or an even number. If the difference is 2, `ans` is 1. If the difference is even and `y` is greater than the difference divided by 2 minus 1, then `tmp` is a list containing one element which is the integer division of the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` by 2, `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus the integer division of the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` by 2, and `y` is decreased by the integer division of the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` by 2 minus 1. If the above condition is not met, the values of `tmp`, `ans`, and `y` remain unchanged.
