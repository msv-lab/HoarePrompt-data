Reasoning:
- The problem requires maximizing the sum of elements in an array using at most \(5 \times 10^5\) operations, where each operation involves setting a contiguous subarray to the MEX (Minimum Excludant) of that subarray.
- The provided functions seem to address this requirement:
  - `func_1` handles the base case where the subarray length is 1 and ensures that the element is set to 0 if necessary.
  - `func_2` initializes the process and calls `recursive_maximize_sum` to handle the main logic.
  - `recursive_maximize_sum` recursively processes the array to maximize the sum by setting subarrays to their MEX values.
  - `func_3` reads input, calls `func_2`, and prints the result along with the operations.

- Let's analyze each function:
  - `func_1` correctly handles the base case and ensures that the subarray is set to the appropriate value.
  - `recursive_maximize_sum` correctly identifies the MEX value and sets the subarray accordingly.
  - `func_2` correctly combines the operations and returns the required values.
  - `func_3` correctly reads input, calls the necessary functions, and prints the results.

Given the detailed descriptions and the logical flow of the functions, the program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem. Each function works as intended, and the overall structure ensures that the array is processed to maximize its sum while adhering to the constraints.

Correctness: **True**
