### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step using the function summaries and the problem description.

#### Function Summaries:
1. **Function 4 (`func_3`)**:
   - Reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers.
   - Calls `func_2` with `a` as input.
   - Prints the sum of the array (`s`) and the number of operations (`m`).
   - Iterates over the operations and prints them.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - Returns the sum of the array (`s`), the number of operations (`m`), and the list of operations (`ops`).

3. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - Recursively sets the subarray from `l` to `r` to the value `r - l + 1`.
   - If `l == r` and `a[l] != 0`, it sets `a[l]` to 0 and records the operation.
   - Otherwise, it recursively processes the right half of the array and then updates the left half to match the right half.

4. **Recursive Function (`recursive_maximize_sum`)**:
   - Tries to maximize the sum of the subarray from `l` to `r`.
   - If the sum of the subarray is less than or equal to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, it sets the entire subarray to `r - l + 1` and records the operation.
   - Otherwise, it finds the maximum element in the subarray and recursively processes the segments before and after the maximum element.

#### Analysis:
1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function correctly sets the subarray from `l` to `r` to the value `r - l + 1`.
   - It ensures that the subarray is updated to the maximum possible value within the constraints.

2. **Recursive Function (`recursive_maximize_sum`)**:
   - This function correctly identifies the maximum value in the subarray and ensures that the entire subarray is set to this maximum value.
   - It handles the case where the sum of the subarray is less than or equal to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)` by setting the entire subarray to `r - l + 1`.

3. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function correctly calls `recursive_maximize_sum` and returns the sum of the array, the number of operations, and the list of operations.

4. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
   - This function correctly reads the input, calls `func_2`, and prints the results.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to maximize the sum of the array by setting subarrays to their maximum possible values. The function summaries and the problem description confirm that the program handles all necessary cases and guarantees the correct maximization of the array sum.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The original assessment was inaccurate because the program correctly implements the solution for the given problem. The program ensures that the sum of the array is maximized by setting subarrays to their maximum possible values, and it handles all necessary cases as described in the problem statement.
