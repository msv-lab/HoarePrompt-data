You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Nene gave you an array of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of length n .

You can perform the following operation no more than 5\cdot 10^5 times
(possibly zero):

  * Choose two integers l and r such that 1 \le l \le r \le n , compute x as \operatorname{MEX}(\\{a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r\\}) , and simultaneously set a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, \ldots, a_r:=x . 

Here, \operatorname{MEX} of a set of integers \\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k\\} is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer m which does not occur in the set
c .

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a . Find the
maximum sum and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.
Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations in this
sequence, you only should use no more than 5\cdot 10^5 operations in your
solution.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 18 ) — the length of the
array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n (0\leq a_i \leq 10^7 )
— the array a .

Output

In the first line, output two integers s and m (0\le m\le 5\cdot 10^5 ) — the
maximum sum of elements of the array a and the number of operations in your
solution.

In the i -th of the following m lines, output two integers l and r (1 \le l
\le r \le n ), representing the parameters of the i -th operation.

It can be shown that the maximum sum of elements of the array a can always be
obtained in no more than 5 \cdot 10^5 operations.

Note

In the first example, after the operation with l=1 and r=2 the array a becomes
equal to [2,2] . It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum
of the elements of a , so the answer is 4 .

In the second example, the initial sum of elements is 13 which can be shown to
be the largest.

In the third example, the array a changes as follows:

  * after the first operation (l=3 , r=3 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,0,1] ; 
  * after the second operation (l=3 , r=4 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,2,2] . 

It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum of the elements
of a , so the answer is 105 .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(a, l, r, ops):
    if l == r:
        if a[l] != 0:
            ops.append((l, l))
            a[l] = 0
        return
    func_1(a, l + 1, r, ops)
    if a[l] != r - l + 1:
        ops.append((l, r))
        for i in range(l, r + 1):
            a[i] = r - l + 1
        func_1(a, l + 1, r, ops)

#Function 2:
def func_2(a):
    n = len(a)
    ops = []

    recursive_maximize_sum(0, n - 1)
    return (sum(a), len(ops), ops)

#Function 3:
def recursive_maximize_sum(l, r):
    s = sum(a[l:r + 1])
    if s <= (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1):
        func_1(a, l, r, ops)
        ops.append((l, r))
        for i in range(l, r + 1):
            a[i] = r - l + 1
    else:
        mx = max(a[l:r + 1])
        pos = a[l:r + 1].index(mx) + l
        if pos != l:
            recursive_maximize_sum(l, pos - 1)
        if pos != r:
            recursive_maximize_sum(pos + 1, r)

#Function 4:
def func_3():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    (s, m, ops) = func_2(a)
    print(s, m)
    for (l, r) in ops:
        print(l + 1, r + 1)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 4 : The function reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then calls another function `func_2` with `a` as input, receiving three values `s`, `m`, and `ops`. It prints `s` and `m`, and iterates over `ops` to print pairs of indices. After the loop, `ops` is guaranteed to be an empty list.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is intended to ensure that all elements in the subarray from `l` to `r` are set to the value `r - l + 1`, which is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray.
   - The function checks if `a[l]` is already `r - l + 1`. If not, it updates the subarray and calls itself recursively on the right part of the subarray starting from `l + 1`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function initializes the operations list (`ops`) and calls the recursive function `recursive_maximize_sum` to maximize the sum of the array.
   - It returns the sum of the array and the number of operations performed.

3. **Function `recursive_maximize_sum`**:
   - This function aims to maximize the sum of the subarray from `l` to `r`.
   - If the sum of the subarray is less than or equal to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, it calls `func_1` to set all elements in the subarray to `r - l + 1`.
   - Otherwise, it finds the maximum element in the subarray and recursively maximizes the sum on both sides of the maximum element.

4. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function reads the input, calls `func_2` to get the maximum sum and the operations, and prints the result.

### Correctness Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The logic in `func_1` is correct. It ensures that all elements in the subarray are set to the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray.
   - However, there is a small issue: if `a[l]` is already `r - l + 1`, the function should not append `(l, r)` to `ops` because no operation is needed.

2. **Function `recursive_maximize_sum`**:
   - The base case where the sum of the subarray is less than or equal to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)` is handled correctly.
   - The recursive case where the sum is greater than `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)` also seems correct. It splits the subarray at the position of the maximum element and recursively maximizes the sum on both sides.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function correctly initializes the operations list and calls the recursive function to maximize the sum.
   - It returns the correct values: the sum of the array and the number of operations.

4. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function reads the input, calls `func_2`, and prints the results correctly.

### Conclusion

The provided program is almost correct but has a minor issue in `func_1` where it unnecessarily appends operations when `a[l]` is already `r - l + 1`. However, this does not affect the overall correctness of the solution since the operations are still valid and the sum is maximized correctly.
