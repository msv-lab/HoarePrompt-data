Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `s` is the result of `func_2(a)`'s first return, `m` is the result of `func_2(a)`'s second return, `ops` is the result of `func_2(a)`'s third return.**

This means that the function `func_2(a)` has been called with the list `a` as its argument, and it has returned three values: `s`, `m`, and `ops`. These values are now assigned to the variables `s`, `m`, and `ops`, respectively. The initial values of `n` and the list `a` remain unchanged.
