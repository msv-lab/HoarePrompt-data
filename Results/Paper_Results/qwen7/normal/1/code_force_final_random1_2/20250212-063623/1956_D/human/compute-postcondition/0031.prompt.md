You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of non-negative integers of length n, where 1 <= n <= 18, and 0 <= a_i <= 10^7 for all 1 <= i <= n. ops is a list used to store the sequence of operations performed.
def recursive_maximize_sum(l, r):
    s = sum(a[l:r + 1])
    if (s <= (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)) :
        func_1(a, l, r, ops)
        ops.append((l, r))
        for i in range(l, r + 1):
            a[i] = r - l + 1
            
        #State: Output State: `s` is the sum of elements in list `a` from index `l` to index `r` inclusive, `i` is `r + 1`, and all elements in the sublist `a[l:r+1]` are equal to `r - l + 1`.
        #
        #This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be `r + 1` because the loop increments `i` from `l` to `r`. Additionally, every element in the sublist from index `l` to index `r` in list `a` will be set to `r - l + 1` due to the assignment statement inside the loop. The sum `s` remains unchanged as no operations were performed on it within the loop, and the condition `l <= r` must still hold true for the loop to complete all iterations.
    else :
        mx = max(a[l:r + 1])
        pos = a[l:r + 1].index(mx) + l
        if (pos != l) :
            recursive_maximize_sum(l, pos - 1)
        #State: Postcondition: `s` is the sum of elements in list `a` from index `l` to index `r` inclusive, and `s` is greater than `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`, `pos` is the position of `mx` in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]` plus `l`, and if `pos` is not equal to `l`, `pos` is decreased by 1.
        if (pos != r) :
            recursive_maximize_sum(pos + 1, r)
        #State: Postcondition: `s` is the sum of elements in list `a` from index `l` to index `r` inclusive, and `s` is greater than `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`, `pos` is the position of `mx` in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]` plus `l`, and if `pos` is not equal to `r`, `pos` is decreased by 1 after the function `recursive_maximize_sum(pos + 1, r)` is called.
    #State: `s` is the sum of elements in list `a` from index `l` to index `r` inclusive, `i` is `r + 1`, and either all elements in the sublist `a[l:r+1]` are equal to `r - l + 1` or `s` is greater than `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`, `pos` is the position of `mx` in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]` plus `l`, and if `pos` is not equal to `r`, `pos` is decreased by 1 after the function `recursive_maximize_sum(pos + 1, r)` is called.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters, `l` and `r`, where `l` is a list of non-negative integers of length n (1 <= n <= 18) and each element in the list is between 0 and 10^7 inclusive. The function returns the maximum possible sum that can be achieved by performing a series of operations specified in the `ops` list on the elements of `l`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
