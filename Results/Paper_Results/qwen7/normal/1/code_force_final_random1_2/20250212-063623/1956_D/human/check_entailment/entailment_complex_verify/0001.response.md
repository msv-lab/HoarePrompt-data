### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies the main logic of the program and its correctness, but there is a minor issue in `func_1` that needs to be addressed. Specifically, the function `func_1` appends an operation to `ops` even when `a[l]` is already equal to `r - l + 1`. This is unnecessary and can be optimized.

Let's break down the issues and confirm the overall correctness:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The logic in `func_1` is almost correct. It ensures that all elements in the subarray are set to the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray.
   - However, there is a small issue: if `a[l]` is already `r - l + 1`, the function should not append `(l, r)` to `ops` because no operation is needed.

2. **Function `recursive_maximize_sum`**:
   - The base case where the sum of the subarray is less than or equal to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)` is handled correctly.
   - The recursive case where the sum is greater than `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)` also seems correct. It splits the subarray at the position of the maximum element and recursively maximizes the sum on both sides.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function correctly initializes the operations list and calls the recursive function to maximize the sum.
   - It returns the correct values: the sum of the array and the number of operations.

4. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function reads the input, calls `func_2`, and prints the results correctly.

### Optimizing `func_1`

To fix the issue in `func_1`, we can add a simple check before appending the operation to `ops`:

```python
def func_1(a, l, r, ops):
    if l == r:
        if a[l] != 0:
            ops.append((l, l))
            a[l] = 0
        return
    func_1(a, l + 1, r, ops)
    if a[l] != r - l + 1:
        ops.append((l, r))
        for i in range(l, r + 1):
            a[i] = r - l + 1
        func_1(a, l + 1, r, ops)
    else:
        # No operation needed if a[l] is already r - l + 1
        pass
```

With this optimization, the function will not append unnecessary operations, but the overall correctness of the program remains unaffected.

### Conclusion

The provided program is almost correct, and the minor issue in `func_1` can be fixed by adding a simple check. The program correctly maximizes the sum of the array and constructs the sequence of operations.
