Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined as `for (l, r) in ops:`. This means the loop iterates over each tuple `(l, r)` in the list `ops`.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ops` is a non-empty list.

3. **Understand what happens in each iteration**:
   - In each iteration, the loop takes a tuple `(l, r)` from the list `ops`.
   - After processing the tuple `(l, r)`, the list `ops` is modified to remove the processed tuple.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop removes the processed tuple from `ops`, the list `ops` will have one fewer element.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `ops` must still contain at least one tuple.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `ops` is a non-empty list with one fewer tuple than it had at the end of the previous iteration.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`ops` is a non-empty list**
