Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Specifically, the functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `recursive_maximize_sum` do not handle all edge cases and do not guarantee the maximization of the sum of the array elements as required.

One issue is in the `func_1` function, where it attempts to set the subarray from `l` to `r` to the value `r - l + 1`. However, this function does not correctly update the array or record operations for all necessary cases. For example, consider the input `[1, 100, 2, 1]`. The function should set the entire array to the maximum possible value, but it fails to do so correctly.

Another issue is in the `recursive_maximize_sum` function. This function tries to maximize the sum by setting segments of the array to their maximum possible values, but it does not handle all cases where the current segment's sum is less than or equal to the product of its length and the next integer. For instance, in the input `[1, 100, 2, 1]`, the function should set the entire array to 4, but it only partially sets the array, leading to an incorrect final sum.

Given these issues, the program does not guarantee the correct maximization of the array sum for all inputs, hence it is incorrect.
