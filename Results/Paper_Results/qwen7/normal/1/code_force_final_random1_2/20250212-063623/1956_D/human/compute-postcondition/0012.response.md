Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but uses predefined variables n (an integer between 1 and 18) and a (a list of n integers where each integer is between 0 and 10^7). It returns a value based on the analysis of the list a.**

This means the function `func_3` does not take any parameters when called directly but relies on two predefined variables: `n`, which is an integer between 1 and 18, and `a`, which is a list containing `n` integers, each ranging from 0 to 10^7. The function then processes this list and returns a value based on the analysis of the list `a`.
