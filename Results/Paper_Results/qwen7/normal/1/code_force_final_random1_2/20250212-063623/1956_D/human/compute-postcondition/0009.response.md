Given the initial state where `ops` is a non-empty list, we need to determine the values of `l` and `r` to understand what will be printed by the statement `print(l + 1, r + 1)`.

However, the initial state does not provide specific values for `l` and `r`. Typically, such variables would be defined within the context of the code that manipulates the `ops` list. Since no specific values or definitions for `l` and `r` are provided, we cannot determine their exact values.

Therefore, based on the given information, we can only describe the expression that will be printed:

Output: **(l + 1, r + 1)**
