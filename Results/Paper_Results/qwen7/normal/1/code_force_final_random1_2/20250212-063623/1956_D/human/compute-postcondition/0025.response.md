Output State: **`s` is the sum of elements in list `a` from index `l` to index `r` inclusive, and `s` is greater than `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`, `pos` is the position of `mx` in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]` plus `l`, and `pos` is decreased by 1, and the function `recursive_maximize_sum(pos + 1, r)` is called.**

This means that the function `recursive_maximize_sum` is called with the arguments `pos + 1` and `r`. The values of `s`, `mx`, and `pos` remain unchanged from their previous values, but the function call itself is now part of the current state.
