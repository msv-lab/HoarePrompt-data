Given the initial state that `ops` is a non-empty list, we need to determine the values of `l` and `r` to understand what will be printed by the statement `print(l + 1, r + 1)`.

However, the initial state does not provide specific values for `l` and `r`. Since `l` and `r` are not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine their exact values. Therefore, we can only describe them in terms of their relationship to the list `ops`.

For the sake of clarity, let's assume typical indexing behavior where `l` and `r` are indices into the list `ops`. Without loss of generality, let's say `l` and `r` are valid indices of the list `ops`.

Output: **(l + 1, r + 1)** (where `l` and `r` are indices into the non-empty list `ops`)
