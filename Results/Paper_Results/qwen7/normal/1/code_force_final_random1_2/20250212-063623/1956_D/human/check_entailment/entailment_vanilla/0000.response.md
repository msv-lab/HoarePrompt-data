Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function recursively ensures that all elements in the subarray from `l` to `r` are set to the same value, specifically `r - l + 1`.
   - The base case checks if `l == r`. If true, it sets `a[l]` to 0 if it's not already 0 and appends `(l, l)` to `ops`.
   - Otherwise, it calls itself recursively for the subarray `[l+1, r]` and then ensures that all elements in the current subarray `[l, r]` are set to `r - l + 1`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function initializes the operations list `ops` and calls `recursive_maximize_sum(0, n - 1)` to start the process.
   - It returns the sum of the array `a` and the number of operations performed.

3. **Function `recursive_maximize_sum`**:
   - This function aims to maximize the sum of the subarray from `l` to `r`.
   - It calculates the sum of the subarray and compares it with `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`.
     - If the sum is less than or equal to this value, it calls `func_1` to set all elements in the subarray to `r - l + 1`.
     - Otherwise, it finds the maximum element in the subarray and recursively processes the subarrays before and after this maximum element.

4. **Function `func_3`**:
   - Reads the input values for `n` and the array `a`.
   - Calls `func_2` to get the maximum sum and number of operations.
   - Prints the sum and number of operations.
   - Prints each operation in the format required.

### Correctness Check

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - Ensures that the subarray is set to the correct value.
   - Base case correctly handles single-element subarrays.

2. **Function `recursive_maximize_sum`**:
   - The logic for setting the subarray to `r - l + 1` when the sum is less than or equal to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)` is sound.
   - The recursive approach to handle the subarrays before and after the maximum element is also correct.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - Correctly initializes and uses the operations list.
   - Returns the correct values.

4. **Function `func_3`**:
   - Correctly reads input and prints output.

Given that each function logically performs its intended task and there are no apparent logical errors or bugs, the program appears to be correct.

### Conclusion

**Correctness: True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to maximize the sum of the array elements using the allowed operations.
