You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nene gave you an array of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of length n .

You can perform the following operation no more than 5\cdot 10^5 times
(possibly zero):

  * Choose two integers l and r such that 1 \le l \le r \le n , compute x as \operatorname{MEX}(\\{a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r\\}) , and simultaneously set a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, \ldots, a_r:=x . 

Here, \operatorname{MEX} of a set of integers \\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k\\} is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer m which does not occur in the set
c .

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a . Find the
maximum sum and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.
Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations in this
sequence, you only should use no more than 5\cdot 10^5 operations in your
solution.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 18 ) — the length of the
array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n (0\leq a_i \leq 10^7 )
— the array a .

Output

In the first line, output two integers s and m (0\le m\le 5\cdot 10^5 ) — the
maximum sum of elements of the array a and the number of operations in your
solution.

In the i -th of the following m lines, output two integers l and r (1 \le l
\le r \le n ), representing the parameters of the i -th operation.

It can be shown that the maximum sum of elements of the array a can always be
obtained in no more than 5 \cdot 10^5 operations.

Note

In the first example, after the operation with l=1 and r=2 the array a becomes
equal to [2,2] . It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum
of the elements of a , so the answer is 4 .

In the second example, the initial sum of elements is 13 which can be shown to
be the largest.

In the third example, the array a changes as follows:

  * after the first operation (l=3 , r=3 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,0,1] ; 
  * after the second operation (l=3 , r=4 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,2,2] . 

It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum of the elements
of a , so the answer is 105 .

#Overall this is what the function does:The function modifies a list of non-negative integers `a` based on the indices `l` and `r`.

        #This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be `r + 1` because the loop increments `i` from `l` to `r`. Additionally, every element in the sublist from index `l` to index `r` in list `a` will be set to `r - l + 1` due to the assignment statement inside the loop. The sum `s` remains unchanged as no operations were performed on it within the loop, and the condition `l <= r` must still hold true for the loop to complete all iterations.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `recursive_maximize_sum` takes two parameters, `l` and `r`, which define a sublist of a given list `a`. It aims to maximize the sum of the elements in this sublist by either setting all elements to the maximum value in the sublist or recursively processing the left and right parts of the sublist based on certain conditions. The function does not return a value but modifies the original list `a` and appends operations to the `ops` list. After the function concludes, the sublist defined by `l` and `r` will have either all elements set to the maximum value in the sublist or the sum of the sublist will be maximized according to the given conditions.

        print(l + 1, r + 1)
        
    #State: Output State: `ops` is an empty list.
    #
    #Natural Language Explanation: Given that the loop continues to execute as long as `ops` is a non-empty list, and since `ops` remains a non-empty list even after three iterations, it implies that the condition for the loop to continue (i.e., `ops` being non-empty) persists. However, the problem does not provide any information indicating that `ops` will become empty during or after the loop's execution. Therefore, based on the given information and without any additional conditions that could make `ops` empty, we can conclude that `ops` remains a non-empty list after all iterations of the loop have finished. But since the question asks for the state after all iterations and the only change mentioned is in the loop's continuation condition, and no operation inside the loop changes `ops` to an empty list, the most logical conclusion is that `ops` remains non-empty. However, if we strictly follow the instruction to describe the final state based on the given information and assuming the loop eventually stops, the only state that fits the description provided is when `ops` becomes empty, which means the loop has completed its iterations and there are no further operations to perform. Thus, `ops` is an empty list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then calls another function `func_2` with `a` as input, receiving three values `s`, `m`, and `ops`. It prints `s` and `m`, and iterates over `ops` to print pairs of indices. After the loop, `ops` is guaranteed to be an empty list.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Specifically, the functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `recursive_maximize_sum` do not handle all edge cases and do not guarantee the maximization of the sum of the array elements as required.

One issue is in the `func_1` function, where it attempts to set the subarray from `l` to `r` to the value `r - l + 1`. However, this function does not correctly update the array or record operations for all necessary cases. For example, consider the input `[1, 100, 2, 1]`. The function should set the entire array to the maximum possible value, but it fails to do so correctly.

Another issue is in the `recursive_maximize_sum` function. This function tries to maximize the sum by setting segments of the array to their maximum possible values, but it does not handle all cases where the current segment's sum is less than or equal to the product of its length and the next integer. For instance, in the input `[1, 100, 2, 1]`, the function should set the entire array to 4, but it only partially sets the array, leading to an incorrect final sum.

Given these issues, the program does not guarantee the correct maximization of the array sum for all inputs, hence it is incorrect.
