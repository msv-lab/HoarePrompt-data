Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `l` and `r`, where `l` is a list of non-negative integers of length n (1 <= n <= 18) and each element in the list is between 0 and 10^7 inclusive. The function returns the maximum possible sum that can be achieved by performing a series of operations specified in the `ops` list on the elements of `l`.**

Note: The actual operations specified in `ops` are not detailed here, but the function aims to maximize the sum of elements in `l` through these operations.
