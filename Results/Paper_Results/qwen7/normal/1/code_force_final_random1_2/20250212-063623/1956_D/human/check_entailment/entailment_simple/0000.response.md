Reasoning:  
Let's analyze the program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function is designed to set a segment of the array `a` to a specific value, ensuring the segment's sum is maximized. It recursively processes segments of the array, setting them to the smallest possible value that maximizes the sum.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function initializes the operations list `ops` and calls `recursive_maximize_sum` to process the entire array. It then returns the sum of the array and the number of operations performed.

3. **Function `recursive_maximize_sum`**: This function is the core logic that processes segments of the array to maximize their sum. It uses a divide-and-conquer approach to ensure each segment is set to the optimal value. Specifically, if the sum of the current segment is less than or equal to the product of the segment's length and the segment's length, it sets the entire segment to the segment's length. Otherwise, it finds the maximum value in the segment and recursively processes the segments before and after this maximum value.

4. **Function `func_3`**: This function reads the input, calls `func_2` to process the array, and prints the result along with the sequence of operations.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in these functions, the program correctly implements the solution strategy. Hereâ€™s why:

- **Base Case Handling**: The base case in `func_1` handles individual elements, ensuring they are set to 0 if necessary.
- **Recursive Processing**: `recursive_maximize_sum` ensures that each segment of the array is processed optimally to maximize the sum.
- **Correct Sum Calculation**: `func_2` correctly calculates the sum of the array and the number of operations.
- **Sequence of Operations**: The operations are stored in `ops` and printed correctly.

The provided annotated program shows that the logic is sound and aligns with the problem requirements. There are no apparent errors in the implementation that would lead to incorrect results.

Correctness: **True**
