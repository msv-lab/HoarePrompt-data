Output State: **`s` is an input string with at least one character, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is 2, `ans` is `ss` + `ss`, `ss` is the next character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the difference between the ASCII value of `ss` and the ASCII value of 'a'.**

Explanation: The code `ans += ss` appends the value of `ss` to the end of the string `ans`. Initially, `ans` was set to `ss`, so now it becomes `ss + ss`. The other variables (`s`, `cur`, `cnt`, `ss`, and `cur_ss`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
