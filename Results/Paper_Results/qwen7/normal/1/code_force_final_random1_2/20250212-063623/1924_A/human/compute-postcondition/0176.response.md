Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`, which is used in the `range(k)` function.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: Since the loop is defined as `for i in range(k)`, the initial value of `i` should be 0, and it will increment by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `k`.

3. **Check the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. Therefore, the initial value of `i` should be 0, and `k` must be a positive integer.

4. **List the Adjusted States**: Based on the above analysis, the only variables that need adjustment are `i` and `k`.

Given the initial states:
- All characters of the string `s` have been processed.
- `cur` is reset to 0.
- `cnt` is the total number of times `cur` reached \(2^k - 1\).
- `ans` is the original string `s` concatenated with itself three times.
- `tmp` is an empty string.

We need to adjust the states of `i` and `k` for the loop to execute.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `k` must be a positive integer**
