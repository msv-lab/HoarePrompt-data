Output State: **`cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`, `cur` is equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, `cnt` is `cnt + 1`**.

Explanation: The variable `cnt` is incremented by 1. The values of `cur_ss` and `cur` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `cur_ss` is still `ord(ss) - ord('a')`, `cur` is still equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, and `cnt` is now `cnt + 1`.
