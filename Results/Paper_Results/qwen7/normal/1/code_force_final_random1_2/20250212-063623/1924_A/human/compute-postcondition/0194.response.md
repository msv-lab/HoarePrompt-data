Output State: **All characters of the string `s` have been processed, `cur` is reset to 0, `cnt` is the total number of times `cur` reached \(2^k - 1\), `ans` is the original string `s` concatenated with itself three times, `tmp` is an empty string, and `ans` is appended with `tmp`.**

Explanation: The line `ans += tmp` appends the value of `tmp` to `ans`. Since `tmp` is an empty string (`""`), appending it to `ans` does not change the value of `ans`. Therefore, `ans` remains as the original string `s` concatenated with itself three times. All other variables remain unchanged.
