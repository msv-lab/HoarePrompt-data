Postcondition: `tmp` is 'a', `cur` is reset to 0, `cnt` is the total number of times `cur` reached `(1 << k) - 1`, `ans` is a string containing all characters of `s` repeated according to the conditions specified in the loop, and `i` is 1. If the condition `cur & 1 << i == 0` is true, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
