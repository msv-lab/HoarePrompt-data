Output State: **`tmp` is an empty string, `cur` is reset to 0, `cnt` is the total number of times `cur` reached `(1 << k) - 1`, and `ans` is a string containing all characters of `s` repeated according to the conditions specified in the loop. Additionally, `cnt` is less than `n`.**

Explanation: The line `tmp = ''` initializes an empty string `tmp`. The values of `cur`, `cnt`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their previous states. Therefore, `cur` is reset to 0, `cnt` is the total number of times `cur` reached `(1 << k) - 1`, and `ans` is a string containing all characters of `s` repeated according to the conditions specified in the loop, with the condition that `cnt` is less than `n`.
