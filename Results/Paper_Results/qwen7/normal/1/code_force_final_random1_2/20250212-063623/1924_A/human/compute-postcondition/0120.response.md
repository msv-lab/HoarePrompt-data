Postcondition: **`tmp` is 'd', `cur` remains 0, `cnt` remains equal to the length of `s`, `ans` remains a string containing every character of `s` repeated three times consecutively, `cur_ss` remains representing the difference between the ASCII value of each character in `s` and the ASCII value of 'a', `i` becomes 4 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
