Postcondition: `s` is a non-empty string; `cur_ss` is the difference between the ASCII value of the first character of `s` and the ASCII value of 'a'; if `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` is incremented by 1, `cur` is reset to 0, and `ans` is updated by adding the value of `ss` to its original value; otherwise, the values of `cnt`, `cur`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
