Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is the input string, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is equal to the length of `s`, `ans` is a string containing every character of `s` repeated three times consecutively, `cur_ss` resets to 0 whenever `cur` reaches \((1 << k) - 1\)**.

Explanation: The code `s = input()` reads an input string from the user and assigns it to the variable `s`. All other variables (`n`, `k`, `m`, `cur`, `cnt`, `ans`, `cur_ss`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `cnt` is set to the length of the new string `s`.
