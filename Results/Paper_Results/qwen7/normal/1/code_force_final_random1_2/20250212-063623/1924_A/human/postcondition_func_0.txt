The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers \( t \), \( n \), \( k \), and \( m \), and a string \( s \). For each test case, it checks if the string \( s \) contains at least \( n \) unique substrings of length \( k \). If so, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO" followed by a modified version of \( s \) that includes additional 'a' characters to meet the requirement of \( n \) unique substrings. The function ultimately prints the result for each test case.
