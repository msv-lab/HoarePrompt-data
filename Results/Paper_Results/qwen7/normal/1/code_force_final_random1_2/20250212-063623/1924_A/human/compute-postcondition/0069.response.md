Output State: **`i` is 5 (if `i` was 4 before), `cur` is 0, `cnt` is the same, `ans` is the same, `s` is fully processed, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n, k, m = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, and `m`. The values of `i`, `cur`, `cnt`, `ans`, and `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` retains its value of 5 (if it was 4 before), `cur` remains 0, `cnt` and `ans` stay the same, and `s` is fully processed. The values of `n`, `k`, and `m` are the integers input by the user.
