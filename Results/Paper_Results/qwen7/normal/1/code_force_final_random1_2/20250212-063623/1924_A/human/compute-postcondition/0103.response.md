Postcondition: **`s` is an input string with at least one character, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is 3, `ans` is `ss` + `ss` + `ss`, `ss` is the next character in the string `s` after the previous `ss`, `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a') + 1`.** 

Explanation: If the condition `cur == (1 << k) - 1` is true, then `cur` is set to 0, `cnt` is set to 3, and `ans` is updated to `ss` + `ss` + `ss`. If the condition is false, the values of `cur`, `cnt`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their original values, which are `cur` as 0, `cnt` as 2, and `ans` as `ss` + `ss`. Since there is no else part, the postcondition directly follows from the if part.
