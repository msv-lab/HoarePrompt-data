Output State: **`tmp` is 'c', `cur` is reset to 0, `cnt` is the total number of times `cur` reached `(1 << k) - 1`, `ans` is a string containing all characters of `s` repeated according to the conditions specified in the loop, `i` is 3 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. In this case, it breaks out of the loop or conditional block that was being executed. Since no variables are modified by the `break` statement itself, their previous states remain unchanged.
