Output State: **`s` is an input string with at least one character, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is 1, `ans` is `ss`, `ss` is the next character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the difference between the ASCII value of `ss` and the ASCII value of 'a'**.

The code calculates the difference between the ASCII value of `ss` (the next character in the string `s`) and the ASCII value of 'a', and assigns this difference to the variable `cur_ss`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
