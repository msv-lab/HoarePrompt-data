Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is 1, `ans` remains unchanged, `cur_ss` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code sets `cur` to 0. Since `cur` was previously incremented by `1 << cur_ss` under certain conditions, setting it to 0 resets its value. The other variables (`cnt`, `ans`, and `cur_ss`) remain unchanged as they were not affected by the assignment operation.
