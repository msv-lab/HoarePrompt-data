Output State: **`cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`, `cur` is `(1 << k) - 1`, `cnt` is `cnt + 1`, and `ans` is `ss`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `cur_ss` to `ord(ss) - ord('a')`. The other variables (`cur`, `cnt`, and `ans`) remain unchanged from their previous states. Therefore, the updated state includes the new value for `cur_ss` and retains the original values for `cur`, `cnt`, and `ans`.
