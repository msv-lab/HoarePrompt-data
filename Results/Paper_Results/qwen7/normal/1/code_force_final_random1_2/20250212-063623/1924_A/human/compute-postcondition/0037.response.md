Output State: **`cur` is 0, `cnt` is 1, `ans` is `ss`, and `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`**.

Explanation: The code sets `cur` to 0. This changes the value of `cur`. The value of `cnt` was incremented by 1 previously, so it is now `cnt + 1`, which is 1. The values of `ans` and `cur_ss` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `ans` is still `ss`, and `cur_ss` is still `ord(ss) - ord('a')`.
