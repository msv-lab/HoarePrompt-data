Based on the initial state described:

- `s` is a string whose characters have been processed.
- `cur` is reset to 0.
- `cnt` is the total number of times `cur` reached \((1 << k) - 1\).
- `ans` is a string containing all characters of `s` repeated according to certain conditions.
- `cnt` is less than `n`.

The `print('NO')` statement directly prints the string 'NO'.

Output: **NO**
