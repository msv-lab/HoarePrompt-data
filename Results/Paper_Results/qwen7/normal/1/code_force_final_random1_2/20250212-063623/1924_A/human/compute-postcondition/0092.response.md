Postcondition: `s` is an input string with at least one character, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is 2, `ans` is `ss` + `ss`, `ss` is the next character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the difference between the ASCII value of `ss` and the ASCII value of 'a'. If the condition `cur == (1 << k) - 1` is true, then `cur` remains 0, `cnt` is 2, `ans` is `ss` + `ss`.
