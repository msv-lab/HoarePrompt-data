Based on the initial state provided:

- `cur` is 0
- `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`
- `ans` is a string containing every character of `s` repeated three times consecutively
- `cur_ss` represents the difference between the ASCII value of each character in `s` and the ASCII value of 'a', and it resets to 0 whenever `cur` reaches \((1 << k) - 1\)

The `print('YES')` statement will simply print the string 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
