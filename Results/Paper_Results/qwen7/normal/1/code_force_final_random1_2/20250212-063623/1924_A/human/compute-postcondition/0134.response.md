Output State: **`cnt` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is the input string, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is equal to the length of `s`, `ans` is a string containing every character of `s` repeated three times consecutively, `cur_ss` resets to 0 whenever `cur` reaches \((1 << k) - 1\)**.

Explanation: The line `cnt = 0` sets the variable `cnt` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
