Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**:
   - The program correctly parses the input dimensions \( n \) and \( m \).
   - It initializes dictionaries for players and goals.
   - It correctly identifies the initial positions of the Quaffle and goals.
   - It correctly identifies the initial positions of players.

2. **Movement and Action Handling**:
   - The program correctly updates the positions of players and the Quaffle based on the given movements.
   - It handles the elimination of players when they collide with a Bludger.
   - It correctly updates the Quaffle's position when a player catches or throws it.
   - It checks if a player has scored and updates the score accordingly.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the correct events in the correct order.
   - It prints the final score at the end of the game.

4. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function correctly computes the new position of an entity based on the direction of movement.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to handle all aspects of the problem correctly. It correctly processes the input, updates the state of the game, and produces the correct output.

Correctness: **True**
