Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `bOnes` is 0, `aOnes` is 0, `newk` is k // 2.**

The code `newk = k // 2` assigns the value of `k` divided by 2 using integer division to the variable `newk`. Since the initial value of `k` is not specified, we only know that `newk` is now `k // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
