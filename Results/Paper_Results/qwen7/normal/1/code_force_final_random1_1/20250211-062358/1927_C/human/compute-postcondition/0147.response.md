Output State: **`t` is `n + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers split from the input, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input using `map(int, input().split())`**.

Explanation: The code reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer using `map(int, ...)`. These integers are then collected into a list `b`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial state.
