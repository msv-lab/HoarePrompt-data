Postcondition: `bOnes` is 1 if `i` is in both lists `a` and `b`, and the number of 1s in `a` is less than or equal to the number of 1s in `b`; otherwise, `bOnes` is 2. If `i` is in list `a`, `bOnes` is incremented by 1 if the number of 1s in `a` is less than or equal to the number of 1s in `b`. If `i` is not in list `a`, `bOnes` remains unchanged.
