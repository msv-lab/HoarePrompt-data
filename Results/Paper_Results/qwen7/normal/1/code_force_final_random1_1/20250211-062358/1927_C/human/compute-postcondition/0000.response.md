Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable `t` is used in the loop condition `t in range(int(input()))`.
   - The loop will iterate as long as `t` is a positive integer within the specified range (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).

2. **Determine the Initial State:**
   - The initial state before the loop starts is given as `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.

3. **Adjust the State for the Loop to Execute:**
   - Since the loop will run based on the value of `t`, we need to ensure that `t` is within the valid range for the loop to execute.
   - We also need to consider that the loop will read input for each `t`, but the initial state only specifies the range of `t`.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `t` itself, ensuring it is within the specified range.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
