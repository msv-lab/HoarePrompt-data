Postcondition: `i` is 1, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `bOnes` is either 0 or 1, `aOnes` is either 0 or 1, `newk` must be greater than or equal to 1, and the current value of `i` is in both `a` and `b`. Additionally, if `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is 1; otherwise, `bOnes` is 1.
