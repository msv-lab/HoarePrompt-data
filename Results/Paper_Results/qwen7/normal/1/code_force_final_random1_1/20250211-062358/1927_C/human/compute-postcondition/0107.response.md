To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the loop head condition and ensure that the condition `i <= k` holds true.

Given the loop head:
```python
while i <= k:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

We need to ensure that `i` is less than or equal to `k` for the loop to continue executing. From the state at the end of the previous iteration, we know:
- `i` is 2
- `bOnes` is either 0 or 1
- `k` must be at least 1

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must still be less than or equal to `k`. Since `i` is currently 2, `k` must be at least 3 (because `k` must be at least 1 and `i` needs to be less than or equal to `k`).

No other states need to be adjusted because the loop condition only depends on `i` and `k`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `k` must be at least 3.

State: **`i` is 2, `bOnes` is either 0 or 1, `k` must be at least 3**
