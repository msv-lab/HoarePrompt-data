Postcondition: `i` is 3, `bOnes` is either 0, 1, or 2, `aOnes` is either 1 (if `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`), or `bOnes` (if `aOnes` is not less than `bOnes`), `k` must be greater than or equal to 3. If `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `i`, `bOnes`, `aOnes`, and `k` retain their original values. Otherwise, `i`, `bOnes`, `aOnes`, and `k` also retain their original values.
