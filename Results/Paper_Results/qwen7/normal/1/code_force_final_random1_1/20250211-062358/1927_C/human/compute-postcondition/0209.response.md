Postcondition: **`bOnes` will be the total count of numbers that are present in both lists `a` and `b` and satisfy the condition where the number of occurrences of the number in `a` is less than or equal to the number of occurrences in `b`. The value of `t` remains `n + 1`, `n` is the input integer, `m` is the input integer, `k` is the input integer and must be at least 1, `a` is a list of integers split from the input, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input using `map(int, input().split())`, `aOnes` remains 0, `newk` is `k // 2`, and `i` is `k + 1`. The condition `(aOnes == newk and bOnes == newk)` is false.**
