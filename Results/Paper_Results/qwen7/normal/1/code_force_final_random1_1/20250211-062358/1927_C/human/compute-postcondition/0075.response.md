Output State: **`bOnes` is 0, `i` is `k + 1`, `t` is `t + 1`, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `bOnes` is the total count of numbers that are present in both `a` and `b` up to `k`, `aOnes` is 0, `newk` is `k // 2`, `a` is now a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values of integers split from the input.**

Explanation: The code `newk = k // 2` simply assigns the value of `k // 2` to `newk`. It does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the values of `bOnes`, `i`, `t`, `b`, `bOnes`, `aOnes`, `a`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged.
