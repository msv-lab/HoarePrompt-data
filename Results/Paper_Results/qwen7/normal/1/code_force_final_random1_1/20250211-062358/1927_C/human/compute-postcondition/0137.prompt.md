Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `bOnes` is 0, `i` is 1, `t` is `t + 1`, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `bOnes` is the total count of numbers that are present in both `a` and `b` up to `k`, `aOnes` is 0, `newk` is `k // 2`, `a` is now a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values of integers split from the input.
Code of the loop:
while i <= k:
    if i in a and i in b:
        if aOnes < bOnes:
            aOnes += 1
        else:
            bOnes += 1
    elif i in a and aOnes <= newk:
        aOnes += 1
    elif i in b and bOnes <= newk:
        bOnes += 1
    else:
        break
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 2, `bOnes` is either 0 or 1, `k` must be at least 1, and the following conditions hold: - If `i` is in both lists `a` and `b`, then `aOnes` is incremented by 1 if it is less than `bOnes`, otherwise `aOnes` is greater than or equal to `bOnes`. - If `i` is not in both lists `a` and `b`, then `aOnes` is greater than `newk`. If `i` is in `b` and `bOnes` is less than or equal to `newk`, then `bOnes` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `bOnes` remains 0, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `i` is 3, `bOnes` is either 0, 1, or 2, `aOnes` is either 1 (if `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`), or `bOnes` (if `aOnes` is not less than `bOnes`), `k` must be at least 3, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if `bOnes` is not equal to 1 or 2.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `i` is 4, `bOnes` is either 0, 1, or 2, `aOnes` is either `bOnes + 1` (if `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`), or `bOnes` (if `aOnes` is not less than `bOnes`), and `k` must be greater than or equal to 3.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
