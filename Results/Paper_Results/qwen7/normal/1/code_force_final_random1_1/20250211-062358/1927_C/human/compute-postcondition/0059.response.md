Postcondition: `i` is 3, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `bOnes` is either 0 or 1 (and incremented by 1 if `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`), `aOnes` is either 1 or 2, `k` must be greater than or equal to 4. If `i` is found in both `a` and `b`, `bOnes` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `bOnes` remains unchanged and `aOnes` is set to 2.
