Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `k + 1`
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces
- `bOnes` is the total count of numbers that are present in both `a` and `b` up to `k`
- `aOnes` is the total count of numbers present in `a` up to `k` but not in `b` or present in `b` with a count less than or equal to `bOnes`
- `newk` is `k // 2`
- The condition `(aOnes == newk and bOnes == newk)` is true

The print statement is:
```python
print('yes')
```

Given the condition `(aOnes == newk and bOnes == newk)` is true, it confirms that the values of `aOnes` and `bOnes` match `newk`.

The print statement simply outputs the string `'yes'`.

Output: **yes**
