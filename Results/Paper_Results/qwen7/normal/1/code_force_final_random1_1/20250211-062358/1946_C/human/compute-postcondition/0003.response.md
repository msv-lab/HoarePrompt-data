Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**.

Explanation: The function `solve()` has been called, but since no specific actions or changes to variables within `solve()` are provided, the only information we know is that `t` remains an integer within the specified range. No other variables are mentioned or modified, so their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
