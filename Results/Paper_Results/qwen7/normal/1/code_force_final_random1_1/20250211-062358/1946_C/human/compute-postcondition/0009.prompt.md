You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each set of input data, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5. The subsequent n - 1 lines contain pairs of integers v and u such that 1 ≤ v, u ≤ n, representing the edges of the tree.
def func_1():
    for _ in range(int(sys.stdin.readline())):
        solve()
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t < 10^4\).
    #
    #Explanation: Given that `t` starts within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and with each iteration of the loop, `t` is decremented by 1, after all iterations of the loop, `t` will be less than 0 but since `t` cannot be negative, it will be 0. Therefore, after the loop executes all its iterations, `t` will be 0.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a tree structure defined by the user through predefined input data. It returns information about the tree, specifically focusing on a set of nodes and their connections, adhering to the constraints where t (the number of test cases) ranges from 1 to 10^4, and for each test case, n (the number of nodes) and k (some specific value related to the nodes) range from 1 to 10^5, with n-1 edges connecting these nodes.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
