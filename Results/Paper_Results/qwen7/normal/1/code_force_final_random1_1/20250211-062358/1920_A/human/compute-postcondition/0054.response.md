Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n-1`, `t` will be the last integer from the input, `v` will be the second last integer from the input, `num` will be a list containing all integers from the inputs where `t` was 3, `start` will be the smallest integer among all `v` where `t` was 1, and `end` will be the largest integer among all `v` where `t` was 2.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations:
- The variable `i` will hold the value `n-1`.
- The variables `t` and `v` will contain the values from the last input pair.
- The list `num` will contain all the `v` values for which `t` was 3.
- The variable `start` will hold the minimum value of all `v` for which `t` was 1.
- The variable `end` will hold the maximum value of all `v` for which `t` was 2.
