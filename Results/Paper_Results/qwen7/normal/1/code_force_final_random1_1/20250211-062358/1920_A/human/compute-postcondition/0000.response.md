Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and `t` is an integer in the set {1, 2, 3}, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^9. Additionally, there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, and all constraints are unique; `n` is updated to the integer input value.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. Since the input is an integer, the range constraints for `n` (2 <= n <= 100) are preserved, and the other variables (`t` and `x`) remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
