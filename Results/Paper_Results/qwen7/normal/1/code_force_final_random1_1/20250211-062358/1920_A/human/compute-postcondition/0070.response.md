Output State: **`num` is an empty list, `i` is the first element of `num` (which is currently an empty list)**.

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since there is no loop context provided in the initial state or the code snippet, the variables `num` and `i` remain unchanged. The `i` is still the first element of `num`, which is an empty list, and `num` itself remains an empty list.
