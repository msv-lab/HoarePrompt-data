Postcondition: `num` is an empty list, `i` is the first element of `num` (which is currently an empty list). In both cases (whether `i < start or i > end` or not), `num` remains an empty list and `i` remains as the first element of `num`, which is an empty list, and there is no change in the value of `count_num`.
