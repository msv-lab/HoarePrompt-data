Output State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, `num` will be an empty list, `i` will be the first element of `num` (which is still an empty list), `count_num` will be the total number of elements in `num` that satisfy the condition `i < start or i > end`.**

Explanation: The loop iterates over each element in the list `num`. For each element `i`, it checks if `i` is outside the range defined by `start` and `end`. If `i` is within the range, the loop does nothing. However, if `i` is outside the range, the loop continues to the next iteration without incrementing `count_num`. Since `num` is initially an empty list and no elements are added to it during the loop (because the loop's body does not add any elements to `num`), `num` remains an empty list. Therefore, `count_num` will also remain 0 unless there were elements in `num` that did not meet the conditions of being less than `start` or greater than `end`, but since `num` is empty, `count_num` stays at 0.
