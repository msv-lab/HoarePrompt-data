Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `t` is the first integer from the input, `v` is the second integer from the input, `num` is a list containing the second integer from the input, `start` is equal to `v`, and `end` is equal to `v`. This remains unchanged regardless of whether the condition `start < v` is true or false.**
