Output State: **`num` is an empty list, `i` is the first element of `num` (which is currently an empty list), `count_num` is 1.**

Explanation: The code increments `count_num` by 1. Initially, `count_num` is not specified, but since no initial value is given and it is implied to start from 0, it becomes 1 after the increment. The values of `num` and `i` remain unchanged.
