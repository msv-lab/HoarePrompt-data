Postcondition: `num` is an empty list, `i` is the first element of `num` (which is currently an empty list). In both cases (whether `i < start or i > end` or not), the value of `i` remains as the first element of `num`, and `num` remains an empty list. Additionally, `count_num` is 1 if the else part is executed.
