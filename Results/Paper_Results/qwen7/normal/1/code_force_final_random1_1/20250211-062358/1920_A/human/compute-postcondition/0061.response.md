Output State: **`num` is an empty list, `i` is the first element of `num` (which is currently an empty list), and `count_num` is 1.**

Explanation: The initial state indicates that `num` is an empty list, `i` is the first element of `num` (which is currently an empty list), and the condition `i < start or i > end` is false. The code `count_num += 1` increments the value of `count_num` by 1. Since `count_num` was initially 0 (implied by the condition being false), it becomes 1 after the increment. All other variables remain unchanged.
