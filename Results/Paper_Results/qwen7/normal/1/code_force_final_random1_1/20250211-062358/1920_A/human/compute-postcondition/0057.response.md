Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the object `num`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i` and `num`**:
   - The loop will iterate over each element in the list `num`.
   - Therefore, `i` will take on each value in `num` during the iterations.

3. **Initial state of `num`**:
   - We know that after the loop completes, `num` will contain all integers `v` from each iteration where `t` was 3.
   - However, before the loop starts, `num` is an empty list because no elements have been added yet.

4. **Initial state of `i`**:
   - Since `i` takes on each value in `num` during the iterations, before the loop starts, `i` should be set to the first element of `num` (which is currently an empty list).

5. **Other variables**:
   - `t`, `v`, `start`, `end`, and `count_num` are not part of the loop head, so their values do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the initial state of `num` and `i`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`num` is an empty list, `i` is the first element of `num` (which is currently an empty list)**
