The function `func_4` accepts two parameters: `string` (a string consisting of printable ASCII characters) and `substring` (a string consisting of printable ASCII characters with a length less than or equal to the length of `string`). It returns a list containing all the starting positions in `string` where `substring` was found, in the order they were found, and an integer representing the position of the last occurrence of `substring` in `string`, or -1 if `substring` is not found.
