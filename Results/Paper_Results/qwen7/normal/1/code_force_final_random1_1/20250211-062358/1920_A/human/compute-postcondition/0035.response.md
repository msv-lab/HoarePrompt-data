Output State: **`i` is 1, `t` is the first integer from the input, `v` is the second integer from the input, `num` is a list containing the second integer from the input, `end` is equal to `v`, and `start` is equal to `v`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `v` to `end`. Since `v` was already defined as the second integer from the input, `end` now holds the same value. The other variables (`i`, `t`, `v`, `num`, and `start`) remain unchanged.
