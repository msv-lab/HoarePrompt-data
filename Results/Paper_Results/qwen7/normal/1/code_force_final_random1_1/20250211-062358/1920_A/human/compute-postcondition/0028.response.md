Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `t` is 3
   - `v` is an integer from the input
   - `num` is a list containing the value of `v`

3. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.
   - Since `i` is currently 0, the loop will execute again if `n > 0`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will become 1.
   - `n` remains unchanged unless specified otherwise, but since no change is mentioned, `n` stays the same.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `i` is now 1.
   - `t` remains 3.
   - `v` remains an integer from the input.
   - `num` remains a list containing the value of `v`.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `t` is 3, `v` is an integer from the input, `num` is a list containing the value of `v`**.
