t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and for each test case, there are exactly n lines describing constraints. Each constraint is represented by two integers a and x where a is either 1, 2, or 3, and x is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9. Additionally, there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, and no two constraints are the same.
