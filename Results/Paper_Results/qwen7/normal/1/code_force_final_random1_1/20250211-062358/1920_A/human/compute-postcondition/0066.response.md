Output State: **`num` is an empty list, `i` is the first element of `num` (which is currently an empty list), `count_num` is 1.**

Explanation: The initial state shows that `num` is an empty list and `i` is the first element of `num` (which is currently an empty list). The code `count_num += 1` increments the value of `count_num` by 1. Since `count_num` was initially not specified, we assume it started at 0. After executing the code, `count_num` becomes 1. The states of `num` and `i` remain unchanged.
