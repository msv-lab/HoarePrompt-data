Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is an integer such that `i` (which is `n + 1`) is within the range `1` to `n-1`, and `array2` now contains an additional element which is `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` if `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]` is less than `b / a`. If `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]` is not less than `b / a`, `array2` remains unchanged.**

This means that the value of `i` and `n` remain the same as before, and `array2` has been updated by appending a new element based on the condition provided.
