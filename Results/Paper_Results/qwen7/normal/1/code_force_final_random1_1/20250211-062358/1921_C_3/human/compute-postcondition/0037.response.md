Output State: **`feat` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is `n + 1`, `test_cases` must be greater than `n + 1`, `f` is the second element of `feat`, `a` is the third element of `feat`, `b` is the last element of `feat`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from input, `array2` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list `array2`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
