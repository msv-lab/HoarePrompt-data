Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be equal to `n`, and `array2` will contain all elements added during each iteration where the condition `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a` was satisfied.**

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be set to the value of `n`, indicating that the loop has processed all elements up to `n-1`. The list `array2` will include all the computed values `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` for each `i` from 1 to `n-1` where the difference between consecutive elements in `arr` is less than `b / a`.
