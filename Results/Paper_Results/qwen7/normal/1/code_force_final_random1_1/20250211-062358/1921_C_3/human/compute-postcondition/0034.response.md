Output State: **`feat` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is the first element of `feat`, `test_cases` must be greater than `n + 1`, `f` is the second element of `feat`, `a` is the third element of `feat`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the third element of the list `feat` to the variable `a`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `a` now holds the value of `feat[2]`, while `feat`, `i`, `n`, `test_cases`, and `f` retain their original values.
