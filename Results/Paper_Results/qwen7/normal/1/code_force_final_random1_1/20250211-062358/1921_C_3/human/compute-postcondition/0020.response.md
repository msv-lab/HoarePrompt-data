Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 4; array2` is updated with the value `(arr[5] - arr[4]) * a`**

Explanation: The code `array2.append((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a)` updates the `array2` by appending a new element. This element is calculated as `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`. Given that `i` is initially 5, the expression simplifies to `(arr[5] - arr[4]) * a`. However, since `i` is decremented by 1 due to the indexing in the expression, the effective value of `i` used in the calculation becomes 4. Therefore, `i` is updated to 4, while the condition for `n` remains unchanged. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 4 also remains valid.
