Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 3, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer, `array2` is a list containing two elements where the first element is `(arr[3] - arr[2]) * a` and the second element is `(arr[4] - arr[3]) * a`.**

Explanation: The code appends a new element to `array2`. This new element is calculated as `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`, where `i` is 4. So, the new element added to `array2` is `(arr[4] - arr[3]) * a`. The previous elements in `array2` remain unchanged, so `array2` now contains two elements: the first is `(arr[3] - arr[2]) * a` and the second is `(arr[4] - arr[3]) * a`. All other variables retain their initial or previously determined values.
