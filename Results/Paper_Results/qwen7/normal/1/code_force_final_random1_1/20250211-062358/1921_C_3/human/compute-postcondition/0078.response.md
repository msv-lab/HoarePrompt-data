Postcondition: **`i` is 4, `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 3, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer, `array2` is a list containing two elements where the first element is `(arr[3] - arr[2]) * a` and the second element is `(arr[4] - arr[3]) * a`.** 

This postcondition summarizes that regardless of whether the condition `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a` is true or false, the values of `i`, `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, `arr`, and `array2` remain as specified, with `array2` now containing two elements derived from the differences between consecutive elements in `arr` scaled by `a`.
