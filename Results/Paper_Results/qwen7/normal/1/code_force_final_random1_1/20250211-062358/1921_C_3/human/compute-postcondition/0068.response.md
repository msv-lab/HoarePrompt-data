Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is `feat[0]`, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer, `array2` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list `array2`. No changes are made to the values of the other variables (`i`, `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, and `arr`). Therefore, the output state retains the initial values of these variables and simply adds the new empty list `array2`.
