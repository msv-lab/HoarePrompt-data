Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` will be equal to `n`
- `array2` will contain all elements added during each iteration where the condition `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] >= b / a` was satisfied.

The print statement is simply `print('No')`.

Since the print statement is directly printing the string `'No'` without any variables or conditions being evaluated, the output will be exactly as printed.

Output: **No**
