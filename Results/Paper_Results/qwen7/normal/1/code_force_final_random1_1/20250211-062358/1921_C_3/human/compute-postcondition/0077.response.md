Postcondition: `i` is 4, `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 3, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer, `array2` is a list containing two elements where the first element is `(arr[3] - arr[2]) * a` and the second element is `(arr[4] - arr[3]) * a`.

Explanation: If the condition `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a` is true, then `array2` is updated to contain two elements: the first element is `(arr[3] - arr[2]) * a` and the second element is `(arr[4] - arr[3]) * a`. Since there is no else part, the values of other variables (`i`, `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, `arr`) remain unchanged.
