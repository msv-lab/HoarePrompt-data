Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` is an input integer, and it is within the range 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(test_cases):
    feat = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
    n = feat[0]
    f = feat[1]
    a = feat[2]
    b = feat[-1]
    arr = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
    array2 = []
    for i in range(0, n):
        if i == 0:
            if arr[0] < b / a:
                array2.append(arr[0] * a)
        elif arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a:
            array2.append((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a)
    if sum(array2) + (n - len(array2)) * b < f:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is equal to `n-1`, and `arr2` is a list containing all the values calculated according to the given conditions during each iteration of the loop. If the sum of `arr2` plus `(n - len(arr2)) * b` is less than `f`, the sum of `arr2` plus `(n - len(arr2)) * b` will be less than `f`. Otherwise, the sum of `arr2` plus `(n - len(arr2)) * b` will be greater than or equal to `f`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The final state of `array2` will contain elements based on the conditions specified within the loop, with `i` being exactly `n` after all iterations. If the sum of elements in `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is less than `f`, the condition holds. Otherwise, the sum is greater than or equal to `f`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` is equal to `n-1`, and `array2` contains elements based on the conditions specified in the loop. Specifically, if `arr[0] < b / a`, then `arr[0] * a` will be in `array2`. For each subsequent index `i` from 1 to `n-1`, if `arr[i] - arr[i-1] < b / a`, then `(arr[i] - arr[i-1]) * a` will be appended to `array2`. If neither condition is met for any index, the corresponding value will not be added to `array2`. Depending on the result of the if condition, either the sum of `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is less than `f` or greater than or equal to `f`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
