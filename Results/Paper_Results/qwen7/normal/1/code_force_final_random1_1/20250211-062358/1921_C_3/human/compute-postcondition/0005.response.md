Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `i` is 0, `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `n` is the first element of the list `feat`, `f` is the second element of the list `feat`, `a` is the third element of the list `feat`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the third element of the list `feat` to the variable `a`. The values of `test_cases`, `i`, `feat`, `n`, and `f` remain unchanged.
