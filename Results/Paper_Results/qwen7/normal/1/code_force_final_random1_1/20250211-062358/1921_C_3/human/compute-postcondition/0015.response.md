Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - If the difference between `arr[2]` and `arr[1]` is less than `b / a`, then `array2` contains one element which is `(arr[1] - arr[0]) * a`. Otherwise, `array2` remains unchanged.

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - The loop starts from `i = 1` and increments `i` by 1 each iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 3.
   - Since `n` must be greater than 1, it remains the same as long as this condition holds true.

4. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The condition for adding an element to `array2` is based on the values of `arr[2]`, `arr[1]`, `b`, and `a`.
   - Since these values do not change within the loop, the condition itself does not change.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `i` will be 3 at the start of the next iteration.
   - `n` remains greater than 1 (as no information suggests otherwise).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 1**.
