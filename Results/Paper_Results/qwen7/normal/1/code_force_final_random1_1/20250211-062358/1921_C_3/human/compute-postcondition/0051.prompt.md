Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `feat` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is `n + 1`, `test_cases` must be greater than `n + 1`, `f` is the second element of `feat`, `a` is the third element of `feat`, `b` is the last element of `feat`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from input, `array2` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a:
        array2.append((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is an integer such that `i` (which is `n + 1`) is within the range `1` to `n-1`, and `array2` contains one additional element which is `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` if `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]` is less than `b / a`. If `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]` is not less than `b / a`, `array2` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is an integer such that `i` (which is `n + 1`) is within the range `1` to `n-1`, and `array2` now contains an additional element which is `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` if `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]` is less than `b / a`. If `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]` is not less than `b / a`, `array2` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` is at least 2, and if `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`, then `array2` contains an element equal to `(arr[1] - arr[0]) * a`. Otherwise, `array2` does not change.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
