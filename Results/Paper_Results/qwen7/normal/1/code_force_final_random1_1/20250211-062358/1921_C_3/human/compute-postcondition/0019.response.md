Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(1, n):`.
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Current State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 4.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.

3. **Check the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `i` is currently 4, `n` must be greater than 4 for the loop to continue.

4. **Adjust the State:**
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration, so `i` will become 5.
   - `n` must remain greater than 4 for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 5, `n` must be greater than 4**
