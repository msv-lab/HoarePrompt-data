### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and its components to determine if it correctly implements the solution for the given problem.

1. **Function Definitions and Usage**:
   - The program defines several utility functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, etc.), but none of these functions directly relate to solving the main problem. The only relevant function is `func_15`, which seems to be intended to solve the problem but is not correctly implemented.

2. **Function `func_15` Analysis**:
   - `func_15` reads two integers `n` and `m` and then calculates a value using a loop and arithmetic operations.
   - The loop iterates from `1` to the square root of `n + i` and increments `ans` by `(n + i) // (i * i)`.
   - This approach does not seem to address the problem statement, which requires checking pairs \((a, b)\) where \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

3. **Main Function `func_16`**:
   - `func_16` reads the number of test cases `t` and then calls `func_15` for each test case.
   - It prints the result of `func_15` for each test case, which is supposed to be the count of valid pairs.
   - However, `func_15` does not correctly compute the number of valid pairs as per the problem statement.

4. **Problem Statement and Solution**:
   - The problem requires counting pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The provided `func_15` does not perform any checks or calculations related to the gcd condition or the multiple condition.

Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly implement the required functionality. The `func_15` function does not solve the problem as described, and the overall structure of the program does not address the problem's requirements.

### Final Evaluation:

**Final: False**

The program is incorrect because it does not implement the necessary logic to solve the given problem.
