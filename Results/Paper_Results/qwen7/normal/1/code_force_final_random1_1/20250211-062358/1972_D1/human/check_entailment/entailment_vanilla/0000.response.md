Let's analyze the given program to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads input using custom functions like `func_1()`, `func_2()`, etc., which are used to read integers and lines from standard input.
   - These functions seem to be correctly implemented to handle the input format described in the problem statement.

2. **Main Function (`func_16`):**
   - The main function iterates over each test case and calls `func_15()` for each test case.
   - This function is expected to compute the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for each test case.

3. **Function `func_15`:**
   - This function is responsible for calculating the number of valid pairs.
   - It takes \(n\) and \(m\) as inputs.
   - The logic inside `func_15` involves iterating over possible values of \(i\) and computing the number of valid pairs.

### Detailed Analysis of `func_15`:

- **Loop Initialization:**
  ```python
  i = 1
  ans = 0
  while i * i <= n + i:
      ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
      i += 1
  ```

- **Calculation Logic:**
  - The loop iterates over values of \(i\) starting from 1.
  - For each \(i\), it calculates \(\left\lfloor \frac{n + i}{i^2} \right\rfloor\) and adds this value to `ans`.
  - This part of the code seems to be an attempt to count valid pairs, but the logic does not directly address the condition \(a + b \text{ is a multiple of } b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Verification of the Logic:

- **Condition Check:**
  - The condition \(a + b \text{ is a multiple of } b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) needs to be checked for each pair \((a, b)\).
  - The current implementation does not check this condition at all.

### Conclusion:

The provided solution does not correctly implement the required logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**
