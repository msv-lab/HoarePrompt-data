Output State: `i` will be `n + 1`, `n` must be a positive integer and at least 13, `m` is a positive integer, `ans` will be the sum of 2 and the integer division of `(n + i)` by `(i * i)` for each iteration from `i = 3` to `i = n + 1`.

To break it down further:
- The loop continues as long as `i * i <= n + i`.
- After the loop finishes, `i` will be the next integer greater than `sqrt(n + i)`, which is `n + 1`.
- `ans` accumulates the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for each value of `i` starting from 2 up to `n + 1`.
- Given the last provided state (`i` is 4, `n` is at least 13), the loop will continue until `i` exceeds `sqrt(13 + 4)`, which is approximately 4.58, so `i` will become 5, 6, ..., up to `n + 1`.
