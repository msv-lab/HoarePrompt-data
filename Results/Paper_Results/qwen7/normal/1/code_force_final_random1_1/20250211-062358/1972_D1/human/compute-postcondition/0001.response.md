Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and `func_15()` returns a positive integer.**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')` writes the return value of `func_15()` to the standard output as a string. However, the initial state of `t` remains unchanged, and the function `func_15()` is called, which must return a positive integer. The value of `t` and the condition \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) are preserved, and the return value of `func_15()` is written to the output.
