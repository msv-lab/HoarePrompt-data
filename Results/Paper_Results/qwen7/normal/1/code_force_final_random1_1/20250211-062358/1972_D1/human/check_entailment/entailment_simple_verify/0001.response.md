### Reasoning:

The original assessment concluded that the provided solution is incorrect because the logic in `func_15` does not properly check the condition \(a + b \text{ is a multiple of } b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Let's verify this step-by-step.

#### Detailed Analysis of `func_15`:

1. **Loop Initialization:**
   ```python
   i = 1
   ans = 0
   while i * i <= n + i:
       ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
       i += 1
   ```

2. **Calculation Logic:**
   - The loop iterates over values of \(i\) starting from 1.
   - For each \(i\), it calculates \(\left\lfloor \frac{n + i}{i^2} \right\rfloor\) and adds this value to `ans`.
   - This part of the code attempts to count the number of valid pairs, but it does not actually check the condition \(a + b \text{ is a multiple of } b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if they satisfy the condition \(a + b \text{ is a multiple of } b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Here is a corrected version of the logic:

```python
def func_15(n, m):
    ans = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                ans += 1
    return ans
```

This approach iterates over all pairs \((a, b)\) and checks the condition directly. If the condition is satisfied, it increments the counter `ans`.

#### Verification Using Annotations:

- **Function `func_15`:**
  - The function iterates over all pairs \((a, b)\) from 1 to \(n\) and 1 to \(m\) respectively.
  - For each pair, it checks if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
  - If the condition is satisfied, it increments the counter `ans`.

Given the annotations and the detailed analysis, the original assessment was correct. The provided solution does not correctly implement the required logic to count the number of valid pairs.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
