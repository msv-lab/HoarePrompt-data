Output State: The loop will execute exactly `t` times, where `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). During each iteration, `sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')` will write a positive integer minus 1 to the standard output. After all iterations, the total number of lines written to the standard output will be `t`, each line containing a different positive integer minus 1.

This means that if `t` is, for example, 10, the output will look something like this:
```
x - 1
y - 1
z - 1
...
```
where `x`, `y`, `z`, etc., are different positive integers returned by `func_15()` during each of the 10 iterations.
