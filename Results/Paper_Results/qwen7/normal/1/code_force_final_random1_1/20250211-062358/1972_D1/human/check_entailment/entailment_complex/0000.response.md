Reasoning:
1. The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy specific conditions for multiple test cases.
2. The given functions are designed to handle input reading, processing, and output writing for the problem.
3. The key function `func_15()` is responsible for calculating the number of valid pairs for a given \(n\) and \(m\).
4. `func_16()` processes each test case by calling `func_15()` for the specified number of test cases and writing the results to the standard output.

Let's analyze the correctness of the functions:

- `func_1()`: Reads an integer from standard input and returns it. This is correctly implemented.
- `func_2()`: Reads a line of input, splits it into integers, and returns a map object. This is correctly implemented.
- `func_3()`: Reads a line of input, splits it into integers, and returns a list. This is correctly implemented.
- `func_4()`: Reads multiple test cases and returns a list of \([n, m]\) pairs. This is correctly implemented.
- `func_5()`: Reads a single line from standard input and returns it as bytes. This is correctly implemented.
- `func_6()`: Reads a single line from standard input, strips the newline, and decodes it to a string. This is correctly implemented.
- `func_7()`: Reads input from the user, processes it to extract test cases, and returns a list of tuples. This is correctly implemented.
- `func_8()`: Reads multiple test cases and returns a list of tuples. This is correctly implemented.
- `func_9()`: Reads the number of test cases from standard input and returns it as a string. This is correctly implemented.
- `func_10()`: Reads an integer input from the user for the current test case. This is correctly implemented.
- `func_11()`: Reads input from the user and splits it into a list of strings. This is correctly implemented.
- `func_12()`: Implements a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to find the minimum path length. This function is not relevant to the problem and does not seem to be used.
- `func_13()`: Implements the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. This function is not relevant to the problem and does not seem to be used.
- `func_14()`: Checks if a list of integers meets certain conditions. This function is not relevant to the problem and does not seem to be used.
- `func_15()`: Calculates the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for given \(n\) and \(m\). This function appears to be incorrectly implemented. It does not correctly calculate the number of valid pairs based on the problem statement.
- `func_16()`: Processes each test case by calling `func_15()` and writing the results to the standard output. This function is correctly implemented, assuming `func_15()` works correctly.

Since `func_15()` is incorrectly implemented, the overall program cannot be considered correct.

Correctness: **False**
