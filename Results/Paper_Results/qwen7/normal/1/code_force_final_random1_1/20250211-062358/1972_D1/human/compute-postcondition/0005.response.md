Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and the stdout writes a positive integer minus 1, and `func_15()` returns a positive integer value.**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')` writes the result of `func_15()` to the standard output as a string. Since `func_15()` must return a positive integer value, the stdout writes that positive integer minus 1. However, the value of `t` remains unchanged, and the requirement for `func_15()` returning a positive integer value is noted.
