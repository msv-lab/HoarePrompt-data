Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

The `processing` list will have all its elements set to 0, as it is reset to 0 for each `di` after being set to 1.

    #
    #To explain further, the loop continues as long as `i * i` is less than or equal to `n + i`. The loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration and adds `(n + i) // (i * i)` to `ans`. This process repeats until `i * i` exceeds `n + i`. Therefore, `i` will eventually become `n + 1`, and `ans` will accumulate the sum of the integer divisions as described.

    #State: Output State: The loop will execute exactly `t` times, where `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). During each iteration, `sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')` will write a positive integer minus 1 to the standard output. After all iterations, the total number of lines written to the standard output will be `t`, each line containing a different positive integer minus 1.
    #
    #This means that if `t` is, for example, 10, the output will look something like this:
    #```
    #x - 1
    #y - 1
    #z - 1
    #...
    #```
    #where `x`, `y`, `z`, etc., are different positive integers returned by `func_15()` during each of the 10 iterations.
