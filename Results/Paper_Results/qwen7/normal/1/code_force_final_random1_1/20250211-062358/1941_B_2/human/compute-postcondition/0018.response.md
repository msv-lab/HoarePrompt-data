Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the `range(int(input()))` part. This means the loop will run based on the integer value entered by the user.

2. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - The loop will execute again if the user inputs a positive integer (since the condition `int(input())` will provide the number of iterations).
   - Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will depend on the user input for the next iteration.

3. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `t`: Since the postcondition states that `t` must be greater than 0, and the loop will continue as long as the user inputs a positive integer, `t` will remain greater than 0.
   - `a`: This variable will be updated to the new input integer for the next iteration.
   - `b`: This list will be updated to a new list of integers obtained from the split input string for the next iteration.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `t` remains greater than 0.
- `a` becomes the new input integer.
- `b` becomes a new list of integers obtained from the split input string.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `a` is the new input integer, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the split input string**.
