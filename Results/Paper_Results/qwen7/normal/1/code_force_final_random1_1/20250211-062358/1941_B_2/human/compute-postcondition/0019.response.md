Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the split input string**.

Explanation: The code `a = int(input())` takes an input from the user, converts it to an integer, and assigns it to the variable `a`. The variable `t` remains unchanged and still must be greater than 0. The list `b` remains unchanged and is still a list of integers obtained from splitting an input string.
