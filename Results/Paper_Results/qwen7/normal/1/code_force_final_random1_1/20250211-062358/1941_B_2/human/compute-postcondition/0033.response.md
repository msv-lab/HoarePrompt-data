Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 4, `opNum` is `a[2]`, and if `a[2] < 0`, then `stop` is True and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. If `a[2] >= 0`, then the value of `stop` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `a[i]` to `opNum`. Since `i` is 2, `opNum` is now `a[2]`. The conditions regarding `n` and `stop` remain unchanged.
