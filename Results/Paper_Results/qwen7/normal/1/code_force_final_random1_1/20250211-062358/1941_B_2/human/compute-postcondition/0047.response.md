Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `n - 3`
- `n` is greater than or equal to `n - 2` (which is always true since `n` is just a number and `n - 2` is a smaller number)
- `opNum` is 0
- `a[i]`, `a[i + 1]`, and `a[i + 2]` are `a[n - 3]`, `a[n - 2]`, and `a[n - 1]` respectively
- The last two elements of the list `a` are both 0

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`. There are no variables or objects from the initial state that need to be substituted into this string.

Output: **YES**
