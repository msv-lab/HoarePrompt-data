Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `stop` is `True`
   - `i` is `2`
   - `opNum` is `a[1]`
   - `a[0]` is `-2^(n-3) * a[n - 3]`
   - `a[1]` is `a[n - 2] - (2^n - 2) * a[n - 3]`
   - `a[2]` is `a[n - 1] - (2^(n-2) - 1) * a[n - 3] - opNum - 2 * opNum - opNum`
   - `numTest` is `numTest - 1`
   - We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(0, n - 2):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Head Variables:**
   - The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

4. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop condition is `i < n - 2`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `2`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n - 2`.

5. **Adjusting States:**
   - Since `i` was `2` at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented by `1` in the next iteration.
   - Therefore, `i` will become `3`.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop body.

6. **Final State:**
   - `stop` remains `True` as it is not modified in the loop.
   - `i` becomes `3`.
   - `opNum` remains `a[1]` as it is not modified in the loop.
   - `a[0]`, `a[1]`, and `a[2]` remain unchanged as they are not modified in the loop.
   - `numTest` remains unchanged as it is not modified in the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`stop` is `True`, `i` is `3`, `opNum` is `a[1]`, `a[0]` is `-2^(n-3) * a[n - 3]`, `a[1]` is `a[n - 2] - (2^n - 2) * a[n - 3]`, `a[2]` is `a[n - 1] - (2^(n-2) - 1) * a[n - 3] - opNum - 2 * opNum - opNum`, `numTest` is `numTest - 1`**.
