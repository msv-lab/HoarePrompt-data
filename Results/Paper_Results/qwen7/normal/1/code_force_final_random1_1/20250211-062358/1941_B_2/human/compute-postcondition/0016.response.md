Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `a` is the new input integer, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the split input string. If the first element of `b` is odd and does not differ from the second element by 2, or if the last element of `b` is odd and does not differ from the second last element by 2, the condition is satisfied. Otherwise, the condition is also satisfied.
