Postcondition: `i` is equal to `n - 3`, `n` is greater than or equal to `n - 2`, the value of `opNum` is 0, the values of `a[i]`, `a[i + 1]`, and `a[i + 2]` are `a[n - 3]`, `a[n - 2]`, and `a[n - 1]` respectively, and either the last two elements of the list `a` are not both zero, or they are both zero.
