Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `b = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer. The resulting list of integers is assigned to `b`. The initial conditions for `t` and `a` remain unchanged.
