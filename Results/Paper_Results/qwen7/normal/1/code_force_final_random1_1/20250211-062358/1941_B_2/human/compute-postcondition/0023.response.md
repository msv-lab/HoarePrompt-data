Postcondition: `t` is greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string using space as delimiter and converting each element to integer. If the first element of `b` is odd and does not equal the second element minus 2, or if the last element of `b` is odd and the second-to-last element does not equal the last element minus 2, the condition is met.
