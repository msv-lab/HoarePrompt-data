Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `numTest`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Checking for Negative Elements:**
   - The program iterates through the array from index 0 to `n-3` (since the operation requires indices `i`, `i+1`, and `i+2`).
   - If any element `a[i]` is negative, it prints 'NO' and stops further processing for that test case.
   
3. **Applying Operations:**
   - For each valid index `i`, the program calculates the number of operations `opNum` required to reduce `a[i]` to zero.
   - It then applies the operations to `a[i]`, `a[i+1]`, and `a[i+2]` by subtracting `opNum`, `2*opNum`, and `opNum` respectively.
   - This part of the code seems to be incorrectly implemented because it doesn't actually ensure that the elements are reduced to zero. Instead, it just modifies them without checking if they can be made zero.

4. **Final Check:**
   - After the loop, the program checks if the last two elements `a[n-1]` and `a[n-2]` are zero.
   - If either of them is non-zero, it prints 'NO'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

### Issues with the Program

1. **Incorrect Operation Application:**
   - The logic for applying the operations is flawed. The program does not ensure that the elements can be reduced to zero. Instead, it just modifies them without a proper strategy to achieve the goal.

2. **Lack of Strategy:**
   - The program does not have a strategy to ensure that all elements can be reduced to zero. It only checks if there are any negative elements initially and then makes arbitrary modifications without ensuring the final state.

3. **Potential Infinite Loop:**
   - If the initial array configuration does not allow making all elements zero, the program may enter an infinite loop due to the incorrect application of operations.

### Correct Solution

To correctly solve the problem, we need to check if the sum of all elements in the array is even. If it is, then it is possible to make all elements zero; otherwise, it is not.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    numTest = int(input())
    for _ in range(numTest):
        n = int(input())
        a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        total_sum = sum(a)
        
        if total_sum % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

# Example usage
func()
```

### Conclusion

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic to determine if all elements can be made zero. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
