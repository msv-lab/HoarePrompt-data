Output State: **`stop` is `True`, `i` is `5`, `n` must be greater than `6`.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or the innermost enclosing block that is a loop or a match statement. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block (like a match statement) that the `break` statement is associated with, it does not affect any variable values. The preconditions remain unchanged, and the `break` statement itself does not alter any variable values. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
