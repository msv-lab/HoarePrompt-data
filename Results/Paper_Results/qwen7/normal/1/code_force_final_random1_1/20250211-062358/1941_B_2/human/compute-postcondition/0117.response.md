Output State: **`stop` is `True`, `i` is `3`, `opNum` is `a[3]`, `a[0]` is `-2^(n-3) * a[n - 3]`, `a[1]` is `a[n - 2] - (2^n - 2) * a[n - 3]`, `a[2]` is `a[n - 1] - (2^(n-2) - 1) * a[n - 3] - opNum - 2 * opNum - opNum`, `numTest` is `numTest - 1`**.

Explanation: The code assigns `a[i]` to `opNum`. Given that `i` is 3, `opNum` is updated to `a[3]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
