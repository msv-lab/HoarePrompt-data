Output State: **`i` is equal to `n - 3`, `n` is greater than or equal to `n - 2`, the value of `opNum` is 0, the values of `a[i]`, `a[i + 1]`, and `a[i + 2]` are `a[n - 3]`, `a[n - 2]`, and `a[n - 1]` respectively, and we continue with the next iteration of the loop.**

The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to any variables within the scope of the `continue` statement, all the variables retain their original values from the initial state.
