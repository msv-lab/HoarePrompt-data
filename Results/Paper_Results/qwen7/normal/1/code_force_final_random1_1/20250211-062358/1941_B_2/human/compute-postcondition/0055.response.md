Postcondition: `i` is `n - 3`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `opNum` is 0, the values of `a[i]`, `a[i + 1]`, and `a[i + 2]` are `a[n - 3]`, `a[n - 2]`, and `a[n - 1]` respectively, and either the last two elements of the list `a` are not both zero, or they are both zero, `numTest` is greater than 0, `a` is updated to a list of integers split from the input, `n` is an input integer, `stop` is `False`, and the current value of `a[i]` is less than 0.
