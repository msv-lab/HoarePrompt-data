Postcondition: `t` is greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string using space as delimiter and converting each element to integer. If the first element of `b` is odd and does not differ by 2 from the second element, or if the last element of `b` is odd and does not differ by 2 from the second last element, the condition is met. In all cases, `t` remains greater than 0, `a` remains unchanged, and `b` remains a list of integers as described.
