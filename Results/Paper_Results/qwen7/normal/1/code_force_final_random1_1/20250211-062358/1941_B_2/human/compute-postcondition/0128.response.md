Output State: **`stop` is `True`, `i` is `5`, `n` must be greater than `6`, `a[5]` is `a[5] - opNum`, `opNum` is `a[5]`**

Explanation: The code `a[i] -= opNum` subtracts the value of `opNum` from `a[i]`. Given that `i` is `5` and `opNum` is `a[5]`, the value of `a[5]` is updated to `a[5] - a[5]`, which simplifies to `0`. The other variables (`stop`, `i`, `n`, and `opNum`) remain unchanged.
