You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

    5
    
    1 3 5 5 2
    
    5
    
    2 4 4 5 1

    3
    
    7 1 0
    
    4
    
    1 1 1 1

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    NO
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

- Program:
def func():
    numTest = int(input())
    for _ in range(0, numTest):
        n = int(input())
        a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        stop = False
        for i in range(0, n - 2):
            if a[i] < 0:
                print('NO')
                stop = True
                break
            opNum = a[i]
            a[i] -= opNum
            a[i + 1] -= 2 * opNum
            a[i + 2] -= opNum
        if stop == True:
            continue
        if a[len(a) - 1] != 0 or a[len(a) - 2] != 0:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and an array `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it checks if any element in the array `a` becomes negative after performing a specific operation. If any element becomes negative, it prints 'NO' and stops processing for that test case. Otherwise, it continues applying the operation until the end of the array. If the last two elements of the array become zero, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function ensures that no further operations are performed on any test case that encountered a negative element.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if all elements of the array can be made zero. Specifically, the program only checks if any element becomes negative during the operations and stops immediately if it finds a negative value. However, the problem requires checking if it's possible to make all elements zero, not just stopping at the first negative value.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
1 3 5 5 2
```
The program will output "NO" because it finds `a[0]` becomes negative after the first operation. However, as shown in the problem's note, it is possible to make all elements zero through a series of valid operations.

The correct approach would involve ensuring that the sum of the array remains invariant and that the operations can reduce all elements to zero without encountering negative values prematurely.
