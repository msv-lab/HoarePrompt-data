Postcondition: **`stop` is `True`, `i` is `n - 3`, `opNum` is `a[n - 3]`, `a[0]` is `-2^(n-3) * a[n - 3]`, `a[1]` is `a[n - 2] - (2^n - 2) * a[n - 3]`, `a[2]` is `a[n - 1] - (2^(n-2) - 1) * a[n - 3] - 2 * opNum - 3 * opNum`, `numTest` is `numTest - 1`**.

This postcondition describes the state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block. Since the if condition is `stop == True` and the if part matches this condition, the postcondition directly reflects the state described in the if part. There is no else part, so the postcondition does not change from the if part's description.
