Output State: **`stop` is `True`, `i` is `1`, `opNum` is `a[1]`, `a[0]` is `-2^(n-3) * a[n - 3]`, `a[1]` is `a[n - 2] - (2^n - 2) * a[n - 3]`, `a[2]` is `a[n - 1] - (2^(n-2) - 1) * a[n - 3]`, `numTest` is `numTest - 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The code `opNum = a[i]` assigns the value of `a[i]` to `opNum`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, so `opNum` is now `a[1]`. All other variables remain unchanged. We also note that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement as mentioned in the initial state.
