Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `a` is the new input integer, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the split input string.**

Explanation: The code `b = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `b`. The initial value of `a` is updated to the new input integer. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged.
