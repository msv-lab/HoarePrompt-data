Output State: **`stop` is `False`, `i` is `n - 3`, `opNum` is `a[n - 3]`, `a[i]` is `-2^(n-3) * a[n - 3]`, `a[i + 1]` is `a[n - 2] - (2^n - 2) * a[n - 3]`, `a[i + 2]` is `a[n - 1] - (2^(n-2) - 1) * a[n - 3]`, `numTest` is `numTest - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers read from input.**

Explanation: The variable `stop` is explicitly set to `False`. All other variables retain their previous values as they were not modified by the code snippet.
