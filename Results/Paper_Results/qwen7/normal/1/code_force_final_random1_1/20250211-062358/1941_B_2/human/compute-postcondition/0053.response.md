Output State: **`i` is equal to `n - 3`, `n` is greater than or equal to `n - 2`, `opNum` is 0, the values of `a[i]`, `a[i + 1]`, and `a[i + 2]` are `a[n - 3]`, `a[n - 2]`, and `a[n - 1]` respectively, and either the last two elements of the list `a` are not both zero, or they are both zero, `numTest` is greater than 0, `a` is updated to a list of integers split from the input, `n` is an input integer, `stop` is `False`.**

Explanation: The variable `stop` is assigned the boolean value `False` in the given code snippet. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
