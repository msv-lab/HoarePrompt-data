Output State: **`tc` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1, `dp` is a boolean value determined by the condition `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1` or the negation of the previous value of `dp` for every `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1`, inclusive, and `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This changes the value of `n` to the input integer, but does not affect the values of `tc`, `i`, or `dp`. The precondition that `tc` must be greater than 0 and the definition of `i`, `n`, and `dp` remain unchanged.
