Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a list of test cases. Each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), followed by a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n). The function returns the results based on the given test cases.**

This means the function takes in a series of test cases, each containing a value for t, n, and a list of n integers. It then processes these inputs according to the specified conditions and returns the results accordingly.
