Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variable in the loop head is `tc`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop condition is `tc > 0`. For the loop to execute at least once, `tc` must be greater than 0.

3. **Current State Before the Loop**: According to the given state, `tc` is an input integer, but no specific value is mentioned. We need to ensure that `tc` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute the first time.

4. **Adjust the State**: Since `tc` is the only variable in the loop head and it must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `tc` meets this condition.

Therefore, the state right before the loop should be adjusted to ensure `tc` is greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`tc` must be greater than 0**
