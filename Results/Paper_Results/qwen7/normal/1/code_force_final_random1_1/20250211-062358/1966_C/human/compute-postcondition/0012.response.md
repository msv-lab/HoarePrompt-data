Output State: `tc` must be greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1, `arr` is a list of integers in descending order with 0 appended as the last element, `dp` is the result of applying the loop's condition `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp` iteratively from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n` (the second-to-last index of `arr`), `tc` will still be greater than 0, `n` will remain the length of `arr` minus 1, `arr` will stay as a list of integers in descending order ending with 0, and `dp` will be the final value determined by applying the loop's condition for each `i` from 1 to `n-1`.
