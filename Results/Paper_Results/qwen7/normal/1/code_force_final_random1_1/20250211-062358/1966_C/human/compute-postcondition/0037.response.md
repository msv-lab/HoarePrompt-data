Output State: **`dp` is a boolean value based on the condition `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1`, `i` is at least 1, `n` is at least 1.**

Explanation: The variable `dp` is assigned a boolean value based on the condition `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged as they are not directly involved in the condition. The initial conditions that `i` is at least 1 and `n` is at least 1 still hold true.
