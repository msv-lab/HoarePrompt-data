Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the condition `range(1, n)`. Therefore, the only variables that can be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Current State of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented from its initial value of 1 to `i + 1`. If the loop just finished its previous iteration, `i` would be `2` (assuming it started from `1`).

3. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. Since `i` is now `2`, the condition for the next iteration is that `2 < n`.

4. **Adjust the State**: We need to update the state to reflect the new values of `i` and the condition for the next iteration.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`dp` is a boolean value determined by `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1` or the negation of the current `dp` value, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2**
