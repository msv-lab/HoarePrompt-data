Output State: **`tc` must be at least 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1, `arr` is a list of integers in descending order with 0 appended as the last element, `dp` is the result of applying the condition `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1 or not dp` iteratively from `i = 1` to `i = n-1, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. This changes the value of `n` to the input integer, but it does not affect the values of `tc`, `i`, `arr`, or `dp`. The precondition that `tc` must be at least 1 remains unchanged. The value of `i` is still equal to the original value of `n`, which is now an input integer. The description of `arr` and `dp` remains the same as per the initial state.
