Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `t` and a binary string `s`. For each test case, it counts the number of times the binary string transitions from '0' to '1'. If any string contains a transition from '0' to '1', it subtracts one from the count. Finally, it prints the adjusted count for each test case.**
