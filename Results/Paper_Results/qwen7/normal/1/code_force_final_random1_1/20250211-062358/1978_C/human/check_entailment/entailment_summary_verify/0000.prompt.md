You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's call the Manhattan value of a permutation^{\dagger} p the value of the
expression |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n| .

For example, for the permutation [1, 2, 3] , the Manhattan value is |1 - 1| +
|2 - 2| + |3 - 3| = 0 , and for the permutation [3, 1, 2] , the Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

You are given integers n and k . Find a permutation p of length n such that
its Manhattan value is equal to k , or determine that no such permutation
exists.

^{\dagger} A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^{4} ) — the number of test cases. The description
of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^{5}, 0 \le k \le 10^{12} ) — the length of the permutation and the
required Manhattan value.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^{5} .

Output

For each test case, if there is no suitable permutation, output "No".
Otherwise, in the first line, output "Yes", and in the second line, output n
distinct integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — a suitable
permutation.

If there are multiple solutions, output any of them.

You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Note

In the first test case, the permutation [3, 1, 2] is suitable, its Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

In the second test case, it can be proven that there is no permutation of
length 4 with a Manhattan value of 5 .

In the third test case, the permutation [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] is suitable, its
Manhattan value is |1-1|+|2-2|+|3-3|+|4-4|+|5-5|+|6-6|+|7-7|=0 .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, k):
    k = k // 2
    l = list(range(1, n + 1))
    c = 0
    for i in range(n, -1, -2):
        c += 1
        if k == 0:
            return l
        if k < i - 1:
            return func_2(c, k, l)
        k = k - i + 1
        l = func_3(c, l)

#Function 2:
def func_2(c, k, l):
    (x, y) = (l[-c], l[-c - k])
    (l[-c], l[-c - k]) = (y, x)
    return l

#Function 3:
def func_3(c, l):
    (x, y) = (l[-c], l[c - 1])
    (l[c - 1], l[-c]) = (x, y)
    return l

#Function 4:
def func_4():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    if k % 2:
        return (0, 0)
    if n % 2:
        max_k = (n ** 2 - 1) // 2
    else:
        max_k = n ** 2 // 2
    if max_k < k:
        return (0, 0)
    return (n, k)

#Function 5:
def func_5(l):
    print('YES')
    for i in l:
        print(i, end=' ')
    print()
    return

#Function 6:
def func_6():
    (n, k) = func_4()
    if n == 0:
        print('NO')
        return
    l = func_1(n, k)
    func_5(l)
    return



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 6 : The function accepts no parameters and determines whether to return an integer \( k \) between 0 and \( 10^{12} \) or None. If \( n \) (obtained from `func_4()`) is 0, it prints 'NO' and returns. Otherwise, it processes \( n \) and \( k \) using `func_1()` and `func_5()`, then returns None.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the function `func_1` attempts to construct a permutation based on the given `n` and `k`, but it does not cover all possible scenarios, particularly when `k` is odd or when the maximum possible Manhattan value (`max_k`) is less than `k`.

Here are some specific issues:

1. **Handling Odd `k`:**
   - The function `func_1` does not handle the case when `k` is odd. Since the Manhattan value is always even (as it is the sum of absolute differences), the function should not attempt to construct a permutation when `k` is odd.

2. **Handling Maximum Possible Manhattan Value:**
   - The function `func_4` calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value (`max_k`). If `max_k` is less than `k`, the function returns `(0, 0)`, indicating that no valid permutation exists. However, the main function `func_6` does not properly handle this case and continues to call `func_1`, which may lead to incorrect behavior.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:
```
3 5
```
- The maximum possible Manhattan value for `n = 3` is `2` (since `|1-1| + |2-2| + |3-3| = 0` and the next highest is `|1-1| + |2-3| + |3-2| = 2`).
- Since `5 > 2`, the function should return "No". However, the current implementation may incorrectly attempt to construct a permutation, leading to an incorrect result.

Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly and hence is marked as **False**.
