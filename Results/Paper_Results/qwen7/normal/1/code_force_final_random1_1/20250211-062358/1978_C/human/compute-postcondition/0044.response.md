Output State: **`i` is `n-5`, `k` is `k - 2n + 5`, `x` is the last element of list `l`, and the second element of list `l` is the original third last element of list `l`.**

Explanation: The code `x = l[-1]` assigns the last element of list `l` to `x`. This does not affect the values of `i` and `k`, nor does it change the structure of the list `l` except for updating the value of `x`. The second element of the list `l` is mentioned to be the original third last element of the list `l`, which remains unchanged from the initial state. The conditions related to inserting an element into the list `l` based on the comparison between `1 + (n-5)` and `(k - 2n + 5)` are not triggered by this line of code, so the list `l` does not undergo any changes other than the assignment of its last element to `x`.
