Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 5⋅10^11, `l` is a list containing integers from 1 to n inclusive.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    if k == 0:
        return l
    if 1 + i > k:
        x = l[-1]
        l.pop(-1)
        l.insert(-k, x)
        return l
    k = k - i + 1
    x = l[-1]
    l.pop(-1)
    l.insert(0, x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is `n-2`, `n` must be at least 1, and `k` is equal to `k - (n-1) + 1`, `x` is the second last element of list `l`, and list `l` has its first element replaced by `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is `n-3`, `k` is `k - (n-1) + 1 - i`, `x` is now the first element of list `l`, and the second element of list `l` is the original second last element of list `l`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `n-5`, `k` is `k - 2n + 5`, `x` is the second last element of list `l`, the first element of list `l` is the second last element of list `l` before the insertion, and the second element of list `l` is the original third last element of list `l`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
