You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l is a list of integers where each integer represents a position in the permutation of length n such that 1 <= l[i] <= n and all positions are distinct.
def func_5(l):
    print('YES')
    #This is printed: YES
    for i in l:
        print(i, end=' ')
        
    #State: Output State: `l` must contain at least one element.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop will continue to execute as long as there are elements in the list `l`. Since the question does not specify any condition that would cause the loop to terminate (such as modifying `l` within the loop to remove elements or setting a break condition), the loop will keep running until `l` is empty. Therefore, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the output state is that `l` must contain at least one element, which in this case would mean `l` is empty. However, based on the given information and the format required, we can only state that `l` must contain at least one element before the loop starts, which remains true even after all iterations.
    print()
    #This is printed: ()
    return
    #The program returns a list `l` that must contain at least one element.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `l`, which is a list of integers. Each integer in the list represents a position in the permutation of length `n` such that 1 <= l[i] <= n and all positions are distinct. The function returns the list `l` itself, ensuring it contains at least one element.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list `l` that must contain at least one element.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
