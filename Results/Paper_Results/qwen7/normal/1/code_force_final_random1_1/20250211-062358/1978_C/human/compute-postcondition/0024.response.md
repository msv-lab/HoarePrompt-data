Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n, -1, -2)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `i` is `n - 2`
   - `n` remains unchanged
   - `k` is `k - (n - 2) + 1`
   - `c` is increased by 2
   - `l` is the return value of `func_3(c, l)`

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from `n - 2` and decreases by 2 each iteration, the next value of `i` would be `i - 2`.
   - Therefore, the new value of `i` will be `(n - 2) - 2 = n - 4`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `k` will be updated to `k - (n - 2) + 1 - 1 = k - (n - 4) + 1`.
   - `c` will be increased by 2 again, so `c` will be `c + 2`.
   - `l` will remain the same as it is the return value of `func_3(c, l)`.

Given these adjustments, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is `n - 4`, `n` remains unchanged, `k` is `k - (n - 4) + 1`, `c` is `c + 2`, `l` is the return value of `func_3(c, l)`**
