Postcondition: `i` is `n - 2`, `n` remains unchanged, `k` is `k - n + 1`, `c` is increased by 2, and `l` is the return value of `func_3(c, l)`. If `k` is less than `i - 1`, the function returns the value of `l`, which is the return value of `func_2(c, k, l)`, where `c` is increased by 2 from its original value, `k` is `k - n + 1`, and `l` is the return value of `func_3(c, l)`. If `k` is not less than `i - 1`, the function still returns the value of `l`.
