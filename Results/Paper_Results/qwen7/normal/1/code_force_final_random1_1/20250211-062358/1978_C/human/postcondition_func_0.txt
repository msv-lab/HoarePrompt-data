The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`. It processes these parameters through a series of conditional checks and function calls. If `k` is zero, it returns the initial list `l`. Otherwise, it iteratively decreases `i` by 2 starting from `n`, updating `c` and `k` accordingly. Depending on the conditions met during each iteration, it either returns the result of `func_2(c, k, l)` or the modified list `l` after calling `func_3(c, l)`. The final state of the program is determined by the specific case that matches the given conditions, ultimately returning either the unchanged initial list `l`, or the result of subsequent function calls involving `c`, `k`, and `l`.
