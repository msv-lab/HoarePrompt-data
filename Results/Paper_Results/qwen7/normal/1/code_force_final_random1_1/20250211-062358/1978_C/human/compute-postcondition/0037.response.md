Output State: **`i` is `n-4`, `k` is `k - 2n + 4`, `x` is `l[-1]`, and the second element of list `l` remains the original second last element of list `l`.**

Explanation: The code `x = l[-1]` assigns the last element of list `l` to `x`. This changes the value of `x` to the last element of `l`, but it does not affect the values of `i`, `k`, or the second element of `l`. The second element of `l` remains the original second last element of `l` because no operation was performed on it.
