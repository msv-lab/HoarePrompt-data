Postcondition: `i` is `n - 4`, `n` remains unchanged, `k` is `k - (n - 4) + 1`, `c` is `c + 3`, and `l` is the return value of `func_3(c, l)`. If `k` is less than `i - 1`, the function returns the value of `l`, which is the result of `func_2(c, k, l)` where `c` is `c + 3`, `k` is `k - (n - 4) + 1`, and `l` is the return value of `func_3(c, l)`. If `k` is not less than `i - 1`, the function does not change the value of `l`.
