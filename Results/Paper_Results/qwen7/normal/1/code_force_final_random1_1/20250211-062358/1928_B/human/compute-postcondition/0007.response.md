Output State: **`arr` is a list of positive integers that must have at least one element, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, `tem` is the product of all elements in `arr` except `arr[i]`, `ans` is a list containing the value `tem` + [tem]**.

Explanation: The code `ans.append(tem)` appends the value of `tem` to the list `ans`. Initially, `ans` contains only one element, which is `tem`. After appending, `ans` will contain two elements: the original `tem` and the new `tem` added by the append operation.
