The function accepts a list of positive integers `arr` and returns a list `ans` containing all intermediate products of the cumulative product of elements in `arr`, calculated from the end to the beginning. After processing, the index `i` is set to -1 and the variable `tem` holds the product of all elements in `arr`.
