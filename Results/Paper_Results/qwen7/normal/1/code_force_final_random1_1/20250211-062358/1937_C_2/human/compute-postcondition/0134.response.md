Output State: `best` is `n-1`, `res` is an input string, `i` is `n`, `k` is `n-1`, and `n` is the input integer provided by the user.

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`. After each iteration, the value of `best` is updated to the current value of `i` if the condition `res == '<'` is met. Since the loop runs `n-1` times (from 1 to `n-1`), `best` will eventually be set to `n-1` if the condition is met every time. The value of `res` remains as the last input received, which could be either `<` or any other string depending on the user's input. The variables `i` and `k` will be `n` and `n-1` respectively after the loop completes, and `n` remains unchanged as it was provided by the user.
