Based on the initial state provided:

- `best` is explicitly given as 0.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `k` is `n-1`.
- `res` is an input string, but its value is not needed for the print statement.
- `n` must be at least 2.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', k, best, k, i, flush=True)
```

Here's the breakdown of what will be printed:
- `'?'` is a literal string.
- `k` is `n-1`. Since `n` is at least 2, `k` will be 1.
- `best` is 0.
- `k` again is 1.
- `i` is `n-1`, so it is also 1.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **'? 1 0 1 1'**
