Output State: **`best` is 0, `res` is the final input provided by the user, `i` is 1, `k` is `n-1`, and `n` is the input integer provided by the user.**

Explanation: The code `res = input()` assigns the value entered by the user (as a string) to the variable `res`. The values of the other variables (`best`, `i`, `k`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
