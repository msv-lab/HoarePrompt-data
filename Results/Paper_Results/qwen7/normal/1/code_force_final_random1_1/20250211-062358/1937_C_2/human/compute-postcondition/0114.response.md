Output State: **Postcondition: `res` is the final input provided by the user, `i` is `n`, `k` is `n-1`, and `n` is the input integer provided by the user.**

In this final state, the loop has executed `n-2` times (since it starts from `i=2` and goes up to `n-1`). During each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, and `k` is set to the current value of `i` if `res` is '<'. After all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, and `k` will be one less than `i`, i.e., `n-1`. The variable `res` will hold the last input received from the user during any of these iterations, and `n` will retain the value it had initially.
