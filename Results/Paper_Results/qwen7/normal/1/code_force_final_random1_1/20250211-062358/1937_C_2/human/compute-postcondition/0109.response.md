Output: **'? 0 3 0 4'**

Explanation:
- `res` is the new input provided by the user, but its value is not needed for this specific print statement.
- `i` is explicitly given as 4.
- `k` is explicitly given as 3.
- The print statement includes literal strings and the values of `k` and `i`, along with two zeros.
- Therefore, the output is exactly as written in the print statement: `'? 0 3 0 4'`.
