Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variables in the given for loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 2 to `n` (exclusive). This means the loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 3
   - `k` is 3 (though `k` is not part of the loop, it remains unchanged)
   - `n` must be greater than 3
   - `res` is an input string (though `res` is not part of the loop, its value remains unchanged)

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `i` is currently 3, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 4.
   - The loop condition checks if `i` is less than `n`. Since `i` is now 4, `n` must be greater than 4 for the loop to execute again.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` needs to be updated to 4.
   - `n` must remain greater than 4.

6. **Consider the postcondition for `res`**: The postcondition states that if `res` equals '<', no changes are made to the variables. However, since there is no information that `res` equals '<' in this context, we assume `res` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is 4, `k` is 3, `n` must be greater than 4, `res` is an input string**
