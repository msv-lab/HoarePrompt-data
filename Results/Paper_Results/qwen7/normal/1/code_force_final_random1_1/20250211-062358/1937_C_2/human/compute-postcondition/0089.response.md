Output State: `best` is `n-1`, `i` is `0`, `k` is `n-1`, and `res` is an input string.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` starts from `n-1` and decreases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `0`. Therefore, by the end of the loop, `i` will be `0`. The variable `best` is updated to `i` when `res` is `<`, and since the loop continues to run as long as `res` is `<`, `best` remains `n-1` even after the loop completes. The variables `k` and `res` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
