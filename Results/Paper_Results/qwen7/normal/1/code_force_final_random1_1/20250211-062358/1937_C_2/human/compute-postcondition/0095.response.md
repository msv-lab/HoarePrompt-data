Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop is defined as `for i in range(2, n):`.
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values:**
   - From the given state, `i` is initially `1`.
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop starts with `i = 2` and increments `i` until `i < n`.
   - Therefore, for the loop to start executing, `i` must be at least `2` and `n` must be greater than `2`.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since `i` is already set to `1`, it needs to be adjusted to `2` to meet the loop condition.
   - `n` must be greater than `2` for the loop to execute.

5. **Consider Other Variables:**
   - `best`, `k`, `res`, and `remaining_iterations` are not part of the loop head and do not affect the loop's execution directly. They can remain as they are.

Based on the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final State:**
State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2**
