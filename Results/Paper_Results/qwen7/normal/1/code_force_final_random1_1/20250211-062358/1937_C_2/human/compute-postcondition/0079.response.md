Based on the initial state provided:

- `best` is `n-1`
- `i` is `n-1`
- `k` is `n-1`
- `res` is an input string with the current value being '<'

The `print` statement is:
```python
print('?', k, best, k, i, flush=True)
```

Let's break down the values that will be printed:

- `'?'` is a literal string.
- `k` is `n-1`.
- `best` is `n-1`.
- `k` again is `n-1`.
- `i` is `n-1`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **'? n-1 n-1 n-1 n-1'**
