Output State: **`best` is 0, `res` is the final input provided by the user, `i` is `n`, `k` is `n-1`, and `n` is the input integer provided by the user.**

Explanation: The line `best = 0` initializes the variable `best` to 0. This does not affect the values of `res`, `i`, `k`, or `n`. Therefore, the output state retains the values of these variables as they were in the initial state, with `best` being explicitly set to 0.
