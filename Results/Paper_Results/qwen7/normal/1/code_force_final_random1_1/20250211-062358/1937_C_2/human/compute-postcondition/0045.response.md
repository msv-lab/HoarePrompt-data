Based on the initial state provided:

- `best` is `n-1`
- `i` is `n-1`
- `n` must be greater than `n-2`
- `k` is `1`
- `res` is an input string

The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`. Given that the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will end up being `n-1`.

- `best` is incremented by 1 each time `res` is '<', which it always is according to the given outputs. After `n-1` iterations, `best` will be `n-1`.
- `k` remains `1` (since `n-1` would make `k` equal to `n-1`, but the loop logic does not change `k`).

Therefore, when the print statement executes, it will print the values of `k`, `best`, and `flush=True`.

Output: **! 1 n-1**
