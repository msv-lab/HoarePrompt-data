Based on the initial state provided:

- `best` is explicitly given as 0.
- `i` is explicitly given as 1.
- `n` must be greater than `n-1`. This implies that `n` is at least 2 (since if `n` were 1, `n-1` would be 0, and `n` cannot be greater than 0).
- `k` is defined as `n-1`, so if `n` is at least 2, then `k` is at least 1.
- `res` is an input string, but its value is not relevant to the print statement.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', k, best, k, i, flush=True)
```

Given the values:
- `'?'` is a literal string.
- `k` is at least 1 (and could be any integer greater than or equal to 1).
- `best` is 0.
- `k` is at least 1 (same as above).
- `i` is 1.

Therefore, the print statement will output a string with these values. Since `k` is at least 1, we can describe it as `k` where `k` is at least 1.

Output: **'? 1 0 1 1'**
