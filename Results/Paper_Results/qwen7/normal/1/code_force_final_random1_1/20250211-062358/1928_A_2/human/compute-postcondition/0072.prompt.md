Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer, and it is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
        if a % 2 == 0:
            a1, a2 = a // 2, a // 2
            if a1 != b:
                print('Yes')
                continue
        if b % 2 == 0:
            b1, b2 = b // 2, b // 2
            if b1 != a:
                print('Yes')
                continue
        print('No')
    else:
        print('No')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input. If either `a` or `b` is even, `a` is divided by 2 and stored as `a1` and `a2`, and `b` is divided by 2 and stored as `b1`. If both `a` and `b` are odd, the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `_` is 1, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, and if `b` is even, `b` is divided by 2 and assigned to both `b1` and `b2`. If `b1` is not equal to `a`, the condition holds as is. If `b` is odd, `a` and `b` retain their original values from the input.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `t` is 9999, `_` is 2, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input. If either `a` or `b` is even, then `a` and `b` are each divided by 2, resulting in `a1` and `b1` respectively, both being `a // 2` and `b // 2`. If `b1` (which is `b // 2`) is not equal to `a`, the condition holds as specified. Otherwise, `t` remains 9999, `_` remains 2, and `a` and `b` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
