Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - It reads the dimensions `a` and `b` for each test case.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - If both `a` and `b` are even, the program prints 'yes'. This is correct because if both dimensions are even, you can always cut the rectangle into smaller rectangles and rearrange them to form a new rectangle.
   - The condition `(a - b == -a, a)` and `(b - a == -b, b)` seems incorrect. These conditions are not properly formatted and do not make sense in the context of the problem. They should be checked individually.
   - The condition `(a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0` is redundant and incorrect. The modulus operation `%` will always return an integer between 0 and the divisor minus 1, so `(a - b) % 2` will either be 0 or 1. The comparison `> 0 or < 0` is always true, which means this condition will always evaluate to `True`.

3. **Correct Conditions**:
   - If both `a` and `b` are odd, no matter how you cut the rectangle, you will end up with at least one dimension being odd, and thus, you cannot form a new rectangle without changing the parity of at least one dimension.
   - If one dimension is even and the other is odd, you can always cut the even dimension into two equal parts and rearrange them to form a new rectangle.

### Corrected Program Logic:
Based on the above analysis, the correct logic should be:
- If both `a` and `b` are even, print 'yes'.
- If one dimension is even and the other is odd, print 'yes'.
- Otherwise, print 'no'.

### Revised Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        elif a % 2 != b % 2:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')

func()
```

### Conclusion:
The original program has logical errors and incorrect conditions. After correcting the logic, the program should work as expected.

**Correctness: False**

The original program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.
