Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `_` is 1, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, `b1` is `b // 2`, `b2` is `b // 2`. If `b1` is not equal to `a`, the postcondition remains as is. Since there is no else part, the postcondition does not change regardless of the condition in the if statement.
