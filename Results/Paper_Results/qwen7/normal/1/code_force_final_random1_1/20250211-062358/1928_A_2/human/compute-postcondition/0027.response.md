Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is the first integer input, `b` is the second integer input, and `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.**

This postcondition remains the same for both the if and else parts since both parts do not change the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, or `i` beyond what is already stated in the precondition.
