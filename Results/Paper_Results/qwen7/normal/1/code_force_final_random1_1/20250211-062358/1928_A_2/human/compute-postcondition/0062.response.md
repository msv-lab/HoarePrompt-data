Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is 9999
- `_` is 2
- `a1` is `a // 2`
- `a2` is `a // 2`
- `b1` is `b // 2`
- `b2` is `b // 2`

However, the values of `a` and `b` are not explicitly given. Since the print statement only outputs the string `'Yes'`, and there is no reference to `a`, `b`, `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, or `b2` in the print statement itself, these variables do not affect the output.

Therefore, the output will simply be the string `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
