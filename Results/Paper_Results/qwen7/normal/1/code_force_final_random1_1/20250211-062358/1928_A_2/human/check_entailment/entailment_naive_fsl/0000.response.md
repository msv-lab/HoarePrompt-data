Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases according to the problem description. Specifically, the logic for determining whether Bob can obtain another rectangle is flawed.

Consider the following test case:
- Input: `2 4`

According to the problem description, a 2x4 rectangle can be cut into two 2x2 rectangles, and then these can be rearranged to form a 4x2 rectangle, which is different from the original 2x4 rectangle. However, the program incorrectly outputs 'no' for this case.

The issue lies in the conditions used to determine if a rectangle can be transformed into another. The current logic checks if both dimensions are even and if the difference between the dimensions is such that a valid transformation can occur. This logic is insufficient and does not cover all possible valid transformations.

A more accurate approach would involve checking if either dimension can be evenly divided by the other, allowing for the formation of a new rectangle through rearrangement.
