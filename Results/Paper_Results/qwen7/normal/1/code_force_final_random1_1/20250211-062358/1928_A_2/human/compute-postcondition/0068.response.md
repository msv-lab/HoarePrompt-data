Output: **No**

Explanation:
- The initial state provides us with the values of `t` and `_`, but these are not relevant to the `print` statement.
- The variables `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, and `b2` are defined as `a // 2` and `b // 2` respectively.
- The condition `if b1 != a:` is checked, but this condition is not necessary to determine the output of the `print` statement.
- The `print('No')` statement simply prints the string 'No' to the console, regardless of the values of other variables.

Therefore, the output is **No**.
