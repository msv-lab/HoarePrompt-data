Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `_` is 1, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, `b1` is `b // 2`, `b2` is `b // 2`.**

Explanation: The code assigns `b // 2` to both `b1` and `b2`. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `_`, `a`, or the condition regarding `a` being even and divided by 2. Therefore, these variables and conditions remain unchanged.
