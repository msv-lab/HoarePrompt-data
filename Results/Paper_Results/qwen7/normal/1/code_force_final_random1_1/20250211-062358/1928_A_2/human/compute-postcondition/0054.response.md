Output State: **`t` is 9999, `_` is 2, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, `a1` is `a // 2`, `a2` is `a // 2**.

Explanation: The initial state of `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and \(t = t - 1\). This means `t` is 10000 - 1 = 9999. The variable `_` remains 2. The variables `a` and `b` are integers from the input. The code assigns `a // 2` to both `a1` and `a2`. Therefore, `a1` and `a2` are each set to `a // 2`.
