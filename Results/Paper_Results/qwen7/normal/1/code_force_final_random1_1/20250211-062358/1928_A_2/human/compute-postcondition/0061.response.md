Output State: **`t` is 9999, `_` is 2, `a1` is `a // 2`, `a2` is `a // 2`, `b1` is `b // 2`, `b2` is `b // 2**.

Explanation: The code assigns `b // 2` to both `b1` and `b2`. Since the initial values of `t`, `_`, `a1`, `a2`, `b`, and the condition involving `a1` and `b` are not directly used in the assignment, these variables retain their initial states. Therefore, `t` remains 9999, `_` remains 2, `a1` remains `a // 2`, `a2` remains `a // 2`, and now `b1` and `b2` are both assigned the value of `b // 2`.
