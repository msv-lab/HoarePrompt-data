Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variable `j`, which is derived from `str(i)`. Therefore, the variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `j`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: The state before the loop starts is given as `i` is 400002.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will iterate over each character in the string representation of `i`. For this to happen, `i` must be a non-empty string. Since `i` is an integer, we need to convert it to a string to proceed with the loop.

4. **Adjust the state of `i`**: To ensure that the loop can execute, `i` must be a non-empty string. Converting the integer `400002` to a string gives us `"400002"`, which is a non-empty string.

5. **Determine the initial value of `j`**: The first iteration of the loop will set `j` to the first character of the string `"400002"`, which is `'4'`.

6. **Adjust the state of `j`**: Since the loop will start with `j` being the first character of the string, we need to ensure that `j` is initialized to `'4'`.

7. **Adjust the state of other variables**: The variables `N` and `pd[i]` are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted based on the loop execution.

Based on the above steps, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` should be converted to its string representation.
- `j` should be initialized to the first character of the string representation of `i`.

Therefore, the final state is:

**State: **`i` is "400002", `j` is "4"**
