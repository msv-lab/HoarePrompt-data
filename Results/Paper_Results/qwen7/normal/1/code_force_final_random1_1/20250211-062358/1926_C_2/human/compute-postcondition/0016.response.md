Output State: **`i` is "400002", `j` is "4", `pd['400002']` is `int('400002') + 4**.

In this case, the code updates the value of `pd['400002']` by adding the integer value of `j` (which is 4) to the existing value of `pd['400002']`. Since the initial value of `pd['400002']` is not specified, we assume it to be the integer value of `i` (which is 400002). Therefore, `pd['400002']` becomes 400006.
