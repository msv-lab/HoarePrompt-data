Output State: **`a` is equal to `num` modulo 10, `num` is a positive integer such that 0 <= num <= 20000, and `num` is the integer value of `num` divided by 10.**

Explanation: The value of `a` remains unchanged as it is calculated as `num % 10`. The value of `num` is updated to `int(num / 10)`, which means `num` is now the integer division of its original value by 10. The range of `num` is adjusted accordingly since dividing by 10 reduces the maximum possible value from 200000 to 20000.
