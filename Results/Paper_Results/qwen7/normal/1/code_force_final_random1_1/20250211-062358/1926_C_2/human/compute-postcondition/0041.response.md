Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is defined as `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable involved here is `t`.

2. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: `t` is 800003, `n` is an input integer.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: Since `t` is currently 800003 (which is greater than 0), the loop will execute again. We need to decrement `t` by 1 for the next iteration.

5. **Final state for the next iteration**: `t` will be 800002, and `n` remains an input integer (since it is not involved in the loop head).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`t` is 800002, `n` is an input integer**
