Output State: **`a` is equal to `3 * (num % 10)`, `num` is equal to `int(num / 10)`**

Explanation: The value of `a` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The code divides `num` by 10 and converts the result to an integer, updating the value of `num`. Therefore, `num` is now `int(num / 10)`. The initial condition that `num` must not be equal to 0 is still valid.
