### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies the key components of the program and their correctness. However, there are a few points to consider for a more detailed and thorough evaluation:

1. **Pre-computation Range**: The program precomputes the sum of digits for numbers up to 200,000. While this is efficient for handling the constraints \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), it might be overkill for smaller values of \(t\) where \(n\) is much smaller than 200,000. Nevertheless, this approach ensures that the precomputation is done only once and reused for multiple test cases.

2. **Function `func_1`**: The function `func_1` correctly computes the sum of digits of a number. The logic inside the function is sound and works as intended.

3. **Test Case Handling**: The program correctly handles the input and outputs the precomputed sum for the range of numbers from 1 to \(n\). This ensures that the solution is both efficient and accurate.

Given these points, the original assessment is accurate. The program meets the requirements of the problem and is correct in its implementation.

### Final Answer

Final: **True**

The program is correct and follows the problem description accurately.
