Output State: `a` is equal to the sum of all digits of `num`, and `num` is 0.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `num` will eventually become 0 because the loop divides `num` by 10 in each iteration until it reaches 0. During each iteration, the loop adds the last digit of `num` to `a`. Therefore, by the end of the loop, `a` will contain the sum of all digits of the original `num`.
