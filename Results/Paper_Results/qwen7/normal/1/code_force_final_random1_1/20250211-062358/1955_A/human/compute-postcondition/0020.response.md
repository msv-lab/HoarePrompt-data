Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 1, `A` is an integer obtained from the first input value, `B` is an integer obtained from the second input value, `C` is an integer obtained from the third input value, `X` is `A // 2`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `A // 2` to the variable `X`. The floor division operator `//` divides `A` by 2 and rounds down to the nearest whole number. The values of `t`, `i`, `A`, `B`, and `C` remain unchanged from their initial states.
