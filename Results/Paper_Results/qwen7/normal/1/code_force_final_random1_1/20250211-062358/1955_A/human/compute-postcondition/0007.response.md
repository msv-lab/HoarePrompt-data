Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is 0.
- `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces.
- \(B \times 2\) is greater than or equal to `C`.
- The current value of `A` is even.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(int(A * C / 2))
```

Given that `A` is even, let's denote the value of `A` as some even integer, say `A = 2k` where `k` is an integer. The value of `C` is an integer obtained from the input, and there is no restriction on its parity (even or odd).

The expression inside the `print` function is `int(A * C / 2)`. Since `A` is even, `A * C` will always result in an even number (because the product of any integer with an even number is even). Dividing an even number by 2 results in an integer, and converting it to `int` does not change its value.

Therefore, the output will be the integer value of half of `A * C`.

Output: **int(A * C / 2)**
