Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\). For each test case, it calculates and prints one of three possible outputs based on the values of \(A\) and \(B\) relative to \(C\):
- If \(2B < C\), it prints \(A \times B\).
- If \(2B \geq C\) and \(A\) is even, it prints \(\frac{A \times C}{2}\).
- If \(2B \geq C\) and \(A\) is odd, it prints \(\left\lfloor \frac{A}{2} \right\rfloor \times C + B\).

After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints the calculated outputs for each test case.**
