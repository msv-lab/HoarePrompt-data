Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces**.

Explanation: The code `A, B, C = map(int, input().split())` takes three integers as input separated by spaces and assigns them to variables `A`, `B`, and `C`. The initial values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. The precondition that `int(input())` must be greater than 0 is implicitly satisfied by the `map(int, ...)` function, which ensures that the input is converted to integers.
