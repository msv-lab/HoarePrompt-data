Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 2, `A` is an integer obtained from the first input value, `B` is an integer obtained from the second input value, `C` is an integer obtained from the third input value.**

Explanation: The code `A, B, C = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to variables `A`, `B`, and `C`. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states. The values of `A`, `B`, and `C` are now specific integers obtained from the input.
