Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
   - `i` is 0
   - `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `i` in the range of an integer input.
   - This means the loop will run `int(input())` times.

3. **Loop Body:**
   - The loop body is omitted, but we know the conditions based on the postconditions given.

4. **Postconditions Based on Conditions Inside the Loop:**
   - If `B * 2 < C`, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.
   - If `B * 2 ≥ C` and `A` is an even integer, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.
   - If `B * 2 ≥ C` and `A` is an odd integer, then `X` is set to `A` divided by 2.

5. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - The only variable in the loop head is `i`.
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - The values of `t`, `A`, `B`, and `C` remain unchanged unless they are modified within the loop body, which is not specified here.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 1, `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces.**
