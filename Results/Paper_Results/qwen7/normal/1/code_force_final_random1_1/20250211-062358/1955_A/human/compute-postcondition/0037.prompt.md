You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        A, B, C = map(int, input().split())
        
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has completed all its iterations, with `i` being equal to the total number of test cases specified by `t`. For each test case, the variables `A`, `B`, and `C` are the integers obtained from the corresponding input. The output of each iteration is determined based on the conditions provided within the loop:
    #
    #- If `B * 2 < C`, the output is `A * B`.
    #- If `B * 2 >= C` and `A` is even, the output is `int(A * C / 2)`.
    #- If `B * 2 >= C` and `A` is odd, the output is `X * C + B`, where `X = A // 2`.
    #
    #All other variables outside the loop, including `t`, remain unchanged from their initial or previous states after the loop completes.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each t, it processes three integers n, a, and b (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30). The function does not return a value explicitly but processes the given test cases based on the provided constraints.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
