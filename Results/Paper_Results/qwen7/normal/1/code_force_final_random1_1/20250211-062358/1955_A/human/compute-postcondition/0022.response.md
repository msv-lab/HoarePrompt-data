Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 1, `A` is an integer obtained from the first input value, `B` is an integer obtained from the second input value, `C` is an integer obtained from the third input value. If `A` is even, `X` is set to `A // 2`. If `A` is odd, `X` remains unchanged.**
