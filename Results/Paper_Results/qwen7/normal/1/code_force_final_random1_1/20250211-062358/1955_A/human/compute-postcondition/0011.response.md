Output: **(A // 2) * C + B**

Explanation:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is initialized to 0.
- `A`, `B`, and `C` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces.
- It is given that \(B \times 2 \geq C\), and `A` is an odd integer.
- `X` is defined as `A` divided by 2, which in Python is `A // 2` (integer division).

When the expression `X * C + B` is evaluated:
- `X` is `A // 2`.
- The expression becomes `(A // 2) * C + B`.

Thus, the output is \((A // 2) * C + B\).
