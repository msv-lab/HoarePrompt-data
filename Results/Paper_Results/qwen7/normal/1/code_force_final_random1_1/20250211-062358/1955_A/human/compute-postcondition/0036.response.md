Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each t, it processes three integers n, a, and b (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30). The function does not return a value explicitly but processes the given test cases based on the provided constraints.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing specific integers within given ranges, without returning any direct output from the function itself.
