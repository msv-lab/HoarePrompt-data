Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integers \( n \) and \( m \). For each test case, it calculates a result based on \( n \) and updates it according to a specific formula involving \( m \). The function prints the final result for each test case. After processing all test cases, it ensures that the sum of \( n \) and \( m \) across all test cases does not exceed \( 2 \times 10^6 \).**
