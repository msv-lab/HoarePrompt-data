Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and converts them into integers, assigning the first integer to `n` and the second integer to `m`. The initial value of `t` remains unchanged, and `i` is also unchanged. Therefore, the updated states of `t` and `i` are as described, along with the new variables `n` and `m` which hold the input integers.
