Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes values for `t`, `n`, and `m` where `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, and for each test case, `n` and `m` are positive integers between 1 and 2⋅10^6. The function returns a result based on the conditions specified for `n` and `m`, ensuring the sum of `n` and `m` across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^6.**

This means the function indirectly accepts a series of test cases defined by `t`, `n`, and `m` and returns a result based on the given constraints and relationships between these parameters.
