You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        count = 2
        ans = n
        while count <= m:
            countmins = int(count - 1)
            g = int(n / count)
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += int(g / count) + 1
            count += 1
        print(int(ans))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6. It is also guaranteed that the sum of n and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^6.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        count = 2
        
        ans = n
        
        while count <= m:
            countmins = int(count - 1)
            g = int(n / count)
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += int(g / count) + 1
            count += 1
        
        print(int(ans))
        
    #State: Output State: `count` is equal to `m + 1`, `i` is equal to `t - 1`, `n` is the input integer provided by the user, `m` is the input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^4, `countmins` is equal to `m`, `g` is 0, and `ans` is the initial value of `n` plus the sum of the contributions from each iteration of the loop for all `i` from 0 to `t - 1`.
    #
    #In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the following will be true:
    #- `count` will be `m + 1` because the loop increments `count` until it exceeds `m`.
    #- `i` will be `t - 1` because the loop iterates `t` times, and `i` is the loop counter.
    #- `n` will remain the input integer provided by the user.
    #- `m` will remain the input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^4.
    #- `countmins` will be `m` because it is initialized as `count - 1` and `count` becomes `m + 1` at the end of the loop.
    #- `g` will be 0 because the loop breaks when `g` becomes less than `countmins`.
    #- `ans` will be the initial value of `n` plus the sum of the series where each term is `int(int(n / i) / i) + 1` for `i` ranging from 2 to `m`, inclusive, for all iterations of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integers \( n \) and \( m \). For each test case, it calculates a result based on \( n \) and updates it according to a specific formula involving \( m \). The function prints the final result for each test case. After processing all test cases, it ensures that the sum of \( n \) and \( m \) across all test cases does not exceed \( 2 \times 10^6 \).


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program attempts to count valid pairs (a, b) based on a simplified approach that does not fully adhere to the conditions specified in the problem description.

To illustrate, consider the test case \( n = 10 \) and \( m = 8 \):

- According to the problem, we need to count pairs (a, b) such that \( 1 \le a \le n \), \( 1 \le b \le m \), and \( a + b \) is a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \).

However, the program's logic does not correctly handle this condition. For instance, the pair (2, 2) should satisfy the condition because \( 2 + 2 = 4 \) and \( 2 \cdot \gcd(2, 2) = 2 \cdot 2 = 4 \). But the program incorrectly counts such pairs.

The program uses a loop to incrementally check values of `count` and calculates `g` as `int(n / count)`, which does not accurately reflect the necessary conditions for the pairs. This approach fails to properly account for the gcd and the multiple condition, leading to incorrect results.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, making it incorrect.
