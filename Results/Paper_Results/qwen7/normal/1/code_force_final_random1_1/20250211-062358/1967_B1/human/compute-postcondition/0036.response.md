Based on the initial state provided:

- `count` is equal to `m + 1`.
- `i` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `countmins` is `m - 1`.
- `g` is `int(n / (m + 1)) - m + 1`.
- `ans` is `n + the sum of [int(int(n / i) / i) + 1 for i in range(2, m + 1)]`.

The print statement is `print(int(ans))`. We need to focus on the value of `ans`.

Given the formula for `ans`:
\[ \text{ans} = n + \sum_{i=2}^{m} \left( \text{int}\left(\frac{\text{n}}{i}\right) / i \right) + 1 \]

This means `ans` is `n` plus the sum of the terms where each term is the integer division of `n` by `i`, then divided by `i`, and finally incremented by 1, for all `i` from 2 to `m`.

Since the exact values of `n` and `m` are not specified, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, we know that `ans` is constructed based on these operations.

Therefore, the print statement will output the integer value of `ans`.

Output: **int(ans) (where ans is n + the sum of [int(int(n / i) / i) + 1 for i in range(2, m + 1)])**
