Output State: **`total` is 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `m` is at least 4, `count` is 2, `countmins` is 1, `g` is `int(n / 2)`, `ans` is `2n + 2`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `g` to be the integer division of `n` by `count`. Since `count` is 2, `g` becomes `int(n / 2)`. The other variables remain unchanged.
