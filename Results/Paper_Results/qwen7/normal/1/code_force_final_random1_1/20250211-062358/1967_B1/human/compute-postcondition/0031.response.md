Output State: **`countmins` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` must be at least 5, `count` is 4, `ans` is `n + int(int(n / 2) - 1 / 2) + 1 + int(int(n / 3) / 3) + 1`, `g` is `int(n / 4)` - 3.**

Explanation: The variable `g` is decremented by `countmins`, which is 3. Therefore, `g` becomes `int(n / 4) - 3`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
