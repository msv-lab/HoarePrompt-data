The code `ans = n` simply reassigns the value of `ans` to be equal to `n`. The value of `n` is an input integer, so `ans` is now also an input integer. The other variables (`count`, `i`, `m`, `countmins`, `g`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`count` is 2, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is the input integer from the second input, `countmins` is `m - 1`, `g` is `int(n / (m + 1)) - m + 1`, `ans` is an input integer**
