Output State: **`countmins` is 3, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` must be at least 5, `count` is 4, `ans` is `n + int(int(n / 2) - 1 / 2) + 1 + int(int(n / 3) / 3) + 1`, `g` is `int(n / 3)`, `g` is also updated to `int(n / 4)`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `g` to `int(n / 4)`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `g` now holds the value of `int(n / 4)`.
