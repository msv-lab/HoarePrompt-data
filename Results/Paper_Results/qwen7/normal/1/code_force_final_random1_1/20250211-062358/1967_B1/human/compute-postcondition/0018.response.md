Output State: **`countmins` is 2, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` must be at least 4, `count` is 3, `ans` is `n + int(int(n / 2) - 1 / 2) + 1`, `g` is `int(n / 2) - 1`, `g` is now `int(n / count)`**

Explanation: The variable `g` is reassigned to the value of `int(n / count)`. Given that `count` is 3, `g` is now calculated as `int(n / 3)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
