Output State: **`count` is 2, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` must be at least 3, `countmins` is 2, `g` is `int(n / 2) - 1`, `ans` is `ans + int((int(n / 2) - 1) / 2) + 1, `g` is now `int(n / 2)`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `g` to `int(n / count)`. Given that `count` is 2, `g` becomes `int(n / 2)`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states.
