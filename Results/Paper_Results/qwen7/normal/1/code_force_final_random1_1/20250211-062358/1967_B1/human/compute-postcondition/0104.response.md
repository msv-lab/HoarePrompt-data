Output State: **`total` is 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `m` is at least 4, `count` is 3, `countmins` is 1, `g` is `int(n / 2) - 1`, `ans` is `ans + int(g / count) + 1**.

Explanation: The code `count += 1` increments the value of `count` by 1. Initially, `count` was 2, so after executing this line, `count` becomes 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
