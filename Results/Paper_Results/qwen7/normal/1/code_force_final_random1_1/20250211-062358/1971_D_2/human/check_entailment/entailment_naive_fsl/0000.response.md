Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle cases where the binary string has multiple segments of '0's and '1's that need to be separated. For example, consider the input "010101". The program will incorrectly count this as needing only 2 pieces ('01' and '01'), but the correct answer is 3 pieces ('0', '10', '1'). This is because the string needs to be split at each transition from '0' to '1' and vice versa, and the program does not account for this properly.
