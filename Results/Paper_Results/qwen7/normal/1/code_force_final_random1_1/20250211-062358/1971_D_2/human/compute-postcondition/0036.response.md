Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `s` is an input string, `count` is equal to `len(s)`, `flag` is True, `j` is equal to `len(s) - 1`.**

Explanation: Since the `else` part is empty, the `if` part must always execute. Given the precondition and the fact that the loop increments `count` for every pair of consecutive characters in the string `s` where the first character is '0' and the second character is '1', plus any other pairs that did not cause a change in `count`, `count` will be incremented `len(s) - 1` times. Additionally, `flag` is set to True at least once during the loop, ensuring its value remains True. Therefore, after the execution of the if statement, `count` will be equal to `len(s)`, `flag` will remain True, and the other variables (`t`, `s`, and `j`) will retain their values from the precondition.
