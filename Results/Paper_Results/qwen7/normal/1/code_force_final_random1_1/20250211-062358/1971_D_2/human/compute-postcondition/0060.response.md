Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `s` is a new input string with length at least 2, `count` is either 3 or remains 2, `flag` is True, `j` must be less than `len(s) - 1`. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[j + 1]`, then `count` is incremented by 1 to become 3. If `s[j]` is equal to `s[j + 1]`, the variables remain unchanged.
