Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `t`.
2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**: 
   - `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means `t` is an integer input from the user.
   - The value of `t` is between 1 and 500, inclusive.
3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i < t`. Therefore, `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to start executing.

Given this information, we need to adjust the state such that the loop can start executing. Specifically, `t` must be greater than 0.

**State after adjustment**:
- `t` must be greater than 0 (since it is an integer between 1 and 500, inclusive, this condition is inherently satisfied).

Since `i` is initialized to 0 at the beginning of the loop, no adjustments are needed for `i`.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
