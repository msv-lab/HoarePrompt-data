### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum number of cuts required to rearrange a binary string into a sorted binary string.
   - A sorted binary string has all '0's before all '1's.
   - Each character must lie in exactly one piece, and the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the binary string `a`.
   - It initializes two counters `cut0` and `cut1` to count the number of transitions from '0' to '1' and from '1' to '0', respectively.
   - It iterates through the string `a` and increments the respective counter when it encounters a transition.
   - After counting the transitions, it checks if there are no transitions from '0' to '1'. If so, it prints `cut1 + 1`. Otherwise, it prints `cut0 + cut1`.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - **Case 1:** If there are no transitions from '0' to '1', the string is already sorted. In this case, we need to count the number of '1's (since each '1' can be a separate piece) plus one additional piece for the '0's at the beginning. This logic is correct.
   - **Case 2:** If there are transitions from '0' to '1', the number of pieces required will be the sum of the transitions from '0' to '1' and from '1' to '0'. This is because each transition indicates a boundary where a new piece starts, and we need to account for both directions of transitions.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases like an empty string or a string with only '0's or '1's correctly.
   - It also correctly handles strings with multiple transitions.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of pieces required to rearrange the binary string into a sorted binary string.

### Correctness:
**True**
