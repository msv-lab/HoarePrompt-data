Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and interacts with an external entity to determine a permutation \( p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} \) through a series of queries. It asks questions in the form of four indices \(a, b, c, d\) and receives a comparison result based on bitwise OR operations. The goal is to find indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized within 3n queries.**
