Based on the initial state and the provided explanation, let's break down the variables:

- `best` is `n-1`
- `i` is `1`
- `k` is `n-1`
- `res` is an input string

The print statement is:
```python
print('!', k, best, flush=True)
```

Given the values of the variables:
- `k` is `n-1`
- `best` is `n-1`

So, the print statement will output:
Output: **! (n-1) (n-1)**
