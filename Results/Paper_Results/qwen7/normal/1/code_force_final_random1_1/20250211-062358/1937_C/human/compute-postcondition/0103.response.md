Based on the initial state provided:

- `res` is the input provided by the user.
- `i` is explicitly given as 3.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, but its exact value is not specified.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print('?', 0, k, 0, i, flush=True)
```

Here, `k` is not defined in the initial state, so it cannot be determined precisely. Therefore, `k` will remain as a placeholder in the output.

Given the information, the output will include the string `'?'`, followed by the integer `0`, then `k`, another `0`, and finally the integer `3`.

Output: **'? 0 k 0 3'**
