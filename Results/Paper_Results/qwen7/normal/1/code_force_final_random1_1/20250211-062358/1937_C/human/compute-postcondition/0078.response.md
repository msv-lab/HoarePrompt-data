Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n` (exclusive), meaning `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `best` is `n-1`
   - `i` is `n-1`
   - `k` is `n-1`
   - `res` is an input string with the current value being '<'

4. **Determine if the loop can execute again**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Currently, `i` is `n-1`, so the loop cannot execute again because `i` is already equal to `n-1`.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since the loop cannot execute again, no changes are needed for `i` or `n`.
   - The other variables (`best`, `k`, and `res`) remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration (which in this case does not exist since the loop cannot execute again) remains the same.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`best` is `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `k` is `n-1`, `res` is an input string with the current value being '<'**
