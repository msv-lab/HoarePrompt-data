Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the `for i in range(1, n):` statement. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `best` is 1
   - `res` is '<'
   - `i` is 1
   - `k` is `n-1`
   - `n` is the input integer provided by the user

3. **Determine the Next State for `i`**:
   - The loop increments `i` by 1 each time it iterates.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`, which means `i` will be 2.

4. **Determine the Condition for the Loop to Continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n`.
   - Since `i` is now 2, the loop will continue if `2 < n`.

5. **Adjust the State**:
   - `best` remains unchanged at 1.
   - `res` remains unchanged at '<'.
   - `i` changes to 2.
   - `k` remains unchanged at `n-1`.
   - `n` remains the same as the input integer provided by the user.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `best` is 1, `res` is '<', `i` is 2, `k` is `n-1`, and `n` is the input integer provided by the user.**
