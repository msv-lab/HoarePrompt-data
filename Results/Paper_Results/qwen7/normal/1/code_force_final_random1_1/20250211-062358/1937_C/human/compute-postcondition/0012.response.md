Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `res` is an input string**

The code assigns the value of `input()` to the variable `res`. Since the initial state of `i` and `n` does not change, they remain as `i` is 3 and `n` must be greater than 3. The variable `res` is assigned the value returned by the `input()` function, which is a string.
