Based on the initial state provided:

- `best` is explicitly given as 0.
- `res` is the final input provided by the user, but its value is not needed for the print statement.
- `i` is explicitly given as 1.
- `k` is `n-1`, where `n` is the input integer provided by the user.
- `n` is the input integer provided by the user.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', k, best, k, i, flush=True)
```

Let's break down the values to be printed:
- `'?'` is a literal string.
- `k` is `n-1`.
- `best` is 0.
- `k` again is `n-1`.
- `i` is 1.

Therefore, the print statement will output:
Output: **'? [n-1] 0 [n-1] 1'**
