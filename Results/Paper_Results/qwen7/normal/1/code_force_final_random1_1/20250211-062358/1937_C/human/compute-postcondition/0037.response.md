Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current values**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n-1` (inclusive). This means `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 until it reaches `n-1`.

4. **Check if the loop can continue**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, the next value `i` would take is 3.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Given that `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to continue.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so it becomes 3.
   - `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to continue.

6. **Other variables**:
   - `best` is 2 and its value does not change based on the loop condition.
   - `k` is 1 and its value does not change based on the loop condition.
   - `res` is an input string and its value does not change based on the loop condition.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final State**:
State: **`best` is 2, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 2, `k` is 1, `res` is an input string**
