Output State: **`n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The initial state of `n` being undefined is replaced by `n` holding the integer value of the input provided by the user. All other variables remain unaffected, so they retain their initial state, which in this case is undefined for any other variables mentioned.
