Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `i` is explicitly stated to be 2.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', 0, k, 0, i, flush=True)
```

Here's the breakdown:
- `'?'` is a string literal.
- `0` is an integer literal.
- `k` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its value. It will be represented as `k` in the output.
- `0` is another integer literal.
- `i` is explicitly given as 2.

Therefore, the output will include the string `'?'`, followed by `0`, then `k`, then another `0`, and finally `2`.

Output: **'? 0 k 0 2'**
