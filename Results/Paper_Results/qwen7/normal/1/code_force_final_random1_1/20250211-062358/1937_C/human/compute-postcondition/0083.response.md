Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `best` is `i`
   - `i` is `n-1`
   - `k` is `n-1`
   - `res` is an input string, and if `res` equals '<', then no change occurs.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for values of `i` from 1 to `n-1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n-1`.

4. **Determine the next state for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 and should be within the range of 1 to `n-1`.
   - Since `i` was `n-1` at the end of the previous iteration, incrementing `i` by 1 would make it `n`, which is out of the range `1` to `n-1`. Therefore, the loop cannot execute again under these conditions.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since the loop cannot execute again, we do not need to change the value of `i`.
   - The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - The variables `best`, `k`, and `res` remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by the loop condition.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration (which in this case is the end of the loop since the loop cannot execute again) remains the same as the state at the end of the previous iteration.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`best` is `i`, `i` is `n-1`, `k` is `n-1`, `res` is an input string, if `res` equals '<', then no change occurs.**
