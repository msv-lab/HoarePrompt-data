Output State: **`best` is `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `k` is `n-1`, `res` is an input string, and the current value of `res` is '<'**

Explanation: The line `best = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is `n-1`) to the variable `best`. All other variables (`i`, `k`, and `res`) remain unchanged. Therefore, `best` is now `n-1`, while `i`, `k`, and `res` retain their original values.
