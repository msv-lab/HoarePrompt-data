Output State: **`best` is `n-1`, `i` is `1`, `k` is `n-1`, `res` is an input string, `remaining_iterations` is `int(input()) - 1`, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input to the variable `n`. All other variables (`best`, `i`, `k`, `res`, and `remaining_iterations`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The input for `n` is taken as an integer.
