The function processes an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4) by calling auxiliary functions `func_1` and `func_2`. It first determines the maximum index that satisfies a certain condition using `func_1`, then identifies all indices that satisfy another condition relative to the maximum index, and finally finds the minimum index among these satisfying indices. The function concludes by calling `func_2` with the determined maximum and minimum indices.
