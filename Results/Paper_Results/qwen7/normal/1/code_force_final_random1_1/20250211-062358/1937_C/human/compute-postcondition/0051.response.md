Output: **'? 0 1 0 2'**

Explanation:
- `best` is `n-1`. Since `n` is greater than 2, `best` is at least 1.
- `i` is `2`.
- `k` is `1`.
- `res` is an input string, but its value is not needed for this specific print statement.
- The print statement uses these values to form the string `'? 0 1 0 2'`.

Therefore, the print statement will output the string `'? 0 1 0 2'`.
