Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when the hour is exactly 12 correctly. According to the problem description, when the hour is 12 in the 24-hour format, it should be represented as "12:xx PM" in the 12-hour format. However, the current implementation does not distinguish between "12:xx AM" and "12:xx PM". For example, if the input is "12:00", the program will output "12:00 AM" instead of "12:00 PM".

To fix this, we need to add a condition to check if the hour is 12 and set the suffix accordingly. Here is the corrected version:

```python
def func_1():
    for t in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        h = s[:2]
        if h == '00':
            print('12', end='')
        elif int(h) == 12:
            print('12', end='')
        elif int(h) <= 12:
            print(h, end='')
        else:
            print('0{}'.format(int(h) - 12), end='')
        print(s[2:], ['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12])
```

This ensures that the hour 12 is correctly converted to "12:xx PM" when needed.
