### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case one by one.
2. **Hour Conversion**:
   - For `h == '00'`, it correctly prints `12`.
   - For `h` between `'01'` and `'12'`, it prints `h` directly.
   - For `h` between `'13'` and `'23'`, it calculates the 12-hour equivalent by subtracting 12 and prepends a zero if necessary (`'0{}'`).
3. **AM/PM Determination**:
   - If `h` is greater than or equal to `'12'`, it appends `'PM'`.
   - Otherwise, it appends `'AM'`.

However, there are a few issues in the code that need to be addressed:

- **Incorrect Output Formatting**: The program uses `print` without specifying the separator, which can lead to unexpected outputs. It should use `print` with a space separator.
- **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle leading zeros for hours properly. For example, `'01'` should be printed as `'01'` instead of `'1'`.

Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
def func_1():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        h = s[:2]
        if h == '00':
            print('12', end=' ')
        elif h == '12':
            print('12', end=' ')
        else:
            print('0' + str(int(h) - 12) if int(h) > 12 else h, end=' ')
        print(s[2:] + ['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12])
```

### Correctness:
After addressing the issues mentioned above, the program should work correctly according to the problem statement.

**Correctness: **True**
