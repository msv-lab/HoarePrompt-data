Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `t` is an integer.
   - `s` is a new string input by the user.
   - `h` is the first two characters of `s`.

2. **Condition**:
   - If `h` is '00', no changes are made to `t` and `s`.
   - Otherwise, no changes are made to `t` and `s`.

3. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(s[2:], ['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12])
   ```

4. **Analysis**:
   - `s[2:]`: This slice operation extracts the substring starting from the third character (index 2) of the string `s`.
   - `['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12]`: This expression evaluates to either `'AM'` or `'PM'` based on the condition `int(h) >= 12`. Since `h` is the first two characters of `s`, it will be a string. When converted to an integer using `int()`, if `h` is '00', it becomes 0; otherwise, it will be a non-zero integer.

Given the condition, `h` cannot be '00' because if it were, no changes would be made to `t` and `s`. Therefore, `int(h)` will be a non-zero integer.

- If `int(h) >= 12`, then `int(h) >= 12` is `True`, and `['AM', 'PM'][True]` will evaluate to `'PM'`.
- If `int(h) < 12`, then `int(h) >= 12` is `False`, and `['AM', 'PM'][False]` will evaluate to `'AM'`.

Since `h` cannot be '00', the output will always be one of `'AM'` or `'PM'`.

5. **Final Output**:
   - `s[2:]` will be the substring of `s` starting from the third character.
   - The second part of the `print` statement will be either `'AM'` or `'PM'`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **[substring of s starting from index 2], ['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12]**
