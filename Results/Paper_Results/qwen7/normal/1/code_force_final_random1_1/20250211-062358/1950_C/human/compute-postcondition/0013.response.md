Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is the string input by the user, `h` is the first two characters of `s`. If `h` is '00', then `h` is set to '00'. Otherwise, `h` is not '00', and if `int(h)` is less than or equal to 12, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition. If `int(h)` is greater than 12, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.
