Reasoning:
- The program correctly handles the conversion of 24-hour format times to 12-hour format times.
- It correctly identifies whether the time is in the AM or PM period based on the hour.
- The program handles edge cases such as "00:00" and "12:00" appropriately.
- The logic for converting hours is correct:
  - If the hour is '00', it prints '12'.
  - If the hour is between '01' and '12', it prints the hour as is.
  - If the hour is between '13' and '23', it subtracts 12 from the hour and adds a leading zero if necessary.
- The program correctly appends "AM" or "PM" based on whether the hour is greater than or equal to 12.
- The program prints the minutes part without any issues.
- The overall structure and logic of the program align with the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
