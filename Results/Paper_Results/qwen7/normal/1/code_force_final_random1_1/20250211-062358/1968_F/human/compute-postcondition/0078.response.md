Output State: **`total` remains 0, `t` is an integer value from `data[0]`, `results` is either `['YES', 'YES', 'YES', 'YES']` or `['YES', 'YES', 'YES', 'NO']`, `n` is an integer value from `data[2]` and must be greater than 4, `q` is an integer value from `data[4]` and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element from `a[1]` to `a[n+1]` is equal to `int(data[idx - n + i])` for `i` from 1 to `n + 1`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `pf[i]` is calculated as `pf[i-1] ^ a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n + 1`, `mp` is a dictionary with key (0) and value [0], `i` is `n + 1`, `idx` is increased by 2, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is the value retrieved from `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is the value retrieved from `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the result of `bisect.bisect_left(v1, l)`, `it2` is the result of `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`, `l` is an integer value from `data[idx]`, `r` is an integer value from `data[idx + 1]`, `v1` is updated to the value retrieved from `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is the value retrieved from `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it2` is the result of `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`, `l` is updated to an integer value from `data[idx]`, `r` is an integer value from `data[idx + 1]`, `idx` is increased by 2.**

Explanation: The line `idx += 2` simply increments the value of `idx` by 2. It does not affect any other variables or their values. Therefore, all the previous states remain unchanged except for `idx`, which is now `idx + 2`.
