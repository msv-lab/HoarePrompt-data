Output State: **`q` is a positive integer, `idx` is increased by 2, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`.**

Explanation: 
- The variable `q` remains a positive integer as no operation changes its value.
- The variable `idx` is increased by 2.
- The variable `x` is assigned the result of the bitwise XOR operation between `pf[r]` and `pf[l - 1]`.
