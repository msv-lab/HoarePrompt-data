The code appends 'NO' to the `results` list. This operation does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the values of `q`, `idx`, `l`, `r`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it2`, and `data` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`q` must be greater than 1, `idx` is increased by 4, `l` is an integer value from `data[idx]`, `r` is an integer value from `data[idx + 1]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it2` is the index of the position just before the first occurrence of `r` in `v2`, `l` is an integer value from `data[idx]`, `v1` is the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `it2` is `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`, `results` contains 'NO'.**
