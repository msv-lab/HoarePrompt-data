Output State: **`q` must be greater than 1, `idx` is increased by 4, `l` is an integer value from `data[idx - 2]`, `r` is now an integer value from `data[idx + 1]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it2` is the index of the position just before the first occurrence of `r` in `v2`, and `l` is updated to an integer value from `data[idx]`**.

Explanation: The code `idx += 2` increases the value of `idx` by 2. Initially, `idx` was increased by 2, so now it is increased by 4 in total. All other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.
