Output State: **All iterations of the loop have completed, `q` is a non-negative integer (since it decreases by 1 each iteration until it reaches 0), `idx` is equal to its initial value plus 24 times the number of iterations, `results` is a list containing either 'YES' or 'NO' for each query based on the conditions specified in the loop, `l` and `r` are the last values assigned within the loop, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` and `v2` are lists retrieved from `mp.get(pf[r], [])` and `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])` respectively, and `it1` and `it2` are indices used to check the conditions for appending 'YES' or 'NO' to `results`.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop have completed:
- The variable `q` will be 0 since it decreases by 1 with each iteration until it reaches 0.
- The variable `idx` will be its initial value (which is `n+1`) plus 24 times the number of iterations, because `idx` increases by 2 with each iteration.
- The `results` list will contain 'YES' or 'NO' for each query based on whether the conditions in the loop were satisfied.
- The variables `l` and `r` will hold the values of the last pair of indices processed.
- The variables `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, and `it2` will reflect the state after the last iteration of the loop.
