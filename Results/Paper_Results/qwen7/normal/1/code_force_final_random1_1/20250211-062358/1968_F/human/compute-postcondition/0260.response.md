Output State: **`q` is a positive integer and will be `q - 1`, `idx` is equal to the original `idx` plus 24, `l` is reassigned the value `int(data[idx])`, `r` is assigned the value `int(data[idx + 1])`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, and the list `results` has 'YES' appended to it, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it2` is the index of the leftmost insertion point of `r` in the sorted list `v2` minus 1.**

Explanation: 
- The code appends 'YES' to the list `results`. This does not change the values of any variables except for `results`.
- All other variables (`q`, `idx`, `l`, `r`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it2`) remain unchanged from their previous values.
