Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `idx` is 6 + n, `t` is an integer value from `data[0]`, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer value from `data[2]` and must be greater than 4, `q` is an integer value from `data[4]`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element from `a[1]` to `a[n+1]` is equal to `int(data[idx - n + i])` for `i` from 1 to `n + 1`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `pf[i]` is calculated as `pf[i-1] ^ a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n + 1`, `mp` is a dictionary with key (0) and value [0], and `i` is `n + 1`, `mp[pf[n+1]]` is a list containing the value `n + 1`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `idx` will be equal to the initial value plus the total number of elements in the list `a`. The list `a` will contain the integer values from `data` starting from index 6 up to the end of the data list. The list `pf` will contain the cumulative XOR results of the elements in `a`. The dictionary `mp` will map the final `pf` value to the list `[n + 1]`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(q):
    l = int(data[idx])
    r = int(data[idx + 1])
    idx += 2
    x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]
    if x == 0:
        results.append('YES')
        continue
    v1 = mp.get(pf[r], [])
    v2 = mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])
    it1 = bisect.bisect_left(v1, l)
    it2 = bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
    if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] <= r and v2[it2] >= l:
        results.append('YES')
    else:
        results.append('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `total` is 0, `t` is an integer value from `data[0]`, `results` is either ['YES', 'YES'] or ['YES', 'NO'], `n` is an integer value from `data[2]` and must be greater than 4, `q` is an integer value from `data[4]` and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element from `a[1]` to `a[n+1]` is equal to `int(data[idx - n + i])` for `i` from 1 to `n + 1`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `pf[i]` is calculated as `pf[i-1] ^ a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n + 1`, `mp` is a dictionary with key (0) and value [0], `i` is `n + 1`, `idx` is increased by 2, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is the value retrieved from `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is the value retrieved from `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the result of `bisect.bisect_left(v1, r)`, `it2` is the result of `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`, and the condition `(it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] <= r) and (v2[it2] >= l))` is either true or false.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `total` remains 0, `t` is an integer value from `data[0]`, `results` is either ['YES', 'YES', 'YES', 'YES'] or ['YES', 'YES', 'YES', 'NO'], `n` is an integer value from `data[2]` and must be greater than 4, `q` is an integer value from `data[4]` and must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element from `a[1]` to `a[n+1]` is equal to `int(data[idx - n + i])` for `i` from 1 to `n + 1`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `pf[i]` is calculated as `pf[i-1] ^ a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n + 1`, `mp` is a dictionary with key (0) and value [0], `i` is `n + 1`, `idx` is increased by 2, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is the value retrieved from `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is the value retrieved from `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the result of `bisect.bisect_left(v1, l)`, `it2` is the result of `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`, `l` is an integer value from `data[idx]`, `r` is an integer value from `data[idx + 1]`, `v1` is updated to the value retrieved from `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is the value retrieved from `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])` and `it2` is the result of `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `total` remains 0, `t` is an integer value from `data[0]`, `results` has an additional `'YES'` or `'NO'` appended to it depending on the condition, `n` is an integer value from `data[2]` and must be greater than 4, `q` is an integer value from `data[4]` and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element from `a[1]` to `a[n+1]` is equal to `int(data[idx - n + i])` for `i` from 1 to `n + 1`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `pf[i]` is calculated as `pf[i-1] ^ a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n + 1`, `mp` is a dictionary with key (0) and value [0], `i` is `n + 1`, `idx` is increased by 2, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is the value retrieved from `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is the value retrieved from `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the result of `bisect.bisect_left(v1, l)`, `l` is an integer value from `data[idx]`, `r` is an integer value from `data[idx + 1]`, `v1` is updated to the value retrieved from `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is the value retrieved from `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it2` is the result of `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
