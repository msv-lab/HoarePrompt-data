Output State: **`q` must be greater than 1, `idx` is increased by 4, `l` is an integer value from `data[idx]`, `r` is an integer value from `data[idx + 1]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it2` is the index of the position just before the first occurrence of `r` in `v2`, `l` is an integer value from `data[idx]`, `v1` is the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `it1` is the index of the position where `l` would be inserted to keep `v1` sorted.**

Explanation: The code `it1 = bisect.bisect_left(v1, l)` inserts `l` into the list `v1` while maintaining the sorted order and returns the index where `l` should be inserted. This does not change the values of any other variables, but it introduces a new variable `it1` which represents the insertion point of `l` in `v1`.
