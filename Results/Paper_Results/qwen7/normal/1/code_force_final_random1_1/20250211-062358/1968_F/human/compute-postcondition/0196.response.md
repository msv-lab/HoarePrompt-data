Output State: **`pf[i]` is equal to `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`; `idx` is increased by 1; `a[i]` is now an integer value from `data[idx]`; `mp[pf[i]]` is a list containing the empty list `[]`.**

Explanation: The line `mp[pf[i]] = []` assigns an empty list to the key `pf[i]` in the dictionary `mp`. The other variables remain unchanged according to their previous states.
