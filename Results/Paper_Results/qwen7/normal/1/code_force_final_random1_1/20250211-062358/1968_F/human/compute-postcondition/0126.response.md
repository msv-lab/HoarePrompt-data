Output State: **`q` must be greater than 0; `idx` is increased by 2; `l` is an integer value from `data[idx - 2]`; `r` is an integer value from `data[idx - 1]`**

Explanation: The value of `idx` is incremented by 2, while the conditions and values of `q`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged. The new values of `l` and `r` are now based on the updated index `idx`.
