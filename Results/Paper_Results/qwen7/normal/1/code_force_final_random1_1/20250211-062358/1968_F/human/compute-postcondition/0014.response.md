Output State: **`idx` is 7, `t` is an integer value from `data[0]`, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer value from `data[2]`, `q` is an integer value from `data[4]`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` containing all zeros except `a[1]` which is equal to `int(data[6])`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` containing all zeros, `mp` is a dictionary with key (0) and value [0], `i` is 3**

Explanation: The line `idx += 1` increments the value of `idx` by 1. Initially, `idx` was 6, so after executing the line, `idx` becomes 7. All other variables remain unchanged.
