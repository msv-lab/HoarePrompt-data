Output State: **`q` is a positive integer and will be `q - 1`, `idx` is increased by 22 (which means idx = original idx + 20), `l` is reassigned the value `int(data[idx])`, `r` is assigned the value `int(data[idx + 1])**.

This means that `q` remains a positive integer and is set to `q - 1`, `idx` has been increased by 20 and then by 1 more (since `r` uses `idx + 1`), `l` is now the integer value of `data` at the new index of `idx`, and `r` is the integer value of `data` at the next index after `idx`.
