Output State: **`pf[i]` is equal to `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`; `idx` is increased by 1; `a[i]` is now an integer value from `data[idx]`; `mp[pf[i]]` is a list containing the value `i`.**

Explanation: The code updates `pf[i]` to be the bitwise XOR of `pf[i - 1]` and `a[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The updated value of `pf[i]` is now explicitly defined as the bitwise XOR of `pf[i - 1]` and `a[i]`.
