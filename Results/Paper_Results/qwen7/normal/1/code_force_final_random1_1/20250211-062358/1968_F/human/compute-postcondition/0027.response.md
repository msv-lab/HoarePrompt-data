Postcondition: `idx` is 8, `t` is an integer value from `data[0]`, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer value from `data[2]` and must be greater than 4, `q` is an integer value from `data[4]`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` containing all zeros except `a[1]` which is equal to `int(data[6])`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` where `pf[4]` is equal to `pf[3] ^ a[4]`, `mp` is a dictionary with key (0) and value [0], `i` is 4, `a[4]` is `int(data[idx])`, if `pf[i]` is not in `mp`, then `mp[pf[i]]` becomes a new list; otherwise, the conditions remain unchanged.
