Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
2. It initializes necessary variables and constructs prefix XOR (`pf`) and mapping (`mp`) structures.
3. For each query, it computes the XOR value of the subarray from `l` to `r` using the prefix XOR values.
4. It checks if the computed XOR value is zero, which directly determines if the subarray is interesting.
5. If the XOR value is not zero, it uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find potential split points within the subarray.
6. The logic for checking if the subarray can be split into interesting parts seems correct, as it ensures that there exists a valid split point where the XOR values match.

Given the provided execution summary and the detailed analysis of the code, the program appears to be handling the problem correctly according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
