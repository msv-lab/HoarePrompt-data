Output State: **`q` must be greater than 0; `idx` is increased by 2; `l` is an integer value from `data[idx - 2]`; `r` is an integer value from `data[idx - 1]`; `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`**.

This means that the value of `x` is calculated as the bitwise XOR of `pf[r]` and `pf[l - 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
