Output State: **`idx` is 4, `t` is an integer value from `data[0]`, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer value from `data[2]`, `q` is an integer value from `data[4]`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `data[idx + 1]` to `q`. Given that `idx` is initially 3, `idx + 1` equals 4. Therefore, `q` is assigned the value of `data[4]`, which is an integer. The values of `idx`, `t`, `results`, and `n` remain unchanged.
