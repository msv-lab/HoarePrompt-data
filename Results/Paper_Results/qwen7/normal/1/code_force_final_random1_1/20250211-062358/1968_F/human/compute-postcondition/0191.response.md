Output State: **`pf[i]` is equal to `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`; `idx` is increased by 1; `a[i]` is now an integer value from `data[idx]`; `mp[pf[i]]` is a list containing the value `i`.**

Explanation: The code appends the current index `i` to the list associated with `pf[i]` in the dictionary `mp`. Since `pf[i]` was not previously in `mp`, it is added with an empty list as its value, and then the current index `i` is appended to this list. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
