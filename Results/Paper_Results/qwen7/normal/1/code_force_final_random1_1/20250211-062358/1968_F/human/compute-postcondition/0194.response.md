Output State: **`idx` is increased by 1; `a[i]` is now an integer value from `data[idx]`; `pf[i]` is equal to `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`; `mp[pf[i]]` is a list containing the value `i`.**

Explanation: The code `idx += 1` increments the value of `idx` by 1. The other variables (`i`, `a[i]`, `pf[i]`, and `mp[pf[i]]`) remain unchanged from their previous states. Therefore, the updated value of `idx` is one more than its previous value. All other conditions and values associated with the variables remain the same as the initial state.
