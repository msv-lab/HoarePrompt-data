Output State: **`q` must be greater than 1, `idx` is increased by 2, `l` is an integer value from `data[idx - 2]`, `r` is now an integer value from `data[idx + 1]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it2` is the index of the position just before the first occurrence of `r` in `v2`, and `l` is updated to an integer value from `data[idx]`.**

Explanation: The code changes the value of `r` to be the integer value from `data[idx + 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to their previous descriptions.
