Postcondition: `q` is a positive integer and will be `q - 1`, `idx` is equal to the original `idx` plus 24, `l` is reassigned the value `int(data[idx])`, `r` is assigned the value `int(data[idx + 1])`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, and the list `results` has 'YES' appended to it if `x == 0`.
