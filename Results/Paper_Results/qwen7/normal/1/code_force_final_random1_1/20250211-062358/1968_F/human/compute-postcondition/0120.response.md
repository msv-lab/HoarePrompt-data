Output State: **`total` is 0, `t` is `data[0] - 1`, `results` is a list containing 'YES' repeated `q` times followed by 'NO', `n` is `int(data[idx])`, `idx` is `idx + 2`, `a[n]` is `int(data[idx - 2])`, `pf[n]` is `pf[n - 1] ^ a[n]`, `mp[pf[n]]` is `[n]` if `pf[n]` is not already in `mp`, `i` is `n + 1`, `idx` is equal to the initial value plus the total number of elements in the list `a` plus 4, `a[i]` is `int(data[idx])`, `pf[i]` is `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`, `mp[pf[i]]` is an empty list if `pf[i]` is not already in `mp`, and `mp[pf[i]]` is appended with `i`, `pf[i]` is updated to `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`, and if `pf[i]` is not in `mp`, `mp[pf[i]]` is an empty list; `mp[pf[i]]` is updated to include `i`.**

In simpler terms: All the variables remain unchanged except for `mp[pf[i]]`, which is now updated to include the value `i` in addition to its previous content (if any).
