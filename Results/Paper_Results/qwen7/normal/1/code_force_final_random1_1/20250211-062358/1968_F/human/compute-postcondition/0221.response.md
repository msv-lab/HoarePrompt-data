Output State: **`q` is a positive integer, `idx` has been increased by 2, `v1` is an empty list or a list retrieved from `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is a list retrieved from `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`.**

Explanation: The code `v2 = mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])` retrieves a list from the dictionary `mp` using the key `pf[l - 1]`. The value of `v2` is assigned this list. The other variables (`q`, `idx`, and `v1`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
