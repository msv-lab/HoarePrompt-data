You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let us call an array x_1,\dots,x_m interesting if it is possible to divide the
array into k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
values from each part are equal.

More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each
element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y_1,\dots,y_k be the XOR of
elements from each part respectively. Then y_1=y_2=\dots=y_k must be
fulfilled.

For example, if x = [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] , you can split it as follows:
[\color{blue}1], [\color{green}1], [\color{red}2, \color{red}3, \color{red}0]
. Indeed \color{blue}1=\color{green}1=\color{red}2 \oplus \color{red}3\oplus
\color{red}0 .

You are given an array a_1,\dots,a_n . Your task is to answer q queries:

  * For fixed l , r , determine whether the subarray a_l,a_{l+1},\dots,a_r is interesting. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array
and the number of queries respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (0 \le a_i < 2^{30} ) —
elements of the array.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 \le l < r \le n )
describing the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of q over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, output "YES" if the subarray is interesting and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, the strings "yES",
"yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as correct answers).

Note

Explanation for the first test case:

The first query is described in the statement.

In the second query, we should divide [1,2,3] . A possible division is
[1,2],[3] , since 1\oplus 2=3 .

It can be shown that for queries 3,4,5 , the subarrays are not interesting.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if a subarray is interesting. Specifically, the program fails to handle cases where the subarray can be divided into more than one segment such that the XOR of each segment is equal.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of XOR Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the prefix XOR (`pf`) up to index `r` and `l-1`, and then computes `x = pf[r] ^ pf[l-1]`. This calculation is correct for determining the XOR of the subarray from `l` to `r`.
   - However, the logic to check if the subarray can be divided into multiple segments with equal XOR values is flawed. The current implementation only checks if the subarray itself has an XOR value of 0, which is not sufficient to determine if the subarray is interesting.

2. **Incorrect Use of Binary Search:**
   - The program uses binary search (`bisect.bisect_left`) to find indices in the list `v1` and `v2`. This approach is not necessary and does not help in correctly identifying the segments with equal XOR values.

3. **Lack of Proper Segmentation Logic:**
   - The program does not properly segment the subarray into multiple parts and check if the XOR of each segment is equal. It only checks if the entire subarray has an XOR value of 0, which is not enough to determine if the subarray is interesting.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following input:
```
5 5
1 1 2 3 0
1 5
2 4
3 5
1 3
3 4
```

- For the query `1 5`, the subarray is `[1, 1, 2, 3, 0]`. The XOR of this subarray is `0`, and the program correctly identifies it as interesting.
- For the query `2 4`, the subarray is `[1, 2, 3]`. The XOR of this subarray is `0`, and the program correctly identifies it as interesting.
- For the query `3 5`, the subarray is `[2, 3, 0]`. The XOR of this subarray is `1`, and the program correctly identifies it as not interesting.
- For the query `1 3`, the subarray is `[1, 1, 2]`. The XOR of this subarray is `2`, and the program correctly identifies it as not interesting.
- For the query `3 4`, the subarray is `[2, 3]`. The XOR of this subarray is `1`, and the program correctly identifies it as not interesting.

However, consider another example:
```
5 5
1 1 2 3 0
1 4
2 3
3 4
1 2
2 3
```

- For the query `1 4`, the subarray is `[1, 1, 2, 3]`. The XOR of this subarray is `3`, and the program incorrectly identifies it as not interesting.
- For the query `2 3`, the subarray is `[1, 2]`. The XOR of this subarray is `3`, and the program incorrectly identifies it as not interesting.
- For the query `3 4`, the subarray is `[2, 3]`. The XOR of this subarray is `1`, and the program correctly identifies it as not interesting.
- For the query `1 2`, the subarray is `[1, 1]`. The XOR of this subarray is `0`, and the program incorrectly identifies it as not interesting.
- For the query `2 3`, the subarray is `[1, 2]`. The XOR of this subarray is `3`, and the program incorrectly identifies it as not interesting.

These examples show that the program does not correctly handle the segmentation logic required to determine if a subarray is interesting. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
