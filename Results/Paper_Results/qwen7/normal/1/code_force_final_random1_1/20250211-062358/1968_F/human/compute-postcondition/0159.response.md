Output State: **`q` must be greater than 0; `l` is an integer value from `data[idx]`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `data[idx]` to the variable `l` after converting it to an integer using `int()`. The precondition that `q` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged. The value of `l` is now an integer derived from `data[idx]`.
