Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop runs from `1` to `n` (inclusive).
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to `n`.

3. **Update the state based on the loop condition**:
   - Since `i` is currently `n`, the loop will continue if `i < n + 1`. For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it `n + 1`.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `i` needs to be updated to `n + 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.

5. **List the remaining states**:
   - `total` is still `0`.
   - `t` is still `data[0] - 1`.
   - `results` is still a list containing 'YES' repeated `q` times followed by 'NO'.
   - `a[n]` is still `int(data[idx - 2])`.
   - `pf[n]` is still `pf[n - 1] ^ a[n]`.
   - `mp[pf[n]]` is still `[n]` if `pf[n]` is not already in `mp`.
   - `idx` is still equal to the initial value plus the total number of elements in the list `a` plus 3.
   - `a[i]` is still `int(data[idx - 1])` (where `i` is now `n + 1`).
   - `pf[i]` is still `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]` (where `i` is now `n + 1`).
   - `mp[pf[i]]` is still an empty list if `pf[i]` is not already in `mp` (where `i` is now `n + 1`), and it is appended with `i` (where `i` is now `n + 1`).

Given this analysis, the final state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`total` is 0, `t` is `data[0] - 1`, `results` is a list containing 'YES' repeated `q` times followed by 'NO', `n` is `int(data[idx])`, `idx` is `idx + 2`, `a[n]` is `int(data[idx - 2])`, `pf[n]` is `pf[n - 1] ^ a[n]`, `mp[pf[n]]` is `[n]` if `pf[n]` is not already in `mp`, `i` is `n + 1`, `idx` is equal to the initial value plus the total number of elements in the list `a` plus 3, `a[i]` is `int(data[idx - 1])`, `pf[i]` is `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`, `mp[pf[i]]` is an empty list if `pf[i]` is not already in `mp`, and `mp[pf[i]]` is appended with `i`.**
