Output State: **`i` is increased by 1; `idx` is increased by 1; `a[i]` is now an integer value from `data[idx]`; `pf[i]` is equal to `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`; `mp[pf[i]]` is a list containing the value `i`.**

This output state reflects that the value of `i` and `idx` have each been incremented by 1. The value of `a[i]` is now set to an integer value from `data[idx]`. The value of `pf[i]` is calculated as the bitwise XOR of `pf[i - 1]` and `a[i]`. Lastly, `mp[pf[i]]` is updated to include the current value of `i`.
