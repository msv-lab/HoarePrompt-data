Output State: **`q` is a positive integer, `idx` has been increased by 2, `v1` is an empty list or a list retrieved from `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is a list retrieved from `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the index of the first position in `v1` where a value greater than or equal to `l` would be inserted.**

Explanation: The code `it1 = bisect.bisect_left(v1, l)` inserts the value `l` into the list `v1` in sorted order at the smallest index where it would maintain the sorted order. The function returns the index at which `l` should be inserted. The values of `q`, `idx`, `v1`, and `v2` remain unchanged except that `it1` is now assigned the result of the `bisect_left` operation.
