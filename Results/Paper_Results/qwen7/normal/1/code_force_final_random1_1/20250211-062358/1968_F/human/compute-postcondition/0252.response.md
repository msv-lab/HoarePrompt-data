Output State: **`q` is a positive integer and will be `q - 1`, `idx` is equal to the original `idx` plus 24, `l` is reassigned the value `int(data[idx])`, `r` is assigned the value `int(data[idx + 1])`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `results` is a list with 'YES' appended to it.**

Explanation: The line `results.append('YES')` appends the string `'YES'` to the list `results`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `q`, `idx`, `l`, `r`, and `x` remain unchanged from their previous states, and `results` now contains the additional element `'YES'`.
