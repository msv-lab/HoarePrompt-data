Output State: `total` is 0, `t` is `data[0] - 1`, `results` is a list containing 'YES' repeated `q` times followed by 'NO', `n` is `int(data[idx])`, `idx` is `idx + 2 * (n + 1)`, `a[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `n + 1` is `int(data[idx - (n + 1) + i])`, `pf[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `n + 1` is calculated as `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`, `mp[pf[i]]` is `[i]` if `pf[i]` is not already in `mp`, otherwise it is appended with `i`, `i` is `n + 1`, and the final state of `pf` and `mp` reflects the cumulative XOR operations performed on the array `a`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `total` remains 0, `t` is still `data[0] - 1`, `results` stays as initially defined, `n` is the integer value from `data[2]`, `idx` is increased by twice the length of the array `a` (which is `n + 1`), each element `a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n + 1` is the integer from the data list starting from the position `idx - (n + 1) + i`, `pf[i]` is the cumulative XOR of the first `i` elements of `a`, and `mp` is a dictionary where keys are the unique cumulative XOR values and values are lists of indices where these XOR values occur.
