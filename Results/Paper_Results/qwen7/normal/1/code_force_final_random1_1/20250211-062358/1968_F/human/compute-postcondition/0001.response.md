Output State: **`idx` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.**

The code initializes the variable `idx` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t` or `data`. Therefore, `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to \(10^4\) and `data` remains a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.
