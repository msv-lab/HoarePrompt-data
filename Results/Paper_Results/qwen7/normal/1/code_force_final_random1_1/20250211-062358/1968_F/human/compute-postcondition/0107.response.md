Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state of these variables**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n - 1`.
   - `n` is updated to `int(data[idx])` at the end of the previous iteration.

3. **Update the state based on the loop condition**:
   - The loop condition is `for i in range(1, n + 1)`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is currently `n - 1`, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented to `n`.
   - `n` remains the same as it was updated at the end of the previous iteration.

5. **Construct the new state**:
   - `total` remains unchanged.
   - `t` remains unchanged.
   - `results` remains unchanged.
   - `a[i]` is now `int(data[idx])` where `i` is `n`.
   - `pf[i]` is `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]` where `i` is `n`.
   - `mp[pf[i]]` is updated if `pf[i]` is not already in `mp`.
   - `i` is incremented to `n`.
   - `idx` is equal to the initial value plus the total number of elements in the list `a` plus 3.
   - `x`, `v1`, and `v2` remain undefined.

Given this, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`total` is 0, `t` is `data[0] - 1`, `results` is a list containing 'YES' repeated `q` times followed by 'NO', `n` is updated to `int(data[idx])`, `idx` is incremented by 2, `a[n]` is `int(data[idx])`, `pf[n]` is `pf[n - 1] ^ a[n]`, `mp[pf[n]]` becomes `[n]` if `pf[n]` is not already in `mp`, `i` is `n`, `idx` is equal to the initial value plus the total number of elements in the list `a` plus 3, `x`, `v1`, and `v2` are not defined.**
