Output State: **`q` must be greater than 0; `idx` is increased by 2; `l` is an integer value from `data[idx - 2]`; `r` is an integer value from `data[idx - 1]`; `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`; `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`; `it1` is the index of the first position in `v1` where `l` can be inserted without violating the sorted order of `v1`.**

Explanation: The code `it1 = bisect.bisect_left(v1, l)` finds the insertion point for `l` in the list `v1`, which is a list obtained from `mp.get(pf[r], [])`. This insertion point ensures that `v1` remains sorted. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
