Output State: **`pf[i]` is equal to `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`; `idx` is increased by 1; `a[i]` is now an integer value from `data[idx]`.**

Explanation: The code updates `pf[i]` to be the bitwise XOR of `pf[i - 1]` and `a[i]`, where `a[i]` is obtained from `data[idx]`. The value of `idx` is increased by 1, and `a[i]` is updated accordingly. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged.
