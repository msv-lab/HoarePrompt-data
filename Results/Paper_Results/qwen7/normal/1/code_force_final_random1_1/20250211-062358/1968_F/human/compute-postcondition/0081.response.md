Output State: **`total` remains 0, `t` is an integer value from `data[0]`, `results` has an additional `'YES'` appended to it, `n` is an integer value from `data[2]` and must be greater than 4, `q` is an integer value from `data[4]` and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element from `a[1]` to `a[n+1]` is equal to `int(data[idx - n + i])` for `i` from 1 to `n + 1`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `pf[i]` is calculated as `pf[i-1] ^ a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n + 1`, `mp` is a dictionary with key (0) and value [0], `i` is `n + 1`, `idx` is increased by 2, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is the value retrieved from `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is the value retrieved from `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it1` is the result of `bisect.bisect_left(v1, l)`, `it2` is the result of `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`, `l` is an integer value from `data[idx]`, `r` is an integer value from `data[idx + 1]`, `v1` is updated to the value retrieved from `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is the value retrieved from `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it2` is the result of `bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`, `l` is updated to an integer value from `data[idx]`, `r` is an integer value from `data[idx + 1]`, `idx` is increased by 2.**

The `continue` statement does not change any variable values or perform any operations. It simply continues to the next iteration of the loop (if there is one). Therefore, the values of all variables remain unchanged except for the fact that `results` has an additional `'YES'` appended to it due to the previous operations before encountering the `continue` statement.
