Output State: **`q` is a non-negative integer (since it decreases by 1 each iteration until it reaches 0), `idx` is equal to its initial value plus 24 times the number of iterations, `results` is a list containing either 'YES' or 'NO' for each query based on the conditions specified in the loop, `l` and `r` are the last values assigned within the loop, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` and `v2` are lists retrieved from `mp.get(pf[r], [])` and `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])` respectively, and `it1` and `it2` are indices used to check the conditions for appending 'YES' or 'NO' to `results`; `results` now has an empty string appended to it.**

The code appends an empty string to the `results` list. This does not affect the values of `q`, `idx`, `l`, `r`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, and `it2`. It only adds an empty string to the end of the `results` list.
