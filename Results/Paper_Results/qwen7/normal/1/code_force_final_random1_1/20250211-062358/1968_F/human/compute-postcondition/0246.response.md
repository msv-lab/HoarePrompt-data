Postcondition: **`q` is a positive integer and will be `q - 1`, `idx` is increased by 10, `v1` is updated to the list retrieved from `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is retrieved again from `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it2` is the index of the element in `v2` which is just less than `r`, `results` contains 'YES', `l` is assigned the value `int(data[idx])`, `r` is assigned the value `int(data[idx + 1])`, `x` is the XOR of `pf[r]` and `pf[l - 1]`, `it1` is the index of the element in `v1` which is just greater than or equal to `l`. If `it1 < len(v1)` and `it2 >= 0` and `v1[it1] <= r` and `v2[it2] >= l`, then `it1` and `it2` remain as they are. Otherwise, `results` now contains 'YES' and 'NO'.**
