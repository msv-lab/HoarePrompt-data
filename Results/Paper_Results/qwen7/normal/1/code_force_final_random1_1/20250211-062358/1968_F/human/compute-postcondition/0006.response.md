Output State: **`idx` is 3, `t` is an integer value from `data[0]`, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer value from `data[2]`.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(data[idx])` updates the value of `n` by converting the element at index `idx` in the `data` list to an integer. Initially, `idx` is 2, so `n` becomes the integer value from `data[2]`. The other variables (`t`, `results`) remain unchanged.
