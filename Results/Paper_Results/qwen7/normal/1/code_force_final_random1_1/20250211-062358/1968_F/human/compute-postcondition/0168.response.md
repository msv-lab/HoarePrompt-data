Output State: **`q` must be greater than 0; `l` is an integer value from `data[idx]`; `r` is an integer value from `data[idx + 1]`; `idx` is increased by 2; `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `results` contains 'YES' if `x == 0`; `v1` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[r], [])`; `v2` is assigned the value of `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`.**

Explanation: The code retrieves the values of `pf[r]` and `pf[l - 1]` from the dictionary `mp` and assigns them to `v1` and `v2`, respectively. No other changes are made to the variables or conditions specified in the initial state.
