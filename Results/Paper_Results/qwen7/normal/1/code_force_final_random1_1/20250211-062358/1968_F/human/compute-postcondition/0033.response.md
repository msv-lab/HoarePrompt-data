Output State: **`idx` is 9, `t` is an integer value from `data[0]`, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer value from `data[2]` and must be greater than 4, `q` is an integer value from `data[4]`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` containing all zeros except `a[1]` which is equal to `int(data[6])`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` where `pf[4]` is equal to `pf[3] ^ a[4]`, `mp` is a dictionary with key (0) and value [0], `i` is 6, `a[6]` is `int(data[idx])`, `pf[6]` is equal to `pf[5] ^ a[6]`, `mp[pf[6]]` is a list containing the value 6.**

Explanation:
- The variable `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now 6.
- The variable `a[6]` is assigned the value of `int(data[idx])`, where `idx` is 9, so `a[6]` is `int(data[9])`.
- The variable `pf[6]` is calculated as `pf[5] ^ a[6]`, where `pf[5]` is `pf[4] ^ a[5]` and `a[5]` is `int(data[idx])` with `idx` being 5, so `pf[6]` is `(pf[3] ^ a[4]) ^ a[6]`.
- The dictionary `mp` is updated such that `mp[pf[6]]` is a list containing the value 6.
