Output State: **`total` is 0, `t` is `data[0] - 1`, `results` is a list containing 'YES' repeated `q` times followed by 'NO', `n` is `int(data[idx])`, `idx` is `idx + 2`, `a[n]` is `int(data[idx - 2])`, `pf[n]` is `pf[n - 1] ^ a[n]`, `mp[pf[n]]` is `[n]` if `pf[n]` is not already in `mp`, `i` is `n + 1`, `idx` is equal to the initial value plus the total number of elements in the list `a` plus 4, `a[i]` is `int(data[idx])`, `pf[i]` is `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`, `mp[pf[i]]` is an empty list if `pf[i]` is not already in `mp`, and `mp[pf[i]]` is appended with `i`, `pf[i]` is updated to `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]**.

Explanation:
- The code updates `pf[i]` to `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`. Since `i` was previously set to `n + 1`, and `n` is `int(data[idx])`, `i` is now `int(data[idx]) + 1`. The value of `pf[i]` is updated using the previous value of `pf[i - 1]` (which is `pf[n]`) and the current value of `a[i]` (which is `int(data[idx])`). The value of `pf[i]` is then stored in `mp[pf[i]]` as an empty list if `pf[i]` is not already in `mp`, and then appended with `i`.
