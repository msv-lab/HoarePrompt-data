Postcondition: `q` is a positive integer, `idx` has been increased by 2, `v1` is an empty list or a list retrieved from `mp.get(pf[r], [])`, `v2` is a list retrieved from `mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])`, `it2` is the index of the element in `v2` which is just less than `r`. The condition `it1 < len(v1)` and `it2 >= 0` holds true, and both `v1[it1] <= r` and `v2[it2] >= l` are satisfied.
