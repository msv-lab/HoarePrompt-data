Output State: **`q` is a positive integer and will be `q - 1`, `idx` is equal to the original `idx` plus 24, `l` is reassigned the value `int(data[idx])`, `r` is assigned the value `int(data[idx + 1])**.

Explanation: The variable `idx` was originally increased by 22, making it `idx + 22`. The code then increments `idx` by 2 more, resulting in `idx` being `idx + 24`. The values of `q`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged from their initial assignments.
