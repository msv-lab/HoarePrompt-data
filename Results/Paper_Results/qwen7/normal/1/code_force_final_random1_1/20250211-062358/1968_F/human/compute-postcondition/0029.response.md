Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `idx` is 8
   - `t` is an integer value from `data[0]`
   - `results` is an empty list
   - `n` is an integer value from `data[2]` and must be greater than 4
   - `q` is an integer value from `data[4]`
   - `a` is a list of length `n + 1` containing all zeros except `a[1]` which is equal to `int(data[6])`
   - `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` where `pf[4]` is equal to `pf[3] ^ a[4]`
   - `mp` is a dictionary with key (0) and value [0]
   - `i` is 4
   - `a[4]` is `int(data[idx])`
   - `mp[pf[i]]` is a list containing the value 4

3. **Determine the Next State for the Loop**:
   - The loop condition is `for i in range(1, n + 1)`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 4.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` should be 5.
   - Since the loop starts from 1 and goes up to `n + 1`, `i` must still be within this range.

4. **Adjust the Relevant States**:
   - `i` should be updated to 5.
   - `a[4]` remains unchanged as it is based on `data[idx]` and `idx` does not change within the loop.
   - `mp[pf[i]]` should now point to the value corresponding to `pf[5]`.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` should be 5.
- `mp[pf[i]]` should be updated to point to the value corresponding to `pf[5]`.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `idx` is 8, `t` is an integer value from `data[0]`, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer value from `data[2]` and must be greater than 4, `q` is an integer value from `data[4]`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` containing all zeros except `a[1]` which is equal to `int(data[6])`, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` where `pf[4]` is equal to `pf[3] ^ a[4]`, `mp` is a dictionary with key (0) and value [0], `i` is 5, `a[4]` is `int(data[idx])`, `mp[pf[i]]` is a list containing the value 5.**
