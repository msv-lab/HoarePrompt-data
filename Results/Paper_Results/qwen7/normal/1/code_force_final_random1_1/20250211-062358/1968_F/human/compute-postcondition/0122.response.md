Output State: `total` is 0, `t` is `data[0] - 1`, `results` is a list containing 'YES' repeated `q` times followed by 'NO', `n` is the final value it was updated to during the last iteration of the loop, `idx` is equal to the initial value plus the total number of elements in the list `a` plus the number of elements in `data` from `data[idx]` to the end, `a[i]` is the last element of `data` processed, `pf[i]` is the cumulative XOR result of all elements in `a` up to `a[i]`, `mp[pf[i]]` contains the indices where `pf[i]` occurs in `a`, `i` is `n + 1`.

This output state describes the final conditions of all variables after the loop has completed its iterations. The loop processes each element of `data` starting from `data[idx]` and updates the arrays `a` and `pf`, as well as the dictionary `mp`, based on the XOR operation. The variable `idx` is incremented appropriately to ensure that each new element of `data` is correctly processed. The variables `total`, `t`, `results`, `n`, and `q` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop's body.
