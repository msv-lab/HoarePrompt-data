Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial conditions at the start of the loop**:
   - `pf[i]` is initialized as `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`.
   - `idx` is increased by 1.
   - `a[i]` is set to `data[idx]`.
   - `mp[pf[i]]` is a list containing the value `i`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n + 1`.

4. **State at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `pf[i]` is equal to `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`.
   - `idx` is increased by 1.
   - `a[i]` is now an integer value from `data[idx]`.
   - `mp[pf[i]]` is a list containing the value `i`.

5. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 from its current value.
   - `idx` will be incremented by 1 from its current value.
   - `a[i]` will be set to `data[idx]` for the new value of `i`.
   - `pf[i]` will be updated based on the previous value of `pf[i - 1]` and the new value of `a[i]`.
   - `mp[pf[i]]` will be updated to include the new value of `i`.

Given the above, let's determine the states at the start of the next iteration:

- `i` will be `i + 1`.
- `idx` will be `idx + 1`.
- `a[i]` will be `data[idx]` for the new value of `i`.
- `pf[i]` will be `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]` for the new value of `i`.
- `mp[pf[i]]` will be a list containing the value `i`.

Since we don't know the exact values of `pf[i - 1]` or `a[i]` from the previous iteration, we can only express the updated states in terms of the previous values.

**State:**
- `i` is increased by 1.
- `idx` is increased by 1.
- `a[i]` is now an integer value from `data[idx]`.
- `pf[i]` is equal to `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`.
- `mp[pf[i]]` is a list containing the value `i`.

So, the final state is:

State: **`pf[i]` is equal to `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`; `idx` is increased by 1; `a[i]` is now an integer value from `data[idx]`; `mp[pf[i]]` is a list containing the value `i`.**
