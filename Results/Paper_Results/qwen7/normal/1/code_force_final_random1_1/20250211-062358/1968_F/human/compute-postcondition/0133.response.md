Postcondition: `q` must be greater than 0; `idx` is increased by 2; `l` is an integer value from `data[idx - 2]`; `r` is an integer value from `data[idx - 1]`; `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`. If `x` is 0, then 'YES' is appended to the `results` list. Otherwise, no changes are made to the `results` list.
