You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A parentheses sequence is a string consisting of characters "(" and ")", for
example "(()((".

A balanced parentheses sequence is a parentheses sequence which can become a
valid mathematical expression after inserting numbers and operations into it,
for example "(()(()))".

The balance of a parentheses sequence is defined as the number of opening
parentheses "(" minus the number of closing parentheses ")". For example, the
balance of the sequence "(()((" is 3.

A balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence
with balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.

We define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and
returns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the
input sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before
that character and write those down in a table together with the positions of
the characters in the input sequence, for example:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
  
Then, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,
breaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
  
The last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case
"()(()())". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced
shuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle
of the input sequence.

You are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Print its balanced shuffle.

Input

The only line of input contains a string s consisting only of characters "("
and ")". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses
sequence with its length not exceeding 500\,000 .

Output

Print the parentheses sequence t — the balanced shuffle of s .

Example

Input

    (()(()))
    
Output

    ()(()())

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1(infoA, infoB):
    if infoA.balance != infoB.balance:
        return infoA.balance - infoB.balance
    return infoB.position - infoA.position

#Function 2:
def func_2(s):
    n = len(s)
    balance_info = []
    balance = 0
    for i in range(n):
        balance_info.append(BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i]))
        if s[i] == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
    balance_info.sort(key=lambda x: (x.balance, -x.position))
    result = ''.join((info.character for info in balance_info))
    print(result)



- Annotated Code: 
class BalanceInfo:

    def __init__(self, balance, position, character):
        self.balance = balance
        self.position = position
        self.character = character
if __name__ == '__main__':
    s = input().strip()
    func_2(s)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: infoA and infoB are objects that have attributes `balance` and `position`, where `balance` is an integer and `position` is an integer representing the position of a character in a balanced parentheses sequence.
def func_1(infoA, infoB):
    if (infoA.balance != infoB.balance) :
        return infoA.balance - infoB.balance
        #The program returns the difference between the balance attribute of infoA and the balance attribute of infoB.
    #State: infoA and infoB are objects that have attributes `balance` and `position`, where both `balance` attributes are equal, and both `position` attributes represent the position of a character in a balanced parentheses sequence.
    return infoB.position - infoA.position
    #The program returns the difference between the position attribute of infoB and infoA, which represents the difference in positions of characters in two balanced parentheses sequences.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")". The string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.
def func_2(s):
    n = len(s)
    balance_info = []
    balance = 0
    for i in range(n):
        balance_info.append(BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i]))
        
        if s[i] == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` is equal to `n`, `n` remains the original length of the string `s`, and `balance` is the net balance of the parentheses in the string `s` (i.e., the difference between the number of '(' and ')'). The `balance_info` list contains `n` elements, each being a `BalanceInfo` object where the `balance` attribute reflects the balance at each step `i` during the loop, and `i` is the index at which the balance was recorded. If `s[i]` is '(', the `balance` attribute increases by 1, and if `s[i]` is ')', the `balance` attribute decreases by 1.
    balance_info.sort(key=lambda x: (x.balance, -x.position))
    result = ''.join(info.character for info in balance_info)
    print(result)
    #This is printed: result (where result is the concatenation of the `character` attributes of each `BalanceInfo` object in the `balance_info` list, sorted by the `balance` attribute in ascending order and by the negative of the `position` attribute in descending order)




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the problem and the provided solution step by step to determine if the program is correct.

### Problem Breakdown
1. **Balanced Parentheses Sequence**: A sequence where the number of opening and closing parentheses is equal, and at any point in the sequence, the number of opening parentheses is greater than or equal to the number of closing parentheses.
2. **Balance Calculation**: The balance of a sequence is the difference between the number of opening and closing parentheses.
3. **Balanced Shuffle Operation**: 
   - Compute the balance of the prefix up to each character.
   - Sort the characters based on their prefix balance (ascending) and position (descending).
   - Form a new sequence from the sorted characters.

### Provided Solution Analysis
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is used for sorting but is not actually used in the main function `func_2`.
   - It compares two `BalanceInfo` objects based on their balance and position.
   
2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - Computes the balance of each prefix and stores it along with the position and character in a list `balance_info`.
   - Sorts `balance_info` using the key specified in the lambda function, which sorts by balance (ascending) and position (descending).
   - Constructs the final balanced shuffle sequence by joining the characters from the sorted list.

### Key Points to Verify
1. **Balance Calculation**: The balance is correctly computed for each prefix.
2. **Sorting Logic**: The sorting logic ensures that the sequence is sorted by balance first and then by position.
3. **Character Construction**: The final sequence is constructed correctly by joining the characters from the sorted list.

### Verification
- **Balance Calculation**: The balance is correctly computed for each prefix.
- **Sorting Logic**: The lambda function in `sort` ensures that the sequence is sorted by balance (ascending) and then by position (descending), which matches the problem requirements.
- **Character Construction**: The final sequence is constructed by joining the characters from the sorted list, which is correct.

Given the analysis, the provided solution correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.

### Conclusion
Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation for a balanced parentheses sequence.
