#State of the program right berfore the function call: infoA and infoB are objects that have attributes `balance` and `position`, where `balance` is an integer and `position` is an integer representing the position of a character in a balanced parentheses sequence.
def func_1(infoA, infoB):
    if (infoA.balance != infoB.balance) :
        return infoA.balance - infoB.balance
        #The program returns the difference between the balance attribute of infoA and the balance attribute of infoB.
    #State: infoA and infoB are objects that have attributes `balance` and `position`, where both `balance` attributes are equal, and both `position` attributes represent the position of a character in a balanced parentheses sequence.
    return infoB.position - infoA.position
    #The program returns the difference between the position attribute of infoB and infoA, which represents the difference in positions of characters in two balanced parentheses sequences.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `infoA` and `infoB`, which are objects containing `balance` and `position` attributes. It returns the difference between the `balance` attributes of `infoA` and `infoB` if their `balance` values are not equal. If the `balance` values are equal, it returns the difference between the `position` attributes of `infoB` and `infoA`. This difference in `position` represents the difference in positions of characters in two balanced parentheses sequences.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")". The string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.
def func_2(s):
    n = len(s)
    balance_info = []
    balance = 0
    for i in range(n):
        balance_info.append(BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i]))
        
        if s[i] == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` is equal to `n`, `n` remains the original length of the string `s`, and `balance` is the net balance of the parentheses in the string `s` (i.e., the difference between the number of '(' and ')'). The `balance_info` list contains `n` elements, each being a `BalanceInfo` object where the `balance` attribute reflects the balance at each step `i` during the loop, and `i` is the index at which the balance was recorded. If `s[i]` is '(', the `balance` attribute increases by 1, and if `s[i]` is ')', the `balance` attribute decreases by 1.
    balance_info.sort(key=lambda x: (x.balance, -x.position))
    result = ''.join(info.character for info in balance_info)
    print(result)
    #This is printed: result (where result is the concatenation of the `character` attributes of each `BalanceInfo` object in the `balance_info` list, sorted by the `balance` attribute in ascending order and by the negative of the `position` attribute in descending order)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s` consisting only of "(" and ")", calculates the balance of parentheses at each position, sorts the positions based on their balance and index, and prints the characters at these positions in the sorted order. The function does not return any value.
