Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is not explicitly initialized in the given state, but it will start from 0 in the first iteration of the loop.
   - `n` is given as the length of the string `s`.

3. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.
   - Therefore, the loop can execute if `i` is 0 or more and less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` will start from 0, we don't need to change its initial value.
   - We need to ensure that `n` (the length of `s`) is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` must be greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(", ")", `n` must be greater than 0, `balance_info` is an empty list, `balance` is 0**
