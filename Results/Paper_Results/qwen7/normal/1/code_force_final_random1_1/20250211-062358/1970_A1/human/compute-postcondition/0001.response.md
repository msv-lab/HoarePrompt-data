Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")"; `n` is the length of `s`; `balance_info` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The line `balance_info = []` creates an empty list named `balance_info`. This does not affect the values of `s` or `n`. Therefore, `s` remains a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and `n` remains the length of `s`.
