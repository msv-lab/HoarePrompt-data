Reasoning:
1. The problem requires implementing a balanced shuffle operation on a balanced parentheses sequence.
2. The solution is divided into two functions:
   - `func_1`: This function is used to compare two `BalanceInfo` objects and sort them based on the specified criteria.
   - `func_2`: This function processes the input string, calculates the balance at each position, sorts the positions based on the calculated balances and indices, and constructs the final shuffled sequence.

3. Let's analyze the correctness of each part:
   - `func_1` is correctly implemented to handle the sorting criteria as described in the problem statement. It ensures that the sequence is sorted first by balance in ascending order and then by position in descending order when balances are equal.
   - `func_2`:
     - Initializes an empty list `balance_info` to store `BalanceInfo` objects.
     - Iterates through the input string `s`, calculating the balance at each position and appending corresponding `BalanceInfo` objects to `balance_info`.
     - Sorts `balance_info` using the key from `func_1`, ensuring the correct order based on the problem's requirements.
     - Constructs the result string by joining the characters from the sorted `balance_info` list.
     - Prints the result string.

4. Given the problem description and the execution summaries, both functions appear to be correctly implemented and should produce the expected output.

Correctness: **True**
