Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` is equal to `n`, `balance` is the final balance calculated based on the entire string `s`, and `balance_info` is a list containing `n` elements. Each element in `balance_info` is a `BalanceInfo` object with the following properties:
- The `balance` attribute of each `BalanceInfo` object represents the balance at the end of the iteration corresponding to the index of the object in the list.
- The `index` attribute of each `BalanceInfo` object is the index `i` at the end of the iteration.
- The `char` attribute of each `BalanceInfo` object is the character `s[i]` at the end of the iteration.

The final value of `balance` will be positive if there are more opening parentheses `(` than closing parentheses `)`, negative if there are more closing parentheses `)`, and zero if the number of opening and closing parentheses are equal.
