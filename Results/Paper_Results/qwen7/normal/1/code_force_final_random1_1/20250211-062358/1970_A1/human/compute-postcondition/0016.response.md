Postcondition: `s` is a string consisting only of characters "(", ")". `n` must be greater than 0. `balance_info` is a list containing two elements, both of which are `BalanceInfo` objects. The first element's `balance` is 2 if `s[2]` is '(', otherwise it is -1. The second element's `balance` is the same as `s[2]`. `i` is either 2 or 3. If `s[i]` is '(', `balance` is 1. Otherwise, `balance` is decreased by 1.
