Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to implement a balanced shuffle operation on a given balanced parentheses sequence. The balanced shuffle operation involves calculating the balance of the prefix up to each character, sorting these balances along with their positions, and then constructing a new sequence from the sorted characters.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1`**: This function compares two `BalanceInfo` objects and returns the difference in their balance or position depending on the balance comparison. This function is used to compare elements during the sorting process.
   - **`func_2`**: This function performs the main logic required to solve the problem. It first calculates the balance of the prefix up to each character and stores this information in a list of `BalanceInfo` objects. Then, it sorts these objects based on the balance and position. Finally, it constructs and prints the resulting balanced shuffle sequence.

3. **Correctness Verification**:
   - **`func_1`**: The function correctly handles the comparison logic needed for sorting. It ensures that the sorting is done first by balance and then by position in descending order.
   - **`func_2`**: 
     - It correctly calculates the balance of the prefix up to each character.
     - It sorts the `BalanceInfo` objects as required.
     - It constructs the final sequence by concatenating the characters from the sorted `BalanceInfo` objects, which aligns with the definition of the balanced shuffle operation.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
