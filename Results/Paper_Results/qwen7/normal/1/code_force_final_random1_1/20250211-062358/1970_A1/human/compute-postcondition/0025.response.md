Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` is equal to `n`, `n` remains the original length of the string `s`, and `balance` is the net balance of the parentheses in the string `s` (i.e., the difference between the number of '(' and ')'). The `balance_info` list contains `n` elements, each being a `BalanceInfo` object where the `balance` attribute reflects the balance at each step `i` during the loop, and `i` is the index at which the balance was recorded. If `s[i]` is '(', the `balance` attribute increases by 1, and if `s[i]` is ')', the `balance` attribute decreases by 1.
