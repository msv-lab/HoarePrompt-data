The function reads `t` test cases from the user, where each test case consists of an integer `n` (even and between 2 and 2 * 10^5), and two strings `row1` and `row2` (both of length `n` and consisting of '<' or '>'). For each test case, it calls `func_1(n, row1, row2)` and stores the result. After processing all test cases, it prints the results of `func_1` for each test case, each on a new line.
