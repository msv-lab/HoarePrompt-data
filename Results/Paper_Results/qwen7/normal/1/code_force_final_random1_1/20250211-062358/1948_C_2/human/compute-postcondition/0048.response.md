Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is at least 1 and an odd number.
- `i` is 1.
- Either `(i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<')` or `(a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<')`.

Given these conditions, let's break down the logic:

1. Since `i` is 1, we need to check the two conditions:
   - `(i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<')` becomes `(1 + 1 < n and a[1] == b[2] == '<')` which simplifies to `(2 < n and a[1] == b[2] == '<')`.
   - `(a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<')` becomes `(a[1] == b[0] == '<')`.

2. For the first condition `(2 < n and a[1] == b[2] == '<')`:
   - Since `n` is at least 1 and an odd number, `2 < n` is true.
   - The truth of `a[1] == b[2] == '<'` depends on the values of `a[1]` and `b[2]`. However, the code does not specify these values, so we cannot determine their exact values from the given information.

3. For the second condition `(a[1] == b[0] == '<')`:
   - This condition also depends on the values of `a[1]` and `b[0]`. Again, the code does not specify these values, so we cannot determine their exact values from the given information.

Since the conditions involve comparing specific elements (`a[1]`, `b[0]`, `b[2]`) and these values are not provided, we cannot definitively say whether either condition is true. However, regardless of the truth of these conditions, the code simply prints `'No'`.

Output: **No**
