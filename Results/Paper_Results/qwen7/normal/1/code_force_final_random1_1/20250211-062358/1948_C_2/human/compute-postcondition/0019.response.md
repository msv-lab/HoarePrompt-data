Output State: The loop will continue to iterate as long as `n` is greater than `i + 1` (where `i` increments by 2 each time), and the conditions `a[i] == '<' and b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == '<' and b[i - 1] == '<'` are not met. After all iterations, if the loop completes without breaking (i.e., no condition `a[i] == '<' and b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == '<' and b[i - 1] == '<'` is met for any `i`), the output will be 'yes'. If any of these conditions are met during any iteration, the loop will break and print 'No', and the loop will terminate early.

In summary, if the loop completes all its iterations without breaking, the output state will be: The final output will be 'yes'. If the loop breaks due to meeting one of the conditions, the final output will be 'No'.
