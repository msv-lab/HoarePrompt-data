Output State: **`t` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**.

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), after executing the code, `t` retains this property but now holds the specific value entered by the user. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this line of code.
