Output State: The loop will have completed all its iterations based on the value of `t`. If `t` is even, the loop will run `t` times; if `t` is odd, it will run `t` times as well. For each iteration, the loop checks the strings `a` and `b` according to the specified condition. If the condition `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` is met at any point during the loop, it will print 'No' and exit. If the loop completes all iterations without finding any match, it will print 'yes'. Therefore, the final output will be 'yes' if no break statement was executed, and 'No' if the condition was met at any iteration.

In summary, the final output state will be:
- If the loop completes all iterations without breaking, the output will be 'yes'.
- If the loop breaks due to the condition being met at any iteration, the output will be 'No'.

Output State: The final output will be either 'yes' or 'No' based on whether the loop condition was met at any point during its execution.
