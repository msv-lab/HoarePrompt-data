Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if the robot can reach cell `(2, n)` starting from `(1, 1)`.
   - It iterates through the first half of the grid (up to `n//2 - 1`), checking specific conditions.
   - If any condition fails, it returns `'No'`. Otherwise, it returns `'Yes'`.

2. **Conditions in `func_1`**:
   - For each column `i` (where `i` ranges from `1` to `n-1` in steps of `2`):
     - It checks if the arrow in the first row at position `2*i + 1` is `<` (pointing left).
     - If so, it checks if the arrow in the second row at positions `2*i` or `2*i + 2` is also `<` (pointing left).
     - If any of these conditions fail, it returns `'No'`.
   - Additional check for the last column (`n-1`):
     - If the arrow in the first row at position `n-1` is `<` and the arrow in the second row at position `n-2` is also `<`, it returns `'No'`.
   - If none of the above conditions fail, it returns `'Yes'`.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the input for multiple test cases.
   - It processes each test case by calling `func_1` and appends the result to a list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

### Correctness Check

1. **Initial Conditions**:
   - The function correctly identifies the initial position and the direction of movement.
   - The logic for checking if the robot can move to the target cell `(2, n)` is implemented correctly.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the edge cases where the robot might get stuck due to arrows pointing left in both rows.
   - The additional check for the last column ensures that the robot does not get stuck if the last column has arrows pointing left in both rows.

3. **General Logic**:
   - The logic for checking the arrows in the first half of the grid and ensuring the robot can move to the target cell is sound.
   - The function correctly returns `'Yes'` if the robot can reach the target and `'No'` otherwise.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the provided program, it appears that the logic implemented in `func_1` and `func_2` correctly determines whether the robot can reach the target cell `(2, n)` based on the given grid configuration.

**Correctness: True**
