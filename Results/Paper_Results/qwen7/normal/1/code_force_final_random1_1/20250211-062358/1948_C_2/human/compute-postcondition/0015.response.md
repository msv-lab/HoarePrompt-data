Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables and conditions:**
   - The loop variable is `i`.
   - The loop runs from `1` to `n-1` with a step of `2`.
   - The condition for continuing the loop is `i + 1 < n`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration:**
   - `n` must be greater than 4.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `step` is 2 (though `step` is not used in the loop itself).
   - `a` and `b` are lists of characters.

3. **Determine the next value of `i`:**
   - Since the loop increments `i` by `2` each time, the next value of `i` would be `i + 2`.
   - Given `i` is currently `3`, the next value of `i` would be `5`.

4. **Check the condition for the next iteration:**
   - The condition `i + 1 < n` must hold true for the loop to continue.
   - With `i` becoming `5`, the condition becomes `5 + 1 < n` or `6 < n`.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly:**
   - `i` will be `5`.
   - `n` must still be greater than 4, but now it must also be greater than 6 to satisfy the condition `i + 1 < n`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`n` must be greater than 6, `i` is 5, `step` is 2, `a` and `b` are lists of characters.**
