Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the constant `n`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop runs as long as `i + 1 < n` and either `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` is true.

3. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `t` is 0
   - `n` is at least 3
   - `a` is an input string
   - `b` is the input string from the user
   - The condition `i + 1 < n and (a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<')` was true, causing the loop to break.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop just broke due to the condition being true, we need to ensure that the loop can run again. This means `i + 1 < n` should still hold true, and the condition inside the loop should not be met in the next iteration.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be such that `i + 1 < n` is true, and the condition `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` should not be met.

5. **Adjusting `i`**:
   - Since `i` increments by 2 each time (as per the loop increment `2`), the smallest possible value for `i` that satisfies `i + 1 < n` and does not meet the condition would be the next odd number that is less than `n-1`.

Given these considerations, let's assume the smallest possible `i` that can satisfy the loop condition for the next iteration without breaking it is `i = 3` (assuming `n` is at least 5).

**State:**
- `t` is 0
- `n` is at least 3
- `a` is an input string
- `b` is the input string from the user
- `i` is 3

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is 0, `n` is at least 3, `a` is an input string, `b` is the input string from the user, `i` is 3**
