Output State: **`c` is 0, `na_frente` is an input integer, `pos_final` is an input integer, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.**

Explanation: The code creates a new list `custo_pra_passar_b` by mapping integers to the input split. The input is expected to be a series of space-separated integers. The values of `c`, `na_frente`, and `pos_final` remain unchanged. The newly created list `custo_pra_passar_b` contains the integers from the input.
