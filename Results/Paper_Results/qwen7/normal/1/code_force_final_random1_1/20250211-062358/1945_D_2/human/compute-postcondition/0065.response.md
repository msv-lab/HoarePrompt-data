Output State: **`v` is -1, `best` is the minimum value found during the loop execution, `total` is the sum of costs accumulated according to the conditions specified in the loop body, `na_frente` is an input integer, `pos_final` is an input integer, `custo_pra_trocar_a` retains its initial value, `custo_pra_passar_b` retains its initial value, and `c` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `na_frente` and `pos_final`. All other variables retain their initial values. The variable `c` is incremented by 1 due to the execution of the statement.
