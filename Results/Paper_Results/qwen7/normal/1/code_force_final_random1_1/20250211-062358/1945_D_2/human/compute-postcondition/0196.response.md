Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State Analysis
- `custo` is increased by either `a_values[y]` or `b_values[y]`, depending on whether `a_values[y]` is less than `b_values[y]`.
- `num_fila` remains greater than or equal to `max_p`.

### Loop Head Variables
- The loop variable `y` starts from `num_fila - 1` and decrements by 1 until it reaches `max_p - 1`.

### Conditions for the Next Iteration
- For the loop to execute one more time, `y` must be greater than or equal to `max_p - 1`.
- Since `y` starts from `num_fila - 1` and decrements, `y` will be `num_fila - 2` at the start of the next iteration if it continues.

### Adjusting the States
- `y` will be `num_fila - 2` at the start of the next iteration.
- `custo` will be updated based on the condition: if `a_values[y]` is less than `b_values[y]`, then `custo` is increased by `a_values[y]`; otherwise, `custo` is increased by `b_values[y]`.
- `num_fila` must remain greater than or equal to `max_p`.

### Updated State
- `y` will be `num_fila - 2`.
- `custo` will be updated based on the condition mentioned above.
- `num_fila` must remain greater than or equal to `max_p`.

### Final Answer
State: **`custo` is increased by either `a_values[num_fila - 2]` or `b_values[num_fila - 2]`, depending on whether `a_values[num_fila - 2]` is less than `b_values[num_fila - 2]`; `num_fila` must be greater than or equal to `max_p`**.
