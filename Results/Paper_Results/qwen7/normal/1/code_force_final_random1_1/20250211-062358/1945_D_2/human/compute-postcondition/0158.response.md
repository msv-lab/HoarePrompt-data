Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables and their initial states:**
   - The loop variable `v` is initialized to `na_frente` and iterates backwards until it reaches `-1`.
   - The loop starts with `v` being less than or equal to `pos_final`.

2. **Understand the loop condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `v` is greater than or equal to `-1`.

3. **Determine the state adjustments needed:**
   - Since the loop runs from `v = na_frente` down to `v = -1`, the next iteration would start with `v` being decremented by 1 from its current value.
   - The loop will stop when `v` becomes less than `-1`.

4. **Adjust the states based on the loop head:**
   - The only variable in the loop head that changes with each iteration is `v`.
   - `na_frente`, `pos_final`, `total`, `best`, `custo_pra_trocar_a`, and `custo_pra_passar_b` remain unchanged within the loop body.

5. **Calculate the new state of `v`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `v` was some value between `na_frente` and `-1`.
   - For the next iteration, `v` will be decremented by 1.

6. **Ensure the loop condition is met:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `v` is greater than or equal to `-1`.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `v` will be decremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `na_frente`, `pos_final`, `total`, `best`, `custo_pra_trocar_a`, and `custo_pra_passar_b` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**`total` is either incremented by `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` (starting from 0), `best` is either updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if it is less than the current `best`, or remains 10, `na_frente` must be greater than or equal to -1, `v` is initialized to `na_frente` and is now `v - 1` and less than or equal to `pos_final`.**

State: **`total` is either incremented by `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` (starting from 0), `best` is either updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if it is less than the current `best`, or remains 10, `na_frente` must be greater than or equal to -1, `v` is initialized to `na_frente` and is now `v - 1` and less than or equal to `pos_final`.**
