Postcondition: **`y` is 1, `y` must be greater than or equal to 0, `custo` is the sum of `b_values[y]` for each `y` in the range from `num_fila - 1` down to 0 plus `a_values[0]`, and `a_values[0] + b_values[1]` is less than or equal to `a_values[1]`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
