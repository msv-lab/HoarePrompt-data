Output State: **`custo` is increased by `a_values[y]`, `y` is `num_fila - 2`.**

Explanation: The code `custo += a_values[y]` increases the value of `custo` by `a_values[y]`. Given that `y` is initially `num_fila - 2`, the value of `y` remains unchanged. Therefore, `custo` is updated by adding `a_values[y]` to its current value.
