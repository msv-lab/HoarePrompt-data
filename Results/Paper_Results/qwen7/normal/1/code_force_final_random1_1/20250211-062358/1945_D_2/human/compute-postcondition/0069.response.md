Output State: **`v` is -1, `best` is the minimum value found during the loop execution, `total` is the sum of costs accumulated according to the conditions specified in the loop body, `na_frente` is `na_frente` - 1, `pos_final` is `pos_final` - 1, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from input split and converted to integers, `c` is `c` + 1.**

Explanation: The code `pos_final -= 1` decrements the value of `pos_final` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
