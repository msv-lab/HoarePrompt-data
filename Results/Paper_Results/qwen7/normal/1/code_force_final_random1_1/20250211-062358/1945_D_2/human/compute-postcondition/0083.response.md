Output State: **`v` is greater than `pos_final`, `na_frente` is greater than -1, `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, and `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `total` by adding `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to it. The values of `v`, `na_frente`, and `best` remain unchanged from their previous states, except for `total` which is updated.
