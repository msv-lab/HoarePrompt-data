Output State: **`v` is an integer such that `v = v - 1`, `na_frente`, `pos_final`, `best`, and `total` are unchanged; `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`.**

Explanation: The code `total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` increments the value of `total` by the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. The other variables (`v`, `na_frente`, `pos_final`, `best`) remain unchanged as per the initial conditions and the given postcondition.
