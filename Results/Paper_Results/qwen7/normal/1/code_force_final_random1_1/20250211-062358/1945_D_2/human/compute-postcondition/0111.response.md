Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `v` and `na_frente`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over `v` from `na_frente` to `-1` with a step of `-1`. This means `v` starts at `na_frente` and decreases by 1 until it reaches `-1`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `v` is `-2`
   - `best` is updated based on certain conditions (either `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[-2]` or `total + custo_pra_passar_b[-2]`)
   - `na_frente` must be greater than `-1`
   - `total` is increased by either `custo_pra_trocar_a[-2]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[-2]`

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `v` starts at `na_frente` and decreases by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `v` is `-2`. For the next iteration, `v` will be `-3`.
   - `na_frente` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.

5. **Consider the postconditions**:
   - `best` is updated based on the values of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[-2]` or `total + custo_pra_passar_b[-2]`.
   - `v` must be greater than `-1` for the loop to continue.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `v` is `-3`
- `na_frente` must be greater than `-1`
- `best` is updated based on the previous iteration's conditions
- `total` is increased by either `custo_pra_trocar_a[-2]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[-2]`

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `v` is -3, `na_frente` must be greater than -1, `best` is updated to either `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[-2]` or `total + custo_pra_passar_b[-2]` depending on whether `best` is greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[-2]`, and `total` is increased by either `custo_pra_trocar_a[-2]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[-2]` accordingly.**
