Output State: **`custo` is increased by `b_values[y]`, `num_fila` is greater than or equal to `max_p`, `a_values[y]` is greater than or equal to `b_values[y]`**

Explanation: The code `custo += b_values[y]` increments the value of `custo` by the value of `b_values[y]`. The other conditions and values remain unchanged from the initial state.
