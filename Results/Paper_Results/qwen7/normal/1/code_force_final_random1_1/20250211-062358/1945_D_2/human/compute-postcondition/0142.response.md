Output State: **`total` is now `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, `best` is either `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or remains `best`, `na_frente` must be greater than or equal to -1, `v` is initialized to `na_frente`, the current value of `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, and if `best` is greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, then `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. Additionally, `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`**.

This means that the value of `total` has been updated by adding `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` to its previous value. All other conditions and relationships between variables remain unchanged from the initial state.
