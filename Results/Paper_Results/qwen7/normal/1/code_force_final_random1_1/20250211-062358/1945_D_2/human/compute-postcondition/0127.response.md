Output State: **`v` is -1, `best` is the maximum value between 10 and the accumulated `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]` from the previous iteration, `na_frente` is an input integer, `total` is 0, and `pos_final` is an input integer; `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from user input.**

Explanation: The code reads a list of integers from the user input using `input().split()`, which splits the input string into individual elements and then converts each element to an integer using `map(int, ...)`. The resulting list is assigned to the variable `custo_pra_trocar_a`. However, since the initial values of `v`, `best`, `na_frente`, `total`, and `pos_final` remain unchanged, they are still as described in the initial state.
