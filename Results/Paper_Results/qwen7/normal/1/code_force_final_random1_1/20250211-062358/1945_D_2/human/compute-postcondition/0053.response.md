Output State: **`v` is `v - 1`; `best` is either `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `best` is greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, or it remains unchanged; `na_frente`, `pos_final`, and `total` are unchanged; `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.**

Explanation: The code increases the value of `total` by `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. The other variables (`v`, `best`, `na_frente`, `pos_final`, and `total`) are updated according to their respective postconditions, but the specific values of `v` and `best` remain as per their conditions.
