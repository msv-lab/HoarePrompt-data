Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `custo` is an integer representing the final accumulated cost based on the given conditions. Specifically, `custo` is the sum of either `a_values[y]` or `b_values[y]` for each `y` in the range from `num_fila - 1` down to `max_p - 1`, depending on whether `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is less than or equal to `a_values[y]`. If `y` reaches 1 during the last iteration and the condition `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]` is true, `custo` will also include the value of `a_values[0]`. The loop ensures that once `y` is set to 1 and the condition is met, it adds `a_values[0]` to `custo` and breaks out of the loop. If the condition is not met, `custo` is incremented by `a_values[y]` and the loop continues until `y` is decremented to 0.
