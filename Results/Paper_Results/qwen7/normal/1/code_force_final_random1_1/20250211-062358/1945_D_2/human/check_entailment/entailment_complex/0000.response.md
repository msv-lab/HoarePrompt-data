Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`cases`) and processes each test case individually. It correctly extracts `na_frente` (number of people in front of Kirill) and `pos_final` (maximum allowable final position of Kirill).

2. **Cost Lists**: The program correctly reads and stores the costs from the two lists `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b`.

3. **Adjustments**: The program adjusts `na_frente` and `pos_final` by subtracting 1, which is necessary because indexing starts from 0.

4. **Dynamic Cost Calculation**: The core logic of the program iterates backward through the positions, calculating the minimum cost to reach `pos_final`. This is done by comparing the cost of moving to the previous position using `a_i` versus `b_i` for each intermediate position. The program correctly updates the `total` cost and `best` minimum cost accordingly.

5. **Boundary Conditions**: The program handles the boundary condition when `v` (current position) is less than or equal to `pos_final`, ensuring that the cost calculation respects the constraints of the problem.

6. **Output**: The program prints the minimum cost found for each test case, which is consistent with the problem statement.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
