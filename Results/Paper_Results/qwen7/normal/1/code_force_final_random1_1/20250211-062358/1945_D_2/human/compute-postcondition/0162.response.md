Output State: **`total` is incremented by `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if it is less than the current `best`, `na_frente` is greater than or equal to -1, `v` is now `v - 1` and less than or equal to `pos_final`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` increments the value of `total` by `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. The conditions for updating `best`, ensuring `na_frente` is greater than or equal to -1, and setting `v` to `v - 1` and ensuring it is less than or equal to `pos_final` remain unchanged from the initial postconditions.
