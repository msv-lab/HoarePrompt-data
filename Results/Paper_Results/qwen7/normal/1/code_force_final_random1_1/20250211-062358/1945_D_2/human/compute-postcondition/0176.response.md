Output State: **`total` is incremented by `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if it is less than the current `best`, `na_frente` is greater than or equal to -1, `v` is now `v - 1` and greater than or equal to -1.**

Explanation: The code `total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` increments the value of `total` by the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged, so `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if it is less than the current `best`, `na_frente` remains greater than or equal to -1, and `v` is decremented by 1 and remains greater than or equal to -1.
