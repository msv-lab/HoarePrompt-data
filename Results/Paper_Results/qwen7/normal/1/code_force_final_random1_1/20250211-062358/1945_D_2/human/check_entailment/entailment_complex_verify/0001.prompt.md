You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The guys lined up in a queue of n people, starting with person number i = 1 ,
to ask Serafim the Owl about the meaning of life. Unfortunately, Kirill was
very busy writing the legend for this problem, so he arrived a little later
and stood at the end of the line after the n -th person. Kirill is completely
dissatisfied with this situation, so he decided to bribe some people ahead of
him.

For the i -th person in the queue, Kirill knows two values: a_i and b_i . If
at the moment Kirill is standing at position i , then he can choose any
position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j .
In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that
j < k < i , Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k .
Kirill can perform this action any number of times.

Kirill is thrifty, so he wants to spend as few coins as possible, but he
doesn't want to wait too long, so Kirill believes he should be among the first
m people in line.

Help Kirill determine the minimum number of coins he will have to spend in
order to not wait too long.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows
the description of the test case.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le m \le n
\le 200\,000 ) — the number of people in the queue besides Kirill and the
maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n separated by spaces
(1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n separated by spaces (1
\le b_i \le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of coins
Kirill needs to spend.

    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `v` will be -1, `best` will hold the minimum value found during all iterations of the loop, `na_frente` will be less than or equal to -1, and `total` will be the cumulative cost based on the conditions specified in the loop body.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by two positive integers \(n\) and \(m\), and two lists of \(n\) positive integers \(a\) and \(b\). For each test case, it calculates the minimum cost to move from position \(na_frente\) to position \(pos_final\) using either the cost from list \(a\) or list \(b\), depending on which is cheaper at each step. The function then prints the minimum cost found for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap
- We need to help Kirill minimize the cost of moving to one of the first `m` positions in a queue.
- For each position `i`, we have two costs:
  - `a_i`: Cost to swap with the person at position `i`.
  - `b_i`: Cost for each person between `i` and the current position `j` (`j < i`) when swapping.
- Kirill wants to be in one of the first `m` positions in the queue.

### Program Analysis
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of people `n` and the maximum allowable final position `m`.
   - It then reads the arrays `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - `na_frente` is set to `n - 1` (number of people in front of Kirill).
   - `pos_final` is set to `m - 1` (maximum allowable final position).
   - `total` is initialized to 0.
   - `best` is initialized to a large value (`10 ** 12`).

3. **Main Logic:**
   - The loop iterates from `na_frente` to `-1` (backwards through the positions).
   - For each position `v`:
     - If `v` is within the allowed range (`v <= pos_final`):
       - Update `best` if the current total plus `a_v` is less than the current `best`.
       - Choose the cheaper option between `a_v` and `b_v` to update `total`.
     - If `v` is beyond the allowed range:
       - Add the cheaper option between `a_v` and `b_v` to `total`.

4. **Output:**
   - Print the minimum cost stored in `best`.

### Correctness Check
- The logic correctly handles the backward iteration through the positions.
- The `best` variable is updated to store the minimum cost to reach a position within the allowed range.
- The choice between `a_v` and `b_v` is made correctly based on the problem constraints.
- The program outputs the correct result for each test case.

Given the analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.

### Conclusion
The program is correct according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
