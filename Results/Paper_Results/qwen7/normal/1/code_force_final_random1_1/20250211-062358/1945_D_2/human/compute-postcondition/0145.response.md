Output State: **`total` is now `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` more than its original value (which was 0), `best` remains unchanged, `na_frente` must be greater than or equal to -1, `v` is still initialized to `na_frente`, the current value of `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, and if `best` is not greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, then `best` remains unchanged.**

This means that the `total` variable has been updated by adding the value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to it, while all other variables remain in their original conditions or as specified in the precondition.
