Output State: **`v` is an integer such that `v = v - 1`, `na_frente` is an integer (unchanged), `pos_final` is an integer (unchanged), `best` is equal to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, and `total` is an integer (unchanged).**

This means that the variable `v` has been decremented by 1, `best` is now updated to be the sum of `total` and `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, while `na_frente`, `pos_final`, and `total` remain unchanged from their initial states.
