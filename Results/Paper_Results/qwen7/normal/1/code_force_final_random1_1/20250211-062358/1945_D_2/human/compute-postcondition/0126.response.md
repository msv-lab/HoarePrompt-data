Output State: **`v` is -1, `best` is the maximum value between 10 and the accumulated `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]` from the previous iteration, `na_frente` is an input integer, `total` is 0, and `pos_final` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `na_frente` and `pos_final`. Since the initial values of `v`, `best`, `na_frente`, and `total` are provided, and no calculation or assignment involving these variables is performed within the given code snippet, their values remain unchanged. The newly introduced variables `na_frente` and `pos_final` are assigned the values obtained from the input.
