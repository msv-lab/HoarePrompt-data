Output State: **`y` is 1, `y` must be greater than or equal to 0, `custo` is the sum of `b_values[y]` for each `y` in the range from `num_fila - 1` down to 0 plus `a_values[0]`, and `a_values[0] + b_values[1]` is less than or equal to `a_values[1]`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables but instead exits the loop or conditional block it is within. Since no specific loop or conditional block was mentioned, we assume it is breaking out of the most internal one. All the conditions and values of the variables remain unchanged.
