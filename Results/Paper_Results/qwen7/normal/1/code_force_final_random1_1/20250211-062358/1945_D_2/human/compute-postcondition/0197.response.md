Output State: **`custo` is increased by `a_values[num_fila - 2]`, `num_fila` must be greater than or equal to `max_p`, and `custo` is now `custo + a_values[y]`.**

Explanation: The code `custo += a_values[y]` updates the value of `custo` by adding `a_values[y]` to its current value. The conditions for `custo` being updated by either `a_values[num_fila - 2]` or `b_values[num_fila - 2]` based on their comparison remain unchanged, but since `y` is used instead of `num_fila - 2`, the specific value of `custo` after this operation depends on the value of `a_values[y]`. The condition that `num_fila` must be greater than or equal to `max_p` also remains valid.
