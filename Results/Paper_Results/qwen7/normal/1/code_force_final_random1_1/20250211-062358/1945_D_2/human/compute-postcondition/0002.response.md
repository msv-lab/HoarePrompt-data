Output State: **`c` is 0, `na_frente` is an input integer, `pos_final` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `na_frente, pos_final = map(int, input().split())` takes a line of input, splits it into two parts, and converts each part to an integer. These integers are then assigned to the variables `na_frente` and `pos_final`. The initial value of `c` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the operation. The conditions that `cases` must be greater than 0 are not directly affected by the given code, so they remain valid.
