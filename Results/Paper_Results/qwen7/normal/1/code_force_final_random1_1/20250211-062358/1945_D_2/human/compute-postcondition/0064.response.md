Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is defined by the variable `c` in the range `range(cases)`. This means the only variables involved in the loop condition are `c` and `cases`.

2. **Determine the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `c < cases`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `v` is -1
   - `best` is the minimum value found during the loop execution
   - `total` is the sum of costs accumulated according to the conditions specified in the loop body
   - `na_frente`, `pos_final`, `custo_pra_trocar_a`, and `custo_pra_passar_b` retain their initial values

4. **Adjusting the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `c` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `c` would be equal to the number of iterations completed minus 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `c` needs to be incremented by 1, so it becomes `c + 1`.
   - The values of `best`, `total`, `na_frente`, `pos_final`, `custo_pra_trocar_a`, and `custo_pra_passar_b` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop condition.

5. **New state for the next iteration**:
   - `v` remains -1
   - `best` remains the minimum value found during the loop execution
   - `total` remains the sum of costs accumulated according to the conditions specified in the loop body
   - `na_frente`, `pos_final`, `custo_pra_trocar_a`, and `custo_pra_passar_b` retain their initial values
   - `c` is incremented by 1, so if it was `c` before, now it is `c + 1`

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`v` is -1, `best` is the minimum value found during the loop execution, `total` is the sum of costs accumulated according to the conditions specified in the loop body, `na_frente`, `pos_final`, `custo_pra_trocar_a`, and `custo_pra_passar_b` retain their initial values, and `c` is incremented by 1**.
