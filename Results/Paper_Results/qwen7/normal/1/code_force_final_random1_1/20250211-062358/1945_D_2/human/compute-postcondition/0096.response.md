Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable is `v`.
   - The loop runs from `na_frente` to `-1` in reverse order (`-1` is inclusive).

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `v` is within the range `[na_frente, -1]`.

3. **Determine the New State After One Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `v` was some value within the range `[na_frente, -1]`.
   - For the loop to continue, `v` must be decremented by 1 and still be within the range `[na_frente, -1]`.

4. **Check the Range:**
   - If `v` was the current minimum value in the range (i.e., `-1`), then the loop will terminate.
   - Otherwise, `v` will be decremented by 1.

5. **Adjust the States:**
   - `v` will be decremented by 1.
   - `na_frente` remains unchanged because it is the upper bound of the range.
   - The other variables (`best`, `total`, `custo_pra_trocar_a`, `custo_pra_passar_b`, and `pos_final`) remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body.

Given these points, let's formulate the new state:

- `v` will be decremented by 1.
- `na_frente` remains the same.
- `best`, `total`, `custo_pra_trocar_a`, `custo_pra_passar_b`, and `pos_final` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`v` is -2, `best` is updated to either `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` (if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]`), or `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]` (if `v > pos_final`), `na_frente` must be greater than -1, and `total` is increased by either `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` depending on the condition. If `v > pos_final`, `best` remains 10, `v` is greater than `pos_final`, and `total` is the original value of `total` plus the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, or `custo_pra_passar_b[-1]` otherwise.**
