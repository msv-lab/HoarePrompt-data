Postcondition: `total` is incremented by either `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `best` is updated to the minimum value between `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]` if it is less than the current `best`, `na_frente` is greater than or equal to -1, `v` is now `v - 1` and greater than or equal to -1.
