Output State: **`custo` is an integer plus the value of `b_values[y]`, `y` is one less than the final value of `custo`.**

Explanation: The code updates `custo` by adding the value of `b_values[y]` to it. Since `y` is defined as being one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration, the new value of `y` is now one less than the updated value of `custo`. The initial state of `custo` being an integer and `y` being one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration remains true, but `custo` itself has been updated.
