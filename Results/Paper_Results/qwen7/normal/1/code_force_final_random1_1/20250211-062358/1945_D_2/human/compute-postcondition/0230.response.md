Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State
- `custo` is an integer.
- The postcondition for `custo` is defined based on the value of `y`:
  - If `y` is 1, `custo` is the sum of `b_values[y]` for each `y` in the range from `num_fila - 1` down to 0 plus `a_values[0]`.
  - If `y` is `max_p - 2`, `custo` is the sum of `a_values[y]` and `b_values[y]` for each `y` in the range from `num_fila - 1` down to `max_p - 2`.
  - For other values of `y`, `custo` is the sum of either `a_values[y]` or `b_values[y]` for each `y` in the range from `num_fila - 1` down to `max_p - 2`, depending on whether `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is less than or equal to `a_values[y]`.

### Loop Head
The loop iterates over `y` in the range from `max_p - 1` down to 1 (inclusive).

### Loop Body
The loop body is omitted, but we know that it affects the calculation of `custo`.

### Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `custo` is an integer.
- Depending on the value of `y`, `custo` has been updated according to the postcondition.

### Next Iteration
For the next iteration, `y` will decrease by 1. Therefore, `y` will now be one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration.

### Adjusting States
- `y` will be decreased by 1.
- The range of the loop will change accordingly, but since the loop is iterating from `max_p - 1` down to 1, the new range will still be valid as long as `y` is within this range.

### Updated State
- `custo` remains the same unless the loop body updates it.
- `y` will be one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration.

### Conclusion
Given the postcondition and the loop range, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `y`.

#### Final Answer:
State: **`custo` is an integer, `y` is one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration**.
