Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `r` is decreased by 1, `l` is greater than or equal to `r`, `a` is the value of `B[r]`, `b` is `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b` by adding `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)` to its current value. Since `i` is 0, the updated value of `b` becomes `b + (0 - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`, which simplifies to `b - idx_A[l - 1] * (r + 1)`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
