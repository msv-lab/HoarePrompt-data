Output State: **`B` is a list where if `len(idx_B)` is 0, then `B` is [0]. Otherwise, the last element of `B` is updated to `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - (n - 1 - 1)) * len(idx_B)`. `idx_B` is `[i]`. `n` is greater than 0. `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'. `A` is a list containing the sum of distances between '>' characters with appropriate multiplicative factors. `idx_A` is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in `s`. `j` is 2. `i` is `n - 3`. The current value of `s[i]` is '<'**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `i` to `n - 1 - j`. Given that `j` was initially 1, after executing `i = n - 1 - j`, `j` becomes 2 and `i` is set to `n - 3`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
