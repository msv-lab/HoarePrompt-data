Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, and the character at index `i` of string `s` is equal to '>', and `l` is greater than or equal to `r`. In both cases (when `r == 0` and when `r != 0`), `l` is either equal to `r` or greater than `r` by at least 1. Additionally, if `r` is not equal to 0, then `b` is calculated as `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`, and `a` is calculated as `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`.
