Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is greater than or equal to `r`, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is equal to `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, and `b` is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `a` by adding `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l` to the current value of `a`. Since `i` is 1, the expression simplifies to `a = A[l - 1] + (1 - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`. The value of `b` is also updated by adding `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)` to its current value. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
