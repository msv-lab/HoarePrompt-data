Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is greater than or equal to `r`, `a` is now `A[l]`, `b` is updated to `B[r - 1] - B[r - (l + 2)] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`, `r` is unchanged, and `x` is `r - (l + 2)`**.

Explanation: The code `b = b - B[x]` subtracts the value of `B[x]` from `b`. Given that `x` is defined as `r - (l + 2)`, the new value of `b` becomes `B[r - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r - B[r - (l + 2)]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
