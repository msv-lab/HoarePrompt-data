Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 0, and the current value of `s[i]` is equal to '>', and if the length of `idx_A` is 0, then `A` contains the element 0 and `x` is equal to `A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`. Otherwise, `A` now contains one additional element which is `x`, and `x` is equal to `A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`.**
