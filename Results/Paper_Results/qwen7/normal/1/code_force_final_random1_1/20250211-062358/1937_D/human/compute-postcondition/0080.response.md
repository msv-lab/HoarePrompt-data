Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - The character at index `i` of string `s` is equal to '>'.
   - `l` is less than `r`.
   - `b` is calculated as `(idx_B[r - 1] - 0) * (l + 1)`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1, end=' ')
   ```

From the initial state, we know:
- `i` is explicitly given as 0.
- `b` is calculated as `(idx_B[r - 1] - 0) * (l + 1)`. Since `idx_B[r - 1]` is not explicitly defined, we cannot determine its exact value, but we know it is an integer.
- `a` is not mentioned in the initial state, so we cannot determine its value.

Given these details, the expression `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1` simplifies to:
- `a * 2`: This term depends on the value of `a`, which is unknown.
- `b * 2`: Since `b = (idx_B[r - 1] - 0) * (l + 1)`, this term is `2 * (idx_B[r - 1] - 0) * (l + 1)`.
- `i + 1`: Since `i` is 0, this term is `0 + 1 = 1`.

Therefore, the expression becomes:
\[ a * 2 + 2 * (idx_B[r - 1] - 0) * (l + 1) + 1 \]

Since `a` is not specified, we cannot provide a precise numerical value for the entire expression. However, we can describe the components clearly.

Output: **a * 2 + 2 * (idx_B[r - 1]) * (l + 1) + 1 (where a is an unknown value, idx_B[r - 1] is an integer, and l is less than r)**
