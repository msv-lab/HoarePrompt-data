Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state is given as follows:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` must be greater than 0 (though its exact value is not specified).
   - `r` is decreased by 1 (though its initial value is not specified).
   - The current value of `l` is 0.

2. The code snippet to be executed is:
   ```python
   print(i + 1, end=' ')
   ```

3. Since `i` is explicitly stated to be 0, we can directly substitute this value into the expression `i + 1`.

4. Therefore, `i + 1` evaluates to `0 + 1`, which is `1`.

5. The `end=' '` parameter in the `print` function specifies that after printing `1`, a space should be added instead of a newline.

Output: **1 **
