Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is greater than or equal to `r`, and depending on the value of `r`, `b` is either unchanged if `r` is 0, or `b` is updated to `b + (idx_B[r] - i) * l` if `r` is not 0. If `r` is 0, `a` remains unchanged and `b` is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`. If `r` is not 0, `a` is updated to `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, `b` is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`, and `a` is `B[r - 1]` if `l - r <= 0`.
