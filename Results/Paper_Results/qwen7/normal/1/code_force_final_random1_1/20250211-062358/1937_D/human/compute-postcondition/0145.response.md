Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 0
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `l` is greater than or equal to `r`
   - Depending on the value of `r`, `b` is either unchanged if `r` is 0, or `b` is updated to `b + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`. If `r` is not 0, `a` is the value of `B[r]` and `b` is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(0, n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop variable `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
   - Since `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented to 1 in the next iteration.
   - The other variables (`n`, `l`, `r`, `a`, `b`, `idx_A`, `idx_B`) are not directly modified within the loop head, so their values remain the same unless explicitly updated inside the loop body.

4. **Conditions for the Loop to Execute Again:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.
   - Given that `i` is incremented by 1, the new value of `i` will be 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must still be less than `n`.

5. **Updated States:**
   - `i` will be 1.
   - `n` remains the same and must still be greater than 0.
   - `l` and `r` remain the same and `l` must still be greater than or equal to `r`.
   - `b` and `a` remain the same unless updated inside the loop body, but since they are not mentioned in the loop head, they stay unchanged.

Given these points, the updated states for the next iteration are:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is greater than or equal to `r`, and depending on the value of `r`, `b` is either unchanged if `r` is 0, or `b` is updated to `b + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`. If `r` is not 0, `a` is the value of `B[r]` and `b` is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1).**
