Output State: **`j` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 4`, `x` is undefined, `B` is a list containing an undefined element.**

The code `B.append(x)` appends the value of `x` to the list `B`. Since `x` is undefined, it remains undefined after the operation. The other variables (`j`, `n`, `i`) are not affected by this operation.
