Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, and the character at index `i` of string `s` is equal to '>', and `l` is greater than or equal to `r`. In both cases (whether `r == 0` or not), `i` remains 0, `n` remains greater than 0, and the character at index `i` of string `s` remains equal to '>'. If `r == 0`, then `l` is greater than or equal to `r` and `r` is 0. Otherwise, `l` is greater than `r` by at least 1, `r` is not equal to 0, and the values of `b` and `a` are defined as specified in the else part.
