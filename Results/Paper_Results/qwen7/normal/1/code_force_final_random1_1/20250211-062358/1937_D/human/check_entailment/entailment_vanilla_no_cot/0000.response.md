Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly simulate the movement of the pinball according to the problem statement. Here are some key issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Movement Duration**: The logic for calculating the duration of the pinball's movement is flawed. The current implementation does not accurately account for the inversion of directions and the movement of the pinball until it leaves the grid.

2. **Handling of Grid Boundaries**: The code does not properly handle the boundary conditions where the pinball leaves the grid. Specifically, it does not correctly compute the time taken for the pinball to reach the boundaries.

3. **Complexity and Efficiency**: The current approach involves complex calculations that do not align with the expected behavior of the pinball. It seems to be overcomplicating the problem rather than solving it directly.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you should simulate the movement of the pinball step-by-step for each query. Hereâ€™s a more straightforward way to implement the solution:

```python
def simulate_pinball(s, i):
    n = len(s)
    time = 0
    while 0 <= i < n:
        time += 1
        if s[i] == '<':
            i -= 1
        else:
            i += 1
        s = s[::-1]  # Invert the direction
    return time

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    results = [simulate_pinball(s, i) for i in range(n)]
    print(' '.join(map(str, results)))
```

This approach simulates the movement of the pinball step-by-step, inverting the direction after each move, and counts the time until the pinball leaves the grid. This ensures that the solution is both correct and efficient.
