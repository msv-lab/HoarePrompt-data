Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `B` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `A` is a list containing the sum of distances between '>' characters with appropriate multiplicative factors, `idx_A` is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `idx_B` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(0, n):
    i = n - 1 - j
    if s[i] == '<':
        if len(idx_B) == 0:
            B.append(0)
        else:
            x = B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)
            B.append(x)
        idx_B.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `B` is a list where if `len(idx_B)` is 0, then `B` is [0]. Otherwise, the last element of `B` is updated to `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - (n - 1 - j)) * len(idx_B)`. `idx_B` is `[i]`. `n` is greater than 0. `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'. `A` is a list containing the sum of distances between '>' characters with appropriate multiplicative factors. `idx_A` is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in `s`. `j` is 0. `i` is `n - 1 - j`. The current value of `s[i]` is '<'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `B` is a list where its last element is updated to `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - (n - 2)) * len(idx_B)`, `idx_B` is `[i]`, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `A` is a list containing the sum of distances between '>' characters with appropriate multiplicative factors, `idx_A` is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `j` is 2, `i` is `n - 3`, and the current value of `s[i]` is '<'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `j` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 4`, and if `s[i]` equals '<', then `idx_B` is `[i]`. If `s[i]` does not equal '<', then `idx_B` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
