Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `i` is `n`; `A` is a list containing 0.**

Explanation: The code `A.append(0)` adds the value `0` to the list `A`. Since `A` was not defined before, it is initialized as a new list with one element `0`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state.
