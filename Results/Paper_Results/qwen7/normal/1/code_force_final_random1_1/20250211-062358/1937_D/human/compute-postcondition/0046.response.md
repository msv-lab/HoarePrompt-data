Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop variable in this case is `j`. The other variables that might change within the loop are `i` and `s[i]`.

2. **Initial States**:
   - `B` is a list where if `len(idx_B)` is 0, then `B` is [0]. Otherwise, the last element of `B` is updated to `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - (n - 1 - j)) * len(idx_B)`.
   - `idx_B` is `[i]`.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
   - `A` is a list containing the sum of distances between '>' characters with appropriate multiplicative factors.
   - `idx_A` is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in `s`.
   - `j` is 0.
   - `i` is `n - 1 - j`.
   - The current value of `s[i]` is '<'.

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs from `j = 0` to `j < n`.
   - For each iteration, `j` increases by 1.

4. **Current Values**:
   - `j` is currently 0.
   - `i` is `n - 1 - j`, which means `i` is `n - 1 - 0 = n - 1`.
   - The current value of `s[i]` is '<'.

5. **Next Iteration**:
   - After the first iteration, `j` becomes 1.
   - `i` becomes `n - 1 - 1 = n - 2`.
   - The value of `s[i]` remains '<' because the loop body does not change it.

6. **Adjusting the States**:
   - `j` changes from 0 to 1.
   - `i` changes from `n - 1` to `n - 2`.
   - The value of `s[i]` remains '<'.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are `j`, `i`, and `s[i]`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`B` is a list where if `len(idx_B)` is 0, then `B` is [0]. Otherwise, the last element of `B` is updated to `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - (n - 1 - 1)) * len(idx_B)`. `idx_B` is `[i]`. `n` is greater than 0. `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'. `A` is a list containing the sum of distances between '>' characters with appropriate multiplicative factors. `idx_A` is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in `s`. `j` is 1. `i` is `n - 1 - 1`. The current value of `s[i]` is '<'.**
