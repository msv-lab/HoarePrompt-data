Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is increased by 1, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, `b` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b` by subtracting `(idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)` from its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the new value of `b` is the original value of `b` minus the specified term.
