Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is greater than or equal to `r`, `a` is equal to `B[r]`, `r` is `r - 1`, `b` is `A[l - 1]`**.

The code assigns the value of `A[l - 1]` to `b`. Since `l` is greater than or equal to `r` and `r` is decreased by 1 before this line of code, `l` remains greater than or equal to `r`. All other variables retain their previous states.
