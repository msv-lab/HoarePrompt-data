Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is greater than or equal to `r`, `a` is `A[l]`, `b` is `(idx_B[r - 1] - 1) * (l + 1)`, `x` is `r - (l + 2)`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b` to `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`. Given the initial conditions, `i` is 1, so `b` becomes `(idx_B[r - 1] - 1) * (l + 1)`. The values of `n`, `l`, `r`, `a`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states.
