Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is greater than or equal to `r`, `r` is equal to `r - 1`, `a` is equal to `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, `b` is equal to `B[r] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1) - B[r - l]**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b` by subtracting `B[r - l]` from its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `b` is now `B[r] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1) - B[r - l]`.
