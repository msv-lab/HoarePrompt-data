Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `l` is greater than or equal to `r`.
   - `b` is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`.
   - `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`.
   - `b` is `A[l - 1]` if `l - r <= 0`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i), end=' ')
   ```

Given these conditions, let's analyze the values of `a` and `b`:

- Since `i` is 1, and `l` is greater than or equal to `r`, the condition `l - r <= 0` could either be true or false. If it is true, then `b = A[l - 1]`. Otherwise, `b` remains as previously updated.

- For `a`, since `i` is 1, the expression simplifies to:
  \[
  a = B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - 1) * r
  \]

- The value of `b` depends on the condition `l - r <= 0`:
  - If `l - r <= 0`, then `b = A[l - 1]`.
  - Otherwise, `b` retains its previous value.

- The term `(n - i)` simplifies to `(n - 1)`.

So, the expression to be printed becomes:
\[
a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - 1)
\]

Since the exact values of `A`, `B`, `idx_A`, and `idx_B` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical values of `a` and `b`. However, we can express the output in terms of the given variables.

Output: **(B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - 1) * r) * 2 + (A[l - 1] if l - r <= 0 else b) * 2 + (n - 1)**
