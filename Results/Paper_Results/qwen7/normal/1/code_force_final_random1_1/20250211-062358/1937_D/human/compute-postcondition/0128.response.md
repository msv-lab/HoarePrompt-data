Given the initial state:
- `i` is 0
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `r` is equal to 0
- `l` is greater than `r`

We need to evaluate the expression `n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2`.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Evaluate `i`:**
   - `i` is explicitly given as 0.

2. **Evaluate `n`:**
   - `n` is greater than 0 but its exact value is not specified. We'll denote it as `n > 0`.

3. **Evaluate `r`:**
   - `r` is explicitly given as 0.

4. **Evaluate `l`:**
   - `l` is explicitly given as being greater than `r`. Since `r` is 0, `l` must be greater than 0. We'll denote it as `l > 0`.

5. **Evaluate `idx_A[l - 1]`:**
   - The value of `idx_A[l - 1]` is not provided, so we cannot determine its exact value. We'll denote it as `idx_A[l - 1]`.

Now, let's substitute these values into the expression:

\[ n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) \times 2 \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ n - 0 + (0 - idx_A[l - 1]) \times 2 \]
\[ n + (- idx_A[l - 1]) \times 2 \]
\[ n - 2 \times idx_A[l - 1] \]

Therefore, the expression simplifies to `n - 2 * idx_A[l - 1]`.

Output: **n - 2 * idx_A[l - 1]**
