Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is greater than or equal to `r`, `a` is equal to `B[r]`, `r` is `r - 1`, `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 2] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b` by subtracting `(idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)` from the current value of `b`. Since the initial value of `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 2]`, the new value of `b` becomes `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 2] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
