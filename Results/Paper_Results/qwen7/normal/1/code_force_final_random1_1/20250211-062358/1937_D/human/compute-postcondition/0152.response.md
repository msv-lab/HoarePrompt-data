Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is greater than or equal to `r`, `a` is `A[l]`, `b` is updated to `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r] - i) * l` if `r` is 0, otherwise `b` is updated to `B[r - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`, `x` is `r - (l + 2)`, if `x >= 0`, then `b` is further updated to `b - B[x] - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)`.
