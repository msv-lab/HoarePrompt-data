Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 2.
- `n` must be greater than 0, but its exact value is not needed to determine the output of the print statement.
- `l` is greater than or equal to `r`, but their exact values are not needed.
- `r` is decreased by 1, but the exact new value of `r` is not needed to determine the output of the print statement.

The print statement is:
```python
print(i + 1, end=' ')
```

Here, `i` is 2, so `i + 1` evaluates to 3. The `end=' '` argument in the `print` function ensures that the output is followed by a space rather than a newline.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **3 **
