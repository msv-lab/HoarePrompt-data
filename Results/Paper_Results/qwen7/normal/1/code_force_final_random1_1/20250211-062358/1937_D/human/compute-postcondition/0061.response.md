Output State: **`j` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 4`, `idx_B` is `[i]`**.

Explanation: The code `idx_B.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `idx_B`. Given that `i` is equal to `n - 4`, the list `idx_B` now contains the single element `i`, which is `n - 4`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
