Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is greater than or equal to `r`, `b` is updated to `b + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, `b` is updated to `b + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, `b` is now `A[l - 1]`**

Explanation: The line `b = A[l - 1]` updates the value of `b` to the value of `A[l - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
