Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` must be greater than 0 (though its exact value is not specified).
   - `l` is greater than or equal to `r`.
   - `r` is decreased by 1 (though the exact value of `r` is not specified).

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - `i` is explicitly given as 2.
   - `n` is greater than 0 but its exact value is not specified.
   - `l` is greater than or equal to `r`, and `r` is decreased by 1. Therefore, `l` is at least equal to the new value of `r`.
   - `idx_A` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its value directly. However, since `l` is used in the expression `idx_A[l - 1]`, we need to consider the value of `idx_A[l - 1]`.

Given the lack of explicit values for `n`, `r`, and `idx_A`, we can only express the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **n - 2 + (2 - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2**
