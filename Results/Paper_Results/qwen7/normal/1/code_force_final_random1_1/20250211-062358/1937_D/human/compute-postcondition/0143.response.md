Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, and `r` is either 0 or decreased by 1. `l` is greater than or equal to `r`. Depending on the value of `l`, `b` is either unchanged if `l` is 0, or `b` is set to `b + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`. If `r` is not 0, `a` is the value of `B[r]` and `b` is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`.
