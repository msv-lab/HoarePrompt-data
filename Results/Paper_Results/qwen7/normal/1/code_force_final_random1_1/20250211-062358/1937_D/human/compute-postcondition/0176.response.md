Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is greater than or equal to `r`, `r` is equal to `r - 1`, `a` is equal to `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, `b` is equal to `B[r] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1) - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block, considering the condition `r - l >= 0`. Since there is no else part, the postcondition directly follows from the if part.
