Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is greater than or equal to `r`, `b` is updated to `b - (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r - A[l - r - 1]`, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, `b` is now `A[l - 1]`**.

Explanation: The code subtracts `A[l - r - 1]` from `b`. Given that `b` was previously updated to `b + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, the new value of `b` is `b - (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r - A[l - r - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
