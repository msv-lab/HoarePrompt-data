Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is greater than or equal to `r`, `a` is equal to `B[r]`, `r` is `r - 1`, `b` is `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)` if `l - r - 1 > 0`, or `b + A[l - 1]` if `l - r - 1 <= 0`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b` by adding `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)` to its current value. The value of `i` is 2, so the expression becomes `(2 - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.
