Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables and their current states:**
   - The loop variable is `i`.
   - The loop runs from `0` to `n-1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, the postconditions are:
     - `n` must be greater than 0.
     - The character `s[i]` is equal to '>'.
     - The length of `idx_A` is now 1 more than before.
     - `x` is equal to `A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`.

2. **Determine the new state of `i`:**
   - Since the loop runs from `0` to `n-1`, if the loop has just finished an iteration, `i` would have been incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, if `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, it will be `k+1` at the start of the next iteration.

3. **Determine the new state of `n`:**
   - The value of `n` does not change within the loop itself; it remains the same as it was at the start of the loop.
   - Therefore, `n` still needs to be greater than 0.

4. **Determine the new state of `idx_A`:**
   - The length of `idx_A` is now 1 more than before, meaning that `idx_A` has grown by one element.
   - Therefore, the length of `idx_A` should be `len(idx_A) + 1`.

5. **Determine the new state of `x`:**
   - The formula for `x` is `A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`.
   - At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `k+1` and `idx_A` will have one more element.
   - Therefore, `x` will be updated based on the new values of `i` and `idx_A`.

Given these points, let's formulate the new state:

- `i` will be `k+1` (where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration).
- `n` remains the same and must still be greater than 0.
- The length of `idx_A` will be `len(idx_A) + 1`.
- `x` will be recalculated based on the new values of `i` and `idx_A`.

Since we don't know the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we'll use a general form:

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, the character `s[i]` is equal to '>', the length of `idx_A` is now 2 more than before, and `x` is equal to `A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`**.

However, since the length of `idx_A` increases by 1 each iteration, we can simplify this to:

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, the character `s[i]` is equal to '>', the length of `idx_A` is now 2 more than before, and `x` is updated based on the new values of `i` and `idx_A`**.

To be precise and concise:

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, the character `s[i]` is equal to '>', the length of `idx_A` is now 2 more than before, and `x` is updated based on the new values of `i` and `idx_A`**.

This ensures that all relevant loop variables are correctly adjusted for the next iteration.
