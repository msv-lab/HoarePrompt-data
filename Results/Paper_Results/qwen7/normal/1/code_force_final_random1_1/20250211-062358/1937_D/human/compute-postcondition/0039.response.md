Postcondition: **`B` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `A` is a list containing the sum of distances between '>' characters with appropriate multiplicative factors, `idx_A` is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `idx_B` is a non-empty list, `j` is 0, `i` is `n - 1 - j`, and the current value of `s[i]` is '<'**
