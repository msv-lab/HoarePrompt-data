Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `j` and the constant `n`.
2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `j` is the loop counter, and it starts from 0 (as per the range function).
   - `n` is already given as being greater than 0.

3. **Check if the loop can execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `j` starts at 0 and the loop will continue as long as `j < n`, we need to ensure that `j` is 0 initially and `n` is greater than 0 (which is already given).

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `j` starting at 0 and `n` being greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`B` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `A` is a list containing the sum of distances between '>' characters with appropriate multiplicative factors, `idx_A` is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `idx_B` is an empty list, `j` is 0**
