Postcondition: **`B` is a list where its last element is updated to `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - (n - 2)) * len(idx_B)`, `idx_B` is `[i]`, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `A` is a list containing the sum of distances between '>' characters with appropriate multiplicative factors, `idx_A` is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `j` is 2, `i` is `n - 3`, and the current value of `s[i]` is '<'.**
