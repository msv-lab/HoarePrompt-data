Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `l` is greater than or equal to `r`.
   - `a` is now `A[l]`.
   - `b` is updated to \((idx_B[r - 1] - 2) * (l + 1) - (idx_B[r - 1] - idx_B[r - (l + 2)]) + (2 - idx_A[l - 1]) * r - (idx_B[r - (l + 2)] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (r - (l + 2) + 1)\).
   - `r` is unchanged.
   - `x` is `r - (l + 2)`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The statement to be executed is `print(a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1, end=' ')`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is explicitly given as 2.
- `a` is `A[l]`, but since `A[l]` is not further specified, we'll keep it as `A[l]`.
- `b` is a complex expression involving `idx_B` and `idx_A`, but without specific values for these indices, we cannot simplify it further.
- `r` and `l` are not explicitly given numerical values, but their relationship (`l >= r`) is known.
- `x` is `r - (l + 2)`, which simplifies to `x = r - l - 2`.

Since we need to evaluate `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1`:
- `a * 2` is `2 * A[l]`.
- `b * 2` is `2 * ((idx_B[r - 1] - 2) * (l + 1) - (idx_B[r - 1] - idx_B[r - (l + 2)]) + (2 - idx_A[l - 1]) * r - (idx_B[r - (l + 2)] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (r - (l + 2) + 1))`.
- `i + 1` is `2 + 1 = 3`.

Combining these, the expression becomes:
\[ 2 * A[l] + 2 * ((idx_B[r - 1] - 2) * (l + 1) - (idx_B[r - 1] - idx_B[r - (l + 2)]) + (2 - idx_A[l - 1]) * r - (idx_B[r - (l + 2)] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (r - (l + 2) + 1)) + 3 \]

Since the exact values of `A[l]`, `idx_B`, and `idx_A` are not provided, we can only describe the expression in this form.

Therefore, the output is:
Output: **2 * A[l] + 2 * ((idx_B[r - 1] - 2) * (l + 1) - (idx_B[r - 1] - idx_B[r - (l + 2)]) + (2 - idx_A[l - 1]) * r - (idx_B[r - (l + 2)] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (r - (l + 2) + 1)) + 3**
