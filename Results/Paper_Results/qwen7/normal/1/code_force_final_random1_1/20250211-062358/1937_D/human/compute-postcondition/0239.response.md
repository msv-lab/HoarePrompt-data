Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is greater than or equal to `r`, `a` is equal to `B[r]`, `r` is `r - 1`, and `b` is updated based on whether `l - r - 1` is greater than 0 or not. If `l - r - 1` is greater than 0, then `b` is `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`. Otherwise, `b` is `b + A[l - 1]`.
