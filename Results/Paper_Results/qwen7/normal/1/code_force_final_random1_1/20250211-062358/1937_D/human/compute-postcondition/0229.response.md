Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is greater than or equal to `r`, `r` is decreased by 1, and either `r` is 0 (in which case `a` is the value of `A[l - 1] + (2 - idx_A[l - 1]) * (l - 1)` and `b` is not defined) or `a` is not defined and `b` is the value of `B[r - 1] - B[r - l - 1] - (idx_B[r - l - 1] - 2) * (r - l - 1)`.
