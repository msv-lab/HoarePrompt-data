Output State: **`j` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 4`, `x` is undefined.**

Explanation: The code snippet provided tries to assign a value to `x` using `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`. However, the variables `B`, `idx_B`, `len(B)`, and `len(idx_B)` are not defined in the initial state or within the provided code snippet. Therefore, these variables cannot be evaluated, and `x` remains undefined. The values of `j`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
