Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `x` is `A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`**

Explanation: The code assigns a new value to `x` based on the last element of list `A`, the difference between `i` and the last element of list `idx_A`, and the length of list `idx_A`. Since the initial values of `A` and `idx_A` are not provided, the expression for `x` remains as given. The conditions and values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.
