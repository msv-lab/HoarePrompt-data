Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is greater than or equal to `r`, `r` is decreased by 1, and depending on the value of `r`, `b` is either unchanged if `r` is 0, or `b` is updated to `b + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`. If `r` is not 0, `a` is the value of `B[r]` and `b` is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1).**

Explanation: The code `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `l`, `a`, `b`, `idx_A`, `idx_B`, and `B`) remain unaffected by this operation. The condition that `l` is greater than or equal to `r` still holds true, and the logic for updating `b` based on the value of `r` remains the same.
