Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is greater than or equal to `r`, `a` is now `A[l]`, `b` is unchanged if `r` is 0, otherwise `b` is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`, and `r` is unchanged if `s[i]` is not '>', otherwise `r` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `a = A[l]` simply assigns the value of `A[l]` to `a`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain as described in the initial state. The conditions involving `r` and `l` remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the code snippet provided.
