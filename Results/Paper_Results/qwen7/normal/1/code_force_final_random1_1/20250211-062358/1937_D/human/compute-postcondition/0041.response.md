Output State: **`B` is now `[B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - (n - 1 - j)) * len(idx_B)]`, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `A` is a list containing the sum of distances between '>' characters with appropriate multiplicative factors, `idx_A` is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `idx_B` is a non-empty list, `j` is 0, `i` is `n - 1 - j`, `x` is undefined, the current value of `s[i]` is '<'**.

Explanation: The code appends the value of `x` to the list `B`. Given that `x` is defined as `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)` and `i` is `n - 1 - j`, the new value of `B` is updated accordingly. All other variables remain unchanged.
