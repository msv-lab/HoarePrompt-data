Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, the character at index `i` of string `s` is equal to '>', `l` is greater than `r` by at least 1, `r` is not equal to 0, `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)`, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`.

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block. If the condition `l - r > 0` is true, then `b` is adjusted to `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)`. In all cases, `i`, `n`, the character at index `i` of string `s`, `l`, `r`, `a`, and `b` retain their specified relationships and values as per the given conditions.
