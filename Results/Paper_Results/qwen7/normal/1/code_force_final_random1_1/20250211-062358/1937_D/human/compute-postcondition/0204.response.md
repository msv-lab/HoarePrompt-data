Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `l` is greater than or equal to `r`.
   - Depending on the value of `r`, `b` is updated as follows:
     - If `r` is 0, `b` remains unchanged.
     - If `r` is not 0, `b` is updated to `b + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`.
     - If `r` is not 0 and `a` is updated to `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`.
     - If `r` is not 0 and `l - r - 1 > 0`, `b` is further updated to `b - A[l - r - 2] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)`.
   - If `s[i] == '>'`, `l` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `r` is decreased by 1.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(n - i, end=' ')
   ```

Given the initial state, let's determine the value of `n - i`:

- `i` is explicitly given as 2.
- `n` is greater than 0 but its exact value is not specified. Since `n` must be greater than 0, the smallest possible value for `n` is 1. However, without more specific information about `n`, we cannot determine its exact value, but we know it is greater than 0.

Therefore, the expression `n - i` will be `n - 2`.

Since `n` is greater than 0, the smallest possible value for `n - i` is `1 - 2 = -1`. However, since `n` could be any positive integer greater than 0, the precise value of `n - i` depends on the actual value of `n`.

Thus, the output will be:

Output: **n - 2 (where n is a positive integer greater than 0)**
