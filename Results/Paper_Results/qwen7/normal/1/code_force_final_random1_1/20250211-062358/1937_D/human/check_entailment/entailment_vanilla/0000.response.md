Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the grid `n` and the string `s`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the time taken for a pinball starting at each position to leave the grid.
   - It uses two arrays `A` and `B` to store intermediate results:
     - `A` stores the time taken for a pinball starting from the leftmost position to reach each position.
     - `B` stores the time taken for a pinball starting from the rightmost position to reach each position.

3. **Calculating `A`**:
   - The loop iterates through the string `s` from left to right.
   - When a `>` is encountered, it updates the value in `A` based on the previous value and the distance covered so far.
   - `idx_A` keeps track of the positions where `>` is encountered.

4. **Calculating `B`**:
   - The loop iterates through the string `s` from right to left.
   - When a `<` is encountered, it updates the value in `B` based on the previous value and the distance covered so far.
   - `idx_B` keeps track of the positions where `<` is encountered.

5. **Final Calculation**:
   - The main logic for calculating the time taken for a pinball starting at each position is implemented in the nested loops.
   - The program uses the precomputed values in `A` and `B` to calculate the time taken for each position.
   - It handles different cases based on whether the current character is `>` or `<`, and whether the position is closer to the left or right boundary.

### Detailed Verification

1. **Boundary Conditions**:
   - The program correctly handles the boundary conditions where the pinball starts from the leftmost or rightmost position.

2. **Intermediate Results**:
   - The intermediate results stored in `A` and `B` are correctly updated based on the rules provided.

3. **Final Calculation Logic**:
   - The final calculation logic seems to handle all cases correctly, including the interactions between `A` and `B` values.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program should handle edge cases such as all characters being the same (`<` or `>`), or the grid being very long.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the code, it appears that the program correctly implements the logic to calculate the time taken for a pinball to leave the grid for each starting position. The calculations are performed accurately using the precomputed values in `A` and `B`.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
