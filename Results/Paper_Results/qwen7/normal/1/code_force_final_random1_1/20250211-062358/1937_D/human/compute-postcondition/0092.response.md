Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, the character at index `i` of string `s` is equal to '>', `l` is greater than `r` by at least 1, `r` is not equal to 0, `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1]`, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b` by subtracting `A[l - r - 1]` from `A[l - 1]`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `b` is now updated to `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1]`, while `a` remains as `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`.
