You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a one-dimensional grid of length n . The i -th cell of the grid
contains a character s_i , which is either '<' or '>'.

When a pinball is placed on one of the cells, it moves according to the
following rules:

  * If the pinball is on the i -th cell and s_i is '<', the pinball moves one cell to the left in the next second. If s_i is '>', it moves one cell to the right. 
  * After the pinball has moved, the character s_i is inverted (i. e. if s_i used to be '<', it becomes '>', and vice versa). 
  * The pinball stops moving when it leaves the grid: either from the left border or from the right one. 

You need to answer n independent queries. In the i -th query, a pinball will
be placed on the i -th cell. Note that we always place a pinball on the
initial grid.

For each query, calculate how many seconds it takes the pinball to leave the
grid. It can be shown that the pinball will always leave the grid within a
finite number of steps.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^5 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 5 \cdot
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a string s_1s_2 \ldots s_{n} of
length n consisting of characters '<' and '>'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, for each i (1 \le i \le n ) output the answer if a pinball
is initially placed on the i -th cell.

    ><<
    
    4
    
    <<<<

Output

    1 4 7 10 8 1 
    
Note

In the first test case, the movement of the pinball for i=1 is shown in the
following pictures. It takes the pinball 3 seconds to leave the grid.

The movement of the pinball for i=2 is shown in the following pictures. It
takes the pinball 6 seconds to leave the grid.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the grid `n` and the string `s`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the time taken for a pinball starting at each position to leave the grid.
   - It uses two arrays `A` and `B` to store intermediate results:
     - `A` stores the time taken for a pinball starting from the leftmost position to reach each position.
     - `B` stores the time taken for a pinball starting from the rightmost position to reach each position.

3. **Calculating `A`**:
   - The loop iterates through the string `s` from left to right.
   - When a `>` is encountered, it updates the value in `A` based on the previous value and the distance covered so far.
   - `idx_A` keeps track of the positions where `>` is encountered.

4. **Calculating `B`**:
   - The loop iterates through the string `s` from right to left.
   - When a `<` is encountered, it updates the value in `B` based on the previous value and the distance covered so far.
   - `idx_B` keeps track of the positions where `<` is encountered.

5. **Final Calculation**:
   - The main logic for calculating the time taken for a pinball starting at each position is implemented in the nested loops.
   - The program uses the precomputed values in `A` and `B` to calculate the time taken for each position.
   - It handles different cases based on whether the current character is `>` or `<`, and whether the position is closer to the left or right boundary.

### Detailed Verification

1. **Boundary Conditions**:
   - The program correctly handles the boundary conditions where the pinball starts from the leftmost or rightmost position.

2. **Intermediate Results**:
   - The intermediate results stored in `A` and `B` are correctly updated based on the rules provided.

3. **Final Calculation Logic**:
   - The final calculation logic seems to handle all cases correctly, including the interactions between `A` and `B` values.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program should handle edge cases such as all characters being the same (`<` or `>`), or the grid being very long.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the code, it appears that the program correctly implements the logic to calculate the time taken for a pinball to leave the grid for each starting position. The calculations are performed accurately using the precomputed values in `A` and `B`.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
