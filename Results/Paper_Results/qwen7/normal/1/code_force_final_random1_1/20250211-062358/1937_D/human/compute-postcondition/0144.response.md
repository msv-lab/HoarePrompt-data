Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is greater than or equal to `r`, and depending on the value of `r`, `b` is either unchanged if `r` is 0, or `b` is updated to `b + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`. If `r` is not 0, `a` is the value of `B[r]` and `b` is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`.**

This postcondition summarizes all possible outcomes after the execution of the if-else block, considering both the if and else parts. It ensures that the initial conditions (`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0) are maintained and describes the final state of the variables `l`, `r`, `b`, `a`, and `idx_A`, `idx_B`.
