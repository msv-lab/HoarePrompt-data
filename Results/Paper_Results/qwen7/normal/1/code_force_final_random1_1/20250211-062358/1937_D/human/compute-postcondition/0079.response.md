Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, the character at index `i` of string `s` is equal to '>', and `l` is less than `r`; `b` is `(idx_B[r - 1] - 0) * (l + 1)`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b` to `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`. Given that `i` is 0, the expression simplifies to `(idx_B[r - 1] - 0) * (l + 1)`, which is `(idx_B[r - 1]) * (l + 1)`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged from the initial state.
