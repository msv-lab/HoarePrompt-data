Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, the difference between `arr[2]` and `arr[1]` is less than `b / a`, and `array2` contains one element which is `(arr[1] - arr[0]) * a`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` to `array2`. Given that initially `i` is 1, after executing the code `i` becomes 2. The condition `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` is calculated using the values of `arr[1]` and `arr[0]`, and this value is appended to `array2`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
