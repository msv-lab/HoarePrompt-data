Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state**: 
   - `i` is currently 4.
   - `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 3.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 4, for the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 5.
   - `n` remains unchanged because it is determined by `feat[0]` and must still be greater than 3.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 5, `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 3**
