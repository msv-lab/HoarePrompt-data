Output State: **`feat` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is the first element of `feat`, `test_cases` must be greater than `n + 1`**.

Explanation: The code `n = feat[0]` assigns the first element of the list `feat` to the variable `n`. The other variables (`feat`, `i`, and `test_cases`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
