Output State: **`i` is 2, `array2` contains an element equal to `arr[0] * a`**

Explanation: The code `array2.append(arr[0] * a)` appends the value of `arr[0] * a` to `array2`. Since the initial state does not specify the exact values of `arr[0]` and `a`, the new element in `array2` is expressed as `arr[0] * a`. The values of `i` remain unchanged, and the conditions for `array2` remain valid but are not directly affected by this line of code.
