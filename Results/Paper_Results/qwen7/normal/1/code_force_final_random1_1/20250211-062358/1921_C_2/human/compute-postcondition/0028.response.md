Postcondition: `i` is equal to `n`, and `array2` contains all elements added during each iteration. If the sum of elements in `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is less than `f`, then `array2` includes elements where `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a` was satisfied. Otherwise, `array2` includes elements where `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] >= b / a` was satisfied.
