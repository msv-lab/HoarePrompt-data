Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads integers `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`, followed by a list of `n` integers `arr`. It then constructs a new list `array2` based on specific conditions: if the difference between consecutive elements in `arr` is less than `b/a`, the difference multiplied by `a` is added to `array2`. After processing all elements, it calculates the sum of `array2` and compares it with `(n - length of array2) * b`. If the sum is less than `f`, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'.**
