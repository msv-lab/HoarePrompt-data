Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 2.
- `n` is an integer such that `i` (which is `n + 1`) is within the range `1` to `n-1`. Since `i` is 2, this means `n` must be 3 (because `2 = n + 1` implies `n = 1`, but `n` must also be greater than 2 to satisfy the range condition).
- `array2` contains elements that satisfy the condition `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` for each `i` from 1 to `n-1` where `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`.

However, the specific values of `a`, `b`, and `f`, as well as the contents of `arr`, are not provided. Despite this, the print statement is simply:

```
print('No')
```

This statement will print the string "No" regardless of the values of other variables or objects.

Output: **No**
