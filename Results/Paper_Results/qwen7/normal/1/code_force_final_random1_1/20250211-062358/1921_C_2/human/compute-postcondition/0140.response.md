Output State: The final state of `array2` will contain elements based on the conditions specified within the loop for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`. Specifically, if `arr[0] < b / a`, then `arr[0] * a` will be in `array2`. For each subsequent index `i` from 1 to `n-1`, if `arr[i] - arr[i-1] < b / a`, then `(arr[i] - arr[i-1]) * a` will be appended to `array2`. If neither condition is met for any index, the corresponding value will not be added to `array2`. After all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n-1`. Depending on the result of the final if condition, either the sum of `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is less than `f` or greater than or equal to `f`. If the sum is less than `f`, the output will be `'Yes'`; otherwise, it will be `'No'`.
