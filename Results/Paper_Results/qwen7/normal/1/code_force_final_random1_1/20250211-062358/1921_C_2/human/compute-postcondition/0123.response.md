Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in this case is `i`.
2. **Determine the range of the loop**: The loop runs from `0` to `n-1`, so `i` will increment from `0` to `n-1`.
3. **Understand the postcondition at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is currently `1`.
   - `array2` contains either `arr[0] * a` if `arr[0] < b / a`, or it remains unchanged.
   - If `arr[1] - arr[0] < b / a`, then `array2` contains an element equal to `(arr[1] - arr[0]) * a`. Otherwise, `array2` remains unchanged.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by `1` at each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `2`.
   - We need to check the condition `arr[2] - arr[1] < b / a` to determine what `array2` should contain.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration (when `i` is `2`) will be:

- `i` is `2`.
- `array2` will contain either `arr[0] * a` if `arr[0] < b / a`, or it remains unchanged.
- If `arr[2] - arr[1] < b / a`, then `array2` contains an element equal to `(arr[2] - arr[1]) * a`. Otherwise, `array2` remains unchanged.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is 2, `array2` contains either `arr[0] * a` if `arr[0] < b / a`, or it remains unchanged. If `arr[2] - arr[1] < b / a`, then `array2` contains an element equal to `(arr[2] - arr[1]) * a`. Otherwise, `array2` remains unchanged.**
