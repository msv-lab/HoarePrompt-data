Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the initial state of `i` and `n`**: From the given information, `i` is `n + 1`.
3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range `1` to `n` (exclusive), meaning `i` will take values from `1` to `n-1`.
4. **Check if the loop can execute**: For the loop to execute, `i` must be within the range `1` to `n-1`. Given that `i` is initially `n + 1`, the loop cannot execute because `i` is not within the specified range.

To make the loop execute, we need to adjust the value of `i` to be within the range `1` to `n-1`. Additionally, since `i` is defined in terms of `n`, `n` must be a valid integer such that `i` falls within the required range.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

### Adjusted States:
- `i` should be within the range `1` to `n-1`.
- `n` must be an integer such that `i` (which is `n + 1`) falls within the range `1` to `n-1`.

Given the initial conditions:
- `i` is `n + 1`.
- `n` must be an integer such that `i` (which is `n + 1`) is within the range `1` to `n-1`.

This is not possible as `i = n + 1` cannot be within the range `1` to `n-1`.

### Conclusion:
Since the initial state of `i` (`n + 1`) does not allow the loop to execute, we need to adjust `n` such that `i` falls within the required range. However, without a specific value for `n`, we can only express the requirement in terms of `n`.

### Final State:
State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be an integer such that `i` (which is `n + 1`) is within the range `1` to `n-1`**

This means `n` must be less than 1, which is not possible for a non-negative integer. Therefore, the loop cannot execute with the given initial state.
