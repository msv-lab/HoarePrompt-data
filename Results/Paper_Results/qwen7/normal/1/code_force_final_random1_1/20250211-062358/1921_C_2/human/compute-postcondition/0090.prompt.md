Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(test_cases):
    feat = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
    n = feat[0]
    f = feat[1]
    a = feat[2]
    b = feat[-1]
    arr = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
    array2 = []
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a:
            array2.append((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a)
    if sum(array2) + (n - len(array2)) * b < f:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` will be equal to `n`, and `array2` will contain all elements added during each iteration. If the sum of elements in `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is less than `f`, then `array2` contains elements where `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a` was satisfied. Otherwise, `array2` contains elements where `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] >= b / a` was satisfied.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that `i` (which is `n + 1`) is within the range `1` to `n-1`, and `array2` contains elements that satisfy the condition `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` for each `i` from 1 to `n-1` where `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`. Additionally, the sum of `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is either less than `f` or greater than or equal to `f`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is equal to `n`, `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than or equal to the maximum index present in `arr` (which is `len(arr) - 1`), `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer, `array2` is a list containing elements where each element is `(arr[j] - arr[j - 1]) * a` for every `j` in the range from `3` to `n-1` inclusive, provided that `arr[j] - arr[j - 1] < b / a`. If the sum of `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is less than `f`, then the condition is met. Otherwise, the condition is not met.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
