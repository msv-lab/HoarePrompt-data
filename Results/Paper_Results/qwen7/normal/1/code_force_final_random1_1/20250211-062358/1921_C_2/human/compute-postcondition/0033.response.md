Output State: **`feat` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is the first element of `feat`, `test_cases` must be greater than `n + 1`, `f` is the second element of `feat`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the second element of the list `feat` to the variable `f`. Since `feat` is a list of integers obtained from input, and `n` is the first element of `feat`, the value of `f` is now the second element of `feat`. The other variables remain unchanged according to their initial state.
