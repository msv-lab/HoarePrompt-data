Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 2.
- `n` is an integer such that `i` (which is `n + 1`) is within the range `1` to `n-1`. Given `i = 2`, it means `n` must be 3 because `i = n + 1` implies `2 = n + 1` and thus `n = 1`, but this contradicts the range condition `1` to `n-1`. Therefore, `n` must be 3.
- `array2` contains elements that satisfy the condition `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` for each `i` from 1 to `n-1` where `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`.

Given these conditions, the print statement is simply:

```
print('Yes')
```

This statement does not depend on the values of `i`, `n`, `array2`, or any other variables; it directly prints the string `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
