Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and the condition `range(0, n)`. This means `i` starts from 0 and goes up to `n-1`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, the postcondition specifies that `i` is an integer. If `i` is 0, there are specific conditions about `arr[0]`, `b`, `a`, and `array2`. If `i` is not 0, there are different conditions involving `arr[i]`, `arr[i-1]`, `b`, `a`, and `array2`.

3. **Determine the next value of `i`**: Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, if `i` was 0 before the loop, it will be 1 after the first iteration.

4. **Adjust the state based on the new value of `i`**:
   - If `i` was 0, after the first iteration, `i` becomes 1.
   - We need to check if `i` (now 1) meets the condition for the loop to continue. Specifically, we need to ensure that `i` is still within the range `[0, n)`.

5. **Update the necessary conditions**:
   - If `i` was 0, the conditions for `i` being 0 no longer apply. Now, we need to check if `i` (which is now 1) should trigger the conditions for `i` not being 0.
   - For `i` to be 1, `i` must be less than `n`.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect `i` as 1 and the condition that `i` must be less than `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1, `i` must be less than `n`**
