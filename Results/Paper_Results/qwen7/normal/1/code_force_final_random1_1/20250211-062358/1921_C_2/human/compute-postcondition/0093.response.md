Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of integers \( n \), \( f \), \( a \), and \( b \), along with a list of \( n \) integers. For each test case, it calculates whether the sum of certain adjusted differences between consecutive elements in the list, plus a linear term, is less than \( f \). If true for the last test case, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'.**
