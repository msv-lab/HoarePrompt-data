Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is `feat[0]` must be greater than 3, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer, `array2` is a list containing one element which is `(arr[3] - arr[2]) * a`, and the current value of `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]` is less than `b / a`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` to `array2`. Given that `i` is 3, `arr[i]` is `arr[3]` and `arr[i - 1]` is `arr[2]`. Therefore, the expression evaluates to `(arr[3] - arr[2]) * a` and this value is appended to `array2`. The other variables remain unchanged.
