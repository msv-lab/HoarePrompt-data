Output State: **`A` is False; the first element of `arr` is 1; `set_` is a list containing the unique elements of `arr` starting from the first element which is 1.**

Explanation: The code `set_ = list(set(arr))` converts the list `arr` into a set to remove any duplicate elements and then converts it back into a list. Since the first element of `arr` is 1, and assuming there are no duplicates (or only one instance of 1), `set_` will contain the unique elements of `arr`, starting with 1. The variable `A` remains unchanged as it was initially set to `False`.
