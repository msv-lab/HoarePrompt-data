Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and the range is defined as `range(1, len(set_))`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `not_c` is False
   - `A` is False
   - `i` is 2

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(set_)`.

4. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 (since it starts from 1) and should still be less than `len(set_)`.
   - Given `i` is currently 2, the next value of `i` would be 3.

5. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will execute if `i < len(set_)`.
   - Since `i` is now 3, the condition will depend on the value of `len(set_)`.
   - For the loop to execute, `len(set_)` must be greater than 3.

6. **Adjust the states**:
   - `not_c` and `A` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.
   - `i` is updated to 3.
   - `len(set_)` must be greater than 3 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`not_c` is False, `A` is False, `i` is 3, `len(set_)` must be greater than 3**
