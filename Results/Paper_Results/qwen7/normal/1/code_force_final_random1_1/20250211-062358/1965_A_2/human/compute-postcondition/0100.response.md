Output State: **`i` is 2, `t` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object created from integers split from the new input string, `lis` is a sorted list of unique elements from `l`, `test` is True, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The line `test = True` sets the variable `test` to the boolean value `True`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `i`, `t`, `n`, `l`, `lis`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
