Output State: **`A` is False; the first element of `arr` is 1; `set_` is a sorted list containing the unique elements of `arr` starting from the first element which is 1.**

Explanation: The code `set_.sort()` sorts the `set_` in ascending order. Since `set_` initially contains the unique elements of `arr` starting from the first element which is 1, after sorting, `set_` will be a sorted list of these unique elements. The values of `A` and the first element of `arr` remain unchanged.
