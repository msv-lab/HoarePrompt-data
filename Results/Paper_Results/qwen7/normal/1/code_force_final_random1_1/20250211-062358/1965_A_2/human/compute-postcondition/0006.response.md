Output State: **`not_c` is True; `A` is False; the first element of `arr` is 1; `set_` is a sorted list containing the unique elements of `arr` starting from the first element which is 1.**

The code `not_c = True` simply assigns the boolean value `True` to the variable `not_c`. This does not affect the values of `A`, `arr`, or `set_`. Therefore, their previous states remain unchanged.
