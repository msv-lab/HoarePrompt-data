Postcondition: **After executing the if-else block, `j` is equal to the length of `lis` minus 1, `lis` remains a sorted list of unique elements from `l` with a length greater than 1, and `test` is `True` since no pair of consecutive elements in `lis` has a difference greater than 1. The length of `lis` can be either odd or even.**
