Output State: **`not_c` is False, `A` is False, `i` is 1, `set_` is a sorted list containing the unique elements of `arr` starting from the first element which is 1, and `set_` must contain at least 2 elements. The difference between the current element and the previous element in `set_` is greater than 1.**

Explanation: The variable `not_c` is explicitly set to `False`. The values of `A`, `i`, and `set_` remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition about the difference between the current element and the previous element in `set_` also remains valid.
