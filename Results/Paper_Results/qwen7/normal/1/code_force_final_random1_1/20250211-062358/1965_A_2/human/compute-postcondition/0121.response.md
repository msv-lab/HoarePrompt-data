Output State: **`j` is 2, `lis` is a sorted list of unique elements from `l` that must have more than one element, `test` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. In this case, it exits the loop or if statement where the condition checks if the difference between `lis[j]` and `lis[j - 1]` is greater than or equal to 1. The values of `j`, `lis`, and `test` remain unchanged after executing the `break` statement.
