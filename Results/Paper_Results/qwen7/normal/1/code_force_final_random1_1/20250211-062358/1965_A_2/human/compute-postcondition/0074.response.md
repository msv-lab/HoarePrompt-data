Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `len(lis)`.
2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop continues as long as `j` is less than `len(lis)`.
3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `t` is an input integer
   - `n` is an input integer
   - `l` is a map object created from the integers split from the new input string
   - `lis` is a sorted list of unique elements from `l` that must have at least 2 elements
   - `j` is 2
   - `test` remains False if `lis[2] - lis[1] > 1`, otherwise `test` remains True

4. **Check the Loop Condition**: For the loop to continue, `j` must be less than `len(lis)`.
5. **Update the State**:
   - `j` is currently 2.
   - To continue the loop, `j` must be incremented to 3 (since it starts from 1 and increments by 1 each time).
   - `len(lis)` remains unchanged.

6. **Adjust the State**:
   - `i` remains 1.
   - `t` remains an input integer.
   - `n` remains an input integer.
   - `l` remains a map object created from the integers split from the new input string.
   - `lis` remains a sorted list of unique elements from `l` that must have at least 2 elements.
   - `j` changes to 3.
   - `test` remains False if `lis[3] - lis[2] > 1`, otherwise `test` remains True.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `i` is 1, `t` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object created from the integers split from the new input string, `lis` is a sorted list of unique elements from `l` that must have at least 2 elements, `j` is 3, and `test` remains False if `lis[3] - lis[2] > 1`, otherwise `test` remains True.**
