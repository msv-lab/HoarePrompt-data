Output State: **`i` is 1, `t` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object created from the integers split from the input string, `lis` is a sorted list of unique elements from `l`, `j` is set based on the conditions involving `lis`, and `test` is True since no pair of consecutive elements in `lis` has a difference greater than 1.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input integer to the variable `n`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the updated state includes `n` being the new input integer, while `i`, `t`, `l`, `lis`, `j`, and `test` retain their original values.
