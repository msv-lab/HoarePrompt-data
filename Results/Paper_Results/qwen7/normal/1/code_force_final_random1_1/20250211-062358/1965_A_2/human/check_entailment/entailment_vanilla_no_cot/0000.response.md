Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues:

1. **Incorrect Input Handling**: The program reads the number of piles `n` as part of the array `arr`, which is incorrect. `n` should be read separately.
2. **Incorrect Logic in `func_1`**: The logic in `func_1` does not correctly implement the game rules. Specifically, it incorrectly assumes that the game state can be simplified to a single boolean value `A`. This approach does not accurately reflect the game's strategy.
3. **Heap Usage**: The problem description suggests using a heap to efficiently manage the smallest non-empty pile, but this is not utilized in the provided code.

To solve this problem correctly, you need to use the concept of Nim-sum (XOR of all pile sizes). Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.readline

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input().strip())
    arr = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    
    # Calculate Nim-sum
    nim_sum = 0
    for pile in arr:
        nim_sum ^= pile
    
    if nim_sum == 0:
        print("Bob")
    else:
        print("Alice")
```

This solution works as follows:
- It reads the number of test cases and processes each one.
- For each test case, it reads the number of piles and the sizes of the piles.
- It calculates the Nim-sum of the pile sizes.
- If the Nim-sum is zero, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins.
