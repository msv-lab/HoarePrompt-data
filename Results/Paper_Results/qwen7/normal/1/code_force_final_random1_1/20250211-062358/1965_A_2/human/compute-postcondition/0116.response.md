Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable `j` is being incremented in the range from 1 to `len(lis)`.
   - The initial value of `j` at the start of the loop is 1.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `len(lis)`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `j` is 1.
   - `lis` is a sorted list of unique elements from `l` that must have more than one element.
   - The postcondition mentions that if the difference between the current element `lis[j]` and the previous element `lis[j - 1]` is greater than or equal to 1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `j` starts at 1, the next value of `j` would be 2 (assuming the loop continues).
   - The condition for the next iteration is `j < len(lis)`. Therefore, `j` should be 2 for the loop to continue.

5. **Maintain the Postcondition:**
   - The postcondition checks the difference between `lis[j]` and `lis[j - 1]`. For `j = 2`, this becomes the difference between `lis[2]` and `lis[1]`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `j` is 2.
- `lis` remains a sorted list of unique elements from `l` that must have more than one element.
- The postcondition still holds for `j = 2`.

Therefore, the updated state is:

**State: **`j` is 2, `lis` is a sorted list of unique elements from `l` that must have more than one element, and if the difference between the current element `lis[j]` and the previous element `lis[j - 1]` is greater than or equal to 1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
