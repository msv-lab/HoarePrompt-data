Output State: **`ss` is the first character of `s`, `s` is the input string, `cur_ss` is the difference between the ASCII value of `ss` and the ASCII value of 'a', `cur` is `cur | (1 << cur_ss)` and the current value of `cur & 1 << cur_ss` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `cur += 1 << cur_ss` updates the value of `cur` by setting the bit corresponding to `cur_ss` to 1. Since `cur & 1 << cur_ss` was initially 0, it means that the bit at position `cur_ss` was not set before. After executing the code, the bit at position `cur_ss` is now set to 1, making `cur & 1 << cur_ss` equal to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
