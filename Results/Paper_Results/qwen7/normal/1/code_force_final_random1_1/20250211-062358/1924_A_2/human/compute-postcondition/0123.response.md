Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` must be greater than 0, `cur` is such that `(cur & 1 << 0)` evaluates to 0, and `tmp` is 'd'.**

Explanation: The variable `tmp` is assigned the character value corresponding to the ASCII value of 'a' plus the value of `i`. Since `i` is 2, `ord('a') + i` equals `97 + 2`, which is 99. The character with ASCII value 99 is 'd'. Therefore, `tmp` is set to 'd'. The values of `i`, `k`, and `cur` remain unchanged according to the initial state.
