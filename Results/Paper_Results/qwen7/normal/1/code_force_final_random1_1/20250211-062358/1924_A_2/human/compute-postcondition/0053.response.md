Output State: **`tmp` is 'b', `i` is an integer that was used in the calculation.**

Explanation: The code `tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)` calculates the character that is `i` positions after 'a' in the alphabet. Since 'a' has an ASCII value of 97, adding `i` to it will give the ASCII value of the character `tmp`. If `i` is 1, then `tmp` will be 'b' (ASCII 98). The value of `i` itself is not changed by this operation, so it remains as an integer that was used in the calculation.
