Postcondition: `i` is 0, `k` must be greater than 0, and the current value of `cur` is such that `(cur & 1 << i)` evaluates to 0; in this case, `tmp` is set to 'a' and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If `(cur & 1 << i)` does not evaluate to 0, no changes are made to `tmp` and `cur`.
