Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tmp` is an empty string, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `i` is the total length of the string `s`, `cnt` is less than `n`, `cur` is 0, and `ans` is a string containing every character from `s` that caused `cur` to reach \(2^k - 1\) during the loop's execution.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    if cur & 1 << i == 0:
        tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 0 and `cur` is an integer where the bit at position `i` is not set, and `tmp` is 'a'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `cur` is an integer, `tmp` is 'b', and `i` is an integer that was used in the calculation. If `cur & 1 << i` equals 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains unchanged from the if part.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `cur` is an integer, `tmp` is either 'a' + i or 'b', and `i` is an integer that is `i + 1` from its previous value. If `cur & 1 << i == 0`, then `tmp` is set to 'a' + i, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `tmp` remains 'b'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
