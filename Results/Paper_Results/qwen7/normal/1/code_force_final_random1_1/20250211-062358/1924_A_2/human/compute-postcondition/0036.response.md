Postcondition: `cur` is 1 shifted left by `cur_ss` + 1, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^5\), `i` is 2, `s` is the string input by the user, `cnt` is 2, `cur_ss` is the difference between the ASCII value of the next character in `s` and the ASCII value of 'a', `ans` is the first character of the string `s` plus the next character in `s` plus the value of `ss`. If `cur` equals \(1\) shifted left by `k` minus \(1\), then `cur` becomes \(0\); otherwise, `cur` remains as 1 shifted left by `cur_ss` + 1.
