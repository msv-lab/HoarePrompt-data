Output State: **`cur` is an integer, `tmp` is 'a' + i, and `i` is an integer that is `i + 1` from its previous value.**

Explanation: The code `tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)` assigns to `tmp` the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `'a'` plus the value of `i`. Since `'a'` has an ASCII value of 97, `tmp` becomes the character at ASCII value 97 + i, which is `'a' + i`. The value of `cur` and the increment of `i` are not affected by this line of code.
