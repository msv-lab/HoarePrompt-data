Output State: **`ss` is the first character of the string `s`, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `i` is 2, `s` is the string input by the user, `cnt` is 1, `cur` is 0, `ans` is the first character of the string `s`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += ss` appends the value of `ss` (which is the first character of the string `s`) to the string `ans`. Since `ss` is the first character of `s`, `ans` now contains this character. All other variables remain unchanged.
