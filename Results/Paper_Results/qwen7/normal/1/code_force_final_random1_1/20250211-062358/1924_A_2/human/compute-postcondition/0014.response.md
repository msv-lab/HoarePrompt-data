Output State: **`ss` is the first character of the string `s`, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `i` is 2, `s` is the string input by the user, `cnt` is 1, `cur` is equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, `ans` is an empty string.**

Explanation: The code `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. Initially, `cnt` was 0, so after executing this line, `cnt` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
