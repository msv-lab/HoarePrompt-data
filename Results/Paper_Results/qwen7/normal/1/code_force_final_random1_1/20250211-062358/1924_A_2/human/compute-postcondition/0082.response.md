Output State: **`ss` is the first character of `s`, `s` is the updated string input by the user, `cur_ss` is the numerical value of the ASCII of `ss` minus the ASCII of 'a', the current value of `cur` is 0, the current value of `cnt` is increased by 1, `ans` is now equal to the first character of `s`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans += ss` appends the first character of the string `s` to the variable `ans`. Since `ss` is the first character of `s`, `ans` is updated to include this character. The other variables (`cur_ss`, `cur`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
