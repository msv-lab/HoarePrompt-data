Output State: **`ss` is the third character of `s`, `s` is the input string, `cur_ss` is the value of `ord(ss) - ord('a')`, `ans` is the third character of `s` concatenated with the previous value of `ans`, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is incremented by 1 (new value is `cnt + 1`).**

Explanation: The line `cur = 0` sets the variable `cur` to 0. All other variables (`ss`, `s`, `cur_ss`, `ans`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
