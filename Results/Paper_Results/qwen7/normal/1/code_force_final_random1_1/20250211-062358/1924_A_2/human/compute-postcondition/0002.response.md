Output State: **`t` must be a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^5, `i` is 0, `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `n, k, m = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input, splits them by spaces, and assigns them to `n`, `k`, and `m`. The initial state of `t` and `i` remains unchanged. Therefore, `t` is still a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, and `i` is still 0. The values of `n`, `k`, and `m` are the integers entered by the user.
