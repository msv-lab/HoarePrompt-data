Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The final value of `ans` is the concatenation of all characters in the string `s`, `cnt` is the total number of times the inner condition `cur == (1 << k) - 1` was met, `cnt` is less than `n`, `tmp` is an empty string, and all other variables (`cur`, `cur_ss`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `t`) remain as they were in the initial state.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    if cur & 1 << i == 0:
        tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 0, `k` must be greater than 0, and the current value of `cur` is such that `(cur & 1 << i)` evaluates to 0; in this case, `tmp` is set to 'a' and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If `(cur & 1 << i)` does not evaluate to 0, no changes are made to `tmp` and `cur`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `cur` is such that `(cur & 1 << 0)` evaluates to 0, and `tmp` is either 'a' or 'b', depending on whether the if condition `cur & 1 << i == 0` is met or not. If the condition is true, `tmp` becomes 'b', and if the condition is false, `tmp` remains 'a'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `k` must be greater than 0, `cur` is such that `(cur & 1 << 0)` evaluates to 0, and `tmp` is 'd', as the if condition `cur & 1 << 2 == 0` is not met, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
