Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `i` is the total length of the string `s`, `s` is the string input by the user, `cnt` is the number of times `cur` equals \(2^k - 1\) during the loop's execution, `cur` is 0, and `ans` is a string containing every character from `s` that caused `cur` to reach \(2^k - 1\). If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, the function does not change these variables. Otherwise, `i` is equal to `k-1`, `cur` is 0, `tmp` is determined based on the unset bit in `cur` (if any), and `ans` is a string containing characters from `s` that caused `cur` to reach \(2^k - 1\) during the loop's execution, followed by 'a' repeated `(n - cnt - 1)` times.**
