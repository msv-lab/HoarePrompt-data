Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^5\), `i` is the total length of the string `s` plus 1, `s` is the updated string input by the user, `cnt` is 0, `cur` is 0, `ans` is an empty string, `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers obtained from the input split, and `cur` is 0.**

The code `ans = ''` initializes the variable `ans` to an empty string. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
