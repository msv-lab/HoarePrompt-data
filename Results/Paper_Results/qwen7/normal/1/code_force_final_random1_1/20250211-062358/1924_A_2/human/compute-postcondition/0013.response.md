Postcondition: **`ss` is the first character of the string `s`, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `i` is 1, `s` is the string input by the user, `cnt` is 0, `cur` is equal to `(1 << k) - 1`, `ans` is an empty string, and if the current value of `cur & 1 << cur_ss` is 0, then no change occurs in the variables. If the current value of `cur & 1 << cur_ss` is 1, then `cur` is updated to `cur_ss` + 1.**
