Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^5\).
- `i` is the total length of the string `s`.
- `s` is a string input by the user.
- `cnt` is less than `n`.
- `cur` is 0.
- `ans` is a string containing every character from `s` that caused `cur` to reach \(2^k - 1\) during the loop's execution.

The print statement is simply `print('NO')`.

Given this information, the output of the print statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of any other variables or objects.

Output: **NO**
