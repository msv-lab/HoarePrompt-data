Postcondition: `ss` is the third character of `s`, `s` remains the same, `cur_ss` is the numerical value of the ASCII of the third character of `s` minus the ASCII of 'a', `cur` is 2 raised to the power of `cur_ss`, `cnt` is 3, `ans` is the first character of `s` concatenated with the second character of `s`, `cur_ss` is the numerical value of the ASCII of `ss` minus the ASCII of 'a'. If the bit corresponding to `cur_ss` in `cur` is not set (i.e., `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0`), then the bit is set.
