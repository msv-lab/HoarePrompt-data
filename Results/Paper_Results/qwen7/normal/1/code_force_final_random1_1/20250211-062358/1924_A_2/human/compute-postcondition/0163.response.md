Output State: **`ss` is the third character of `s`, `s` is the input string, `cur_ss` is the value of `ord(ss) - ord('a')`, `ans` is the third character of `s` concatenated with the previous value of `ans`, `cur` is 1 << `cur_ss`, `cnt` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `cur += 1 << cur_ss` updates the value of `cur` by shifting 1 to the left by `cur_ss` positions and adding it to the current value of `cur`. Given that `cur` was initially 0, the new value of `cur` is `1 << cur_ss`. The other variables remain unchanged.
