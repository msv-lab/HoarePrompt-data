Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` must be greater than 0, `cur` is such that `(cur & 1 << 0)` evaluates to 0, and `tmp` is 'd', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but indicates that the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was inside. All the initial conditions remain unchanged.
