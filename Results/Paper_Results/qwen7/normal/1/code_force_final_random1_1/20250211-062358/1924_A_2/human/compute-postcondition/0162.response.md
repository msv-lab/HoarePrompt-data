Output State: **`ss` is the third character of `s`, `s` is the input string, `cur_ss` is the value of `ord(ss) - ord('a')`, `ans` is the third character of `s` concatenated with the previous value of `ans`, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is incremented by 1**

The code `cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')` calculates the position of the character `ss` in the alphabet (where 'a' is 0, 'b' is 1, etc.) and assigns this value to `cur_ss`. The other variables (`ss`, `s`, `ans`, `cur`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
