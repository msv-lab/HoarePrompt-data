Output State: **`ss` is the second character of `s`; `s` remains the same; `cur_ss` is the numerical value of the ASCII of the second character of `s` minus the ASCII of 'a'; `cur` is 0; `cnt` is 3; `ans` is the first character of `s` concatenated with `ss`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += ss` concatenates the value of `ss` (which is the second character of `s`) to the existing value of `ans`. Since `ans` initially holds the first character of `s`, after executing the code, `ans` will be the first character of `s` followed by the second character of `s`. All other variables remain unchanged.
