Output State: **`ss` is the second character of `s`, `s` is the input string, `cur_ss` is the value of `ord(ss) - ord('a')`, `ans` is the concatenation of the second character of `s` with the previous value of `ans`, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The line `cur = 0` sets the variable `cur` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
