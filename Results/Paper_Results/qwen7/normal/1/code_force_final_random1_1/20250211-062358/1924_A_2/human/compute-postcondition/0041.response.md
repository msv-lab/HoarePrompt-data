Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^5\).
- `i` is the total length of the string `s`.
- `s` is a string input by the user.
- `cnt` is the number of times `cur` equals \(2^k - 1\) during the loop's execution.
- `cur` is initially set to 0.
- `ans` is a string containing every character from `s` that caused `cur` to reach \(2^k - 1\).
- The condition `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n` holds true.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print('YES')
```

This print statement directly outputs the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
