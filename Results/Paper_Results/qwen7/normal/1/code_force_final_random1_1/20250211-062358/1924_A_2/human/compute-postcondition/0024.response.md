Output State: **`cur` is 1 shifted left by `cur_ss`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^5\), `i` is 2, `s` is the string input by the user, `cnt` is 2, `cur_ss` is the difference between the ASCII value of `ss` and the ASCII value of 'a', `ans` is the first character of the string `s`, and the condition `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0` holds true.**

Explanation: The code `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. Initially, `cnt` was 1, so after executing this line, `cnt` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
