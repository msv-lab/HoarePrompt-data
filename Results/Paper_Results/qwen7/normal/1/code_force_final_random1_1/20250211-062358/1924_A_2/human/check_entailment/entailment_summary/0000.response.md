Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, and `m`, and the string `s`.
3. It uses a bitmask (`cur`) to track the presence of each of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets in the current substring of `s`.
4. As it iterates through `s`, it updates the bitmask and counts how many unique substrings of length `k` it encounters.
5. If the count of unique substrings is at least `n`, it prints 'YES'.
6. If not, it identifies the missing character by checking the bitmask and constructs a string `ans` that includes this missing character and enough 'a's to make the total length `n`.
7. The program then prints 'NO' followed by the constructed string `ans`.

Given the logic and the steps involved, the program appears to follow the problem description accurately. However, there is one potential issue to consider:

- The program assumes that the string `s` must contain at least `n` unique substrings of length `k`. This is correct for the problem statement, but the implementation should ensure that it correctly handles the case where `s` might not contain enough unique substrings.

After reviewing the code, the logic seems sound, and the program should work as intended for the given constraints and examples.

Correctness: **True**
