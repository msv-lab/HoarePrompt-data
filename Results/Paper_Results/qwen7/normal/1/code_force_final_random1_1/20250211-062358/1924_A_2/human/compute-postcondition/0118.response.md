Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `cur` is such that `(cur & 1 << 0)` evaluates to 0, `tmp` is 'b'**

Explanation: The code `tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)` updates the value of `tmp`. Since `i` is initially 1, `ord('a') + i` equals `ord('a') + 1`, which is `97 + 1 = 98`. The character corresponding to ASCII value 98 is 'b'. Therefore, `tmp` is updated to 'b'. The values of `i`, `k`, and `cur` remain unchanged according to the initial state.
