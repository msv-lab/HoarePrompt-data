Output State: `one` is True, `two` is False, `tmp` is the last element of `rev[tmp]` after it has been popped in the final iteration of the loop.

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `rev[tmp]` is not empty. After each iteration, `two` toggles its value (from True to False or vice versa), and `tmp` is set to the last element of `rev[tmp]` after popping it. This process repeats until `rev[tmp]` becomes empty. At that point, the loop terminates. Given the conditions, the final state will have `one` still True because it does not change within the loop, `two` will be False if the loop terminated on an odd-numbered iteration or True if it terminated on an even-numbered iteration, and `tmp` will be the last element of `rev[tmp]` after being popped in the final iteration.
