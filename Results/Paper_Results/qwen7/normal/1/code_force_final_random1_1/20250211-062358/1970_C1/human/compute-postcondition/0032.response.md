Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `rev[tmp] != []`.

2. **Determine the variables involved in the loop condition**: The only variable involved in the loop condition is `tmp`.

3. **Current state of `tmp`**: According to the given state right before the loop, `tmp` is `z`.

4. **Condition for the loop to execute**: For the loop to execute the first time, `rev[tmp]` must not be an empty list. Since `tmp` is currently `z`, we need to ensure that `rev[z]` is not an empty list.

5. **Adjusting the state**: We need to ensure that `rev[z]` is not an empty list for the loop to execute the first time.

Given this analysis, the state right before the loop should be adjusted to ensure that `rev[z]` is not an empty list.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`one` is True, `two` is True, `tmp` is `z`, and `rev[z]` is not an empty list**
