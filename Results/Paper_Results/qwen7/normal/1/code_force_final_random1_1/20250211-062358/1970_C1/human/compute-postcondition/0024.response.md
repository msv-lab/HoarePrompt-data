Output State: **`one` is True, `lst[z]` is not an empty list, `tmp` is now equal to the last element of `lst[tmp] - 1`, `x` will be less than or equal to 0 after all iterations, `a` will be the last integer input provided during the loop's final iteration, `b` will be the last integer input provided during the loop's final iteration, `rev[b]` will contain all integers `a` that were inputs along with `b` throughout the loop's iterations, `lst[a]` will contain all integers `b` that were inputs along with `a` throughout the loop's iterations.**

Explanation: The code `tmp = lst[tmp].pop()` pops (removes and returns) the last element from the list `lst[tmp]` and assigns it to `tmp`. Since `tmp` was previously equal to the last element of `lst[tmp]`, after popping, `tmp` is now equal to the second last element of `lst[tmp]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
