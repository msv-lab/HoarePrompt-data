Output State: **`x` must be greater than or equal to 1; `a` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer; `rev[b]` now contains the additional element `a`.**

Explanation: The code `rev[b].append(a)` appends the value of `a` to the list `rev[b]`. Since `a` and `b` are input integers, their values remain unchanged. The precondition that `x` must be greater than or equal to 1 is still valid. After executing the code, `rev[b]` now includes the additional element `a`.
