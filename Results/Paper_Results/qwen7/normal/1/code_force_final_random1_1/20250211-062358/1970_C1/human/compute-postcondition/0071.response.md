Output State: **The `queue` is an empty deque, `current` is the target node, `dist` is the shortest distance from the start node to the target node, and `visited` is a set containing all nodes that are reachable from the start node.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the `queue` will be empty because there are no more nodes to process. The `current` will be the `target` node, and `dist` will be the shortest distance from the start node to the target node. The `visited` set will include all nodes that are reachable from the start node, ensuring that every node has been explored exactly once.
