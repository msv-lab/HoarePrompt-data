Output State: **`x` must be greater than 0; `a` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer; `a, b` are updated to new integer values from input; `rev[b]` now contains the additional element `a`; `lst[a]` now contains the element `b`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `b` to the list at index `a` in the `lst` list. The values of `x`, `a`, `b`, and the content of `rev[b]` remain unchanged from their initial states. The only change is that `lst[a]` now includes the value `b`.
