Output State: **`one` is True, `two` is False, `rev[tmp]` is not an empty list**

Explanation: The variable `two` was originally set to `True`. The code snippet `two = not two` changes the value of `two` to the opposite of its current value, which means `two` becomes `False`. The other variables, `one` and `rev[tmp]`, remain unchanged.
