Output State: **`x` is an integer input from the first split, `y` is an integer input from the second split, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer such that t = 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the list of integers for the starting node(s) contains exactly one integer 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n; `lst` is a defaultdict where all values are lists.**

The code initializes a defaultdict named `lst` where all values are lists. This does not change the values of the existing variables (`x`, `y`, `n`, `t`, `u`, `v`). Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions of these variables while adding the new defaultdict `lst`.
