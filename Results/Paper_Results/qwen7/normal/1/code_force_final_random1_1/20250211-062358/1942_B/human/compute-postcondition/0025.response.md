Output State: **`mex` is `n`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from user input, `res` is a list of `n` elements where each element is `None`, and `i` is `-1`.**

Explanation: The code sets `mex` to the value of `n`. All other variables remain unchanged.
