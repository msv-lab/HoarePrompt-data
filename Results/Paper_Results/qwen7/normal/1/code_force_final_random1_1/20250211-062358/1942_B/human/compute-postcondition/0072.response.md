Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads a positive integer \( n \), a list \( a \) of \( n \) integers, and calculates a new list \( res \) based on the values in \( a \). Specifically, for each index \( i \) from \( n-1 \) to \( 0 \), it sets \( res[i] \) to \( mex - a[i] \), where \( mex \) is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the adjusted list \( a \). The function then prints the elements of \( res \) separated by spaces. The original list \( a \) remains unchanged.**
