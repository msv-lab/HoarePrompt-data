Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case involves the variable `i`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `len(ar) - 1` down to `0` with a step of `-1`. Therefore, `i` starts at `len(ar) - 2` (as given in the postcondition) and decreases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `-1`.

3. **Determine the new value of `i`**: Since the loop decrements `i` by 1, the new value of `i` will be `len(ar) - 3`.

4. **Check the postcondition**: The postcondition states that `mex` is unchanged, `res` is a list of `None` values with length `n`, and `res[i]` is equal to `mex - ar[i]`. This means that the values of `mex`, `res`, and `ar` remain the same for the next iteration.

5. **Adjust the state**: The only state that changes is the value of `i`, which decreases by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: `i` is `len(ar) - 3`, `mex` is unchanged, `res` is a list of `None` values with length `n`, and `res[i]` is equal to `mex - ar[i]`.**
