You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

Farmer John has a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n , where every integer from
0 to n-1 occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array a of length n and
challenges her to construct p based on a .

The array a is constructed so that a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) -
p_i , where the \texttt{MEX} of an array is the minimum non-negative integer
that does not appear in that array. For example, \texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0 and
\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2 .

Help Bessie construct any valid permutation p that satisfies a . The input is
given in such a way that at least one valid p exists. If there are multiple
possible p , it is enough to print one of them.

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the lengths of p and a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-n \leq a_i \leq n ) — the elements of array a .

It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid p for the given data.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers on a new line, the elements of p .

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    1 1 -2 1 2
    
    5
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    3
    
    -2 1 2

Output

    0 1 4 2 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 
    2 0 1 
    
Note

In the first case, p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is one possible output.

a will then be calculated as a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 , a_2 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 , a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 , a_4 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 , a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 .

So, as required, a will be [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] .

- Program:
from collections import deque

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = [None] * n
        mex = n
        for i in range(len(ar) - 1, -1, -1):
            res[i] = mex - ar[i]
            if mex > mex - ar[i]:
                mex = mex - ar[i]
        print(' '.join((str(x) for x in res)))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads a positive integer \( n \), a list \( a \) of \( n \) integers, and calculates a new list \( res \) based on the values in \( a \). Specifically, for each index \( i \) from \( n-1 \) to \( 0 \), it sets \( res[i] \) to \( mex - a[i] \), where \( mex \) is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the adjusted list \( a \). The function then prints the elements of \( res \) separated by spaces. The original list \( a \) remains unchanged.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate a valid permutation \( p \) based on the given array \( a \). Specifically, the logic used to compute the values for \( p \) is flawed. Let's analyze the issue:

1. The program attempts to compute the MEX value in reverse order, which is not the correct approach. The MEX for a subarray \( p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i \) needs to be computed forward, considering the current state of the permutation \( p \).

2. The program incorrectly updates the `mex` value without properly accounting for the elements already placed in the permutation. This leads to incorrect values being assigned to the permutation \( p \).

To illustrate this, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
3
5
1 1 -2 1 2
```

Expected output:
```
0 1 4 2 3
```

However, the program produces:
```
0 1 2 3 4
```

This is incorrect because:
- For \( i = 4 \), the MEX of \( [0, 1, 2, 3] \) is 4, but the program assigns 3, leading to an invalid permutation.

A correct approach would involve constructing the permutation \( p \) by ensuring that each element \( p_i \) is the smallest integer not yet used in the prefix of \( p \). Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = [-1] * n
        used = set()
        
        for i in range(n):
            mex = 0
            while mex in used:
                mex += 1
            res[i] = mex
            used.add(mex)
        
        print(' '.join(str(x) for x in res))

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that each element in the permutation is the smallest integer not yet used, thus satisfying the condition \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \).
