Output State: **`i` is 0, `mex` is `n`, `res` is a list of None values with length `n`, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user.**

Explanation: The line `mex = n` assigns the value of `n` to the variable `mex`. The values of the other variables (`i`, `res`, and `ar`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
