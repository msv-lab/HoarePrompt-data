Output State: **`i` is `len(ar) - 1`; `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `mex - ar[i]` to `res[i]`. Here, `i` is already set to `len(ar) - 1` from the initial state. Since `mex` (minimum excluded) is not defined in the initial state, we keep it as `mex`. The value of `ar[i]` is known because `i` is `len(ar) - 1`, so `ar[i]` refers to the last element of the list `ar`. The output state updates `res[i]` with the calculated value while keeping other variables unchanged.
