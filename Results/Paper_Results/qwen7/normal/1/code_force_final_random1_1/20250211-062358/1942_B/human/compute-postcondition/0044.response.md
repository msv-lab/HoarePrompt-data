Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the `for _ in range(int(input())):` statement. The only variables involved here are the input value from `int(input())` and the loop counter `_`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop runs for as many times as the integer input provided by the user. Each iteration does not explicitly change the values of `i` or `mex`, but it updates the `res` list based on the current value of `i`.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - The loop counter `_` starts from 0 and increments by 1 with each iteration.
   - Since the loop runs for a number of times equal to the integer input, after the loop completes, `_` will be equal to the input value.
   - The `i` variable in the context of the loop is the loop counter `_`, which means at the end of the loop, `i` will be equal to the input value minus 1 (since it starts from 0).
   - `mex` remains unchanged if it was never updated to a value greater than `mex - ar[i]` during any iteration.
   - Each element in `res` is updated to `mex - ar[i]` where `i` ranges from `len(ar) - 1` to `0`.

Given that the loop runs for a number of times equal to the input value, let's assume the input value is `N`. After the loop completes, `i` will be `N-1`, `mex` remains unchanged, and `res` is updated accordingly.

Since the loop counter `_` is the only variable in the loop head, and it starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

- The input value (which determines the number of iterations) is used to set the initial value of `_` to 0.
- After the loop completes, `_` will be equal to the input value `N`.

However, since we are asked to think about the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the state just before the loop starts running. Therefore, the state at the start of the first iteration (before any iterations have occurred) would be:

State: **`i` is 0, `mex` remains unchanged, and `res` is empty**.

But since the question asks for the state at the start of the next iteration after the loop has completed its previous iteration, we need to consider the state right before the next iteration starts, which is just before the loop starts running again.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`i` is 0, `mex` remains unchanged, and `res` is empty**.

However, if we strictly follow the format and the example given, we should consider the state just before the next iteration starts, which would be:

State: **`i` is 0, `mex` remains unchanged, and `res` is empty**.
