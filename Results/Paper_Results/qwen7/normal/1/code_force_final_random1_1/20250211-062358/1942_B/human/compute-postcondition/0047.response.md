Output State: **`i` is 0, `mex` remains unchanged, `res` is a list of None values with length `n`, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user.**

Explanation: The code initializes `res` as a list of `None` values with a length of `n`. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 0, `mex` remains unchanged, and `ar` remains unchanged as a list of integers input by the user.
