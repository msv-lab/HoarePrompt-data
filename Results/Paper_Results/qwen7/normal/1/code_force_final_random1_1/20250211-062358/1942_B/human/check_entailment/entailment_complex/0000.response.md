Reasoning:

The annotated program seems to have a logical flaw in how it calculates the `mex` value and assigns the values to the result list `res`. Let's break down the logic step-by-step:

1. **Initialization**: `mex` is initialized to `n`, which is the maximum possible value for the MEX (Minimum EXcludant) in a list of length `n`.

2. **Loop**: The loop iterates backward through the list `ar` from the last element to the first. For each element `ar[i]`, it calculates `res[i]` as `mex - ar[i]` and updates `mex` if `mex > mex - ar[i]`.

3. **Issue with MEX Calculation**: The key issue is that `mex` should be updated based on the current state of the `res` array, not just the `ar` array. The `mex` value should reflect the smallest non-negative integer not present in the current state of `res`.

4. **Correct Approach**: To correctly compute the `mex` for each position, we need to ensure that `mex` is always the smallest non-negative integer not present in the current segment of `res` that has been processed.

Here is a corrected version of the logic:

```python
from collections import deque

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        res = [-1] * n  # Initialize result array with -1
        mex = 0  # Start with the smallest non-negative integer
        
        for i in range(n):
            if ar[i] == mex:
                mex += 1  # Skip if ar[i] is equal to mex
            else:
                res[i] = mex  # Assign mex to the current position
                mex += 1  # Increment mex after assignment
        
        print(' '.join(str(x) for x in res))
```

This corrected approach ensures that `mex` is always the smallest non-negative integer not present in the current segment of `res` and correctly constructs the permutation `p`.

Given the above analysis, the original program is incorrect due to the flawed calculation of `mex`.

Correctness: **False**
