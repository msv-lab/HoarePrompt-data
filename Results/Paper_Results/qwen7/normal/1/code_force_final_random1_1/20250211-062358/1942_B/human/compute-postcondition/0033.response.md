Output State: **`i` is `len(ar) - 2`, `mex` is greater than `mex - ar[i]`, and `res[i]` is updated to `mex - ar[i]`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `res[i]` to `mex - ar[i]`. Since `i` is `len(ar) - 2`, `mex` is greater than `mex - ar[i]`, and `res[i]` was previously updated to `mex - ar[i]`, these conditions remain true after the code execution. Therefore, the values of `i`, `mex`, and the condition involving `res[i]` remain unchanged, while `res[i]` is now explicitly set to `mex - ar[i]`.
