Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `i` is `len(ar) - 2`
- `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[i]`
- `res[i]` is updated to `mex - ar[i]`

### Loop Head
The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(len(ar) - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Loop Variable (`i`)**:
   - The loop starts from `len(ar) - 1` and decrements by 1 until it reaches `-1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `len(ar) - 2`.

2. **Next Value of `i`**:
   - Since the loop decrements `i` by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` would be `len(ar) - 3`.

3. **Other Variables**:
   - `mex` and `res` are updated within the loop but their values depend on the loop variable `i` and the array `ar`. These values will be updated in the next iteration based on the new value of `i`.

### Adjusted States
- `i` will be `len(ar) - 3`.
- `mex` and `res` will be updated based on the new value of `i`.

### Final State
State: **`i` is `len(ar) - 3`, `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[i]`, and `res[i]` is updated to `mex - ar[i]`**
