Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `ar = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, converts each integer to a string, splits the string into individual elements, converts those elements back to integers, and stores them in the list `ar`. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
