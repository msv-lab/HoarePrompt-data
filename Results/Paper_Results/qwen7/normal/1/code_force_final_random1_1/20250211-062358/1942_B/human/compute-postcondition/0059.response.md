Postcondition: `i` is `len(ar) - 2`, `mex` is unchanged, `res` is a list of `None` values with length `n`, and `res[i]` is equal to `mex - ar[i]`. If `mex > mex - ar[i]` is true, then `mex` is decreased by `ar[i]` and `res[i]` remains as `mex - ar[i]`. If the condition is false, `mex` remains unchanged and `res[i]` remains as `mex - ar[i]`.
