Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `len(ar) - 1` to `0` with a step of `-1`. This means `i` starts from `len(ar) - 1` and decrements by 1 until it reaches `0`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `len(ar) - 2`
   - `mex` is unchanged
   - `res` is a list of `None` values with length `n`
   - `res[i]` is equal to `mex - ar[i]`
   - If `mex > mex - ar[i]` is true, then `mex` is decreased by `ar[i]` and `res[i]` remains as `mex - ar[i]`. If the condition is false, `mex` remains unchanged and `res[i]` remains as `mex - ar[i]`.

4. **Determine the next value of `i`**: Since the loop decrements `i` by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` will be `len(ar) - 3`.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be `len(ar) - 3`
   - `mex` remains unchanged
   - `res` remains a list of `None` values with length `n`
   - `res[i]` (which is `len(ar) - 3`) will be equal to `mex - ar[len(ar) - 3]`

Given this information, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is `len(ar) - 3`, `mex` is unchanged, `res` is a list of `None` values with length `n`, and `res[i]` is equal to `mex - ar[i]`.**
