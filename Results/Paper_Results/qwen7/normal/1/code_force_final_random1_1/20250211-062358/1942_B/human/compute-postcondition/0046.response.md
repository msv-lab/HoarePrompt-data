Output State: **`i` is 0, `mex` remains unchanged, `res` is empty, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user.**

Explanation: The code `ar = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input from the user and converts each integer into a list. The initial values of `i`, `mex`, and `res` remain unchanged. The new variable `ar` is created and assigned a list of integers based on the user's input.
