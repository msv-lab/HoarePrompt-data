Postcondition: **`mex` is `mex - ar[len(ar) - 3]`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `res` is a list of `n` elements, all set to `n - ar[i]`, `i` is `len(ar) - 4`, `res[i]` is updated to `mex - ar[i]` if `mex > mex - ar[len(ar) - 3]`.**
