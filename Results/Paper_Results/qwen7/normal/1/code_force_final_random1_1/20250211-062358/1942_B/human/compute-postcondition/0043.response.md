Based on the initial state provided:

- After the loop executes all iterations, `i` is `-1`.
- `mex` remains unchanged if it was never updated to a value greater than `mex - ar[i]` during any iteration.
- Each element in `res` is updated to `mex - ar[i]` where `i` ranges from `len(ar) - 1` to `0`.

Let's break down the process:

1. **Loop Execution**: The loop updates each element in `res` to `mex - ar[i]` for each `i` ranging from `len(ar) - 1` to `0`. Since `i` starts from `len(ar) - 1` and goes down to `0`, the last value of `i` will be `0` after the loop completes.

2. **Final Value of `res`**: After the loop, each element in `res` will be `mex - ar[i]` for `i` ranging from `len(ar) - 1` to `0`. Given that `i` ends up being `0` after the loop, the last element in `res` will be `mex - ar[0]`, and so on until the first element, which will be `mex - ar[len(ar) - 1]`.

3. **Printing `res`**: The `print` statement will join all elements of `res` into a single string with spaces between them.

Therefore, the output will be a space-separated string of values, each being `mex - ar[i]` for `i` ranging from `len(ar) - 1` to `0`.

Output: **mex - ar[len(ar) - 1] mex - ar[len(ar) - 2] ... mex - ar[1] mex - ar[0]**
