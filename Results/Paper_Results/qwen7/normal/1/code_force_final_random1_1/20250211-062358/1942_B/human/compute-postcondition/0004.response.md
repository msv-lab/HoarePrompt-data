Output State: **`mex` is `n`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `res` is a list of `n` elements, all set to `None`.**

Explanation: The line `mex = n` assigns the value of `n` to the variable `mex`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
