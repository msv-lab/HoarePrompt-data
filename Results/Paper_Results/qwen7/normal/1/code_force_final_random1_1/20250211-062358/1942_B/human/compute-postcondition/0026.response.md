Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `i`: This variable is used as the index in the loop.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs in reverse order from `len(ar) - 1` to `0` (inclusive). The loop will continue as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `0`.

3. **Initial state of the variables**:
   - `mex` is `n`.
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `ar` is a list of integers obtained from user input.
   - `res` is a list of `n` elements where each element is `None`.
   - `i` is `-1`.

4. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - The loop will start executing when `i` is set to `len(ar) - 1`. Since `i` is initially `-1`, we need to adjust `i` to be `len(ar) - 1` for the loop to start.
   - We don't need to adjust `mex`, `t`, `n`, `ar`, or `res` because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the loop can start executing. Specifically, `i` should be `len(ar) - 1`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is `len(ar) - 1`**
