Output State: **`i` is `len(ar) - 2`, `mex` is decreased by `ar[i]`, `res` is a list of `None` values with length `n`, and `res[i]` is equal to `mex - ar[i]`.**

Explanation: The value of `mex` is decreased by `ar[i]`, where `i` is `len(ar) - 2`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `mex` is updated, and `res[i]` is recalculated based on the new value of `mex`.
