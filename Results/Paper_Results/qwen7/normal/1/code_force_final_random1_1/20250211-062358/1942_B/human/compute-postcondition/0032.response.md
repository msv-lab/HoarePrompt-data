Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs in reverse order from `len(ar) - 1` to `0` (inclusive), decrementing by 1 each time.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is `len(ar) - 1`
   - `mex` is greater than `mex - ar[i]`
   - `res[i]` is updated to `mex - ar[i]`

4. **Determine the Next Value of `i`**: Since the loop decrements `i` by 1 each time, the next value of `i` will be `len(ar) - 2`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be `len(ar) - 2`.
   - The condition `mex > mex - ar[i]` still holds true because `mex` remains unchanged and `ar[i]` is just the next element in the array.
   - `res[i]` will be updated to `mex - ar[i]` for the new value of `i`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is `len(ar) - 2`, `mex` is greater than `mex - ar[i]`, and `res[i]` is updated to `mex - ar[i]`**.
