Postcondition: `mex` is `n`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `res` is a list of `n` elements, all set to `n - ar[i]`, `i` is `len(ar) - 2`, and if `mex` is greater than `mex - ar[i]`, then `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[i]`.
