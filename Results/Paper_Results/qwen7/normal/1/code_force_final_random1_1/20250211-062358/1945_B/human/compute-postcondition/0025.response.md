Functionality: **The function processes up to 10,000 test cases, each consisting of three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(m\) (where \(1 \leq a, b, m \leq 10^{18}\)). For each test case, it calculates a value based on the minimum of \(a\) and \(b\) plus \(m\), and prints either \(\frac{mn}{a} + \frac{mn}{b} + 1\) or \(\frac{mn}{a} + \frac{mn}{b}\) depending on whether \(m\) is divisible by both \(a\) and \(b\) and neither \(a\) nor \(b\) is 1. After processing all test cases, it outputs the calculated value for each case.**
