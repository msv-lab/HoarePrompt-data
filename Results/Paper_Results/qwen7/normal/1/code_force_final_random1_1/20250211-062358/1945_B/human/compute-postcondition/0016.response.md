Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `t`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < t`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `a` is an input integer.
   - `b` is an input integer.
   - `m` is an input integer.
   - `mn` is the minimum of `a` and `b` plus `m`.

4. **Check the loop condition**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1 and `t` must be greater than 0, the loop will continue if `t > 1`.

5. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 2.
   - `t` remains unchanged because no information is given that would suggest a change in `t`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `i` becomes 2.
- `t` remains the same (must be greater than 0).

The final state is:
**`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, and `mn` is the minimum of `a` and `b` plus `m`.**

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, and `mn` is the minimum of `a` and `b` plus `m`.**
