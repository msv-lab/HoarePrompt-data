State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and `i` must be 0**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop is defined as `for i in range(t):`.
2. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer because `range(t)` generates numbers from 0 to `t-1`.
3. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 when the loop starts, as `range(t)` begins counting from 0.
4. Since `t` is set to an integer value entered by the user, and given the constraint \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), we need to ensure `t` is greater than 0 to allow the loop to execute.
5. Therefore, the initial state should reflect that `t` must be greater than 0 and `i` must be 0 to ensure the loop can start executing.
