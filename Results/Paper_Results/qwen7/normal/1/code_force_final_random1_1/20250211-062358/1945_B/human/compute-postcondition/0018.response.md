Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `mn` is the minimum of `a` and `b` plus `m`, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `mn` to be the minimum of `a` and `b` plus `m`. Since `a` and `b` are updated to new input integers and `m` is also updated to an input integer, `mn` will be recalculated based on these new values. The other variables (`t`, `i`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.
