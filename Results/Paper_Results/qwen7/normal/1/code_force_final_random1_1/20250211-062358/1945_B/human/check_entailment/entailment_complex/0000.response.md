Reasoning:  
The annotated program correctly implements the logic to calculate the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This is correct according to the problem statement.

2. **Variables Initialization**: For each test case, the program initializes `a`, `b`, and `m` using the input values. This is also correct.

3. **Calculation of `mn`**: The variable `mn` is defined as the minimum of `a` and `b` plus `m`. This calculation is necessary to determine the time interval when fireworks from both installations might overlap.

4. **Condition Check**: The program checks if `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b` and neither `a` nor `b` is 1. If this condition is met, it prints `mn // a + mn // b + 1`. Otherwise, it prints `mn // a + mn // b`.

   - If `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b`, the formula `mn // a + mn // b + 1` accounts for the fact that there will be an additional overlap at the exact moment `m` is a multiple of both `a` and `b`.
   - If `m` is not divisible by both `a` and `b` or either `a` or `b` is 1, the formula `mn // a + mn // b` is used, which correctly counts the overlaps without the extra +1.

5. **Output**: The program correctly outputs the result for each test case and handles all constraints and edge cases as specified in the problem statement.

Given that the logic implemented in the function matches the requirements of the problem, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
