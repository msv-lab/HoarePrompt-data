Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by calculating the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time. However, there are some logical errors in the approach used to calculate the result.

1. **Calculation of `mn`:**
   - The variable `mn` is defined as `min(a, b) + m`. This calculation does not correctly represent the time when fireworks from both installations might overlap in visibility.

2. **Divisions and Conditions:**
   - The program checks if `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b` and neither `a` nor `b` is 1. If true, it prints `mn // a + mn // b + 1`; otherwise, it prints `mn // a + mn // b`.
   - This condition and the divisions do not correctly account for the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously.

3. **Correct Approach:**
   - To find the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously, we need to consider the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`. The LCM represents the smallest interval where both installations launch fireworks at the same time.
   - The number of fireworks visible at any given time is determined by how many multiples of `a` and `b` fit into the LCM interval plus the additional time `m`.

Given these points, the provided solution is incorrect because it does not properly account for the LCM and the visibility period of the fireworks.

Correctness: **False**
