Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

# Annotated Program:
t = 7
cas_de_test = [(0, 0, 0), (0, 1, 1), (0, 2, 3), (3, 3, 3), (3, 4, 5), (1, 1, 10), (0, 0, 6)]
resultats = func_1(t, cas_de_test)
print('\n'.join(map(str, resultats)))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and cas_de_test is a list of lists, where each inner list contains three non-negative integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30.
def func_1(t, cas_de_test):
    resultats = []
    for (p1, p2, p3) in cas_de_test:
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
        
        if total_points % 2 != 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        
        total_matchs = total_points // 2
        
        if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        
        egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)
        
        if egalites < 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
        else:
            resultats.append(egalites // 2)
        
    #State: Output State: The `resultats` list will contain one of the following based on the conditions checked within the loop for each inner list in `cas_de_test`:
    #
    #- If any of the conditions cause `-1` to be appended to `resultats`, then `resultats` will end up being a list of `-1`s, with the length equal to the number of inner lists in `cas_de_test`.
    #- If none of the conditions cause `-1` to be appended and all `egalites // 2` values are valid, then `resultats` will be a list containing these valid `egalites // 2` values.
    #
    #The `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` variables will be the last values from the last inner list processed in `cas_de_test`. The `total_points` will be the sum of the last `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. `total_matchs` will be `total_points // 2`. `egalites` will be calculated as `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`, and if it's non-negative, `egalites // 2` will be appended to `resultats`.
    #
    #If all inner lists in `cas_de_test` pass all conditions without appending `-1`, the final `resultats` will be a list of `egalites // 2` values for each inner list. If any inner list causes `-1` to be appended, `resultats` will consist of `-1`s followed by any valid `egalites // 2` values.
    return resultats
    #The program returns a list `resultats` which contains either `-1` for each inner list in `cas_de_test` if any condition causes `-1` to be appended, or `egalites // 2` for each valid inner list in `cas_de_test` if no `-1` is appended. The variables `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the last values from the last inner list processed in `cas_de_test`. `total_points` is the sum of the last `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. `total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`. `egalites` is calculated as `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`, and if it's non-negative, `egalites // 2` is appended to `resultats`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `t`, a positive integer between 1 and 500, and `cas_de_test`, a list of lists where each inner list contains three non-negative integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` such that `0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30`. For each inner list in `cas_de_test`, it checks several conditions. If any condition fails, `-1` is appended to the result list `resultats`. If all conditions pass, `egalites // 2` is appended to `resultats`. After processing all inner lists, the function returns the list `resultats`. The variables `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` hold the last values from the last inner list processed, `total_points` is the sum of the last `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, `total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`, and `egalites` is calculated as `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`, with `egalites // 2` appended to `resultats` if non-negative.
