Output State: **`cas_de_test` is a list of lists, `p1` is the first value from the first inner list, `p2` is the second value from the first inner list, `p3` is the third value from the first inner list, `total_points` is the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, `resultats` is a list containing `-1`, `-1`, `total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`, `total_matchs` is greater than 3 or `p3` is greater than `total_matchs`**.

Explanation: The code appends `-1` to the `resultats` list. Initially, `resultats` contained only `-1`, so after appending another `-1`, `resultats` becomes a list containing `-1`, `-1`. The values of `cas_de_test`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `total_points`, `total_matchs`, and the condition `total_matchs` is greater than 3 or `p3` is greater than `total_matchs` remain unchanged.
