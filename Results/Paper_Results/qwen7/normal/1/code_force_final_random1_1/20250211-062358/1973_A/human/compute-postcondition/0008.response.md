Output State: **`cas_de_test` is a list of lists, `p1` is the first value from the first inner list, `p2` is the second value from the first inner list, `p3` is the third value from the first inner list, `total_points` is the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, and `resultats` is a list containing `-1`; `total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `total_matchs` as the integer division of `total_points` by 2. Since `total_points` is the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, `total_matchs` is effectively the integer division of `p1 + p2 + p3` by 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
