The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since no loop was specified in the code snippet, the variables `cas_de_test`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `total_points`, and `resultats` remain unchanged. The `continue` statement does not affect these variables.

Output State: **`cas_de_test` is a list of lists, `p1` is the first value from the next inner list in `cas_de_test`, `p2` is the second value from the next inner list in `cas_de_test`, `p3` is the third value from the next inner list in `cas_de_test`, `total_points` is the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, and `resultats` is a list with an additional element `-1`.**
