Reasoning:

1. The program correctly initializes the test cases and iterates over each case.
2. For each test case, it checks if the total points (`total_points`) are even. If not, it appends `-1` to the results list, indicating an inconsistency.
3. It then calculates the total number of matches (`total_matchs`) and checks if this value exceeds 3 or if the highest score (`p3`) exceeds the total number of matches. If either condition is true, it appends `-1` to the results list.
4. If the above conditions are satisfied, it calculates the number of draws using the formula `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)` and appends `egalites // 2` to the results list.
5. The logic for calculating the number of draws seems to be based on the fact that each match can contribute up to 2 points (either 2 to the winner or 1 to each player in a draw), and the difference in scores can be attributed to the number of draws and wins.
6. The program correctly handles the constraints and conditions specified in the problem statement.

Given the analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
