Output State: **`cas_de_test` is a list of lists, `p1` is the first value from the next inner list in `cas_de_test`, `p2` is the second value from the next inner list in `cas_de_test`, `p3` is the third value from the next inner list in `cas_de_test`, `total_points` is the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, `total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`, `resultats` is a list with an additional element `-1`, `egalites` is `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`**.

Explanation: The code calculates the value of `egalites` using the formula `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`. This value is not assigned to any existing variable but is computed. The conditions `total_matchs > 3` or `p3 > total_matchs` do not affect `resultats` since they are not met (as per the initial state, these conditions are not specified to be true). Therefore, the `resultats` list remains unchanged with an additional element `-1`. The other variables (`cas_de_test`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `total_points`, `total_matchs`) remain in their initial states.
