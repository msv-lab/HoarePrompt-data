Output State: **`p1` is the first value from the next inner list in `cas_de_test`, `p2` is the second value from the next inner list in `cas_de_test`, `p3` is the third value from the next inner list in `cas_de_test`, `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`.**

This means that `total_points` is calculated as the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, which are the first, second, and third values from the next inner list in `cas_de_test`, respectively. All other information about `cas_de_test` remains unchanged.
