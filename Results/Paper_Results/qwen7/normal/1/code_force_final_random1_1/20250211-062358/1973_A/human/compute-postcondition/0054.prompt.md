You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and cas_de_test is a list of lists, where each inner list contains three non-negative integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30.
def func_1(t, cas_de_test):
    resultats = []
    for (p1, p2, p3) in cas_de_test:
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
        
        if total_points % 2 != 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        
        total_matchs = total_points // 2
        
        if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        
        egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)
        
        if egalites < 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
        else:
            resultats.append(egalites // 2)
        
    #State: Output State: The `resultats` list will contain one of the following based on the conditions checked within the loop for each inner list in `cas_de_test`:
    #
    #- If any of the conditions cause `-1` to be appended to `resultats`, then `resultats` will end up being a list of `-1`s, with the length equal to the number of inner lists in `cas_de_test`.
    #- If none of the conditions cause `-1` to be appended and all `egalites // 2` values are valid, then `resultats` will be a list containing these valid `egalites // 2` values.
    #
    #The `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` variables will be the last values from the last inner list processed in `cas_de_test`. The `total_points` will be the sum of the last `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. `total_matchs` will be `total_points // 2`. `egalites` will be calculated as `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`, and if it's non-negative, `egalites // 2` will be appended to `resultats`.
    #
    #If all inner lists in `cas_de_test` pass all conditions without appending `-1`, the final `resultats` will be a list of `egalites // 2` values for each inner list. If any inner list causes `-1` to be appended, `resultats` will consist of `-1`s followed by any valid `egalites // 2` values.
    return resultats
    #The program returns a list `resultats` which contains either `-1` for each inner list in `cas_de_test` if any condition causes `-1` to be appended, or `egalites // 2` for each valid inner list in `cas_de_test` if no `-1` is appended. The variables `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the last values from the last inner list processed in `cas_de_test`. `total_points` is the sum of the last `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. `total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`. `egalites` is calculated as `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`, and if it's non-negative, `egalites // 2` is appended to `resultats`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: `t`, a positive integer between 1 and 500, and `cas_de_test`, a list of lists where each inner list contains three non-negative integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` such that `0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30`. For each inner list in `cas_de_test`, if any condition causes `-1` to be appended, `-1` is added to the result list `resultats`. Otherwise, `egalites // 2` is appended to `resultats`. The function returns the list `resultats`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list `resultats` which contains either `-1` for each inner list in `cas_de_test` if any condition causes `-1` to be appended, or `egalites // 2` for each valid inner list in `cas_de_test` if no `-1` is appended. The variables `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the last values from the last inner list processed in `cas_de_test`. `total_points` is the sum of the last `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. `total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`. `egalites` is calculated as `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`, and if it's non-negative, `egalites // 2` is appended to `resultats`.

The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
