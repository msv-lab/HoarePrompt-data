Output State: **`cas_de_test` is a list of lists, `p1` is the first value from the first inner list, `p2` is the second value from the first inner list, `p3` is the third value from the first inner list, `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`, `resultats` is a list containing `-1`, `-1`, `total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`, `egalites` is `2 * p2 + 2 * p1 - total_points`, `resultats` is a list containing `-1`, `-1`, `egalites // 2`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `egalites // 2` to the `resultats` list. Given that `egalites` is `2 * p2 + 2 * p1 - total_points`, the updated `resultats` list includes this new value. All other variables remain unchanged.
