The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since there is no loop context provided in the initial state, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables outside of a loop. Therefore, the values of all variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cas_de_test` is a list of lists, `p1` is the first value from the first inner list, `p2` is the second value from the first inner list, `p3` is the third value from the first inner list, `total_points` is the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`, `resultats` is a list containing `-1`, `-1`, `total_matchs` is `total_points // 2`, `total_matchs` is greater than 3 or `p3` is greater than `total_matchs`.**
