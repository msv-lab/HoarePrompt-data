Output State: `m` must be greater than 0, `j` is `m-1`, `x` and `y` are input integers, both converted from inputs for each iteration. If `y` is greater than `x` during any iteration, the program prints `d1[y] - d1[x]`. If `y` is less than or equal to `x`, the program prints `d2[y] - d2[x]`. After all iterations, the values of `m` and `j` will reflect the final state of the loop, with `j` being one less than `m` if `m` was greater than 0 initially. The variables `x` and `y` will contain the last input values provided during the loop's execution.
