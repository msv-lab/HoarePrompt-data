Output State: **`i` is `n - 3`, `d2[i]` is updated to `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `d2[i]` using the formula `d2[i] = l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`. Here, `i` remains `n - 3`, and `d2[i]` is now calculated based on the given formula. The other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
