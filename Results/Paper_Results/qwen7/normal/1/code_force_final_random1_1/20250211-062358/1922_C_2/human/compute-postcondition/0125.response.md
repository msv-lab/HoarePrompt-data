Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for j in range(m)`. The variables involved here are `j` and `m`.

2. **Determine the initial values and conditions**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `m` must be greater than 0.
   - `j` is currently 0.
   - `x` and `y` are input integers.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `j < m`.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts at 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, after the first iteration, `j` will be 1.
   - The value of `m` remains unchanged unless modified within the loop body, but since no changes to `m` or `j` are mentioned in the postcondition, `m` remains greater than 0 and `j` becomes 1.

5. **Formulate the new state**: For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be 1 and `m` must still be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `m` must be greater than 0, `j` is 1, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer.**
