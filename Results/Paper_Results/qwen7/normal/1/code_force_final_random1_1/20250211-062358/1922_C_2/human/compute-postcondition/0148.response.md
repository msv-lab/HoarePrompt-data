Postcondition: `d1[i + 2]` is set to either `1 + d1[i + 1]` if the difference between `l[i + 1]` and `l[i]` is less than the difference between `l[i]` and `l[i - 1]`, or `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]` if the difference between `l[i + 1]` and `l[i]` is greater than or equal to the difference between `l[i]` and `l[i - 1]`.
