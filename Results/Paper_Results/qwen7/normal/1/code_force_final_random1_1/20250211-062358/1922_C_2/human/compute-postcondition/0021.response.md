Output State: **`i` is 4; `n` must be greater than 4; `d1[i + 2]` is set to `2 + d1[i + 1]`**.

Explanation: The code updates the dictionary `d1` such that the key `i + 2` (which is `4 + 2` or `6`) is assigned the value `1 + d1[i + 1]` (where `i + 1` is `4 + 1` or `5`). Since `d1[i + 1]` was not specified initially, it remains unchanged, and the new value for `d1[6]` is `1 + d1[5]`. The values of `i`, `n`, and the list `l` remain unchanged from their initial states.
