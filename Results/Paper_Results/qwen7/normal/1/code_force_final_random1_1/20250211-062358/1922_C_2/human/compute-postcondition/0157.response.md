Output State: **`d1[i + 2]` is calculated as `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]`, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2 and remains the same.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `d1[i + 2]` using the formula `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]`. Given that `i` is 2, `d1[i + 2]` becomes `d1[4]`, which is now calculated as `l[3] - l[2] + d1[3]`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
