Output State: **`d2[i]` is updated to `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]` for `i` ranging from `1` to `n - 3`.**

This means that for each `i` in the range from `1` to `n - 3`, the value of `d2[i]` is updated to the sum of `l[i] - l[i - 1]` and `d2[i + 1]`. The conditions and updates for `d1` are not directly relevant to the current state of `d2`, so they remain unchanged.
