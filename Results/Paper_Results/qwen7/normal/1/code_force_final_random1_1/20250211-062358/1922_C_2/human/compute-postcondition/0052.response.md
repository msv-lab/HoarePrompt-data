Given the initial state:
- `m` must be greater than 0.
- `j` is 0.
- `x` is an input integer.
- `y` is an input integer.
- The current value of `y` is greater than the current value of `x`.

We need to determine what will be printed for the line `print(d1[y] - d1[x])`.

From the initial state, we know:
- `x` and `y` are input integers with the condition `y > x`.
- `d1` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it is a dictionary where `d1[y]` and `d1[x]` are keys or values that will be used in the subtraction operation.

Since the exact values of `d1[y]` and `d1[x]` are not provided, we can only describe them in terms of their relationship to `x` and `y`.

The expression `d1[y] - d1[x]` will subtract the value of `d1[x]` from the value of `d1[y]`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **d1[y] - d1[x]** (where `d1[y]` and `d1[x]` are values from the dictionary `d1` corresponding to the keys `y` and `x`, respectively, with the condition `y > x`).
