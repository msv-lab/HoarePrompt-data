Output State: **`i` is `n - 3`, `d2[i]` is `1 + d2[i + 1]`, `n` must be at least 2.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `d2[i]` to be `1 + d2[i + 1]`. The value of `i` remains `n - 3`, and `n` must still be at least 2. The precondition that `d2[i]` is determined based on the conditions involving `l[i + 1]`, `l[i]`, and `l[i - 1]` is no longer directly relevant since the value of `d2[i]` is now explicitly set by the code.
