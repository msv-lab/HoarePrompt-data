Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `j` is equal to `m-1`, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `i` is `k`, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`**.

Explanation: The code initializes `d2` as a defaultdict with an integer default factory. This does not affect the values of the other variables listed in the initial state. Therefore, the conditions and values of the other variables remain unchanged.
