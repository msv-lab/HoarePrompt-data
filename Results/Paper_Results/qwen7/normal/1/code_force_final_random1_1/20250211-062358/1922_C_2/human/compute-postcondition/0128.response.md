Based on the initial state provided:

- `m` must be greater than 0.
- `j` is 1.
- `x` is an input integer.
- `y` is an input integer.
- `x` is converted to an integer from the input.
- `y` is converted to an integer from the input.

The `print(d1[y] - d1[x])` statement will print the difference between the values of `d1[y]` and `d1[x]`.

However, the dictionary `d1` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact values of `d1[x]` and `d1[y]`. Therefore, the output will depend on the actual values of `x` and `y` when the code runs.

Output: **d1[y] - d1[x]**
