Output State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 5, `d1[5]` is `l[4] - l[3] + d1[4]`**

Explanation: The code updates the dictionary `d1` by setting the key `i + 2` (which is `5`) to the value `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]` (which is `l[4] - l[3] + d1[4]`). The values of `n` and `i` are not directly affected by this operation, so they remain as per their initial conditions.
