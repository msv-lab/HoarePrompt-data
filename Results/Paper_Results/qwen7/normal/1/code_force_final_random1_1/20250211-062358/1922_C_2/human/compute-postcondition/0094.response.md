Output State: **`d2[n - 1]` is 1, `d1[n + 1]` is the sum of `d1[2]` (which is 1) and the number of times the condition `l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]` is true for `i` ranging from 1 to `n-2`, plus the cumulative differences `l[i + 1] - l[i]` when the condition does not hold.**

Explanation: 
- The code sets `d2[n - 1]` to 1, which is already reflected in the output state.
- For `d1[n + 1]`, the value is determined by the conditions inside the loop. Initially, `d1[2]` is set to 1. The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `n-2`, checking the condition `l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]`. Each time the condition is true, `d1[i + 2]` increments by 1. If the condition is false, `d1[i + 2]` is updated to `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]`. The final value of `d1[n + 1]` is the sum of these increments and updates.
