Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `d1[i + 2]` is 1 + `d1[i + 1]`**

Explanation: The code `d1[i + 2] = 1 + d1[i + 1]` updates the dictionary `d1` such that the key `i + 2` (which is `2 + 2` or `4`) is assigned the value `1 + d1[i + 1]` (which is `1 + d1[3]`). The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `n` must still be greater than 2, `i` is still 2, and `d1[4]` is set to `1 + d1[3]`.
