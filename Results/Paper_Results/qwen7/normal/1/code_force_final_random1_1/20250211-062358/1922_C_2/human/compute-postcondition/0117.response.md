Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `j` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer**

The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated inputs from the user, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `x` and `y` respectively. The initial conditions for `m` and `j` remain unchanged.
