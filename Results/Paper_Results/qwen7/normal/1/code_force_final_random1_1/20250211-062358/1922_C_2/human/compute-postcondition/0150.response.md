Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the condition `range(1, n - 1)`. This means `i` ranges from 1 to `n-2`.

2. **Understand the Postcondition**: The postcondition given is about setting `d1[i + 2]` based on the differences between elements in the list `l`. Specifically:
   - If the difference between `l[i + 1]` and `l[i]` is less than the difference between `l[i]` and `l[i - 1]`, then `d1[i + 2]` is set to `1 + d1[i + 1]`.
   - Otherwise, `d1[i + 2]` is set to `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]`.

3. **Determine the Current State**:
   - `i` is currently at some value within the range `1` to `n-2`.
   - After the loop completes an iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - The condition for the next iteration is that `i` must still be within the range `1` to `n-2`.

Given the current state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `d1[i + 2]` is set based on the conditions mentioned.
- We need to determine the new value of `i` and ensure it is within the valid range.

Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is now `i + 1`.
- The condition for the next iteration is that `i + 1` must still be within the range `1` to `n-2`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`d1[i + 2]` is set based on the conditions, `i` is now `i + 1`, and `i + 1` must be within the range `1` to `n-2`**.

To explicitly state the updated values:
- `i` is now `i + 1`.
- The condition for the next iteration is that `i + 1` must be within the range `1` to `n-2`.

Thus, the final state is:
State: **`d1[i + 2]` is set based on the conditions, `i` is now `i + 1`, and `i + 1` must be within the range `1` to `n-2`**.
