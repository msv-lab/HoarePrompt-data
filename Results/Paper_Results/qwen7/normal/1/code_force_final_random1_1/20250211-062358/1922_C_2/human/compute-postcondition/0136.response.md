Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `j` is equal to `m-1`, `x` and `y` are input integers. The values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged regardless of the condition in the if statement.**

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `j` will be equal to `m-1` (since the loop runs from `0` to `m-1`). The values of `x` and `y` will still be as they were on the last iteration of the loop, but they will remain unchanged throughout all iterations unless new values are explicitly assigned within the loop, which is not the case here.
