Output State: **`m` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `m = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `m`. All other variables remain in their initial state. The precondition that `d2[i]` will be the maximum value of `1 + d2[j]` or `l[j] - l[j-1] + d2[j]` for all `j` from `i+1` to `n-1` based on the condition `l[j+1] - l[j] < l[j] - l[j-1]` remains unchanged, but now `m` is an input integer.
