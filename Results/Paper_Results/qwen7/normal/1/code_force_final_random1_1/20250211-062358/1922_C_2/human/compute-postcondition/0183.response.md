State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `j` is 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Identify the objects in the loop head: The loop head contains the variable `j` and the integer `m`.
2. Determine the initial state of `j`: The problem states that `i` is -1, but `j` is not mentioned, so initially, `j` is 0 (since `j` starts from 0 in the `range(m)` function).
3. Determine the condition for the loop to execute: The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `m`. Therefore, `m` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.

Thus, the state that needs to be adjusted is that `m` must be greater than 0 and `j` is 0.
