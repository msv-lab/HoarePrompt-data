Output State: **`i` is `k - 1`, `d2[i]` is `1 + d2[i + 1]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the dictionary `d2` such that the value at key `i` is set to `1 + d2[i + 1]`. Here, `i` is `k - 1` from the initial state, and since `d2[i + 1]` is not specified, it remains as it is. The value of `i` does not change, but its corresponding value in the dictionary `d2` is updated.
