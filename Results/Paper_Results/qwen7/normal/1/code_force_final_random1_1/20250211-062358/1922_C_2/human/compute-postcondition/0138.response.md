Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `j` is equal to `m-1`, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `i` is `k`, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input integer to `n`. The values of `m`, `j`, `x`, `y`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
