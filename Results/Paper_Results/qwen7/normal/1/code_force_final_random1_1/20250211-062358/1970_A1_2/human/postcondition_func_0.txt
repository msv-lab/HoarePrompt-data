The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `infoA` and `infoB`, which are objects containing `balance` and `position` attributes. It returns the difference between the `balance` attributes of `infoA` and `infoB` if their `balance` values are not equal. If the `balance` values are equal, it returns the difference between the `position` attributes of `infoB` and `infoA`. This difference in `position` represents the difference in positions of characters in two balanced parentheses sequences.
