Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head:**
   - The loop variable `i` is in the loop head.
   - The loop control variable `n` is in the loop head.

2. **Determine the initial conditions and changes during the previous iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `balance_info` is a list containing two elements, both of which are `BalanceInfo` objects.
   - If `s[2]` is '(', the first element's `balance` is 2, otherwise it is -1. The second element's `balance` is the same as `s[2]`.
   - `i` is 3, and `balance` is 1.
   - If `s[2]` is not '(', the first element's `balance` is 1, otherwise it is -1. The second element's `balance` is the same as `s[2]`, `i` is 2, and `balance` is decreased by 1.

3. **Analyze the loop condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n`.

4. **Update the states for the next iteration:**
   - Since `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 4.
   - `n` must remain the same as it was before the previous iteration (since no information suggests it changes).

5. **Adjust the states accordingly:**
   - `i` becomes 4.
   - `n` remains unchanged and must still be greater than 0.

Given this analysis, the updated states for the next iteration are:

State: **`i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 0**
