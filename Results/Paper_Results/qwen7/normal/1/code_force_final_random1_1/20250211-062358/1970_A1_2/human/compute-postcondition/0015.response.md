Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(", ")"; `n` must be greater than 0; `balance_info` is a list containing two elements, both of which are `BalanceInfo` objects; the first element's `balance` is 1 if `s[2]` is '(', otherwise it is -1; the second element's `balance` is the same as `s[2]`; `i` is 2; `balance` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `balance -= 1` decreases the value of `balance` by 1. Since the initial value of the first element's `balance` in `balance_info` was 2 if `s[2]` is '(', otherwise it was -1, after executing the code, it becomes 1 if `s[2]` is '(', otherwise it remains -1. The second element's `balance` remains unchanged because the code does not affect it. All other variables and their conditions remain the same.
