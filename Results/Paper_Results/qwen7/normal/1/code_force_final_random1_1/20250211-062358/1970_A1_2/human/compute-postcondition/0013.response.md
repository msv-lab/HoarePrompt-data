Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(", ")". `n` must be greater than 0. `balance_info` is a list containing two elements, both of which are `BalanceInfo` objects. The first element's `balance` is 2 if `s[2]` is '(', otherwise it is -1. The second element's `balance` is the same as `s[i]`, where `i` is 2. `i` is 2.**

Explanation: The code appends a new `BalanceInfo` object to the `balance_info` list. The new `BalanceInfo` object has its `balance` attribute set to the value of `s[i]`, where `i` is 2. This means the `balance` attribute of the new `BalanceInfo` object is the same as `s[2]`. The previous `balance_info` list contained one `BalanceInfo` object, and now it contains two.
