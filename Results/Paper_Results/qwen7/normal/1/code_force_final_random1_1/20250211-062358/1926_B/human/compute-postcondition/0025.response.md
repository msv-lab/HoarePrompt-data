Postcondition: `b` is the final input string provided by the user, and `k` is a list containing the sum of counts of '1' from each input string provided during the loop iterations. If the first element of `k` is equal to the second element of `k`, no change is made to `k`. Otherwise, the values in `k` reflect the sums of counts of '1' where the first and second elements are not equal.
