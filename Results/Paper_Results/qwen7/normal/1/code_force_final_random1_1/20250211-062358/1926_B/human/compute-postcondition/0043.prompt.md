Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `k` is an empty list
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    b = input()
    if '1' in b:
        k.append(b.count('1'))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `b` is the input string, `k` is a list containing an integer which is the count of '1' in `b`. If the string `b` contains '1', then `k` is updated to reflect the count of '1' in `b`. If the string `b` does not contain '1', then `k` remains unchanged and is still an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `b` is the new input string, `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in `b` plus one, and the number of iterations left is `int(input()) - 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `b` is the new input string from the user, `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in `b` plus one followed by the previous value of `k[1]`, and the number of iterations left is `int(input()) - 2`. If the string `b` contains the character '1', then the count of '1' in `b` plus one is stored in `k[0]` and the previous value of `k[1]` is stored in `k[1]`. If the string `b` does not contain the character '1', then the previous value of `k[1]` remains unchanged and is still stored in `k[1]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
