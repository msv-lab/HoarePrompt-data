Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a grid represented as a list of n strings, where each string contains n characters ('0' or '1'), and identifies whether the grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that includes all '1's. It returns 'triangle' if a single triangle is found, 'square' if a single square is found, and an error message if neither shape is identified or if multiple shapes are present.**
