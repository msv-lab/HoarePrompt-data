You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a binary square grid of n \times n cells. A triangle or a square
is drawn on the grid with symbols \texttt{1} . As he is too busy being cool,
he asks you to tell him which shape is drawn on the grid.

  * A triangle is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has 2 \cdot i-1 consecutive characters \texttt{1} , and the central 1s are located in one column. An upside down triangle is also considered a valid triangle (but not rotated by 90 degrees).

Two left pictures contain examples of triangles: k=4 , k=3 . The two right
pictures don't contain triangles.

  * A square is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has k consecutive characters \texttt{1} , which are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

Examples of two squares: k=2 , k=4 .

For the given grid, determine the type of shape that is drawn on it.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq 10
) — the size of the grid.

The next n lines each contain n characters \texttt{0} or \texttt{1} .

The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all
the \texttt{1} s in the grid. It is guaranteed that the size of the triangle
or square is greater than 1 (i.e., the shape cannot consist of exactly one 1).

Output

For each test case, output "SQUARE" if all the \texttt{1} s in the grid form a
square, and "TRIANGLE" otherwise (without quotes).

    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        k = []
        for _ in range(int(input())):
            b = input()
            if '1' in b:
                k.append(b.count('1'))
        if k[0] == k[1]:
            print('SQUARE')
        else:
            print('TRIANGLE')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a grid represented as a list of strings containing '0's and '1's. For each grid, it counts the number of '1's in each row and checks if the counts match. If the counts match, it prints 'SQUARE'; otherwise, it prints 'TRIANGLE'. The function does not return any value but prints 'SQUARE' or 'TRIANGLE' based on the grid configuration. If no valid shape is found or multiple shapes are present, it will print an error message.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `a`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the grid `n` and then reads `n` lines of binary strings.

2. **Data Collection:**
   - For each test case, it collects the count of `1`s in each row and stores these counts in the list `k`.

3. **Shape Determination:**
   - If all counts in `k` are the same, it prints "SQUARE".
   - Otherwise, it prints "TRIANGLE".

### Issues in the Program

1. **Triangle Detection:**
   - The program checks if all counts in `k` are the same to determine if the shape is a square.
   - However, this approach does not correctly identify triangles.
   - A triangle would have counts like `[1, 3, 5, ..., 2k-1]` for a triangle of size `k`, and an upside-down triangle would have counts like `[1, 3, 5, ..., 2k-1]` but in reverse order.
   - The current logic only checks if all counts are the same, which is true for both squares and certain triangles (specifically, when the triangle is aligned such that all rows have the same number of `1`s).

2. **Square Detection:**
   - The program correctly identifies squares by checking if all counts are the same.
   - This is accurate because a square will always have the same number of `1`s in each row.

### Example Analysis

Let's consider some example grids:

- **Square:**
  ```
  111
  111
  111
  ```
  - Counts: `[3, 3, 3]`
  - Output: `SQUARE` (correct)

- **Triangle:**
  ```
  111
  11111
  1111111
  ```
  - Counts: `[3, 5, 7]`
  - Output: `TRIANGLE` (incorrect, should be `TRIANGLE` but the program might misidentify it as `SQUARE` if it doesn't account for the pattern correctly)

### Conclusion

The program fails to correctly identify triangles because it only checks if all counts are the same, which is insufficient for identifying the specific patterns of triangles and squares.

### Correctness

Given the issues identified, the program is **Incorrect**.

**Correctness: **False**
