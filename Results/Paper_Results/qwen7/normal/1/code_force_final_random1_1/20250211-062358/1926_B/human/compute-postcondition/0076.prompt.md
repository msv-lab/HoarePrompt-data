You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10; the grid is represented as a list of n strings, each string contains n characters which are either '0' or '1', and the grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all the '1's in the grid.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        k = []
        
        for _ in range(int(input())):
            b = input()
            if '1' in b:
                k.append(b.count('1'))
        
        if k[0] == k[1]:
            print('SQUARE')
        else:
            print('TRIANGLE')
        
    #State: After all iterations, `k` is a list containing the total count of '1's across all input strings provided during the loop executions. If the first element of `k` is equal to the second element of `k`, the condition inside the if block is true, and 'SQUARE' is printed for each iteration. Otherwise, the condition inside the else block is executed, and 'TRIANGLE' is printed for each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a grid represented as a list of n strings, where each string contains n characters ('0' or '1'), and identifies whether the grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that includes all '1's. It returns 'triangle' if a single triangle is found, 'square' if a single square is found, and an error message if neither shape is identified or if multiple shapes are present.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
