State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `a` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ a ≤ 10, `i` is 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variables `i` and `a`.
2. For the loop to execute, `a` must be a positive integer and should be within the specified range (2 ≤ a ≤ 10).
3. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 before the loop starts.
4. The variable `t` is not directly involved in the loop condition or initialization, so it does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `a` to ensure it is within the range 2 to 10, and `i` to be initialized to 0.
