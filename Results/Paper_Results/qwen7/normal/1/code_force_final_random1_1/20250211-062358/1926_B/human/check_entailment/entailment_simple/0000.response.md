Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Grid Representation**: For each test case, the program reads the size `n` and the grid itself, storing the counts of '1's in each row in the list `k`.
3. **Triangle vs Square Check**: 
   - The program checks if the first two counts of '1's in the grid (`k[0]` and `k[1]`) are equal.
   - If they are equal, it prints "SQUARE".
   - Otherwise, it prints "TRIANGLE".

However, this approach has a flaw:
- The logic assumes that the first two counts of '1's will be sufficient to determine whether the shape is a square or a triangle. This is not always accurate because:
  - For a square, the count of '1's in each row should be the same.
  - For a triangle, the count of '1's in each row increases linearly (e.g., 1, 3, 5, ...).

To correctly identify the shape, we need to check the pattern of '1's more thoroughly:
- For a square, every row should have the same number of '1's.
- For a triangle, the number of '1's in each row should follow the pattern of odd numbers starting from 1 (1, 3, 5, ...).

Given the current logic, it will only work correctly for some specific cases but not for general cases of squares and triangles.

Therefore, the provided solution does not correctly identify the shapes in all possible cases.

Correctness: **False**
