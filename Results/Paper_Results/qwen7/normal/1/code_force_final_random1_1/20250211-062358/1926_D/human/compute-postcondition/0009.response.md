Output State: **`a` must have at least one element, `num` is not in `count`, `count[num]` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `count[num] -= 1` decrements the value of `count[num]` by 1. Since `num` was not in `count` before, `count[num]` must have been initialized to a non-zero value (likely 1) to ensure that `a` has at least one element. After decrementing, `count[num]` will now be 0. The conditions that `a` must have at least one element and `num` is not in `count` remain unchanged.
