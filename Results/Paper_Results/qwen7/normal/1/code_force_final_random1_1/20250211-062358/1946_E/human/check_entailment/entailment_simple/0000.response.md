Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases, followed by the details of each test case, including the length of the permutation `n`, the number of prefix maximums `m1`, and the number of suffix maximums `m2`. It also correctly reads the indices of the prefix maximums and suffix maximums.

2. **Edge Cases**: The program checks for edge cases where the last index of prefix maximums does not match the first index of suffix maximums, or where the first index of prefix maximums is not 1, or the last index of suffix maximums is not `n`. If any of these conditions are not met, it prints `0` because no valid permutation exists.

3. **Combination Calculations**: The program uses combination calculations to determine the number of ways to place elements between the prefix and suffix maximums. This is done using the `func_2` function, which internally calls `func_1` to compute combinations modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

4. **Modulo Operation**: All operations involving large numbers are performed modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to handle large values and ensure correctness.

5. **Output**: The program outputs the correct number of permutations for each test case, modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Given the above points, the program appears to follow the correct logic and handles all specified cases appropriately. There are no apparent errors or logical flaws in the provided code.

Correctness: **True**
