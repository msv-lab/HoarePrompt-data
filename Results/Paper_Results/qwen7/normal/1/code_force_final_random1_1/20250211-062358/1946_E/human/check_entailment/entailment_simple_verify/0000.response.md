### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to count the number of permutations of length \( n \) that match given prefix and suffix maximum constraints.
   - A permutation is valid if the elements at the specified indices of prefix and suffix maximums are indeed the maximums in their respective prefixes and suffixes.

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - **Function `func_1`**: Implements the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which is used to find the multiplicative inverse in modular arithmetic. This function is not directly related to solving the permutation problem.
   - **Function `func_2`**: Uses the result from `func_1` to compute the modular multiplicative inverse of a number. Again, this function is not directly related to solving the permutation problem.
   - **Main Logic**:
     - The main part of the code initializes a list `facts` with factorials up to 200001, which is used to compute combinations.
     - It then processes each test case by checking if the given prefix and suffix maximums are consistent.
     - If they are consistent, it calculates the number of valid permutations using combinations and modular arithmetic.

3. **Key Points**:
   - The code correctly checks if the given prefix and suffix maximums are consistent.
   - It uses the correct combinatorial logic to calculate the number of valid permutations.
   - The use of modular arithmetic ensures that the result fits within the required bounds.

4. **Annotations**:
   - The annotations correctly describe the state transitions and the logic flow of the program.
   - The code accurately implements the logic to count valid permutations based on the given constraints.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided code correctly solves the problem by ensuring the prefix and suffix maximum constraints are met and then calculating the number of valid permutations using combinatorial methods.
   - The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are not directly related to the problem but are used correctly within the context of the solution.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct as it accurately implements the logic to count the number of valid permutations based on the given prefix and suffix maximum constraints.
