### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided code step-by-step.

#### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to determine the number of permutations of length \( n \) that satisfy given prefix and suffix maximum constraints. The prefix maximums are the largest elements in the prefix up to that index, and the suffix maximums are the largest elements in the suffix starting from that index.

#### Provided Code Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function implements the Extended Euclidean Algorithm.
   - It computes the modular multiplicative inverse of `b` modulo `a` and returns a tuple `(c, d)` where `c` is the modular inverse and `d` is the coefficient in BÃ©zout's identity.
   - The function is not directly related to the problem of counting permutations.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function calls `func_1` with the arguments `(a, 1000000007)`.
   - It then uses the result from `func_1` to compute `a * c % 1000000007`, where `c` is the modular inverse of `b` modulo `1000000007`.
   - Again, this function is not directly related to the problem of counting permutations.

Given the problem description and the functions provided, it is clear that the functions `func_1` and `func_2` are not relevant to solving the permutation problem. The original assessment correctly points out that these functions do not contribute to solving the given problem.

However, the original assessment concludes that the program is incorrect without providing a complete implementation of the solution. While the provided functions are not relevant, they might still be part of a larger solution that is not shown here. If we assume that there is a complete solution that uses these functions appropriately, the program could be correct.

Since the original assessment did not provide a complete solution and concluded the program is incorrect based on the provided functions alone, the assessment may be overly strict. We should consider the possibility that a complete solution using these functions might exist.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate in identifying that the provided functions are not relevant to the problem. However, the conclusion that the entire program is incorrect is premature without seeing the full solution. Given the problem complexity and the fact that the provided functions might be part of a larger solution, the program could be correct if the full solution is implemented properly.
