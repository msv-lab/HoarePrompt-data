#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers where a >= b.
def func_1(a, b):
    if (b == 0) :
        return 1, 0
        #The program returns 1 and 0
    #State: a and b are positive integers where a >= b, and b is not equal to 0
    if (a < b) :
        c, d = func_1(b, a)

        #The program returns the second return value of func_1(b, a) and the first return value of func_1(b, a)
    #State: a and b are positive integers where a >= b, and b is not equal to 0, and a is greater than or equal to b
    if (a % b == 0) :
        return 1, -(a // b - 1)
        #The program returns 1 and -(a // b - 1)

    c, d = func_1(b, a % b)
    return d, c - a // b * d
    #The program returns d, which is the result of func_1(b, a % b), and c - a // b * d, where c and d are the results of func_1(b, a % b)
#Overall this is what the function does:This function accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, both positive integers where `a` is greater than or equal to `b`. It returns either 1 and 0, the second return value and the first return value from a recursive call to `func_1(b, a)`, 1 and the result of `-(a // b - 1)`, or the results `d` and `c - a // b * d` from a recursive call to `func_1(b, a % b)` where `c` and `d` are the results of that same recursive call.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is an integer, and b is a tuple containing two integers where the second integer is 1000000007 (10^9 + 7). The function func_1 is assumed to take a tuple as its first argument and an integer as its second argument, and it returns a tuple of two integers.
def func_2(a, b):
    c, d = func_1(b, 1000000007)
    return c * a % 1000000007
    #The program returns the value of c multiplied by a, modulo 1000000007.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts an integer `a` and a tuple `b` containing two integers, where the second integer is 1000000007 (10^9 + 7). It calls another function `func_1` with the tuple `b` and the integer 1000000007, then returns the product of the first returned integer from `func_1` and `a`, modulo 1000000007.
