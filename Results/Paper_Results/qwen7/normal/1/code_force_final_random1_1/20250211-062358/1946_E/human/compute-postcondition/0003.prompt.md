You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is an integer, and b is a tuple containing two integers where the second integer is 1000000007 (10^9 + 7). The function func_1 is assumed to take a tuple as its first argument and an integer as its second argument, and it returns a tuple of two integers.
def func_2(a, b):
    c, d = func_1(b, 1000000007)
    return c * a % 1000000007
    #The program returns the value of c multiplied by a, modulo 1000000007.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: an integer `a` and a tuple `b` containing two integers, where the second integer is 1000000007 (10^9 + 7). It returns a tuple of two integers, where the first integer is the result of multiplying the first element of the tuple `b` by `a` and taking the result modulo 1000000007.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the value of c multiplied by a, modulo 1000000007.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
