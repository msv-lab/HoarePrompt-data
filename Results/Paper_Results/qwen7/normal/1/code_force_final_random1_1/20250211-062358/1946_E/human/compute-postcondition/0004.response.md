Output State: **`a` is a positive integer where `a` is less than `b`, `b` is a positive integer not equal to 0, `c` is the result of `func_1(b, a)`'s first return value, and `d` is the result of `func_1(b, a)`'s second return value.**

This means that the function `func_1(b, a)` was called with `b` and `a` as arguments, and it returned two values which were assigned to `c` and `d` respectively. The initial conditions for `a` and `b` remain unchanged, but now `c` and `d` hold the values returned by `func_1(b, a)`.
