This function accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, both positive integers where `a` is greater than or equal to `b`. It returns either 1 and 0, the second return value and the first return value from a recursive call to `func_1(b, a)`, 1 and the result of `-(a // b - 1)`, or the results `d` and `c - a // b * d` from a recursive call to `func_1(b, a % b)` where `c` and `d` are the results of that same recursive call.
