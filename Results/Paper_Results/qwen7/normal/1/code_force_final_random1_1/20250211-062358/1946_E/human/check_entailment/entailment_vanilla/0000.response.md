Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the number of permutations of length `n` that satisfy given conditions about prefix and suffix maximums.
   - The solution involves combinatorial counting, which can be complex due to the constraints and the need for modular arithmetic.

2. **Functions Provided**:
   - **func_1(a, b)**: This function appears to implement the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which finds the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers and the coefficients of BÃ©zout's identity.
   - **func_2(a, b)**: This function uses `func_1` to compute the modular multiplicative inverse of `a` modulo `b`. It returns \(a^{-1} \mod b\).

3. **Relevance to the Problem**:
   - The problem requires counting permutations under specific conditions. Typically, such problems involve combinatorial counting and modular arithmetic.
   - The functions provided (`func_1` and `func_2`) are standard tools for dealing with modular arithmetic but do not directly address the core combinatorial logic required to solve the problem.

4. **Core Logic Required**:
   - To solve the problem, one would typically need to:
     - Identify the positions of prefix and suffix maximums.
     - Use these positions to count the valid permutations.
     - Apply combinatorial principles and possibly dynamic programming or other advanced techniques.

5. **Given Functions' Role**:
   - The functions provided are useful for modular arithmetic operations but do not contain the logic needed to solve the permutation counting problem.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided functions (`func_1` and `func_2`) are not sufficient to solve the given problem. They do not contain the necessary logic to handle the combinatorial aspects of the problem.

### Final Answer

**Correctness: False**

The provided program does not contain the necessary logic to solve the given problem. While the functions `func_1` and `func_2` are useful for modular arithmetic, they do not address the core combinatorial counting required to determine the number of valid permutations.
