### Reasoning

The original assessment is accurate in identifying that the provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` are not relevant to solving the problem of counting permutations based on prefix and suffix maximums. These functions deal with modular arithmetic and finding modular inverses, which are not directly applicable to the combinatorial problem at hand.

To further validate this, let's break down the core requirements and the actual logic needed to solve the problem:

1. **Understanding the Constraints**:
   - Prefix maximums and suffix maximums impose strict constraints on the positions of the largest elements in the permutation.
   - Each segment between consecutive prefix or suffix maximums must contain elements that are smaller than the maximums at the boundaries of the segment.

2. **Combinatorial Approach**:
   - For each segment between two consecutive prefix or suffix maximums, we need to count the number of ways to arrange the remaining elements such that they satisfy the constraints.
   - This involves calculating factorials and combinations, which are not handled by the given functions.

3. **Algorithmic Steps**:
   - Identify the segments between consecutive prefix and suffix maximums.
   - For each segment, calculate the number of valid permutations using combinatorial methods.
   - Multiply the results of these calculations to get the total number of valid permutations.

Since the provided functions do not contribute to solving the combinatorial problem and the original assessment correctly identifies this, the assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**

The given program is not correct for solving the problem as stated because it does not provide the necessary combinatorial logic to count permutations based on the given constraints.
