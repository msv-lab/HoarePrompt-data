Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to count the number of permutations of length \( n \) that match the given prefix and suffix maximums.
   - The prefix maximums and suffix maximums are given as ordered lists of indices.
   - The result should be modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

2. **Given Functions**:
   - `func_1(a, b)`: This function seems to implement the Extended Euclidean Algorithm (EEA) to find the modular multiplicative inverse of `b` modulo `a`.
   - `func_2(a, b)`: This function uses the result of `func_1` to compute \( a \mod (10^9 + 7) \).

3. **Relevance to the Problem**:
   - The problem requires counting permutations, which involves combinatorial logic rather than direct modular arithmetic.
   - The functions provided do not seem to directly address the core problem of counting permutations based on prefix and suffix maximums.

4. **Core Logic**:
   - To solve the problem, we need to understand how the prefix and suffix maximums constrain the permutation.
   - For each segment between two consecutive prefix maximums or suffix maximums, we need to count the valid permutations.
   - The constraints imposed by the maximums significantly reduce the number of possible permutations.

5. **Algorithmic Approach**:
   - Identify segments between consecutive prefix and suffix maximums.
   - Count the permutations within these segments while respecting the constraints.
   - Use combinatorial methods to count valid permutations.

### Conclusion

The given functions `func_1` and `func_2` are not relevant to solving the problem of counting permutations based on prefix and suffix maximums. They are related to modular arithmetic but do not provide the necessary logic to solve the problem.

Therefore, the given program is not correct for solving the problem as stated.

**Correctness: **False**
