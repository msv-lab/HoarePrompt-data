Output State: **The program returns d, which is the result of func_1(b, a % b), and c - a // b * d, where c and d are the results of func_1(b, a % b)**

Given the initial state:
- `a` and `b` are positive integers where `a >= b`, `b != 0`, and `a` is not divisible by `b`.
- `c` and `d` are the results of `func_1(b, a % b)`.

The code returns two values:
1. `d`, which is the second return value of `func_1(b, a % b)`.
2. `c - a // b * d`, which is calculated using the values of `c` and `d` from `func_1(b, a % b)` and the integer division of `a` by `b`.

Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the function's return values and the operations performed on them.
