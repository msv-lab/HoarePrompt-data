Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly calculates the year in which all \( n \) signs will occur according to the rules described in the problem statement. Here's a brief explanation of why the program works as expected:

1. **Initialization**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Reading Input**: For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the periodicities of the signs `a`.
3. **Calculating Year**: It initializes `year` to 0. For each periodicity `ai`, it updates `year` by adding the smallest value between `year % ai` and `ai`. This ensures that `year` is always a multiple of the current periodicity `ai` and moves forward to the next required year.
4. **Output**: Finally, it prints the calculated year for each test case.

This approach ensures that the program correctly computes the year when all signs will occur sequentially, following the rules specified in the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.
