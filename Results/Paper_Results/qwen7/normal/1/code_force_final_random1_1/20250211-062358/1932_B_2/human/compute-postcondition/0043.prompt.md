You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a_1, a_2, ..., a_n are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        year = 0
        
        for ai in a:
            year += year % ai or ai
        
        print(year)
        
    #State: Output State: The list `a` is empty, `year` is the sum of all elements in the original list `a`, and `n` is the original input integer.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `a` will be empty because all elements have been processed. The variable `year` will hold the cumulative sum of all elements in the original list `a`, as each element `ai` in `a` contributed to `year` in each iteration. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of sub-cases, followed by t pairs of integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list of n positive integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6). For each sub-case, it returns information based on the values of n and the list a_i.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
