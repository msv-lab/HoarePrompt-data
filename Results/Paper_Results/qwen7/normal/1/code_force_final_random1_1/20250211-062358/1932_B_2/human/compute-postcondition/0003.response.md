Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into a list of strings using whitespace as the delimiter, and then converts each string in the list to an integer. The resulting list of integers is assigned to the variable `a`. The conditions for `t` and the type of `n` remain unchanged.
