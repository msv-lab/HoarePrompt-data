Given the initial state where the list `a` is empty, let's analyze the code snippet step by step:

1. **List `a`**: The list `a` is empty. Therefore, there are no elements in `a` to process in the summation operation.
2. **Variable `year`**: The expression `year + year % ai` is evaluated for each `ai` in `a`. Since `a` is empty, there are no elements to iterate over. This means the expression inside the loop never gets executed.
3. **Variable `n`**: The variable `n` remains unchanged because it is not affected by the loop.

Since the list `a` is empty and there are no elements to process, the expression `year + year % ai` does not get evaluated, and thus `year` remains its initial value, which is typically `0` if not initialized otherwise.

Therefore, the print statement `print(year)` will output the value of `year`, which is `0`.

Output: **0**
