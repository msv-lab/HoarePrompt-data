Postcondition: `a` contains at least one element. If there exists an element `ai` in the list `a` such that `current_year % ai == 0`, then `next_year` is equal to the current year plus the first occurrence of such `ai`. Otherwise, `next_year` is calculated as `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai` for the smallest `ai` in `a` where `current_year % ai == 0`.
