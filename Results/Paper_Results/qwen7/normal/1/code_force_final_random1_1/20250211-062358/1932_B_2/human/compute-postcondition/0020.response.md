Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for ai in a`. The variables involved in the loop head are `ai` and `a`.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` is a non-empty list of integers.
   - `year` is incremented by `year % ai` or `ai`.

3. **Understand the loop execution**:
   - The loop iterates over each element `ai` in the list `a`.
   - During each iteration, `year` is updated based on the value of `ai`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `a` is a list, and it is non-empty, the next iteration will take the next element from the list `a`.
   - Let's denote the current element being processed as `ai_current`, and the next element as `ai_next`.
   - After processing the current element `ai_current`, the next element `ai_next` will be the one that starts the next iteration.

5. **Determine the new state**:
   - `a` will still be a non-empty list of integers, but it will have one less element because the current element `ai_current` has been processed.
   - `year` will be updated based on the current `ai_current`.

Since the exact value of `ai_current` is not given, we can represent it symbolically. However, we know that `a` will have one less element, and `year` will be updated accordingly.

**Final State**:
- `a` is a non-empty list of integers (with one less element than before).
- `year` is updated based on the current `ai_current`.

Given the symbolic nature of the current element `ai_current`, we can represent the state as follows:

**State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers (with one less element), `year` is incremented by `year % ai_current` or `ai_current`**.
