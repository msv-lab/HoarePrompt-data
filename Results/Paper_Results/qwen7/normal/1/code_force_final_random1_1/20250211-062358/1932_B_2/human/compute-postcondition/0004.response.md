Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `year` is 0**.

Explanation: The code simply assigns the value `0` to the variable `year`. It does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `a`. Therefore, the precondition for `t` being greater than 0 and `n` being an input integer, along with `a` being a list of integers, remains unchanged. The only new information is that `year` is now `0`.
