You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and test_cases is a list of test case descriptions. Each test case description is a tuple containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6).
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test in test_cases:
        n, a = test
        
        current_year = 0
        
        for ai in a:
            if current_year % ai == 0:
                next_year = current_year + ai
            else:
                next_year = (current_year // ai + 1) * ai
            current_year = next_year
        
        results.append(current_year)
        
    #State: `results` is a list containing the sequence of `current_year` values calculated during each iteration of the loop for all test cases, and `current_year` is the final value calculated for the last test case.
    return results
    #The program returns a list `results` containing the sequence of `current_year` values calculated during each iteration of the loop for all test cases, and the last element of this list is the final value of `current_year` calculated for the last test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: `t`, a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and `test_cases`, a list of tuples. Each tuple contains an integer `n` (between 1 and 100) and a list of `n` integers (each between 1 and 10^6). For each test case, the function calculates a sequence of `current_year` values and returns a list of these sequences, with the final value being the last `current_year` calculated.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list `results` containing the sequence of `current_year` values calculated during each iteration of the loop for all test cases, and the last element of this list is the final value of `current_year` calculated for the last test case.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
