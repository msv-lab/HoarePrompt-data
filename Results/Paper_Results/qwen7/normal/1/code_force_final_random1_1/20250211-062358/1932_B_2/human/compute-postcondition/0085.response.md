Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `t` and a list of test case descriptions `test_cases`. For each test case, it calculates a sequence of `current_year` values based on certain conditions involving the elements in the test case list. It returns a list of these sequences, where each sequence corresponds to one test case, and the final value in the returned list is the `current_year` calculated for the last test case.**
