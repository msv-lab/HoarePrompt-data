Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `ai in a`. The relevant variables here are `ai` and `a`.

2. **Understand the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in `a` that satisfy the condition specified in the loop head.

3. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `current_year` is equal to `next_year`.
   - `next_year` is either equal to `current_year + ai` if `current_year % ai == 0`, or equal to `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai` otherwise.
   - `a` contains at least one element.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `ai` in `a`, the variable `ai` will change in each iteration.
   - The variable `a` will lose one element after each iteration because `ai` is taken out of `a` and used in the loop.
   - The variables `current_year` and `next_year` are not directly modified by the loop head but depend on the value of `ai` and the current state of `current_year`.

5. **Determine the New State**:
   - After the previous iteration, `a` must contain at least one element (since it contained at least one element before the loop started).
   - For the loop to continue, `a` must still contain at least one element.
   - Therefore, `a` will have one less element than it did at the start of the previous iteration.

Given these points, the new state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `a` now contains one less element than it did previously.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`current_year` is equal to `next_year`, `next_year` is either equal to `current_year + ai` if `current_year % ai == 0`, or equal to `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai` otherwise, `a` must contain at least one element (one less than it did at the start of the previous iteration)**.
