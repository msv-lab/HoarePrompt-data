Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `current_year` is equal to `next_year`.
- `a` contains at least one element.

### Loop Head
```
for ai in a:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Loop Body Analysis
The loop body checks if there exists an element `ai` in the list `a` such that `current_year % ai == 0`. If such an `ai` is found, it updates `next_year` to `current_year + ai`. Otherwise, it calculates `next_year` as `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai` for the smallest `ai` in `a` where `current_year % ai == 0`.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Initial Values:**
   - `current_year` is equal to `next_year`.
   - `a` contains at least one element.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over each element `ai` in the list `a`.
   - For each `ai`, it checks if `current_year % ai == 0`.
     - If true, it updates `next_year` to `current_year + ai`.
     - If false, it calculates `next_year` as `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai` for the smallest `ai` in `a` where `current_year % ai == 0`.

3. **Adjusting States:**
   - The only variables in the loop head are `ai`, `current_year`, and `next_year`.
   - After the loop, `current_year` might change based on the conditions inside the loop.
   - `next_year` will be updated based on the conditions inside the loop.
   - `a` remains unchanged since it is not modified within the loop.

### Updated State at the Start of the Next Iteration
- Since the loop is about to execute again, `current_year` will be the new value of `next_year` from the previous iteration.
- `a` remains the same as it was before the loop started.

Given the above reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`current_year` is the new value of `next_year` from the previous iteration, `next_year` is equal to `current_year`, `a` contains at least one element.**
