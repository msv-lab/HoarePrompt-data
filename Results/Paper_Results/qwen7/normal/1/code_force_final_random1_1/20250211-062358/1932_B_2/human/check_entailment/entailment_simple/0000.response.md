Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the periodicities `a_i`.
3. It initializes `year` to 0.
4. In the loop, it iterates over each periodicity `ai` and updates `year` using the formula `year += year % ai or ai`. This formula ensures that `year` is always a multiple of `ai` after processing each `ai`, effectively simulating the waiting period for each sign to occur sequentially.
5. After processing all periodicities, it prints the final value of `year`.

Given the logic, the program correctly calculates the year in which all signs will occur sequentially according to the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
