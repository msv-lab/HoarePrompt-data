Output: **0 (since the list `a` is empty, the sum of all elements in the original list `a` is 0)**

Explanation:
- Initially, the list `a` is empty.
- The variable `year` is defined as the sum of all elements in the original list `a`. Since `a` is empty, there are no elements to sum, so `year` starts as 0.
- The print statement outputs the value of `year`, which remains 0 after the list `a` becomes empty.
