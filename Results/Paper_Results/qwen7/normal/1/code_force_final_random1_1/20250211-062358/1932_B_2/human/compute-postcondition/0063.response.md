Output State: **`a` contains at least one element, and there is no element `ai` in the list `a` such that `current_year % ai == 0`; `next_year` is calculated as `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai` for the smallest `ai` in `a` where `current_year % ai == 0`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `next_year` as `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai` for the smallest `ai` in the list `a` where `current_year % ai == 0`. Since `a` must contain at least one element and no element `ai` in `a` satisfies `current_year % ai == 0`, the calculation for `next_year` is based on the smallest `ai` that would satisfy the condition if it existed, but since it doesn't, the precondition remains unchanged.
