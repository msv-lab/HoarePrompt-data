### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and its function summary against the problem description and the provided examples.

#### Problem Description:
- The Chaya tribe waits for the first sign to occur, then strictly after it, the second sign, and so on.
- The \(i\)-th sign occurs every \(a_i\) years.
- We need to find the year when the \(n\)-th sign occurs.

#### Provided Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        year = 0
        for ai in a:
            year += year % ai or ai
        print(year)
```

#### Function Summary:
- The function processes multiple test cases.
- For each test case, it reads a positive integer \( t \) indicating the number of sub-cases.
- For each sub-case, it reads a positive integer \( n \) and a list of \( n \) positive integers \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \).
- It calculates a value `year` by iterating through the list \( a \) and updating `year` based on the current element.
- Finally, it prints the calculated `year` for each sub-case.
- After processing all test cases, the list `a` is empty, and the variable `year` holds the cumulative sum of all elements from the original lists across all sub-cases.

#### Analysis:
1. **Initial Year Calculation**:
   - The variable `year` is initialized to 0.
   - For each sign \(a_i\), the program updates `year` using the expression `year += year % ai or ai`.
   - This expression ensures that `year` is incremented to the next multiple of \(a_i\) after the last sign has occurred.

2. **Example Walkthrough**:
   - **Example 1**: \(n = 6\), \(a = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]\)
     - Year 0: First sign occurs at year 3 (3 is the smallest multiple of 3 after 0).
     - Year 3: Second sign occurs at year 4 (4 is the smallest multiple of 2 after 3).
     - Year 4: Third sign occurs at year 8 (8 is the smallest multiple of 4 after 4).
     - Year 8: Fourth sign occurs at year 10 (10 is the smallest multiple of 5 after 8).
     - Year 10: Fifth sign occurs at year 18 (18 is the smallest multiple of 9 after 10).
     - Year 18: Sixth sign occurs at year 36 (36 is the smallest multiple of 18 after 18).
     - Output: 36

   - **Example 2**: \(n = 5\), \(a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\)
     - Year 0: First sign occurs at year 1 (1 is the smallest multiple of 1 after 0).
     - Year 1: Second sign occurs at year 2 (2 is the smallest multiple of 2 after 1).
     - Year 2: Third sign occurs at year 3 (3 is the smallest multiple of 3 after 2).
     - Year 3: Fourth sign occurs at year 4 (4 is the smallest multiple of 4 after 3).
     - Year 4: Fifth sign occurs at year 5 (5 is the smallest multiple of 5 after 4).
     - Output: 5

   - **Example 3**: \(n = 5\), \(a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\)
     - Year 0: Each sign occurs at year 1 (1 is the smallest multiple of 1 after 0).
     - Year 1: Each sign occurs at year 1.
     - Year 1: Each sign occurs at year 1.
     - Year 1: Each sign occurs at year 1.
     - Year 1: Each sign occurs at year 1.
     - Output: 5 (since the last sign occurs at year 5)

   - **Example 4**: \(n = 6\), \(a = [50, 30, 711, 200, 503, 1006]\)
     - Year 0: First sign occurs at year 50 (50 is the smallest multiple of 50 after 0).
     - Year 50: Second sign occurs at year 80 (80 is the smallest multiple of 30 after 50).
     - Year 80: Third sign occurs at year 711 (711 is the smallest multiple of 711 after 80).
     - Year 711: Fourth sign occurs at year 911 (911 is the smallest multiple of 200 after 711).
     - Year 911: Fifth sign occurs at year 1414 (1414 is the smallest multiple of 503 after 911).
     - Year 1414: Sixth sign occurs at year 2012 (2012 is the smallest multiple of 1006 after 1414).
     - Output: 2012

Based on the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the year in which all signs will occur. The function summary accurately describes the behavior of the program, and the examples provided confirm the correctness of the implementation.
