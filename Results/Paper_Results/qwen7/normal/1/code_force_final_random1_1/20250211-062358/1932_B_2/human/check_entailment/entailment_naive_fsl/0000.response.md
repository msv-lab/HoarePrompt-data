Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the year in which all signs will occur according to the given rules. For each test case, it iterates through the periodicities of the signs and updates the year accordingly. The logic `year += year % ai or ai` ensures that the year is incremented to the next multiple of `ai` after the last sign has occurred. This approach correctly handles the sequential occurrence of signs and ensures that the year is updated to the next required multiple for each sign. Given the examples and the problem description, the program works correctly for all potential cases.
