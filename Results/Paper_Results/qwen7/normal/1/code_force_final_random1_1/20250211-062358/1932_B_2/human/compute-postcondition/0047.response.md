Output State: **`current_year` is equal to `next_year - ai`, and `next_year` is equal to `current_year + ai`.**

Explanation: The code `next_year = current_year + ai` updates the value of `next_year` to be `current_year + ai`. Given the initial state where `next_year` is either `current_year + ai` or `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`, and considering the condition `current_year % ai == 0`, the value of `next_year` is now explicitly defined as `current_year + ai`. Therefore, `current_year` is now equal to `next_year - ai`.
