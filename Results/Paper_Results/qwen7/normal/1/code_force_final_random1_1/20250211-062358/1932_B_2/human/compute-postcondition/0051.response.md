Output State: **`current_year` is equal to `next_year`**

Explanation: The code `current_year = next_year` simply assigns the value of `next_year` to `current_year`. Given the initial conditions, if `current_year` is divisible by `ai`, then `next_year` is equal to `current_year + ai`. Otherwise, `next_year` is equal to `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`. After the assignment, `current_year` now holds the same value as `next_year`, maintaining the initial condition.
