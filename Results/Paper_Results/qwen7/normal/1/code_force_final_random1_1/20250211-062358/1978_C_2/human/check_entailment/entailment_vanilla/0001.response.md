Let's analyze the given code step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the input values `n` and `k`.
   - It checks if `k` is odd; if so, it returns `(0, 0)` because an even Manhattan value is required.
   - It calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value (`max_k`) for a permutation of length `n`. 
     - If `n` is odd, `max_k = (n^2 - 1) / 2`.
     - If `n` is even, `max_k = n^2 / 2`.
   - If `max_k` is less than `k`, it returns `(0, 0)` indicating no solution exists.
   - Otherwise, it returns `(n, k)`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function attempts to construct a permutation that meets the Manhattan value requirement.
   - It initializes a list `l` with numbers from 1 to `n`.
   - It iteratively modifies the list to achieve the desired Manhattan value.
   - The logic seems to be flawed because it doesn't correctly handle the insertion of elements to achieve the required Manhattan value.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function prints "YES" followed by the constructed permutation.
   - It takes a list `l` as input and prints each element separated by spaces.

4. **Function `func_4`**:
   - This function orchestrates the process by calling `func_2` and `func_1` to solve the problem.
   - If `func_2` returns `(0, 0)`, it prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it calls `func_1` and `func_3` to generate and print the permutation.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The logic for constructing the permutation is incorrect. It does not guarantee that the resulting permutation will have the exact Manhattan value `k`.
   - The approach of simply shifting elements might not work for all cases and does not ensure the correct Manhattan value.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The calculation of `max_k` is correct.
   - However, the check `if max_k < k:` is sufficient but not comprehensive. It should also consider if `k` is achievable with the given `n`.

3. **Overall Logic**:
   - The overall structure of the functions is somewhat disjointed and does not provide a clear path to solving the problem effectively.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, especially in `func_1`, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: False**
