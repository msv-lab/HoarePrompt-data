Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` remains unchanged, `k` is `k - (n - 2) + 1`, `c` is increased by 2, `l` is the return value of `func_3(c, l)`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `l` by calling the function `func_3(c, l)`. The values of `i`, `n`, `k`, and `c` remain unchanged from their previous states. After executing the line `l = func_3(c, l)`, `l` now holds the return value of the function call `func_3(c, l)`.
