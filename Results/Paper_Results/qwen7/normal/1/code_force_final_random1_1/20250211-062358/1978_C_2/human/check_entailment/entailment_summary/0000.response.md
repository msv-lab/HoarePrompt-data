### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_4`**: This function checks if \( k \) is odd when \( n \) is odd and calculates the maximum possible value of \( k \) based on \( n \). It ensures that \( k \) is within a feasible range for a given \( n \). If \( k \) exceeds the maximum possible value, it returns (0, 0), indicating no solution exists.

2. **Function `func_1`**: This function processes \( n \) and \( k \) to generate a permutation whose Manhattan value is \( k \). It uses helper functions `func_2` and `func_3` to perform specific swaps in the list. The logic seems to involve reducing \( k \) by swapping elements in a way that minimizes the overall Manhattan distance.

3. **Function `func_2`**: This function swaps two elements in the list based on the values of \( c \) and \( k \). It ensures that the list remains a valid permutation.

4. **Function `func_3`**: This function swaps two elements in the list based on the value of \( c \). It ensures that the list remains a valid permutation.

5. **Function `func_5`**: This function prints "YES" followed by the elements of the list `l` and then prints an empty tuple. It ensures that the list `l` is a valid permutation and meets the required Manhattan value.

6. **Function `func_6`**: This function orchestrates the process by calling `func_4` to get \( n \) and \( k \), then calls `func_1` to generate the permutation, and finally calls `func_5` to print the result. If \( n \) is 0, it prints "NO".

### Verification:

- **Edge Cases**:
  - When \( k \) is odd and \( n \) is odd, `func_4` correctly identifies that no solution exists.
  - When \( k \) exceeds the maximum possible value for a given \( n \), `func_4` correctly identifies that no solution exists.

- **Permutation Generation**:
  - `func_1` uses a series of swaps to reduce \( k \) until it reaches 0. The swaps are designed to minimize the Manhattan distance, ensuring that the generated permutation has the required Manhattan value.

- **Output Format**:
  - `func_5` ensures that the output format is correct and the list `l` is a valid permutation.

Given the execution summaries and the logical flow of the functions, the program correctly handles all edge cases and generates valid permutations with the required Manhattan value.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
