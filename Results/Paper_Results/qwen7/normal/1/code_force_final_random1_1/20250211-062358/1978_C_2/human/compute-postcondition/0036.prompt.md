You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and k is an integer such that 0 <= k <= 10^12.
def func_1(n, k):
    k = k // 2
    l = list(range(1, n + 1))
    c = 0
    for i in range(n, -1, -2):
        c += 1
        
        if k == 0:
            return l
        
        if k < i - 1:
            return func_2(c, k, l)
        
        k = k - i + 1
        
        l = func_3(c, l)
        
    #State: The loop will continue to decrement `i` by 2 until `i` is no longer less than or equal to 0. At that point, the function `func_2(c, k, l)` will be returned.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters `n` and `k`. It returns `l` which remains unchanged from its initial state, or it returns the result of calling `func_2(c, k, l)` with updated values of `c` and `k`, or it returns the value of `l` which is the return value of `func_3(c, l)` with updated values of `c`, or it returns the value of `l` which is the result of `func_2(c, k, l)` with further updated values of `c` and `k`, or it returns the value of `l` which is the return value of `func_3(c, l)` with updated values of `c`, or it returns the value of `l` which is the result of `func_2(c, k, l)` with further updated values of `c` and `k` if `k` equals 0.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns l which remains unchanged from its initial state.

Case_2: The program returns the result of calling `func_2(c, k, l)`, where `c` is increased by 1 from its original value, `k` is less than `i - 1`, and `i` is `n`. The variables `n`, `k`, and `l` remain unchanged.

Case_3: The program returns the value of `l`, which is the return value of `func_3(c, l)`. Here, `c` is increased by 2 from its initial value of `i = n - 2`, and `l` is the result of the function call `func_3(c, l)` with the updated value of `c`.

Case_4: The program returns the value of l, which is the return value of func_2(c, k, l), where c is increased by 2 from its original value, k is k - n + 1, and l is the return value of func_3(c, l)

Case_5: The program returns the value of 'l', which is the return value of `func_3(c, l)` where `c` is `c + 3` and `l` is the initial value of `i` adjusted by the function `func_3`.

Case_6: The program returns the value of `l`, which is the result of `func_2(c, k, l)` where `c` is `c + 3`, `k` is `k - (n - 4) + 1`, and `l` is the return value of `func_3(c, l)` if `k` equals 0.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
