To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze each function and how they work together to solve the problem.

### Function Analysis

1. **func_1(n, k):**
   - This function aims to construct a permutation with a specific Manhattan value `k`.
   - It initializes a list `l` with numbers from 1 to `n`.
   - It then iteratively modifies this list to achieve the desired Manhattan value.
   - The logic seems to be trying to place the largest elements at the beginning and the smallest at the end to maximize the differences, which could help in achieving the target Manhattan value.

2. **func_2():**
   - This function checks if a given `k` can be achieved for a permutation of length `n`.
   - It returns `(0, 0)` if `k` is odd or if `k` exceeds the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n`.
   - If `k` is even and within bounds, it returns `(n, k)`.

3. **func_3(l):**
   - This function prints "YES" followed by the permutation `l`.
   - It then returns without further action.

4. **func_4():**
   - This function orchestrates the entire process.
   - It first calls `func_2()` to check if a solution exists.
   - If a solution does not exist (`n == 0`), it prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it calls `func_1(n, k)` to generate the permutation and then calls `func_3()` to print it.

### Reasoning

1. **func_1(n, k):**
   - The logic in `func_1` is flawed. It attempts to directly manipulate the list to achieve the desired Manhattan value, but it doesn't correctly handle the placement of elements to achieve the exact Manhattan value.
   - For example, it might not correctly place elements to ensure the exact Manhattan value is achieved, especially for larger values of `n` and `k`.

2. **func_2():**
   - This function correctly identifies whether a solution is possible based on the parity of `k` and the maximum possible Manhattan value.
   - However, it doesn't provide a direct way to construct the permutation if `k` is even and within bounds.

3. **func_3(l):**
   - This function correctly prints the permutation if one is found.

4. **func_4():**
   - This function correctly handles the overall flow but relies on `func_1` to generate the permutation, which is incorrect as explained above.

### Conclusion

Given the flaws in `func_1`, the overall program will not correctly generate permutations with the desired Manhattan values for all test cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
