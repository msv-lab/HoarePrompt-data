Output State: **`i` is `n-5`, `k` is `k - 2n + 5`, `x` is the second last element of list `l`, the first element of list `l` is the second last element of list `l` before the insertion, and the second element of list `l` is the original third last element of list `l`.**

Explanation: The code `l.insert(0, x)` inserts the value of `x` at the beginning of list `l`. Here, `x` is the second last element of list `l` before the insertion. Therefore, the first element of list `l` becomes the second last element of list `l` before the insertion, and the second element of list `l` remains the original third last element of list `l`. All other variables (`i` and `k`) remain unchanged.
