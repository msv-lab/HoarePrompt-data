### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_4()`**:
   - This function checks if `k` is even when `n` is odd, and ensures that `k` does not exceed the maximum possible Manhattan value for the given `n`.
   - It correctly handles the edge case where `k` is odd when `n` is odd by returning `(0, 0)`, indicating no valid permutation exists.
   - It calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value (`max_k`) correctly for both even and odd `n`.

2. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - This function attempts to construct a permutation with the desired Manhattan value.
   - It iteratively constructs the permutation by swapping elements to achieve the required Manhattan value.
   - The logic seems to handle the construction process correctly, especially when `k` is even and `n` is even or odd.

3. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - This function swaps two elements in the list to adjust the Manhattan value.
   - The swaps are performed correctly, ensuring that the Manhattan value is adjusted as needed.

4. **Function `func_3()`**:
   - This function swaps two elements in the list to adjust the Manhattan value.
   - The swaps are performed correctly, ensuring that the Manhattan value is adjusted as needed.

5. **Function `func_5()`**:
   - This function prints the permutation and returns `None`.
   - It correctly prints the permutation in the required format.

6. **Function `func_6()`**:
   - This function orchestrates the entire process.
   - It calls `func_4()` to get initial values.
   - It calls `func_1()` to construct the permutation.
   - It calls `func_5()` to print the permutation.
   - The flow of control and the handling of edge cases are correct.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the edge cases where `k` is odd when `n` is odd.
- The construction of the permutation in `func_1()` seems to follow the logic to achieve the desired Manhattan value.
- The swapping functions (`func_2()` and `func_3()`) are implemented correctly to adjust the Manhattan value.
- The overall structure of the program is logically sound and follows the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description and the execution states.

### Response:
