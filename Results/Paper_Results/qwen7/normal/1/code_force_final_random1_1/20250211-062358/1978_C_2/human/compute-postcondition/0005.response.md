Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer between 0 and 10^12, `l` is the result of `func_1(n, k)`**.

The function `func_1(n, k)` is called with the values of `n` and `k`, and the result is assigned to the variable `l`. Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the specific value of `l`. However, we know that `l` is the result of the function call with the given parameters. The initial conditions for `n` and `k` remain unchanged.
