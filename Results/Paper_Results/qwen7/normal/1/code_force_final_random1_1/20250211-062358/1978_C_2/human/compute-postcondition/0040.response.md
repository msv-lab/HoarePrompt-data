Output State: **The program returns the list `l` which has an additional element inserted at index `-k`, where `k` is `-2n + 6`. The second element of the list `l` is the original third last element of the list `l`, and `i` is `n-4`.**

This means the list `l` will have one extra element added at the position calculated by `-k`, and the second element of the list will be the original third last element of the list. The value of `i` is `n-4`, but since `i` is not directly part of the returned list, it does not affect the final output state of the list `l`.
