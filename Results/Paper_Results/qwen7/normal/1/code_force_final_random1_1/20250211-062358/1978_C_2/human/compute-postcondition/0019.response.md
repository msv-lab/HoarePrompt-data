Output State: **The program returns the value of l, which is the return value of func_2(c, k, l), where c is increased by 2 from its original value, k is k - n + 1, and l is the return value of func_3(c, l)**.

This means that the function `func_2` is called with parameters `c`, `k`, and `l`. The value of `c` has been increased by 2, `k` has been adjusted according to `k - n + 1`, and `l` is the result of calling `func_3` with `c` and `l` as arguments. Finally, the result of `func_2` is returned.
