- The provided code does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. Specifically, the logic in `func_1` is flawed and does not ensure that the constructed permutation has the correct Manhattan value.
   - The code fails to handle certain edge cases and does not produce a valid permutation in some scenarios.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly construct a permutation with the desired Manhattan value for all cases.
