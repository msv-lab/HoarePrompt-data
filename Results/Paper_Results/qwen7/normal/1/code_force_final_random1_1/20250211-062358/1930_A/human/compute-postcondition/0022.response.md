Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 3
   - `score` is the original `score` plus `l[3]`
   - `n` must be at least 2

2. **Loop Head Analysis:**
   - The loop is defined as `for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2):`
   - This means `i` starts at 0 and increments by 2 until it reaches `2 * n`.

3. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3.

4. **Condition for Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `2 * n`.
   - Since `i` is currently 3, the next value of `i` would be 5 (since it increments by 2).
   - Therefore, `2 * n` must be greater than 5 for the loop to continue.

5. **Adjusting the State:**
   - `i` will be incremented to 5.
   - `n` must still be at least 2, but now `2 * n` must be greater than 5, meaning `n` must be at least 3.

6. **Final State:**
   - `i` is 5
   - `score` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration (the original `score` plus `l[3]`)
   - `n` must be at least 3

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 5, `score` is the original `score` plus `l[3]`, `n` must be at least 3**
