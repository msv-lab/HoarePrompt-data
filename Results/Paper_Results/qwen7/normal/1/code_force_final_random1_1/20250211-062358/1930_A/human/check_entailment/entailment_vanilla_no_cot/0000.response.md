Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum final score according to the problem statement. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases (`t`), and for each test case, it reads `n` and the list of `2n` integers.
   
2. **Sorting**: It sorts the list of integers. Sorting ensures that when we pair the smallest elements together, we maximize the sum of the minimums of each pair.

3. **Scoring Logic**: For each test case, it iterates over the sorted list in steps of 2, summing up the elements at even indices. This corresponds to pairing the smallest available elements and adding their minimum value to the score.

4. **Output**: Finally, it prints the accumulated score for each test case.

Given these points, the program correctly computes the maximum possible score by always pairing the smallest available elements, which aligns with the optimal strategy for this problem. Therefore, the provided solution is correct.
