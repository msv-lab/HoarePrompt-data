Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is the one used in the `range` function, which is `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the State Adjustments**: The loop will execute as long as `int(input())` is a positive integer. Given the constraints, `t` (which is the input to `int(input())`) must be a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000.

3. **Adjust the State**: Since the loop depends on the value of `t`, we need to ensure that `t` is within the specified range. The other variables (`n` and the `a_i` values) are not directly involved in the loop condition and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` to ensure that it is a positive integer within the given range.

**State:**
**`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000**
