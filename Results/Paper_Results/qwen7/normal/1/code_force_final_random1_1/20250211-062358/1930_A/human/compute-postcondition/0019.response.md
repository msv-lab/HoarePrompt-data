Output State: **`i` is 1, `score` is the original `score` plus `l[0]`**

Explanation: The code `score += l[i]` increments the value of `score` by the value of `l[i]`. Given that `i` is initially 0, the value of `l[0]` is added to `score`. After this operation, `i` is incremented by 1 (assuming `i` is incremented afterward in the loop), making `i` equal to 1. The initial state of `n` being a positive integer is not affected by this line of code.
