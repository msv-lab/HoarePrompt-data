Output State: **`i` is 2 * `n` - 1, `score` is the original `score` plus the sum of elements at indices 0, 2, 4, ..., 2 * (`n` - 1), `l` is a sorted list of integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of space-separated integers from the user, converts each integer to an integer type using `map(int, input().split())`, and then sorts these integers to form the list `l`. The values of `i` and `score` remain unchanged from their initial states.
