Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is a sorted list of integers entered by the user split from a single input string.**

Explanation: The code takes a single line of space-separated integers as input, splits it into a list, converts each element to an integer using `map(int, ...)` and then sorts this list in ascending order. The sorted list is assigned to `l`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it was just an input integer and no further operations were performed on it.
