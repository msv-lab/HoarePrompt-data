Output State: `i` is 2 * n - 1, `score` is the original `score` plus the sum of elements at indices 0, 2, 4, ..., 2 * (n - 1).

In Natural Language: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be set to `2 * n - 1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `score` will be the original value of `score` plus the sum of elements from the list `l` at even indices, specifically `l[0]`, `l[2]`, `l[4]`, and so on, up to `l[2 * (n - 1)]`.
