Output State: **`score` is increased by the value of `l[i + 2]`, `i` is `i + 2`**

Explanation: The code `score += l[i]` increments the value of `score` by the value of `l[i]`. At the same time, `i` is updated to `i + 2`. The initial conditions are that `score` is increased by the value of `l[i]` and `i` is `i + 2`. After executing the code, `score` is further increased by the value of `l[i]`, which now effectively means `l[i + 2]` since `i` was already incremented by 2 before this line of code. The value of `i` is also updated to `i + 2`.
