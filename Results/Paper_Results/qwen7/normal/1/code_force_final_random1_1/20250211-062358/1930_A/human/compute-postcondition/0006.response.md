Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and the constant `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `score` is `l[i]`
   - `n` must be greater than 0

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over `range(0, 2 * n, 2)`. This means `i` starts at 0 and increments by 2 each time until it reaches `2 * n`.

4. **Analyze the state changes**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value (let's call it `i_end_prev`), and `n` was greater than 0.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 2 from its previous value.

5. **Calculate the new value of `i`**:
   - If `i_end_prev` was the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, then the next value of `i` would be `i_end_prev + 2`.

6. **Adjust the state**:
   - `score` remains the same as it is defined as `l[i]` and `i` is changing.
   - `n` must still be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`score` is `l[i_end_prev + 2]`, `n` must be greater than 0** 

Since we don't know the exact value of `i_end_prev`, we express it in terms of the previous state. However, if we assume `i_end_prev` was the last value of `i` before the previous iteration, the next value of `i` would be `i_end_prev + 2`.

Thus, the final state is:

State: **`score` is `l[i + 2]`, `n` must be greater than 0**
