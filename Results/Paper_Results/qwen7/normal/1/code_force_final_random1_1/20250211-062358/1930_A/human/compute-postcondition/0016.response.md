Output State: **`input` is decreased by 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code `l = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, sorts these integers, and assigns the sorted list to `l`. The initial state of `input` being decreased by 1 and `n` being an input integer remains unchanged except for the new variable `l` which now holds the sorted list of integers.
