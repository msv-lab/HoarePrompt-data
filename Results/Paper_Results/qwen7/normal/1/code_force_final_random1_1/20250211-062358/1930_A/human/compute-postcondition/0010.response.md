Output State: **`score` is `l[i + 4] + l[i + 2] + l[i]`, `n` must be greater than 0**

Explanation: The code `score += l[i]` increments the value of `score` by the value of `l[i]`. Initially, `score` was defined as `l[i + 4] + l[i + 2]`. After executing the code, `score` now includes the additional value of `l[i]`, making it `l[i + 4] + l[i + 2] + l[i]`. The condition that `n` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged.
