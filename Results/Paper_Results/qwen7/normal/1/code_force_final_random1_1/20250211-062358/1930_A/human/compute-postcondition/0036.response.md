Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `2 * n`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `score` is increased by the value of `l[i + 2]`.
   - `i` is updated to `i + 2`.

4. **Calculate the new value of `i`**:
   - Let's assume the previous value of `i` was `i_prev`.
   - After the loop body, `i` is updated to `i_prev + 2`.

5. **Check if the loop should continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `2 * n`.
   - Therefore, the new value of `i` (which is `i_prev + 2`) must still be less than `2 * n`.

6. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` is now `i_prev + 2`.
   - `score` is increased by the value of `l[i_prev + 2 + 2] = l[i_prev + 4]`.

7. **Formulate the new state**:
   - Since `i` is updated to `i + 2`, and assuming the previous value of `i` was `i_prev`, the new value of `i` is `i_prev + 2`.
   - The condition for the next iteration is that `i_prev + 2 < 2 * n`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`score` is increased by the value of `l[i + 4]`, `i` is `i + 2`**.

Given that `i` is updated to `i + 2`, the new state can be written as:

State: **`score` is increased by the value of `l[i + 4]`, `i` is `i + 2`**.

However, to provide a concrete example, let's assume the previous value of `i` was 2 (for illustration purposes):

State: **`score` is increased by the value of `l[6]`, `i` is 4**.

If the previous value of `i` was different, the state would be adjusted accordingly. For the general case:

State: **`score` is increased by the value of `l[i + 4]`, `i` is `i + 2`**.
