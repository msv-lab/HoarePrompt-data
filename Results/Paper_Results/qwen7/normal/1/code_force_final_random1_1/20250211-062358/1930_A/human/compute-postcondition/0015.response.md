Output State: **`input` is decreased by 1, `n` is an input integer**.

The value of `input` is initially decreased by 1, and the code assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 0 is not checked or enforced by the given code snippet. Therefore, the updated state includes `input` being decreased by 1 and `n` being an integer input value.
