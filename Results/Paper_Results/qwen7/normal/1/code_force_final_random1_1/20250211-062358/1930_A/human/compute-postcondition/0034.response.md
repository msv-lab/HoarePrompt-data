Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State
- `score` is increased by the value of `l[i]`.
- `i` is unchanged.

### Loop Statement
```
for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head contains the variable `i`.
2. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over the range `0` to `2 * n` with a step of `2`. This means `i` takes values `0, 2, 4, ..., 2 * (n - 1)`.

### Current State
- Since `i` is unchanged from the previous iteration, it remains at its current value.
- `score` is increased by the value of `l[i]`.

### Next Iteration
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by `2` (since the step size is `2`).
- Therefore, if `i` was `k` in the previous iteration, it will become `k + 2` in the next iteration.

### Updated State
- `score` will be updated again by the value of `l[i + 2]`.
- `i` will be incremented to `i + 2`.

### Final Answer
State: **`score` is increased by the value of `l[i + 2]`, `i` is unchanged but will be incremented to `i + 2` in the next iteration**.

However, since we need to provide the state just before the next iteration starts, we can express it as:

State: **`score` is increased by the value of `l[i]`, `i` is `i + 2`**.

Given the format requirement, we can write:

State: **`score` is increased by the value of `l[i]`, `i` is `i + 2`**.
