The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two integers \(n\) and \(k\). For each test case, it calculates and prints a result based on the values of \(n\) and \(k\). Specifically, it constructs a list \(L\) by repeatedly dividing \(n\) by 2 and subtracting the result from \(n\). Then, it iterates over the list \(L\) to find the position where \(k\) falls within the cumulative sum of its elements, and prints a calculated value based on this position and the current power of 2. The function does not return any value but outputs the calculated results for each test case.
