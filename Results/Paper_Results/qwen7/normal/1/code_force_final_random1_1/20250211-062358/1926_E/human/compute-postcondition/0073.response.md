Output State: **`a` is 1, `L` is [1, 1], `tot` is 2**.

Explanation: The value of `a` remains unchanged at 1. The list `L` also remains unchanged at [1, 1]. The variable `tot` is incremented by the value of `a`, which is 1, making `tot` equal to 2. The condition `tot < k` and `k <= tot + a` remains unchanged based on the initial state.
