Output State: `a` is 0, `L` is [2, 1, 1], `k` is less than or equal to 4, `pow` is 8, `tot` is 2, `n` is 0, `m` is 1.

Explanation: After analyzing the provided loop and its behavior, we can see that once `n` becomes 0, the loop condition `n` is no longer satisfied, and thus the loop terminates. The given output states after the first three iterations show that `n` is reduced to 0 after exactly 3 iterations, with `L` containing `[2, 1, 1]`. Since no further iterations occur, the final state remains as after the third iteration, where `n` is 0.
