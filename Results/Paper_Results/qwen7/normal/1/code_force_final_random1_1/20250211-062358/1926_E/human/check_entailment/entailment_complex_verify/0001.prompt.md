You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n cards numbered 1, 2, \dots, n . He wants to lay them down in a
row as follows:

  * First, he lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest. 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 2 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 3 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 3 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 4 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 4 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * And so on, until all cards are laid down. 

What is the k -th card he lays down in this process? Once Vladislav puts a
card down, he cannot use that card again.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n
\leq 10^9 ) — the number of cards Vlad has, and the position of the card you
need to output.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the k -th card Vladislav lays
down.

Note

In the first seven test cases, n=7 . Vladislav lays down the cards as follows:

  * First — all the odd-numbered cards in the order 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . 
  * Next — all cards that are twice an odd number in the order 2 , 6 . 
  * Next, there are no remaining cards that are 3 times an odd number. (Vladislav has only one of each card.) 
  * Next — all cards that are 4 times an odd number, and there is only one such card: 4 . 
  * There are no more cards left, so Vladislav stops. 

Thus the order of cards is 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 2 , 6 , 4 .

    #State: Output State: The loop will continue to execute until all test cases specified by `t` are processed. After all iterations, the final output will depend on the last test case's values of `n` and `k`. If `k > (n + 1) // 2`, the final state will be that `s` is the sum of all values added to it during each iteration of the loop, `i` is the total number of iterations the loop executed, `d` is 0, `h` is 0, `p` is 1, `g` is the sum of \((h + 1) // 2\) for each iteration, `f` is \(k - g\), and `y` is calculated as \(2^{(i - 1)} \times (2 \times (k - g) - 1)\). If `k \leq (n + 1) // 2`, then `s` remains 0, `i` remains 0, `d` remains `n`, `h` remains `n`, `p` remains 1, `g` remains 0, and `f` remains \(k - g\).
    #
    #The final output for each test case will be printed as `y`, which is determined based on whether `k` is greater than or less than or equal to \((n + 1) // 2\).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each containing integers `t`, `n`, and `k`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on the given integers. If `k > (n + 1) // 2`, it computes a specific formula involving powers of 2 and arithmetic operations. Otherwise, it simply prints `2 * k - 1`. After processing all test cases, the function outputs the calculated values for each case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - It then reads `n` and `k` for each test case, which are the number of cards and the position of the card to find, respectively.

2. **Initial Variables**:
   - `s`: Sum of the count of cards laid down so far.
   - `i`: Counter for the current iteration level (times an odd number).
   - `d`: Remaining cards at the current iteration level.
   - `h`: Maximum value of cards at the current iteration level.
   - `p`: Counter for the current iteration level.
   - `g`: Sum of the count of cards laid down before the current iteration level.

3. **Case 1: k > (n + 1) // 2**:
   - This condition checks if the position `k` is beyond the first half of the cards.
   - The loop `while s < k and d > 0:` iterates to add the count of cards laid down at each level.
   - `s += (d + 1) // 2` adds the number of cards at the current level.
   - `d -= (d + 1) // 2` updates the remaining cards at the current level.
   - `i += 1` increments the level counter.
   - After exiting the loop, it calculates the position within the current level using `f = k - g`.
   - Finally, it computes the card number `y = 2 ** (i - 1) * (2 * f - 1)` and prints it.

4. **Case 2: k <= (n + 1) // 2**:
   - This condition checks if the position `k` is within the first half of the cards.
   - It directly prints `2 * k - 1`, which is the correct formula for the k-th odd number.
