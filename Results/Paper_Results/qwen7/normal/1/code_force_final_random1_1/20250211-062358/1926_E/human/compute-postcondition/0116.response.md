Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for a in L:`. The variables involved here are `a` and `L`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in the list `L`. At the end of the previous iteration, `a` is 0, `L` is `[2, 0, 1]`, and `pow` and `tot` are not relevant to the loop itself.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - The variable `a` will take the next value from the list `L`.
   - The list `L` will be updated to remove the first element (since `a` is taking the first element from `L`).

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `a` will be the next element in the list `L`, which is `2`.
   - `L` will be the remaining elements of the list after removing the first element, which is `[0, 1]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`a` is 2, `L` is [0, 1]**
