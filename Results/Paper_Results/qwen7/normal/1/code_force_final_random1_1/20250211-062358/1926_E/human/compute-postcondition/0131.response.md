Output State: The loop will continue to process each test case provided by the input until there are no more cases to process. After all iterations, the final output will depend on the last test case's values of `n` and `k`. If `k > (n + 1) // 2`, the variable `y` will be calculated as \(2^{(i - 1)} \times (2 \times (k - g) - 1)\), where `i` is the total number of iterations in the loop, and `g` is the sum of \((h + 1) // 2\) for each iteration. If `k \leq (n + 1) // 2`, then `y` will simply be \(2 \times k - 1\).

The output state after all iterations will be the result of the last `print(y)` statement executed, which is the final value of `y` based on the conditions met by the last test case.
