Output State: **`a` is 0, `L` is [], `k` is less than or equal to 4, `pow` is 8, `tot` is 2, `n` is `n - (n + 1) // 2`, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2**.

Explanation: The value of `n` is updated to `n - (n + 1) // 2`. Since `m` is defined as `(n + 1) // 2`, `n` is reduced by `m`. All other variables remain unchanged.
