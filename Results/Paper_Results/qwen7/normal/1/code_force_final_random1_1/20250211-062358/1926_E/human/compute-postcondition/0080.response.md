Output State: **`a` is 1, `L` is [1], `pow` is 2**

Explanation: The initial state is defined as follows:
- `a` is 1
- `L` is [1]
- `tot` is 2 if `k` is between `tot` (which is 1) and `tot + a` (which is 2), otherwise no change to `a` and `L`. This implies `k` is between 1 and 2, so `tot` is indeed 2.

The code snippet `pow *= 2` multiplies the value of `pow` by 2. Since `pow` was not initially defined, it is assumed to be 1 (as it is common for such variables to start at 1 if not specified otherwise). After executing `pow *= 2`, the value of `pow` becomes 2.

All other variables (`a`, `L`, and `tot`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the final output state is `a` is 1, `L` is [1], `pow` is 2.
