Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for a in L:`. This means the variables involved in the loop head are `a` and `L`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements left in the list `L`. At the end of the previous iteration, `a` is 2, `L` is `[2, 1, 1]`, and `pow` is 2.

3. **Determine the next value of `a`**: Since `a` is currently set to the first element of `L` (which is 2), the next value of `a` will be the second element of `L`. Therefore, `a` will be 1.

4. **Check if `L` still has elements**: After setting `a` to 1, we need to check if `L` still has elements. The list `L` originally was `[2, 1, 1]`. After using the first element (2), the remaining list is `[1, 1]`. Since there are still elements in `L`, the loop can continue.

5. **Adjust the state**: The only variables that need to be adjusted are `a` and `L`. The variable `pow` is not part of the loop head and does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`a` is 1, `L` is [1, 1]**
