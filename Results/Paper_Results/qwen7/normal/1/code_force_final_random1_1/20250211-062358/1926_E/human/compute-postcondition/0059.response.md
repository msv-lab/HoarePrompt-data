Output State: **`a` is 0, `L` is [2, 1, 1], `k` is less than or equal to 4, `pow` is 8, `tot` is 0, `n` is 0, `m` is 1**.

Explanation: The code `tot = 0` simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `tot`. This does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the values of `a`, `L`, `k`, `pow`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged from their previous values. The updated value of `tot` is 0.
