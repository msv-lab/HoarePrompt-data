Output State: **`a` is 2, `L` is [0, 1], `tot` is 4, `pow` is multiplied by 2.**

Explanation: The initial state is `a` is 2, `L` is [0, 1], and `tot` is 2 + a, which means `tot` is 4. The line `pow *= 2` multiplies the value of `pow` by 2. Since the initial value of `pow` is not specified, we only know that `pow` is now twice its original value. All other variables remain unchanged.
