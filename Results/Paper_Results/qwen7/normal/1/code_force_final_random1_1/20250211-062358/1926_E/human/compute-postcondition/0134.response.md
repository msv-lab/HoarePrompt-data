Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each containing integers `t`, `n`, and `k`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on the given integers. If `k > (n + 1) // 2`, it computes a specific formula involving powers of 2 and arithmetic operations. Otherwise, it simply prints `2 * k - 1`. After processing all test cases, the function outputs the calculated values for each case.**
