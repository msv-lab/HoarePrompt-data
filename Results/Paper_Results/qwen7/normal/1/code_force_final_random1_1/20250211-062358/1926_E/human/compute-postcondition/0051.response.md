Output State: **`a` is 0, `L` is [2], `k` is less than or equal to 4, `pow` is 8, `tot` is 2, `n` is 0, `m` is 1**

Explanation: The code `n -= m` subtracts the value of `m` (which is 1) from `n`. Initially, `n` is 1, so after executing the code, `n` becomes 0. All other variables (`a`, `L`, `k`, `pow`, `tot`, and `m`) remain unchanged.
