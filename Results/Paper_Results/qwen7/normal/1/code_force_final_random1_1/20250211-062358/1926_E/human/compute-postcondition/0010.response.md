Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50000, `n` is now `n - (n + 1) // 2`, `k` is an integer obtained from the second input split, `L` is a list containing one element which is `(n + 1) // 2`, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2**.

Explanation: The value of `n` is updated to `n - (n + 1) // 2`. Since `m` is defined as `(n + 1) // 2`, the new value of `n` becomes `n - m`. The values of `t`, `k`, `L`, and `m` remain unchanged from their initial states.
