Output State: `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50000, `n` is 0, `k` is an integer obtained from the second input split, `L` is a list containing up to three elements `[n + 1 // 2, m, m]`, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`.

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `n` is non-zero. After each iteration, `n` is reduced by `m`, where `m` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`. This process continues until `n` becomes 0. At this point, the loop terminates. Since `L` is appended with `m` in each iteration, and `m` is always the same value in each iteration (as it is based on the current value of `n` which changes), `L` will contain up to three elements, depending on how many iterations were executed. Given the constraints, `n` will eventually become 0, and the loop will stop, leaving `n` as 0 and `L` containing the values `[n + 1 // 2, m, m]` if the loop ran for three iterations, or fewer if `n` became 0 earlier.
