Output State: **`a` is 1, `L` is [2, 0], `tot` is 4, `pow` is 4, `t` must be greater than 3, `n` must be 1, `m` is 1**

Explanation: The code `m = (n + 1) // 2` calculates the integer division of `(n + 1)` by `2`. Given that `n` must be 1, the expression `(1 + 1) // 2` evaluates to `1`. Therefore, `m` is updated to `1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
