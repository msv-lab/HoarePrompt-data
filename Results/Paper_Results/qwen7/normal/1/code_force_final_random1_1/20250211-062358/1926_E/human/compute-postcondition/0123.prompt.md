Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer, 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    L = []
    while n:
        m = (n + 1) // 2
        n -= m
        L.append(m)
    tot = 0
    pow = 1
    for a in L:
        if tot < k and k <= tot + a:
            print(pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1))
        tot += a
        pow *= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `a` is 0, `L` is [0], `k` is less than or equal to `tot` + 2, `pow` is 4, `tot` is the sum of all elements in `L` which is 2.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `L` will be reduced to `[0]` because each element of `L` is processed in each iteration. The value of `a` will always be 0 after the first iteration since `L` becomes `[0]` thereafter. The variable `pow` gets multiplied by 2 in each iteration, so after 3 iterations, it becomes 4. The variable `tot` accumulates the sum of all elements in `L`, which is initially `[2, m, m]`. Given `m = (n + 1) // 2` and `n` starts at 0, `m` is 1, so `L` starts as `[2, 1, 1]`. The total sum of `L` is 4, but since `a` becomes 0 after the first iteration, `tot` only increases by the initial `a` value of 2, making `tot` equal to 2. Therefore, `tot` remains 2 after all iterations.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `a` is 1, `L` is [], `tot` is 4, `pow` is 4.

Explanation: The loop continues until `L` is exhausted. Given the initial conditions and the provided output states, we can deduce the following:

- After the first iteration, `a` is set to 2, `L` becomes [1, 1], and `pow` is 2.
- After the second iteration, `a` is set to 1, `L` becomes [1], and `tot` is updated to 2, with `pow` remaining 2.
- After the third iteration, `a` is set to 1, `L` becomes [], `tot` is updated to 3 (from the previous total of 2 plus the current `a` value of 1), and `pow` remains 2.

Since `L` is now empty, the loop terminates. Before the last iteration, `tot` was 3, and `a` was 1. During the last iteration, `tot` is incremented by `a`, making `tot` equal to 4. Also, `pow` is multiplied by 2 each time the loop runs, so it becomes 4 after three iterations. Thus, the final state is `a` is 1, `L` is [], `tot` is 4, and `pow` is 4.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `a` is 1, `L` is [1], `tot` is 5, `pow` is 8.

Explanation: The loop continues until `L` is empty. Given the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can deduce the following:

- After the first iteration, `a` becomes 2 and `pow` is 2.
- After the second iteration, `a` becomes 0, `L` is updated to [2, 0, 1], and `pow` is 4. However, since `a` was set to 2 in the previous iteration, `L` is now [0, 1] and `a` is 2 again.
- After the third iteration, `a` becomes 1, `L` is updated to [0], `tot` is 4, and `pow` is 8.

Since `L` is now [0], the loop will terminate. Therefore, `a` will be 1 (the next element in the original list), `L` will be [0], `tot` will be 4 + 1 = 5, and `pow` will be 8.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
