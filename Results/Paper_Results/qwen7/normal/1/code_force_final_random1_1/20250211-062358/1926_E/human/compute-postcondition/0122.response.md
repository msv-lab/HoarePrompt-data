Output State: `a` is 1, `L` is [1], `tot` is 5, `pow` is 8.

Explanation: The loop continues until `L` is empty. Given the output states after the first 3 iterations, we can deduce the following:

- After the first iteration, `a` becomes 2 and `pow` is 2.
- After the second iteration, `a` becomes 0, `L` is updated to [2, 0, 1], and `pow` is 4. However, since `a` was set to 2 in the previous iteration, `L` is now [0, 1] and `a` is 2 again.
- After the third iteration, `a` becomes 1, `L` is updated to [0], `tot` is 4, and `pow` is 8.

Since `L` is now [0], the loop will terminate. Therefore, `a` will be 1 (the next element in the original list), `L` will be [0], `tot` will be 4 + 1 = 5, and `pow` will be 8.
