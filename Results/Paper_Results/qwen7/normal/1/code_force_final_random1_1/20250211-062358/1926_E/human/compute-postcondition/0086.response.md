Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The only variable in the loop head is `n`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop condition is `while n`. This means the loop will execute as long as `n` is non-zero.

3. **Current state before the loop**: 
   - `a` is 1
   - `L` is []
   - `tot` is 4
   - `pow` is 4
   - `t` must be greater than 3
   - `n` is an input integer
   - `k` is an input integer

4. **Adjust the state for the loop to execute the first time**: For the loop to execute the first time, `n` must be non-zero. Since `n` is described as an input integer, we need to ensure that `n` is not zero.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n` should not be zero.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`a` is 1, `L` is [], `tot` is 4, `pow` is 4, `t` must be greater than 3, `n` is an input integer and `n` must not be zero, `k` is an input integer**
