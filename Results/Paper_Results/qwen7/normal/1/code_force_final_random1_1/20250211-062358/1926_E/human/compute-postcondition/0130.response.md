Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\), `input_value - 1`, `n` is an integer from the input split, `k` is an integer from the input split, `s` is 0, `i` is 0, `d` is 0, `h` is equal to `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, and either `k` is greater than \((n + 1) // 2\) where `g` is the sum of \((h + 1) // 2\) for each iteration, `h` is reduced by \((h + 1) // 2\) for each iteration until `d` becomes 0, `p` is equal to the total number of iterations `i`, `d` is 0, `s` is incremented until it reaches or exceeds `k`, `i` is the total number of iterations performed, `f` is `k - g`, and `y` is \(2^{(i - 1)} \times (2 \times f - 1)\), or `k` is less than or equal to \((n + 1) // 2\).**
