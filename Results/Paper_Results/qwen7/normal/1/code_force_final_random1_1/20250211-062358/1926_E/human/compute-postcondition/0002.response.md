Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 5â‹…10^4, `n` is an integer obtained from the first input split, `k` is an integer obtained from the second input split**.

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input separated by a space, splits them, and converts them into integers, assigning them to `n` and `k` respectively. The initial condition for `t` remains unchanged.
