Output State: `a` is 0, `L` is [2, 1, 1], `k` is less than or equal to 4, `pow` is 8, `tot` is 2, `n` is 0, `m` is 1.

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `n` is non-zero. After the first iteration, `n` becomes `n - (n + 1) // 2`. For the second iteration, `n` becomes 0 because it is now less than or equal to 0, which causes the loop to terminate. Therefore, after all iterations, `n` will be 0, and the list `L` will contain the values `[2, 1, 1]` which were appended during each iteration of the loop. The other variables (`a`, `k`, `pow`, `tot`, and `m`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
