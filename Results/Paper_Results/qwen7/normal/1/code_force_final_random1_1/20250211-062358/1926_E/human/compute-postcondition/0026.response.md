Output State: **`a` is 2, `L` is [2, 0, 0], `tot` is `tot` + 2, and `k` is less than or equal to `tot` + 2.**

Explanation: The variable `tot` is incremented by the value of `a`, which is 2. Therefore, `tot` becomes `tot + 2`. The values of `a` and `L` remain unchanged. The condition for `k` remains the same, i.e., `k` is less than or equal to `tot + 2`.
