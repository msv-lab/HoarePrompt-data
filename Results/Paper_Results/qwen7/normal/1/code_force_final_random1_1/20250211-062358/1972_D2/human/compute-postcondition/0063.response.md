Output State: `x` is 5, `n` is 24, `m` is 24, `y` is 3, and `cnt` is 1.

To understand this output state, let's break it down:

- The loop continues as long as `x * x <= n`. Given that `x` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, we can determine the final value of `x` after all iterations.
- From the given information, we know that after 3 iterations, `x` is 4. Therefore, the loop will continue until `x` reaches 5 because the condition `x * x <= n` must still hold true.
- For `x = 5`, the loop will check the conditions with `y` starting from 1. However, since `n` is 24, `(x + y) * x = 6 * 5 = 30` which is greater than `n`, so `y` will not increment beyond its initial value of 1. This means `y` remains 3.
- Similarly, for `m = 24`, `(x + y) * y = 8 * 3 = 24` which is equal to `m`, but any further increment in `y` would make `(x + y) * y > m`, so `y` remains 3.
- The condition `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` holds true for `x = 5` and `y = 3` since their greatest common divisor is 1. However, the value of `cnt` does not change because the condition `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` evaluates to 0 due to `(x + y) * x > n` and `(x + y) * y > m`.
- Thus, after all iterations, `x` becomes 5, `n` remains 24, `m` remains 24, `y` becomes 3, and `cnt` remains 1.
