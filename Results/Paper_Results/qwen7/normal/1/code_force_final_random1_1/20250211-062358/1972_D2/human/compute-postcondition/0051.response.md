Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition:**
   The loop condition is given by:
   \[
   (x + y) \cdot x \leq n \quad \text{and} \quad (x + y) \cdot y \leq m
   \]

2. **Current States:**
   - \( x = 3 \)
   - \( n \geq 15 \)
   - \( m \geq 30 \)
   - \( y = 2 \)
   - \( cnt = 1 \) (This is not relevant to the loop condition)

3. **Evaluate the Loop Condition with Current Values:**
   Substitute the current values into the loop condition:
   \[
   (3 + 2) \cdot 3 \leq n \quad \text{and} \quad (3 + 2) \cdot 2 \leq m
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   5 \cdot 3 \leq n \quad \text{and} \quad 5 \cdot 2 \leq m
   \]
   Which results in:
   \[
   15 \leq n \quad \text{and} \quad 10 \leq m
   \]

4. **Determine the Variables to Adjust:**
   - The loop condition involves the variables \( x \), \( y \), \( n \), and \( m \).
   - We need to ensure that the loop condition remains true for the next iteration.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since \( n \geq 15 \) and \( m \geq 30 \) are already satisfied, we don't need to change these directly.
   - However, we need to ensure that the loop condition still holds. Given that \( x = 3 \) and \( y = 2 \), the new values of \( n \) and \( m \) should still satisfy:
     \[
     15 \leq n \quad \text{and} \quad 10 \leq m
     \]

### Conclusion:

To ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to maintain the conditions \( 15 \leq n \) and \( 10 \leq m \). Therefore, we need to ensure that \( n \) and \( m \) remain at least 15 and 10, respectively.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`x` is 3, `n` is at least 15, `m` is at least 10, `y` is 2**
