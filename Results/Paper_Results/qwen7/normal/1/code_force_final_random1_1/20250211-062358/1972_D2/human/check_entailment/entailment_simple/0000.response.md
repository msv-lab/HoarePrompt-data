Reasoning:
1. The annotated program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
2. `func_1` is designed to calculate the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for a given \(n\) and \(m\).
3. The logic in `func_1` checks for pairs \((x, y)\) where \(1 \leq x \leq n\) and \(1 \leq y \leq m\), ensuring that \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\). It uses a nested loop to iterate through possible values of \(x\) and \(y\), and a gcd check to ensure the condition is met.
4. `func_2` reads the number of test cases \(t\) and calls `func_1` for each test case.
5. The provided example and the output state in the comments correctly reflect the expected behavior of the program. For instance, when \(n = 24\) and \(m = 24\), the output is 1, which aligns with the logic in `func_1`.

Given the problem description and the provided example, the program logic appears to be correct. The nested loops and gcd check in `func_1` are appropriately implemented to find valid pairs, and `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases.

Correctness: **True**
