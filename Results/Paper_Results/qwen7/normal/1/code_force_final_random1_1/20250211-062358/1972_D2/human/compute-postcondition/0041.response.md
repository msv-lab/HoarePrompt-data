Output State: `x` is 2, `n` is at least 15, `m` is at least 30, `y` is 5, and `cnt` is 2.

Explanation: After the first three iterations, we observe that `x` remains constant at 2, while `y` increments by 1 each iteration. The conditions `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` are checked in each iteration. The gcd condition ensures that `cnt` is incremented only when `x` and `y` are coprime. Given the constraints on `n` and `m` increase with each iteration, the loop will continue until these conditions are no longer satisfied. Since the output state after 3 iterations shows `y` as 4 and `cnt` as 2, and considering the pattern, it's reasonable to conclude that after all iterations, `y` would be 5, `n` would be at least 15, and `m` would be at least 30, maintaining `cnt` at 2 as the gcd condition was not met again in subsequent iterations.
