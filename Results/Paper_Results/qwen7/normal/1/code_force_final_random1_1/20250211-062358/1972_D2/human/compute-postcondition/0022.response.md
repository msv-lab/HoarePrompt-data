Output State: **`x` is 2, `n` must be at least 5, `m` must be at least 20, `y` is 5, and `cnt` is 2**.

Explanation: The code `x += 1` increments the value of `x` by 1. Initially, `x` was 1. After executing `x += 1`, `x` becomes 2. The conditions for the loop and the values of `n`, `m`, `y`, and `cnt` remain unchanged since the code only modifies `x`. Therefore, `n` must still be at least 5, `m` must still be at least 20, `y` is still 5, and `cnt` is still 2.
