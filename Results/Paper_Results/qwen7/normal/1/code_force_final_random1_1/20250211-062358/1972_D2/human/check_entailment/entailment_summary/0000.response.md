Reasoning:
1. The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).
2. The provided solution consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
3. `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the pairs \((x, y)\) that satisfy the conditions specified in the problem. It iterates over possible values of \(x\) and \(y\), checks if they are coprime (\(\gcd(x, y) == 1\)), and ensures that the product \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\). It counts the valid pairs and prints the result.
4. `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases. It reads the number of test cases \(t\), and for each test case, it calls `func_1()`. This function does not return any value but ensures that the logic inside `func_1` is executed for each test case.

Given the execution summaries and the logic implemented in both functions, the overall program correctly solves the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
