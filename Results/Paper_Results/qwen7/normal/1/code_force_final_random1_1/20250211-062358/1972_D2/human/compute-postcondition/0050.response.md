Output State: **`x` is 3, `n` is at least 15, `m` is at least 30, `y` is 2, and `cnt` is 1 because `math.gcd(x, y)` equals 1.**

Explanation: The value of `y` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The other variables (`x`, `n`, `m`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code snippet.
