Output State: **`x` is 1, `n` must be at least 4, `m` must be at least 12, `y` is 4, and `cnt` is 1 since `math.gcd(x, y)` equals 1.**

Explanation: The value of `y` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 3 to 4. The other variables (`x`, `n`, `m`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged. The condition for `n` and `m` (being at least 4 and 12 respectively) and the gcd condition for `x` and `y` also remain valid.
