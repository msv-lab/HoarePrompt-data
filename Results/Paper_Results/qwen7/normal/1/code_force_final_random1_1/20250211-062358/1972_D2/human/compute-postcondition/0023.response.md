The loop condition is `x * x <= n`. For the loop to execute one more time, the condition must be true at the beginning of the next iteration.

Given the current state:
- `x` is 2
- `n` must be at least 5
- `m` must be at least 20
- `y` is 5
- `cnt` is 2

We need to ensure that `x * x <= n` is true at the start of the next iteration. Currently, `x * x` is `2 * 2 = 4`. Therefore, `n` must be at least 5 for the condition to hold true.

No other states need to be adjusted since they do not affect the loop condition directly.

State: **`x` is 2, `n` must be at least 5, `m` must be at least 20, `y` is 5, and `cnt` is 2**
