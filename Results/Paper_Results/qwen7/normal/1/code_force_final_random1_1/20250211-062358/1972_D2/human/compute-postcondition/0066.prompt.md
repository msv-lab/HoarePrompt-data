You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, and n and m are within the constraints specified in the problem description.
def func_1():
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        
        x += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `x` is 5, `n` is 24, `m` is 24, `y` is 3, and `cnt` is 1.
    #
    #To understand this output state, let's break it down:
    #
    #- The loop continues as long as `x * x <= n`. Given that `x` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, we can determine the final value of `x` after all iterations.
    #- From the given information, we know that after 3 iterations, `x` is 4. Therefore, the loop will continue until `x` reaches 5 because the condition `x * x <= n` must still hold true.
    #- For `x = 5`, the loop will check the conditions with `y` starting from 1. However, since `n` is 24, `(x + y) * x = 6 * 5 = 30` which is greater than `n`, so `y` will not increment beyond its initial value of 1. This means `y` remains 3.
    #- Similarly, for `m = 24`, `(x + y) * y = 8 * 3 = 24` which is equal to `m`, but any further increment in `y` would make `(x + y) * y > m`, so `y` remains 3.
    #- The condition `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` holds true for `x = 5` and `y = 3` since their greatest common divisor is 1. However, the value of `cnt` does not change because the condition `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` evaluates to 0 due to `(x + y) * x > n` and `(x + y) * y > m`.
    #- Thus, after all iterations, `x` becomes 5, `n` remains 24, `m` remains 24, `y` becomes 3, and `cnt` remains 1.
    print(cnt)
    #This is printed: 1
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and returns nothing.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
