Output State: `x` is 5, `n` is 24, `m` is 24, `y` is 4, and `cnt` is 1.

Explanation: Based on the given information, we can see that the loop increments `x` by 1 each time it completes one iteration. The loop continues as long as `x * x <= n`. After the third iteration, `x` is 4, and `n` is 19. Since `x` is incremented to 5 for the next iteration, the condition `x * x <= n` will no longer hold true when `x` becomes 5, assuming `n` does not change and remains 19 or less. However, since the problem states that `n` is 24 after three iterations, we assume `n` increases with each iteration to keep the loop going until `x` reaches 5. Similarly, `m` is also adjusted to 24 after three iterations. The variable `y` resets to 4 at the start of each new iteration of the outer loop, and `cnt` is updated based on the conditions within the inner loop. Given the constraints and the pattern observed, `cnt` remains 1 after the fourth iteration.
