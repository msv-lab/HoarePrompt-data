Based on the initial state provided and the code snippet, let's break down the execution step-by-step:

1. **Initial Values:**
   - `x` is 5
   - `n` is 24
   - `m` is 24
   - `y` is 3
   - `cnt` is 1

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop continues as long as `x * x <= n`. Since `x` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, we need to determine the final value of `x` after all iterations.
   - From the given information, we know that after 3 iterations, `x` is 4. Therefore, the loop will continue until `x` reaches 5 because the condition `x * x <= n` must still hold true.
   - For `x = 5`, the loop checks the conditions with `y` starting from 1. However, since `n` is 24, `(x + y) * x = 6 * 5 = 30` which is greater than `n`, so `y` will not increment beyond its initial value of 1. This means `y` remains 3.
   - Similarly, for `m = 24`, `(x + y) * y = 8 * 3 = 24` which is equal to `m`, but any further increment in `y` would make `(x + y) * y > m`, so `y` remains 3.
   - The condition `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` holds true for `x = 5` and `y = 3` since their greatest common divisor is 1. However, the value of `cnt` does not change because the condition `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` evaluates to 0 due to `(x + y) * x > n` and `(x + y) * y > m`.

3. **Final Values:**
   - After all iterations, `x` becomes 5
   - `n` remains 24
   - `m` remains 24
   - `y` becomes 3
   - `cnt` remains 1

4. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(cnt)`.
   - Since `cnt` remains 1 after all iterations, the print statement will output the value of `cnt`.

Output: **1**
