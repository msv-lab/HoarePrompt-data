Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes three integers: t, n, and m, where t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6. The function does not return any value directly but seems to perform some operations based on these inputs.**

However, since the exact operations are not specified in the given information, the focus here is on the parameters and their constraints.
