Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by two positive integers \(a\) and \(b\). For each test case, it checks if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even. If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd and neither can be split into two equal parts such that one part equals the other number, it prints 'No'. Otherwise, it prints 'Yes'. The function does not return any value but prints 'Yes' or 'No' for each test case.**
