The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop and move to the next iteration of the loop. However, since no loop was specified in the given code snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is 9999, `_` is 2, `a1` is `a // 2`, `a2` is `a // 2`, `b1` is `b // 2`, `b2` is `b // 2`.**
