Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state defines `t` as a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). It also states that \(t = t - 1\). This equation implies that `t` is being set to a value that is one less than itself, which is logically impossible unless `t` is undefined or the operation is ignored due to the assignment being self-contradictory. Given the nature of the problem, it's more likely that this line is intended to be a no-op (no operation) or simply ignored, meaning `t` retains its original value.

2. `_` is explicitly defined as 2.

3. `a` and `b` are integers from the input, but their specific values are not provided in the initial state.

4. The `print('No')` statement will print the string 'No' regardless of the values of `t`, `_`, `a`, and `b`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **No**
