Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is the first integer input, `b` is the second integer input, and `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to variables `a` and `b`. It also increments `i` by 1. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not involved in any operation.
