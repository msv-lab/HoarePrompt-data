Output: **yes**

Explanation: The initial state provides us with the conditions for the variables `t`, `a`, and `b`. Specifically, it states that `a` and `b` are such that at least one of them is odd, and their difference is not zero. The print statement simply outputs the string 'yes', regardless of the values of `a` and `b`. Therefore, the output will be the string 'yes'.
