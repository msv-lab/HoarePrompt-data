Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `a` is the first integer input.
- `b` is the second integer input.
- At least one of `a` or `b` is odd.
- Neither `(a - b == -a)` nor `(b - a == -b)` holds true.
- `(a - b) % 2 == 0`

The print statement is simply `print('no')`.

Given these conditions, the print statement will output the string `'no'` without any changes because the string literal `'no'` is directly provided in the print statement.

Output: **no**
