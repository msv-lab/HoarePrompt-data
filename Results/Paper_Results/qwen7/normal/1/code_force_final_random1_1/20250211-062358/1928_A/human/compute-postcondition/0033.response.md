Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `a` is the first integer input.
- `b` is the second integer input.
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'yes'`. Since no variables or objects within the print statement are dependent on the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, or `i`, the output will be the string `'yes'`.

Output: **'yes'**
