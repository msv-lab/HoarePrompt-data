Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is the first integer input, `b` is the second integer input, at least one of `a` or `b` is odd, and either `(a - b == -a)` with `a` being the current value, or `(b - a == -b)` with `b` being the current value, or neither `(a - b == -a)` nor `(b - a == -b)` holds true, satisfying the condition `(a - b) % 2 != 0` if the difference between `a` and `b` is not zero, and `(a - b) % 2 == 0` if the difference between `a` and `b` is zero.
