Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `int(input())` provides a non-negative integer value.
   - Since `t` is given as a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the input value should be within this range.

3. **Adjust the state**:
   - The variable `i` will start from 0 and increment by 1 in each iteration.
   - The value of `int(input())` must be a positive integer within the specified range to ensure the loop executes.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the input value that will be read inside the loop. Specifically, the input value should be a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the input value must be a positive integer within the same range.**
