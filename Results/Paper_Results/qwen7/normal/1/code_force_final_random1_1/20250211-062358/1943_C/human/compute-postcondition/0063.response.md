Output State: **`i` is 1; `c1` is unchanged; `ops` now contains the tuple `(c1, 1)`**

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(c1, i)` to the list `ops`. Given the initial state where `i` is 1 and `len(path_ba)` is greater than or equal to `c1 + 1`, the value of `i` remains unchanged. The value of `c1` also remains unchanged. The list `ops` now includes the tuple `(c1, 1)`.
