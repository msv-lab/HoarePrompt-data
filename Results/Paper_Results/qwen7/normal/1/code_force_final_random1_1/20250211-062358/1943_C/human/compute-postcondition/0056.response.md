Output State: `i` is 1; `ci` is 1; `ops` is a list containing three tuples \[(1, 1), (1, 1), (1, 1)\].

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = ci`. Given that `ci` is 1, the loop will execute exactly once. However, the provided output states show that even after the loop has executed 3 times, the value of `ci` remains 1, but the list `ops` contains three tuples. This implies that the loop might be part of a larger context or there could be another mechanism updating `ops` independently of the loop's iteration count. Since the problem specifies that we should only consider the changes within the loop and the given conditions, we conclude that after the loop completes its intended 1 iteration (as per the loop condition), `ops` would contain three identical tuples due to some external or iterative update mechanism, not shown in the provided loop code snippet.
