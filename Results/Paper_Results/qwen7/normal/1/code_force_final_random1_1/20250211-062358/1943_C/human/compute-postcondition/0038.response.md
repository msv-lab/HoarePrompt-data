Output State: **`n` is -1, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `d` and `_` are the results of the bfs function call with argument 0, `d` is the result of the bfs function call starting from `a`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, and `path_ba` is a list containing `[b, -1]` and `n` is appended to `path_ba`, `n` is -1**

Explanation: The code `n = previous[path_ba[-1]]` updates the value of `n`. Since `path_ba` ends with `-1`, `path_ba[-1]` is `-1`. Therefore, `n` is set to the value of `previous[-1]`. Given the initial state, `n` was originally `-1`, and there is no information about the value of `previous[-1]` being different from `-1`. Hence, `n` remains `-1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
