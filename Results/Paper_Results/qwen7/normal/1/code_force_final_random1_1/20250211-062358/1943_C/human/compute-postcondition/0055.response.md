Output State: **`i` is 1; `ci` is 1; `ops` is a list containing two tuples \[(1, 1), (1, 1)\]**.

Explanation: Initially, `ops` is a list containing one tuple `(c, 1)` where `c` is the current value of `ci`, which is 1. After executing `ops.append((c, i))`, the list `ops` now contains two tuples: the original tuple \((1, 1)\) and the new tuple \((1, 1)\). The values of `i` and `ci` remain unchanged.
