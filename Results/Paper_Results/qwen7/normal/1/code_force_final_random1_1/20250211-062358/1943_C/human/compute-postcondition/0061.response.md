Output State: **`c2` is 1, `n` is -1, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `d` and `_` are the results of the bfs function call with argument 0, `d` is the result of the bfs function call starting from `a`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, and `path_ba` is a list containing `[b, -1, -1, -1]`. The length of `path_ba` is even.**

Explanation: The value of `c2` is updated to `c2 - 1`, which means `c2` is now 1. The other variables (`n`, `a`, `d`, `_`, `b`, and `path_ba`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
