The function constructs a tree represented by the list `u2vs` and performs a series of operations to determine and print a specific set of operations based on the tree structure. It reads an integer `n` and a tree structure from the input, performs breadth-first searches (BFS) to find certain nodes, and constructs a list of operations. Depending on the length of the resulting path, it either prints three tuples or a varying number of tuples. The function ultimately returns nothing.
