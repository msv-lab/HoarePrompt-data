Output State: **`n` is an input integer, 1 ≤ n ≤ 2000; `u2vs` is a list of length `n` where each element is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes `u2vs` as a list of `n` empty lists. Each element in `u2vs` is now an empty list, which means no vertices have any neighbors yet. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and the structure of `u2vs` now represents an empty tree (a tree with no edges).
