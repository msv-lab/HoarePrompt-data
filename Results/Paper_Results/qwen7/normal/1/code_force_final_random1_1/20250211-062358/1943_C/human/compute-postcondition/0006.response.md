Output State: **`u2vs[u]` is a list containing `v`, `u` is an integer from the input split minus 1, `v` is an integer from the input split minus 1**.

Explanation: The code appends the value of `v` to the list `u2vs[u]`. Since `u` and `v` are integers from the input split minus 1, the list `u2vs[u]` now contains the value `v`. The values of `u` and `v` remain unchanged.
