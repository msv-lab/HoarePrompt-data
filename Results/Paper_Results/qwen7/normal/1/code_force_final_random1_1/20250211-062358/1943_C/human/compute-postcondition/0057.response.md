Output State: `i` is 1; `ci` is 1; `ops` is a list containing three tuples \[(1, 1), (1, 1), (1, 1)\].

In this final output state, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` remains unchanged at 1 because the loop's condition `i < ci + 1` evaluates to false when `i` reaches 2 (since `ci` is 1). The variable `ci` also remains unchanged at 1. The list `ops` contains three tuples, each being `(1, 1)`, as the loop appends the same tuple `(c, i)` for each iteration, and since `c` is 1 (the current value of `ci`), and `i` increments from 0 to 1, the list ends up with three identical tuples.
