Since the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, it will always execute at least once regardless of the initial state of the variables. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary to make the loop execute the first time.

State: **`a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `d` and `_` are the results of the bfs function call with argument 0, `d` is the result of the bfs function call starting from `a`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, and `path_ba` is a list containing `[b]`**
