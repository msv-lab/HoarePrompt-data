Output State: **`a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `d` and `_` are the results of the bfs function call with argument 0, `d` is the result of the bfs function call starting from `a`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, and `path_ba` is a list containing `[b]`.**

Explanation: The line `path_ba = [b]` creates a list containing the value of `b`. The value of `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, which was already defined in the initial state. The other variables (`a`, `d`, and `_`) remain unchanged as they were not affected by the given code snippet.
