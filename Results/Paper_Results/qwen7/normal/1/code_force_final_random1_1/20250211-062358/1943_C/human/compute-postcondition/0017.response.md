Output State: **`u2vs[u]` is a list containing `v` and the original value of `v`, `u2vs[v]` is a list containing both `u` and the original value of `u`, `n` is 1, `u` is 1 less than the original input integer `u`, `v` is the integer input after decrementing by 2, and `v` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `v -= 1` decrements the value of `v` by 1. Initially, `v` was the integer input after decrementing by 1, so now it is decreased by another 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
