The loop is a `while True` loop, which means it will always execute as long as the program state allows it. Since there are no conditions in the loop head to determine whether the loop should continue, we do not need to adjust any specific states for the loop to execute one more time.

However, according to the problem's instruction, we need to provide the modified program state such that the loop can proceed to the next iteration. Given that the loop is `while True`, no specific adjustments are necessary beyond ensuring the loop continues to execute.

Therefore, the program state remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`n` is -1; `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `d` and `_` are the results of the bfs function call with argument 0, `d` is the result of the bfs function call starting from `a`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, and `path_ba` is a list containing `[b, -1]`**
