Output State: `n` is -1, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `d` and `_` are the results of the bfs function call with argument 0, `d` is the result of the bfs function call starting from `a`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, and `path_ba` is a list containing `[b, -1, -1, ..., -1]`.

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `n` is not equal to -1. After each iteration, `n` is added to the end of `path_ba`. Since `n` becomes -1 after the third iteration, the loop breaks. Therefore, `path_ba` will contain `-1` three times, corresponding to the three iterations where `n` was not -1.
