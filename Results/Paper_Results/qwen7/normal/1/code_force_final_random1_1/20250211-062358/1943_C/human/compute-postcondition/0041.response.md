Postcondition: `n` is -1, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `d` and `_` are the results of the bfs function call with argument 0, `d` is the result of the bfs function call starting from `a`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, and `path_ba` is a list containing `[b, -1]`. After executing the if-else block, if `n == -1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
