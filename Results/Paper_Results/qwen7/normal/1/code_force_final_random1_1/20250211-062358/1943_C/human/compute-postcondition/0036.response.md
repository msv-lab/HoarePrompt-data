Output State: **`n` is -1, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `d` and `_` are the results of the bfs function call with argument 0, `d` is the result of the bfs function call starting from `a`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, and `path_ba` is a list containing `[b, -1]` and `n` is appended to `path_ba`**.

This means that the value of `n`, which was -1, is now added to the list `path_ba`. The list `path_ba` originally contained `[b, -1]`, and after appending `n`, it becomes `[b, -1, -1]`. All other variables retain their original values.
