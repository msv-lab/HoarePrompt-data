To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions specified in the loop head:

```python
while rest != 0 and pos != len(sorted_indices):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition Analysis**:
   - The loop continues as long as `rest != 0` and `pos != len(sorted_indices)`.

2. **Current State**:
   - `rest` is equal to `k` - (`a[sorted_indices[pos]]` - `delta`) - `delta`.
   - `distance` remains unchanged.
   - `pos` is either increased by 1 or remains unchanged, depending on whether `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` equals 0.

3. **Ensuring the Loop Executes Again**:
   - For the loop to continue, both conditions must hold true:
     - `rest != 0`
     - `pos != len(sorted_indices)`

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - **`rest`**: To ensure `rest != 0`, `rest` must be non-zero. Since the current state has `rest` already calculated, no adjustment is necessary here unless `rest` becomes zero during the loop body, which is not specified.
   - **`pos`**: To ensure `pos != len(sorted_indices)`, `pos` must not be equal to `len(sorted_indices)`. The current state indicates that `pos` is either increased by 1 or remains unchanged based on the condition `a[sorted_indices[pos]] == 0`.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - We need to ensure that `pos` does not reach `len(sorted_indices)`. This means `pos` should remain within the bounds of the list `sorted_indices`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`rest` is equal to `k` - (`a[sorted_indices[pos]]` - `delta`) - `delta`, `distance` remains unchanged, and `pos` must be less than `len(sorted_indices)`**.
