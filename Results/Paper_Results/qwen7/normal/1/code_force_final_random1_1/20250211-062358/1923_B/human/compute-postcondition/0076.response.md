Postcondition: `rest` is equal to `k` - (`a[sorted_indices[pos]]` - `delta`) - `delta`, `distance` remains unchanged, and `pos` is either increased by 1 or remains unchanged, depending on whether `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` equals 0. If `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` equals 0, then `pos` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `pos` remains unchanged.
