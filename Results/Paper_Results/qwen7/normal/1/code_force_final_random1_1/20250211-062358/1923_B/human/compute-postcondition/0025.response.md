To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the loop head conditions: `rest != 0` and `pos != len(sorted_indices)`.

Let's break down the conditions:

1. **Condition 1:** `rest != 0`
   - For the loop to continue, `rest` must not be zero.
   
2. **Condition 2:** `pos != len(sorted_indices)`
   - For the loop to continue, `pos` must not be equal to the length of `sorted_indices`.

Given the postconditions from the previous iteration:
- `distance` is 0 (this does not affect the loop condition).
- `pos` is either increased by 1 or remains the same.
- `len(sorted_indices)` is greater than 0 (this does not affect the loop condition).
- `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is decreased by `delta`.
- `rest` is now `rest - min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that both conditions in the loop head are satisfied:
- `rest` should not be zero.
- `pos` should not be equal to the length of `sorted_indices`.

Since `pos` can either increase by 1 or remain the same, and `len(sorted_indices)` is already greater than 0, the key adjustment needed is ensuring that `rest` is not zero.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `rest` such that it is not zero.

State: **`distance` is 0, `pos` is either increased by 1 or remains the same, `len(sorted_indices)` is greater than 0, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is decreased by `delta`, and `rest` must be non-zero.**
