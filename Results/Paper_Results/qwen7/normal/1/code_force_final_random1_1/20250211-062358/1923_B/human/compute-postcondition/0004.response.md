Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input using `map(int, input().split())`**.

Explanation: The code `x = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `x`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
