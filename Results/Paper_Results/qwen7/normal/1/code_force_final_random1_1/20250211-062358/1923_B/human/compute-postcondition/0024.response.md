Postcondition: `distance` is 0, `pos` is either increased by 1 or remains the same, `len(sorted_indices)` is greater than 0, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is decreased by `delta`, and `rest` is now `rest - min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`.

Explanation: If `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` equals 0, then `pos` is increased by 1. In all cases, `distance` remains 0, `len(sorted_indices)` stays greater than 0, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is decreased by `delta`, and `rest` is adjusted accordingly. Since there is no else part, the conditions specified in the if part apply regardless of the value of `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`.
