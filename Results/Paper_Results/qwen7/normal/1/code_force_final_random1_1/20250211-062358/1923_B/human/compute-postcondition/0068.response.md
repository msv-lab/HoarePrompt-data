Output State: **`rest` is equal to `k`, `distance`, `pos`, and `x[sorted_indices[pos]]` remain unchanged, and the function returns False.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the value of `k` to the variable `rest`. No other variables are affected, and the postconditions state that `distance`, `pos`, and `rest` remain unchanged, and the function returns False under certain conditions. Since `rest` is now explicitly set to `k`, the function's return condition remains the same.
