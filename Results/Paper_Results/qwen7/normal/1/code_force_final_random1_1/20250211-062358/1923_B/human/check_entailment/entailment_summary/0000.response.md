Reasoning:
1. The main function `func_2()` correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
2. For each test case, it calls `func_1(a, x, k)` with the appropriate parameters.
3. The function `func_1(a, x, k)` sorts the monsters based on their distance from the origin (0).
4. It then iteratively reduces the health of the closest monsters using the available bullets (`k` per second).
5. If at any point the health of a monster becomes zero or negative, it removes it from consideration.
6. The function checks if all monsters can be defeated before any of them reach the player's position (0).

Given the problem description and the execution summary, the implementation of both functions aligns with the requirements specified in the problem statement. Therefore, the program should work correctly under the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
