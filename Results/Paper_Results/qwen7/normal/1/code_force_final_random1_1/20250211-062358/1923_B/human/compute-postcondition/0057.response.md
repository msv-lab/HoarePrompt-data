Output State: **`delta` is the minimum value between `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`, `distance` is 1, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is decreased by `delta`, `rest` is decreased by `delta`.**

Explanation: The code `a[sorted_indices[pos]] -= delta` decreases the value of `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` by the value of `delta`. Since `delta` is defined as the minimum value between `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` will be reduced by `delta`. The values of `distance` and `rest` are also decreased by `delta` as per the initial state description.
