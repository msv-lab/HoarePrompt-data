Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, followed by two lists `a` and `x`. It then calls `func_1(a, x, k)` to check a certain condition. If the condition is met, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function outputs the results for each case.**
