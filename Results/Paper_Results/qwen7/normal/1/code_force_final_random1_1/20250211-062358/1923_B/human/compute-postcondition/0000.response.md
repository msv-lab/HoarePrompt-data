Output State: **`t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, n and k remain unchanged, a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, x is a list of n integers such that -n ≤ x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_n ≤ n and x_i ≠ 0.**

This means that the value of `t` is updated to the integer input provided by the user, while the values of `n`, `k`, `a`, and `x` remain as per their initial conditions.
