Postcondition: **`distance` is 1, `pos` is `len(sorted_indices)` (after incrementing `pos` by 1), `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is undefined (as `pos` now points beyond the bounds of `sorted_indices`), and `rest` is `k` - `min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])` - `delta` (since `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is undefined, this part remains unchanged).**
