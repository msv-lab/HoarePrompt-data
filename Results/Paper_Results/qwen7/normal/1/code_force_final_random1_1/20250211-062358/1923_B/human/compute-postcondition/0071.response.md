Output State: **`rest` is equal to `k` - `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` - `delta`, `distance` remains unchanged, `pos` remains unchanged, and `x[sorted_indices[pos]]` remains unchanged.**

The code `rest -= delta` subtracts the value of `delta` from `rest`. Since `rest` was initially equal to `k - a[sorted_indices[pos]]`, after executing the code, `rest` becomes `k - a[sorted_indices[pos]] - delta`. The values of `distance`, `pos`, and `x[sorted_indices[pos]]` remain unchanged, and the function returns `False`.
