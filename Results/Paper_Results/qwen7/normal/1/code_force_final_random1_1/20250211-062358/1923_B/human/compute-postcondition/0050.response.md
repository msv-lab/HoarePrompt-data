Output State: **`distance` is 1, `pos` is less than `len(sorted_indices)`, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is reduced by `delta`, `rest` is `rest - min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`**

Explanation: The code `a[sorted_indices[pos]] -= delta` subtracts the value of `delta` from the element `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`. This changes the value of `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`. The other variables (`distance`, `pos`, and `rest`) remain unchanged according to the initial state and the code provided.
