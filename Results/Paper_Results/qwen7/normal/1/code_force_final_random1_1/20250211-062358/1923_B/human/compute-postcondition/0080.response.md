Output State: **`rest` is equal to `k` - (a[sorted_indices[pos]] - delta - delta) - delta, `distance` remains unchanged, `pos` must be less than `len(sorted_indices)`**

Explanation: The code subtracts `delta` from `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`. This changes the value of `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` but does not affect the other variables. Therefore, the updated state for `rest` includes the subtraction of `delta` from the original expression. The other variables remain unchanged.
