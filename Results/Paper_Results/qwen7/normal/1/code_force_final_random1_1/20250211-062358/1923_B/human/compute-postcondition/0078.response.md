Output State: **`rest` is equal to `k` - (`a[sorted_indices[pos]]` - `delta`), `distance` remains unchanged, `pos` must be less than `len(sorted_indices)`, and `delta` is equal to `min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`.**

Explanation: The value of `delta` is updated to be the minimum between `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
