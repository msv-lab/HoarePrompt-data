Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer minus 2. This means `t` could be any integer greater than or equal to -1 (since `t = positive_integer - 2`).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `a` is updated with new input values split by spaces and converted to integers. So, `a` is a list of integers.
- `x` is a list of integers obtained from the new input split by spaces and converted to integers.

The `print` statement is checking the result of `func_1(a, x, k)` and printing `'YES'` if the function returns `True`, otherwise it prints `'NO'`.

Since the function `func_1` is not defined, we cannot determine the exact output. However, we know that the output will be either `'YES'` or `'NO'` based on the evaluation of `func_1(a, x, k)`.

Output: **'YES' if func_1(a, x, k) returns True, otherwise 'NO'**
