Output State: **`distance` is 0, `pos` is increased by 1, `len(sorted_indices)` is greater than 0, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is decreased by `delta`, and `rest` is now `rest - min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`.**

Explanation: The code `pos += 1` increments the value of `pos` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
