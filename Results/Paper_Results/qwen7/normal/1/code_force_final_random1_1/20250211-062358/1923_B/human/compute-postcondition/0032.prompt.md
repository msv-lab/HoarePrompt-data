Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `distance` is 0, `pos` is 0, `len(sorted_indices)` is greater than 0, and the absolute value of `x[sorted_indices[pos]]` is not equal to `distance`; `rest` is `k`.
Code of the loop:
while rest != 0 and pos != len(sorted_indices):
    delta = min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])
    rest -= delta
    a[sorted_indices[pos]] -= delta
    if a[sorted_indices[pos]] == 0:
        pos += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `distance` is 0, `pos` is either increased by 1 or remains the same, `len(sorted_indices)` is greater than 0, and the absolute value of `x[sorted_indices[pos]]` is not equal to `distance`; `rest` is `rest - delta`, `delta` is `min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]]) - delta`, and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is updated accordingly (either set to 0 if the condition in the if part is met, or decreased by `delta` if the condition is not met).
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: Postcondition: `distance` is 0, `pos` is either increased by 1 or remains the same, `len(sorted_indices)` is greater than 0, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is decreased by `delta`, and `rest` is now `rest - min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`.

Explanation: If `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` equals 0, then `pos` is increased by 1. In all cases, `distance` remains 0, `len(sorted_indices)` stays greater than 0, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is decreased by `delta`, and `rest` is adjusted accordingly. Since there is no else part, the conditions specified in the if part apply regardless of the value of `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `delta` is equal to `min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`, `distance` is 0, `pos` is increased by 1, `len(sorted_indices)` is greater than 0, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is now `a[sorted_indices[pos]] - delta`, and `rest` is now `rest - delta`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
