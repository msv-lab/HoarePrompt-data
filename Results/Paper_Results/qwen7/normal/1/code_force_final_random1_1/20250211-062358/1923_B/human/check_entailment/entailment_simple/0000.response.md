### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves a game scenario where you need to survive and kill all monsters without letting any of them reach your character at point 0. You can fire up to `k` bullets per second, each reducing a monster's health by 1. After firing, any monster with health 0 or less dies, and the remaining monsters move closer to you.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function processes the list of monsters' health (`a`) and positions (`x`) to determine if you can survive.
   - It sorts the monsters based on their distance from you (`abs(x[i])`).
   - It iteratively fires bullets to reduce the health of the closest monsters until either all monsters are killed or one reaches you.
   - The logic ensures that you always target the closest monsters first, which is crucial for survival.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function handles multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases (`t`), and for each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, followed by the lists `a` and `x`.
   - It calls `func_1` for each test case and prints "YES" if `func_1` returns `True`, indicating you can survive, or "NO" otherwise.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The constraints are handled correctly within the functions.
   - The sorting and processing logic in `func_1` ensure that the closest monsters are targeted first, which is necessary to maximize your chances of survival.
   - The loop in `func_2` iterates over all test cases, ensuring that each case is processed independently.

Given the detailed analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described.
