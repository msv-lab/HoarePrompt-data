The only object in the loop head is `_`, but since it is a dummy variable, it does not affect the loop condition. The loop condition depends on the variable `t`. At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0.

Given that `t` is a positive integer, the loop will continue as long as `t > 0`. After one iteration, `t` will be decremented by 1, so `t` will be a positive integer minus 1.

State: **`t` is a positive integer minus 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input using `map(int, input().split())`**
