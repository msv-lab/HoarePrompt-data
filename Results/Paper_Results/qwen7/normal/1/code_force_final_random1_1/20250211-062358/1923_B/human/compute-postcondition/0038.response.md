Output State: **`distance` is 1, `pos` is equal to `len(sorted_indices)` - 1, `len(sorted_indices)` is greater than 0, and the absolute value of `x[sorted_indices[pos]]` is equal to `distance`; `rest` is `k`.**

The code `rest = k` assigns the value of `k` to the variable `rest`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
