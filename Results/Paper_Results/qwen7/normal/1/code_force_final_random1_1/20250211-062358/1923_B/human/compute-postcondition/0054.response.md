Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `rest != 0` and `pos != len(sorted_indices)`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `distance` is 1
   - `pos` is either `pos + 1` or remains the same
   - `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is reduced by `delta`
   - `rest` is updated to `rest - min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`
   - If `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` equals 0, then `pos` is incremented by 1

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - For the loop to continue, both conditions `rest != 0` and `pos != len(sorted_indices)` must be true.
   - If `rest == 0`, the loop will stop, so `rest` must not be 0.
   - If `pos == len(sorted_indices)`, the loop will stop, so `pos` must not be equal to `len(sorted_indices)`.

Given these points, we need to ensure that:
- `rest` is not 0.
- `pos` is not equal to `len(sorted_indices)`.

Since the loop body updates `rest` and `pos`, we don't need to explicitly adjust their values unless they meet the stopping conditions. However, we need to ensure that the loop can continue based on the given conditions.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `rest` and `pos`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`distance` is 1, `rest` is not 0, and `pos` is not equal to `len(sorted_indices)`**
