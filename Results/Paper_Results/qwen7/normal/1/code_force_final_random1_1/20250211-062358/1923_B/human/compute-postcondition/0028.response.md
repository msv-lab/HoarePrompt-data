Output State: **`delta` is equal to `min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`, `distance` is 0, `pos` is either increased by 1 or remains the same, `len(sorted_indices)` is greater than 0, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is now `a[sorted_indices[pos]] - delta`, and `rest` is now `rest - delta`.**

Explanation: The code `a[sorted_indices[pos]] -= delta` subtracts the value of `delta` from `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`. Given the initial conditions, `delta` is defined as `min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`. After executing the code, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is updated to `a[sorted_indices[pos]] - delta`, and `rest` is also updated to `rest - delta`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
