Output State: `distance` is 3, `pos` is equal to `len(sorted_indices)`, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is undefined (as `pos` now points beyond the bounds of `sorted_indices`), and `rest` is 0.

Explanation: After each iteration of the loop, `distance` increases by 1, `pos` is incremented when `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` becomes 0, and `rest` decreases by the value of `delta`, which is the minimum of `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`. The loop continues until `rest` is 0 or `pos` equals `len(sorted_indices)`. Since the loop executes 3 times as per the given output states, `distance` will be 3. After the third iteration, `rest` will be 0 because it keeps decreasing by the value of `delta` until exhausted. At the end of the loop, `pos` will be equal to `len(sorted_indices)` because `pos` is incremented each time `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` reaches 0, and there are no more elements in `sorted_indices` to process. Therefore, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is undefined as `pos` points beyond the bounds of `sorted_indices`.
