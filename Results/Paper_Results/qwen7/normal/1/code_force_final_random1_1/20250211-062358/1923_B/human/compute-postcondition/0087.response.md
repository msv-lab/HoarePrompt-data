Output State: **`rest` is equal to `k` - (a[sorted_indices[pos]] - 2*delta) - delta, `distance` remains unchanged, and `pos` must be less than `len(sorted_indices)`; `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is reduced by `delta`.**

Explanation: The code `a[sorted_indices[pos]] -= delta` subtracts `delta` from the value of `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`. The other variables (`rest`, `distance`, and `pos`) remain unchanged according to the initial state. Therefore, the updated value of `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is its original value minus `delta`.
