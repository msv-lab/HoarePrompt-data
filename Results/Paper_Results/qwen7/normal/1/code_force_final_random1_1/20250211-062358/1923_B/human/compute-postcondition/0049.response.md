Output State: **`distance` is 1, `pos` is less than `len(sorted_indices)`, `rest` is `rest - min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`**

Explanation: The variable `rest` is decreased by the value of `delta`, which is defined as `min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`. Therefore, `rest` is updated to `rest - min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`. The other variables (`distance` and `pos`) remain unchanged.
