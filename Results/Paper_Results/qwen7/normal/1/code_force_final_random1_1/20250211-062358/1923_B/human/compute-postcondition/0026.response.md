Output State: **`delta` is equal to `min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])`, `distance` is 0, `pos` is either increased by 1 or remains the same, `len(sorted_indices)` is greater than 0, `a[sorted_indices[pos]]` is decreased by `delta`, and `rest` must be non-zero.**

Explanation: The variable `delta` is assigned the minimum value between `rest` and `a[sorted_indices[pos]]`. All other variables remain in their initial states or conditions as described in the initial state.
