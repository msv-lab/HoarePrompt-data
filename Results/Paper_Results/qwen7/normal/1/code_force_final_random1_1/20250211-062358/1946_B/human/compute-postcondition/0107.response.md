Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variables in the given for loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n`. This means that at the start of each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `sm` is updated based on the condition: if the difference between `suf[i]` and `smin[i]` is greater than -111 or `sm` is -111, then `sm` remains -111. Otherwise, `sm` is set to the difference between `suf[i]` and `smin[i]`.
   - We need to know the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration to determine what happens in the next iteration.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 at each iteration, if the loop just finished an iteration where `i` was `k`, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`.
   - The value of `sm` remains unchanged unless the condition in the loop body is met, but since we are only asked to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, we focus on `i` and `n`.

5. **State at the start of the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be `k + 1` (where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration).
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is the upper bound of the loop.

Given the information provided, let's assume that at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `k` and `n` was some value `N`. For the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`.

Since the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration is not specified, we can generalize the answer based on the structure of the loop.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`sm` is updated based on the condition, `i` is `k + 1`, and `n` is `N`**.

To be more specific, if we denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `k`, then:

**State: **`sm` is updated based on the condition, `i` is `k + 1`, and `n` is `N`**.
