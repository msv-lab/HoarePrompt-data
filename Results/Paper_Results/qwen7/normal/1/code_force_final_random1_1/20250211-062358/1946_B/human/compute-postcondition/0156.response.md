Postcondition: `i` is `n - 2`, `n` is the length of the list `l`, and `smin[i]` is the suffix minimum at index `i` and `i + 1`. If `suf[i + 1]` is less than `smin[i]`, then `smin` is updated such that the suffix minimum at index `i` becomes `suf[i + 1]`. Otherwise, `smin` remains unchanged with the last element being `smin[i]`.
