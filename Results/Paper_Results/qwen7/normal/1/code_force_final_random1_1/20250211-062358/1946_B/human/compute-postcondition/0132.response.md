Output State: **`sm` is an integer, `j` is `j_prev + 1`, `t` is the same as before, `n` is the first element of the list `l`, `k` is the second element of the list `l`, `l` is a list of integers obtained from input.**

Explanation: The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, converts each integer to an int, and stores them in a list `l`. The values of `sm`, `j`, `t`, `n`, and `k` are not changed by this operation. `n` is now the first element of the list `l`, and `k` is the second element of the list `l`. The list `l` itself is the result of converting the input into a list of integers.
