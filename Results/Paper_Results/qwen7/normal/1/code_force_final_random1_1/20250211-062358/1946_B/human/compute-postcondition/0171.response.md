Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n + 1`.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `n` is the length of the list `l`
   - `smin` is a list where each element represents the minimum suffix sum up to that index in the list `l`
   - `sm` is updated to either `suf[0] - smin[0]` or `-111`, depending on whether `suf[0] - smin[0]` is greater than `-111` or if `-111` is still the current value of `sm`.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged because it is determined by the length of the list `l`, which does not change within the loop.

5. **State at the Start of the Next Iteration**:
   - `i` will be 1.
   - `n` will remain the length of the list `l`.
   - `smin` and `sm` will remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration unless the loop body updates them, but since no such update is mentioned, we assume they stay the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 1, `n` is the length of the list `l`, `smin` is a list where each element represents the minimum suffix sum up to that index in the list `l`, and `sm` is updated to either `suf[0] - smin[0]` or `-111`, depending on whether `suf[0] - smin[0]` is greater than `-111` or if `-111` is still the current value of `sm`.**
