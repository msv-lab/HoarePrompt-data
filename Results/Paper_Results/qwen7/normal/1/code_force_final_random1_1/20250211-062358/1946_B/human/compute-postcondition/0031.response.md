Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `b` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `k` is the second element of the list `b` converted to an integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from mapping `int` to the input split, `suf` is `[0, suf[0] + l[0], suf[1] + l[1], ..., suf[n-1] + l[n-1]]`, `n` is the length of the list `l`, `i` is incremented by 1, `smin` is a list of integers with one additional element `suf[i + 1]` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code appends `suf[i + 1]` to the list `smin`. Since `i` was previously incremented by 1, `i` now holds the value of `i + 1`. Therefore, `smin` now includes the value of `suf[i + 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
