Output State: **`sm` is now equal to `(sm + (a + 1) * (10 ** 9 + 7))`, `a` is the absolute value of `sm` divided by \(10^9 + 7\)**.

Explanation: The value of `sm` is updated to `sm + (a + 1) * (10 ** 9 + 7)`. Since `sm` was initially less than 0 and `a` is defined as the absolute value of `sm` divided by \(10^9 + 7\), these values remain unchanged by the operation. Therefore, `sm` is now equal to its original value plus the calculated expression involving `a`.
