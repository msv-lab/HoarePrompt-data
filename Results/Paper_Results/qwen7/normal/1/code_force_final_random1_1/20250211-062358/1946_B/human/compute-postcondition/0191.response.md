Output State: **sm is an integer calculated based on the final values of t, n, k, and l after all iterations of the loop, adjusted to ensure it is non-negative and within the range modulo \(10^9 + 7\).**

To explain this in more detail:
- The loop processes each test case (`t` times).
- For each test case, it calculates a value `sm` based on the input arrays `n`, `k`, and `l`.
- The calculations involve suffix sums, minimum prefix sums, and some arithmetic operations.
- After processing all `t` test cases, the final value of `sm` is determined.
- If `sm` is negative, it is adjusted to be non-negative using the formula provided.
- The final value of `sm` is guaranteed to be within the range \(0 \leq sm < 10^9 + 7\).
