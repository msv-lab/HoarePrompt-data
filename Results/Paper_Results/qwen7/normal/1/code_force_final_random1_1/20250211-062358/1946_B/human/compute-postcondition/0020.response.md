Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and an integer value between 1 and \(10^4\), `b` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `k` is the second element of the list `b` converted to an integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from mapping `int` to the input split, `suf` is `[0, suf[0] + l[0], suf[1] + l[1], ..., suf[n-1] + l[n-1]]`, `n` is the length of the list `l`, `i` must be less than `n`, `smin` is `[0, suf[i + 1]]`, and the current value of `suf[i + 1]` is less than the current value of `smin[i]`.**

Explanation: The code appends `suf[i + 1]` to the list `smin`. Initially, `smin` is `[0]`. After appending `suf[i + 1]`, `smin` becomes `[0, suf[i + 1]]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
