To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the conditions given:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `sm` is an integer.
   - If `sm` is less than 0, then `sm` is set to 0.
   - If `sm` is not less than 0, then `sm` is set to \(2 + \text{suf}[n]\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Conditions**:
   - If `sm < 0`, then `sm` is set to 0.
   - If `sm \geq 0`, then `sm` is set to \(2 + \text{suf}[n]\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Given these conditions, we need to consider two scenarios:

- **Scenario 1**: If `sm < 0`, then `sm` is set to 0.
- **Scenario 2**: If `sm \geq 0`, then `sm` is set to \(2 + \text{suf}[n]\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Since the exact value of `sm` is not provided in the initial state, we need to consider both possibilities:

- If `sm` was initially less than 0, it is now set to 0.
- If `sm` was initially greater than or equal to 0, it is now set to \(2 + \text{suf}[n]\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

However, regardless of the initial value of `sm`, after applying the conditions, `sm` will be either 0 or a value between 0 and \(10^9 + 6\) (since it is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\)).

Therefore, the output will be the final value of `sm` after applying the conditions.

Output: **sm (where sm is 0 if the initial sm was less than 0, otherwise sm is 2 + suf[n] modulo 10^9 + 7)**
