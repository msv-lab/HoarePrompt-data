Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `sm` is -111, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `b` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `k` is the second element of the list `b` converted to an integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from mapping `int` to the input split, `suf` is `[0, suf[0] + l[0], suf[1] + l[1], ..., suf[n-1] + l[n-1]]`, `n` is the length of the list `l`, `i` is 0 (since it starts from `n` and is decremented by 1 each iteration until it reaches 0), and `smin` is a list of integers where each element is the minimum value encountered so far from `suf[i+1]` to `suf[n]`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n + 1):
    if suf[i] - smin[i] > sm or sm == -111:
        sm = suf[i] - smin[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `sm` is updated such that if `suf[i] - smin[i]` is greater than `sm` or `sm` is equal to -111, then `sm` is set to `suf[i] - smin[i]`. If neither condition is met, `sm` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `sm` is updated based on the condition `suf[4] - smin[4]`. If `suf[4] - smin[4]` is greater than `sm` or `sm` is -111, then `sm` is set to `suf[4] - smin[4]`. Otherwise, `sm` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `sm` is updated based on the condition `suf[i] - smin[i]`, where `i` is `n + 1` and `n` remains unchanged. If `suf[i] - smin[i]` is greater than `sm` or `sm` is `-111`, then `sm` is set to `suf[i] - smin[i]`. Otherwise, `sm` retains its original value.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
