Output State: **`sm` is now (2 ** k * `sm` - `sm`).**

Explanation: The initial state defines `sm` as the maximum value of `suf[i] - smin[i]` for any `i` from 0 to `n`, or -111 if no such value exists. The code snippet updates `sm` to `(2 ** k * sm - sm)`. Since `sm` was previously defined, it gets replaced by this new expression. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged.
