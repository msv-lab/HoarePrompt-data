Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is the length of the list `l`, and `smin[i]` is the suffix minimum at index `i` and `i + 1`; `smin` has an additional element which is `smin[i]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `smin[i]` to the list `smin`. Here, `smin[i]` is the suffix minimum at index `i` and `i + 1`. After appending, the length of `smin` increases by one, and its last element is now `smin[i]`. All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
