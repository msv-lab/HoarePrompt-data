Output State: **`sm` is now equal to (2 ** k - 1) * sm**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `sm` by multiplying it with `2 ** k` and then subtracting `sm`. This can be simplified to `sm = 2 ** k * sm - sm`, which further simplifies to `sm = (2 ** k - 1) * sm`. Therefore, `sm` is now equal to `(2 ** k - 1) * sm`.
