Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Postcondition at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is `n - 1`.
   - `n` is the length of the list `l`.
   - `smin[i]` is the minimum value between the suffix minimum at index `i` and the suffix minimum at index `i + 1`.

3. **Determine the Next Values for the Loop**:
   - Since `i` is currently `n - 1`, the next value of `i` would be `n - 2` (decremented by 1).
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is the length of the list `l`, and the length of the list does not change within the loop.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` needs to be set to `n - 2`.
   - `n` remains the same, which is the length of the list `l`.
   - `smin[i]` will be the minimum value between the suffix minimum at index `i` and the suffix minimum at index `i + 1`, where `i` is now `n - 2`.

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` is the length of the list `l`, and `smin[i]` is the minimum value between the suffix minimum at index `i` and the suffix minimum at index `i + 1`**.
