Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values at the Start of the Loop**:
   - `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - `n` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

3. **Update the States Based on the Loop Head Variables**:
   - `i` is incremented by 1, so if `i` was `i` before the increment, it will now be `i + 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged, so it still needs to be the same value as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

4. **Consider the Postconditions**:
   - `smin` is updated by appending either `suf[i + 1]` or `smin[i]` to the list, whichever is smaller.
   - This means that the updated `smin` will depend on the current values of `i` and `suf` and `smin`.

Given these points, let's update the states:

- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `i + 1`.
- `n` remains the same, so `n` is still the length of the list `l`.
- `smin` will be updated based on the new value of `i`, but since we are only asked to update the initial states for the next iteration, we don't need to specify the exact updated value of `smin` here.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration are:

State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `b` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `k` is the second element of the list `b` converted to an integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from mapping `int` to the input split, `suf` is `[0, suf[0] + l[0], suf[1] + l[1], ..., suf[n-1] + l[n-1]]`, `n` is the length of the list `l`, `i` is incremented by 1, `smin` is a list of integers.**

In summary, the key changes are:
- `i` is updated to `i + 1`.
- `n` remains the same.

So, the final state is:
State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `b` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `k` is the second element of the list `b` converted to an integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from mapping `int` to the input split, `suf` is `[0, suf[0] + l[0], suf[1] + l[1], ..., suf[n-1] + l[n-1]]`, `n` is the length of the list `l`, `i` is incremented by 1, `smin` is a list of integers.**
