Output State: **`sm` is equal to `suf[i] - smin[i]`; `suf[i] - smin[i]` is greater than `sm` or `sm` is equal to -111.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `suf[i] - smin[i]` to `sm`. Since `suf[i] - smin[i]` was already greater than `sm` or equal to -111, the condition remains true after the assignment. Therefore, `sm` now holds the value of `suf[i] - smin[i]`, and the original condition about `suf[i] - smin[i]` being greater than `sm` or equal to -111 still holds.
