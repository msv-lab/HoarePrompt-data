Output State: **`i` is 1, `smin` contains `suf[3]`**

Explanation: The code appends `suf[i + 1]` to the list `smin`. Given that `i` is initially 2, `i + 1` becomes 3. Since the initial state does not provide the exact values of `smin` and `suf`, we only know that `smin` now contains the element `suf[3]`. The value of `i` is updated to 1 because the operation modifies `i` to `i + 1` within the context of the code snippet provided.
