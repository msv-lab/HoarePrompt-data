Output State: **`sm` is -111, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `b` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `k` is the second element of the list `b` converted to an integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from mapping `int` to the input split, `suf` is `[0, suf[0] + l[0], suf[1] + l[1], ..., suf[n-1] + l[n-1]]`, `n` is the length of the list `l`, `i` is 0 (since it starts from `n` and is decremented by 1 each iteration until it reaches 0), and `smin` is a list of integers where each element is the minimum value encountered so far from `suf[i+1]` to `suf[n]`.**

Explanation: The code snippet only initializes the variable `sm` to -111. It does not affect any of the other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `t`, `b`, `k`, `l`, `suf`, `n`, `i`, and `smin` remain unchanged from their initial states.
