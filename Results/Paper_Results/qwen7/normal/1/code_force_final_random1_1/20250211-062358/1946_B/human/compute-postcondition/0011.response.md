Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and an integer value between 1 and \(10^4\), `b` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `k` is the second element of the list `b` converted to an integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from mapping `int` to the input split, `suf` is `[0, suf[0] + l[0], suf[1] + l[1]]`, `n` is the length of the list `l`, `i` is `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The code appends a new element to the list `suf`, which is the sum of the current last element of `suf` and the corresponding element from the list `l`. Since the previous value of `suf` was `[0, suf[0] + l[0]]`, the new value of `suf` becomes `[0, suf[0] + l[0], (suf[0] + l[0]) + l[1]]`, which simplifies to `[0, suf[0] + l[0], suf[0] + l[0] + l[1]]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
