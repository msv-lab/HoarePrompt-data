Output State: **`sm` is equal to `suf[k + 2] - smin[k + 2]`, `i` is `k + 2`, and `n` is `N`.**

Explanation: The code updates `sm` to `suf[i] - smin[i]` where `i` is `k + 2`. This means `sm` is now specifically `suf[k + 2] - smin[k + 2]`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state, so they are still `k + 2` and `N`, respectively. All other variables and conditions remain unaffected by this operation.
