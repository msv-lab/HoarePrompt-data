Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `sm` is now equal to \(2 + \text{suf}[n] \mod (10^9 + 7)\), if `sm` is less than 0, then `sm` is adjusted to be \(-2 + (2 + 1) \times (10^9 + 7)\) and `a` is set to 2, otherwise `sm` remains as \(2 + \text{suf}[n] \mod (10^9 + 7)\), `b` is a list of strings from the input, `j` is now equal to the previous value of `j` plus 1, `n` is the first element of the list `b` converted to an integer, `k` is the second element of the list `b` converted to an integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each part to an integer, `suf` is now `[0]`, `suf[n]` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    suf.append(suf[i] + l[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `suf` is updated such that suf[i+1] = suf[i] + l[i], and the initial condition that `n` must be at least 1 remains valid.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `suf` is updated such that its i-th element is now the sum of its i-th element and `l[i]`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be at least 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `suf` is updated such that its i-th element is now the sum of its i-th element and `l[i]`, and `suf` has an additional element which is `suf[i] + l[i]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
