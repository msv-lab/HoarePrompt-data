Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is greater than 0 and an integer value between 1 and \(10^4\).
   - `b` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string.
   - `k` is the second element of the list `b` converted to an integer.
   - `l` is a list of integers obtained from mapping `int` to the input split.
   - `suf` is `[0, suf[0] + l[0]]`.
   - `n` is the length of the list `l`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was less than `n`, and the loop will continue if `i` is still less than `n`.
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, after the previous iteration, `i` is now `i + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the loop.
   - `b` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the loop.
   - `k` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the loop.
   - `l` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the loop.
   - `suf` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the loop.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the loop.

6. **Final state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` is now `i + 1`.
   - `n` must remain the same, but for the loop to execute, `i` must be less than `n`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` is greater than 0 and an integer value between 1 and \(10^4\), `b` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `k` is the second element of the list `b` converted to an integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from mapping `int` to the input split, `suf` is `[0, suf[0] + l[0]]`, `n` is the length of the list `l`, `i` is `i + 1`**.
