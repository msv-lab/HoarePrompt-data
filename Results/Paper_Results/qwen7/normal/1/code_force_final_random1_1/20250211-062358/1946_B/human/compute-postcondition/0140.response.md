Output State: **`suf` is updated by appending `suf[j + 2] + l[j + 2]` to it, `i` is `j + 2`**.

Explanation: The code appends the value of `suf[i] + l[i]` to the list `suf`. Given that `i` is set to `j + 2`, the new element appended to `suf` is `suf[j + 2] + l[j + 2]`. The value of `i` remains `j + 2` as no changes are made to it within the provided code snippet.
