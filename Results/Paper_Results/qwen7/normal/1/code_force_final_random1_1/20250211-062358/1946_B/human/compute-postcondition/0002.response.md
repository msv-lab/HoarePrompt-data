Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and an integer value between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive); `b` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string.**

Explanation: The variable `t` remains unchanged as the code does not interact with its value. The code `b = input().split()` takes user input as a string, splits it into a list of substrings based on whitespace, and assigns this list to `b`. Therefore, `t` retains its initial condition, and `b` is now a list of strings resulting from the split operation.
