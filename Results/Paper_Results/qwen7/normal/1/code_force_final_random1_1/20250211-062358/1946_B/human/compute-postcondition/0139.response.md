Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `suf` is updated by appending `suf[i] + l[i]` to it.
   - `i` is `j + 1`.

3. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from `j + 1` and the loop iterates over `range(n)`, the value of `i` will increase by 1 in each iteration.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `j + 1`. Therefore, for the next iteration, `i` should be `j + 2`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `suf` remains unchanged as it is not directly affected by the loop head variables.
   - `i` should be `j + 2`.
   - `n` remains the same.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop would be:

State: **`suf` is updated by appending `suf[i] + l[i]` to it, `i` is `j + 2`**
