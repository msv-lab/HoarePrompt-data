Output State: **`suf` is updated by appending `suf[i] + l[i]` to it, `i` is `j + 1`.**

Explanation: The code appends the sum of `suf[i]` and `l[i]` to the list `suf`. Here, `i` is set to `j + 1`. Since `n` must be greater than 0, this condition remains unchanged. The value of `i` is updated to `j + 1`, and `suf` is updated by appending the calculated value.
