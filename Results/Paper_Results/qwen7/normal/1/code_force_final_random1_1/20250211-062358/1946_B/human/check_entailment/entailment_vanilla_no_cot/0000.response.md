Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has a few issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `sm`:**
   - The logic for calculating `sm` is flawed. Specifically, the line `sm = 2 ** k * sm - sm` is not correctly implemented. This line should calculate the sum after performing `k` operations but the current implementation is incorrect.
   
2. **Use of `-111` as Initial Value:**
   - The variable `sm` is initialized with `-111`, which is not a good choice. It should be initialized to 0 or a value that makes sense for the problem.

3. **Handling Negative Values:**
   - The handling of negative values is incorrect. The logic to adjust `sm` when it is negative is not appropriate.

4. **Sufffix Sum and Minimum Suffix Sum Calculation:**
   - The suffix sums and minimum suffix sums are calculated correctly, but their use in determining the maximum possible sum is not accurate.

### Correct Solution:
Here's a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        b = input().split()
        n = int(b[0])
        k = int(b[1])
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))

        # Calculate prefix sums
        pref = [0]
        for num in l:
            pref.append(pref[-1] + num)

        # Calculate minimum prefix sum up to each index
        min_pref = [0] * (n + 1)
        min_pref[0] = pref[0]
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            min_pref[i] = min(min_pref[i - 1], pref[i])

        # Calculate the maximum possible sum after k operations
        max_sum = 0
        for i in range(n + 1):
            max_sum = max(max_sum, pref[i] - min_pref[i])

        # Apply k operations
        max_sum = (max_sum * (2 ** k - 1)) % MOD + pref[n]

        # Output the result modulo 10^9 + 7
        print(max_sum % MOD)

func()
```

This solution correctly calculates the maximum possible sum after `k` operations and handles the modulo operation appropriately.
