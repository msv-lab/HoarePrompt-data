Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is the length of the list `l`.
   - `smin` is a list where each element represents the minimum suffix sum up to that index in the list `l`.
   - `sm` is updated to `suf[1] - smin[1]` if `suf[1] - smin[1]` is greater than `-111` or remains `-111` if it is not.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n`. Since `i` is currently 1, the next value of `i` would be 2.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 2.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is determined by the length of the list `l`.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `i` becomes 2.
   - `n` remains the length of the list `l`.
   - The state of `smin` and `sm` does not change because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` is the length of the list `l`, `smin` is a list where each element represents the minimum suffix sum up to that index in the list `l`, and `sm` is updated to `suf[1] - smin[1]` if `suf[1] - smin[1]` is greater than `-111` or remains `-111` if it is not.**
