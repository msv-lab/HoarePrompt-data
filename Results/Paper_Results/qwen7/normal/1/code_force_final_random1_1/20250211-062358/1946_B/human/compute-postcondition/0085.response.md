Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `suf[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to `smin[i]`, and `smin` has an additional element which is equal to `smin[i]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `smin[i]` to the list `smin`. Since `i` is 0 initially, `smin[i]` is the first element of the list `smin`. Therefore, after executing the line `smin.append(smin[i])`, the list `smin` will have one more element which is the same as its original first element. The other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
