State: **`sm` is -111, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 0** 

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.
2. For the loop to execute, `n + 1` must be a positive integer because the `range` function generates numbers from 0 up to but not including the specified value.
3. Before the loop starts, `i` should be initialized to 0 since the loop starts with `i = 0`.
4. `sm` (which is -111) is not directly related to the loop's execution condition and does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` being 0 and `n` being greater than or equal to 0.
