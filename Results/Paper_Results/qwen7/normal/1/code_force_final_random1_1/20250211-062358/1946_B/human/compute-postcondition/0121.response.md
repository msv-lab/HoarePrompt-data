Output State: **`sm` is now 0, `a` is the absolute value of `sm` divided by \(10^9 + 7\)**.

Explanation: Initially, `sm` is 2 plus `suf[n]`, and `sm` is less than 0. Let's denote the initial value of `sm` as `sm_initial`. Given `sm` is less than 0, let's say `sm_initial = -k` where `k` is a positive integer. Also, `a` is the absolute value of `sm` divided by \(10^9 + 7\), which means `a = abs(sm_initial) / (10^9 + 7) = k / (10^9 + 7)`.

After executing `sm += (a + 1) * (10 ** 9 + 7)`, we substitute `a`:
\[ sm = -k + \left(\frac{k}{10^9 + 7} + 1\right) * (10^9 + 7) \]
\[ sm = -k + k + (10^9 + 7) \]
\[ sm = 10^9 + 7 \]

Since `10^9 + 7` is a large positive number, adding it to `-k` (where `k` is a smaller positive number) results in a positive value. However, since `sm` was initially less than 0 and we added a large positive value to it, the new value of `sm` is effectively 0 because the exact calculation would cancel out to 0 due to the nature of modular arithmetic and the large value being added. Therefore, `sm` becomes 0, and `a` remains as the absolute value of the initial `sm` divided by \(10^9 + 7\).
