Output State: **`sm` is an integer, `j` is `j_prev + 1`, `t` is the same as before, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `j`, `suf` has an additional element which is `suf[i] + l[i]`.**

Explanation: The code appends a new value to the list `suf`. The new value is calculated as `suf[i] + l[i]`, where `i` is equal to `j`. Since `j` is `j_prev + 1`, `i` is also `j_prev + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
