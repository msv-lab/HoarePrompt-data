Output State: **`i` is -1, `n` is the length of the list `l`, `smin` is a list where each element represents the minimum suffix sum up to that index in the list `l`, and `sm` is -111.**

Explanation: The initial state specifies that `i` will decrement until it reaches -1, `n` remains as the length of the list `l`, and `smin` contains the minimum suffix sums for each position in the list `l`. The variable `sm` is initialized to -111 and does not change during the loop since no operation is performed on it within the given code snippet.
