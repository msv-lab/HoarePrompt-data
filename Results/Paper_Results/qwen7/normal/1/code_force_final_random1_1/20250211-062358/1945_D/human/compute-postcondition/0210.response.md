Output State: **`y` is `max_p - 1`, `y` must be greater than or equal to 0, `custo` is the sum of `b_values[y]` for each `y` in the range from `num_fila - 1` down to `max_p - 1`, and `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is less than or equal to `a_values[y]`**.

Explanation: The code `custo += b_values[y]` increments the value of `custo` by `b_values[y]`. This means that `custo` now includes the value of `b_values[y]` in its sum. All other conditions and constraints remain the same as in the initial state.
