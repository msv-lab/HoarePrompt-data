Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by a positive integer `t`, and for each test case, it calculates a total accumulated cost `custo` based on given lists `a` and `b`. It then appends each calculated cost to a list `custos`. After processing all test cases, it prints each cost in `custos`. The final state of the program is that `custos` contains the total accumulated cost for each test case, and the console outputs these costs one by one.**
