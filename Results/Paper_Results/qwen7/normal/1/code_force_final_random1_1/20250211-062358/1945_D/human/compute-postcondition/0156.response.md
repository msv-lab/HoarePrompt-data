Postcondition: `total` is either incremented by `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` (starting from 0), `best` is either updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if it is less than the current `best`, or remains 10, `na_frente` must be greater than or equal to -1, `v` is initialized to `na_frente` and is less than or equal to `pos_final`.
