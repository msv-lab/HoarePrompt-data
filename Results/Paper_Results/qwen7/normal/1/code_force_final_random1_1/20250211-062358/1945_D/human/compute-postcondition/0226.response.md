Output State: **`y` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `custo` is the sum of `a_values[y]` for each `y` in the range from `num_fila - 1` down to `max_p - 2` added to the original `custo` value.**

Explanation: The code `custo += a_values[y]` increments the value of `custo` by `a_values[y]` for the current value of `y`. Since the initial condition specifies that `custo` is calculated based on the comparison between `a_values[y]` and `b_values[y]`, the increment operation does not change the overall logic of how `custo` is determined. The variable `y` remains unchanged, and the updated value of `custo` reflects the addition of `a_values[y]` to its previous value.
