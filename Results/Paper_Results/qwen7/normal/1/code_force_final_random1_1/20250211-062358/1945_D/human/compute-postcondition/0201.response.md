Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variable `y` and the constants `num_fila` and `max_p`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `num_fila - 1` down to `max_p - 1` with a step of `-1`. This means `y` starts from `num_fila - 1` and decreases by 1 until it reaches `max_p - 1`.

3. **Determine the New Value of `y`**: Since the loop decrements `y` by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `y` will be `y - 1`.

4. **Check the Loop Condition After Decrementing `y`**: For the loop to continue, `y` must still be greater than or equal to `max_p - 1`. Given that `y` was previously `num_fila - 1`, after decrementing, `y` becomes `num_fila - 2`.

5. **Adjust the State**: We need to ensure that `y` is set to `num_fila - 2` and that the condition `y >= max_p - 1` holds true.

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`custo` is increased by either `a_values[num_fila - 2]` or `b_values[num_fila - 2]`, depending on whether `a_values[num_fila - 2]` is less than `b_values[num_fila - 2]`; `num_fila` must be greater than or equal to `max_p`, `y` is `num_fila - 2`, and `custo` is now `custo + a_values[y]` if `a_values[y] < b_values[y]`, otherwise `custo` is `custo + b_values[y]`.**

However, since we are only adjusting the state of the objects in the loop head, the final state should be:

State: **`y` is `num_fila - 2`, and `num_fila` must be greater than or equal to `max_p`**.
