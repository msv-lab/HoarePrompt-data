Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cases` is an input integer, and the initial conditions for `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` are still valid.
Code of the loop:
for c in range(cases):
    na_frente, pos_final = map(int, input().split())
    custo_pra_trocar_a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    custo_pra_passar_b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    na_frente -= 1
    pos_final -= 1
    total = 0
    best = 10 ** 12
    for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1):
        if v <= pos_final:
            if best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]:
                best = total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
            if custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
                total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
            else:
                total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
        elif custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
            total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
        else:
            total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
    print(best)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `v` is -1, `best` is the minimum value found during the loop execution, `total` is the sum of costs accumulated according to the conditions specified in the loop body, and `na_frente`, `pos_final`, `custo_pra_trocar_a`, and `custo_pra_passar_b` retain their initial values.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `v` is -1 (since the loop decrements `v` from `na_frente` to -1, and once it reaches -1, it stops), `best` is updated to the maximum value between `10` and the accumulated `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]` for each iteration, `na_frente` is less than or equal to -1 (it will stop decrementing once `v` reaches -1), and `total` is the sum of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` for each iteration where the conditions are met.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, `v` will be -1, `best` will hold the highest value between its initial value of 10 and any updated values during the loop, `na_frente` will be less than or equal to -1, and `total` will be the cumulative cost based on the conditions specified in the loop body.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The loop will continue to iterate until `v` becomes less than -1, which means `na_frente` will decrement until it is less than -1. After all iterations, `total` will be the sum of all increments made during each iteration, and `best` will hold the minimum value between `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]` for any `v` that satisfies the conditions in the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
