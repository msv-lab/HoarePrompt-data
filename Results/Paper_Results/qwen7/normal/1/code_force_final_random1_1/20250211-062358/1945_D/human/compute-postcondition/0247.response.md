Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in the given for loop is `c`, which iterates over the elements in the list `custos`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as there are elements left in the list `custos`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `custos` must contain at least one element.

4. **Adjusting the state for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `custos` must still contain at least one element.
   - Since `c` is iterating through the elements of `custos`, after one iteration, `custos` will have at least one fewer element than before.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `custos` now contains at least one fewer element than it did at the end of the previous iteration.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`custos` must contain at least one element** (This means after one iteration, `custos` will have at least one fewer element, but it still needs to contain at least one element to continue the loop).
