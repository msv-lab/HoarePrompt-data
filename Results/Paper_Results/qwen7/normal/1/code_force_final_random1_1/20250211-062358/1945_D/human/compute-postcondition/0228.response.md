Postcondition: `custo` is an integer representing the accumulated cost based on the values of `a_values` and `b_values` according to the specified rules. If `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]` is less than or equal to `a_values[y]`, `custo` is incremented by `b_values[y]` for the current value of `y`. If `y` equals 1, `custo` is further incremented by `a_values[0]`. If the condition is not met, `custo` remains unchanged for the current `y` value, and `custo` is the sum of `a_values[y]` for each `y` in the range from `num_fila - 1` down to `max_p - 2`, plus the original `custo` value, and the process breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
