Output State: **`c` is 0, `na_frente` is `na_frente` - 2, `pos_final` is an input integer - 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.**

Explanation: The variable `pos_final` is decremented by 1, so its new value is the original value minus 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
