Output State: **`c` is 0, `na_frente` is `na_frente` - 2, `pos_final` is an input integer - 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `total` is 0**.

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `total` to 0. None of the other variables (`c`, `na_frente`, `pos_final`, `custo_pra_trocar_a`, `custo_pra_passar_b`) are affected by this line of code. Therefore, their previous values remain unchanged.
