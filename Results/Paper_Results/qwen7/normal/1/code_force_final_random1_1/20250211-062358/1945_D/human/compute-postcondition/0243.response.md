Output State: `custos` is a list containing the final value of `custo` after the loop has completed, and `custo` is the total accumulated cost based on the specified conditions over all iterations of the loop until `y` is no longer greater than 0.

This means that after the loop has executed for as many times as specified by the input `x`, `custos` will contain the cumulative `custo` values calculated for each iteration. The final output state will have `custos` as a list where each element represents the `custo` value computed for each iteration, and the last element of this list will be the total accumulated cost after all iterations.
