Output State: **`v` is an integer, `pos_final` is an integer, `v` is greater than `pos_final`, and `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is greater than or equal to `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`; `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `total` by adding the value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to it. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
