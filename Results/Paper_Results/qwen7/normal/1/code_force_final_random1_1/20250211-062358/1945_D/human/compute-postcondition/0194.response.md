Postcondition: `custo` is increased by either `a_values[y]` or `b_values[y]` depending on the condition. Specifically, if `a_values[y]` is less than `b_values[y]`, then `custo` is increased by `a_values[y]`; otherwise, `custo` is increased by `b_values[y]`. Additionally, `num_fila` remains greater than or equal to `max_p`.
