Output State: **`v` is -1, `best` is the maximum value between 10 and the accumulated `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]` from the previous iteration, `na_frente` is `na_frente - 1`, `total` is 0, and `pos_final` is an input integer; `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from user input.**

Explanation: The variable `na_frente` is decremented by 1, so its new value is `na_frente - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged based on the initial state.
