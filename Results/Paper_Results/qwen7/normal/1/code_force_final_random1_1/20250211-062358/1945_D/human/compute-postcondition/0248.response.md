Given the initial state that `custos` must contain at least one element, but no specific value or further details about `custos` are provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `c` since `c` is not mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, we can only state that `c` is an element of `custos`.

Output: **c (where c is an element of custos)**
