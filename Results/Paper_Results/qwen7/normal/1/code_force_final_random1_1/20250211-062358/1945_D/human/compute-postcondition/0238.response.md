Postcondition: `custo` is an integer, and `y` is one less than its final value. If `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]` is true, then `custo` remains unchanged and `y` is one less than its final value. If the condition is false, `custo` is increased by `a_values[y]`, `y` is one less than the new value of `custo`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.
