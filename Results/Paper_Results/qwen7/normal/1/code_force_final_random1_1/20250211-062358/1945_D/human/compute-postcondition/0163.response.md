Output State: **`total` is incremented by `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if it is less than the current `best`, `na_frente` must be greater than or equal to -1, `v` is now `v - 1` and less than or equal to `pos_final`.**

Explanation: The code `total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]` increments the value of `total` by `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. The other conditions and constraints remain unchanged, so `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if it is less than the current `best`, `na_frente` must be greater than or equal to -1, and `v` is now `v - 1` and less than or equal to `pos_final`.
