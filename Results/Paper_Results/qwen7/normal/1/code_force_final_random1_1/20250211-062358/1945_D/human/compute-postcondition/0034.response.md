Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `v` and `na_frente`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates from `na_frente` to `-1` in reverse order. This means that at the start of each iteration, `v` is decremented by 1.

3. **Determine the new state of `v`**: Since the loop decrements `v` by 1, at the start of the next iteration, `v` will be `v - 1`.

4. **Determine the new state of `na_frente`**: The value of `na_frente` remains unchanged within the loop body unless explicitly modified. Therefore, `na_frente` stays the same.

5. **Postconditions and their implications**:
   - If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, `best` might be updated, and `total` might be updated based on the costs.
   - If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, `total` might be updated based on the costs.

Given these points, let's determine the new state:

- `v` will be decremented by 1.
- `na_frente` remains unchanged.
- `pos_final` remains unchanged.
- `best` might be updated, but since no specific information about its state is given, we assume it remains unchanged.
- `total` might change based on the conditions inside the loop, but since we are only asked to adjust the states at the start of the next iteration, we don't need to specify the exact value of `total`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`v` is an integer such that `v = v - 1`, `na_frente` is an integer (unchanged), `pos_final` is an integer (unchanged), `best` is an integer (unchanged), and `total` is an integer (unchanged)**.
