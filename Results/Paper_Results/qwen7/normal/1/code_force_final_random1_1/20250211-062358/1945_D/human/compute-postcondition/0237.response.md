Output State: **`custo' is an integer increased by `a_values[y]`, `y` is one less than the new value of `custo', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of `custo` or `y`. It only breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement it is within. Therefore, the values of `custo` and `y` remain unchanged from their initial state.
