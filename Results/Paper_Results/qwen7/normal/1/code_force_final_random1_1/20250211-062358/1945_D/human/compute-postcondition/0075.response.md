Output State: **`v` is -1, `best` is `total` + `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, `na_frente` must be greater than -1, and the current value of `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`.**

Explanation: The variable `best` is updated to the value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. The other variables (`v`, `na_frente`, and the condition about `v` being less than or equal to `pos_final`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
