Output State: **`v` is -2, `best` is updated to either `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[-2]` or `total + custo_pra_passar_b[-2]` depending on whether `best` is greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[-2]`, `na_frente` must be greater than -1, and `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[-2]`**.

Explanation: The code `total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` updates the value of `total` by adding `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` to it. Given that `v` is -2, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[-2]`. The other variables (`best`, `na_frente`) remain unchanged from their initial postconditions.
