Output State: **`v` is -1, `best` is 10, `na_frente` must be greater than -1, `v` is greater than `pos_final`, `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is greater than or equal to `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `total` is `total + custo_pra_passar_b[-1]`**

Explanation: The code updates the `total` variable by adding the value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, which is `custo_pra_passar_b[-1]` since `v` is -1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
