Output State: **The value of `custo` is the sum of either `a_values[y]` or `b_values[y]` for each `y` in the range from `num_fila - 1` down to `max_p - 1`, depending on whether `a_values[y]` is less than `b_values[y]`.**

In more detail, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `custo` will hold the cumulative sum of the values from the list `a_values` and `b_values` based on the condition specified in the loop. Specifically, for each index `y` starting from `num_fila - 1` and decrementing to `max_p - 1`, if `a_values[y]` is less than `b_values[y]`, then `a_values[y]` is added to `custo`; otherwise, `b_values[y]` is added to `custo`. The loop continues until it reaches the index `max_p - 1`.
