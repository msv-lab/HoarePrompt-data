Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes inputs through lists a and b, where for each test case t, n and m are positive integers with 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, and a and b are lists of n positive integers ranging from 1 to 10^9. It returns information based on these inputs.**
