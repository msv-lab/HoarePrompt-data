Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `v` in the range `range(na_frente, -1, -1)`. This means `v` starts from `na_frente` and decrements by 1 until it reaches `-1`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `v` is greater than or equal to `-1`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `v` is -2 (which means the previous iteration ended when `v` was -2).
   - `best` is updated based on the condition given.
   - `na_frente` must be greater than -1.
   - `total` is increased by either `custo_pra_trocar_a[-2]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[-2]` accordingly.
   - Additional postcondition: If `v > pos_final`, then `best` is 10, `v` is greater than `pos_final`, and `total` is the original value of `total` plus `custo_pra_passar_b[-2]`.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `v` is currently -2, the next value of `v` would be -3 if the loop continues.
   - `na_frente` must still be greater than -1.
   - `total` will be increased by either `custo_pra_trocar_a[-3]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[-3]` accordingly.

5. **Check the Additional Postcondition**:
   - The additional postcondition does not affect the current state since `v` is -2 and not greater than `pos_final`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `v` is -3.
- `na_frente` must be greater than -1.
- `total` is increased by either `custo_pra_trocar_a[-3]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[-3]` accordingly.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `v` is -3, `na_frente` must be greater than -1, `total` is increased by either `custo_pra_trocar_a[-3]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[-3]` accordingly.**
