Output State: **`total` is incremented by `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if it is less than the current `best`, `na_frente` is greater than or equal to -1, `v` is now `v - 1` and greater than or equal to -1.**

This means that the `total` variable has been incremented by the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. The `best` variable has been updated to the sum of the new `total` and `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if this new value is less than the previous value of `best`. The conditions for `na_frente` and `v` remain unchanged, with `na_frente` still being greater than or equal to -1 and `v` being decremented by 1 and still greater than or equal to -1.
