Output State: **`v` is -1, `best` is 10, `na_frente` must be greater than -1, and `v` is greater than `pos_final`, and the current value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than the current value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`; `total` is the original value of `total` plus the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`**.

This means that the variable `total` has been updated by adding the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` to its original value, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
