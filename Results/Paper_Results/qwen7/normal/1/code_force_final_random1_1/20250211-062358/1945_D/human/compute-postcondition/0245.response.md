To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects present in the loop head. The loop head here is:

```python
for c in custos:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

From this, we can identify the following objects:
- `c`: This variable iterates over the elements in `custos`.

Given the description, `custos` is a list containing the total accumulated cost `custo` after the loop has executed for all iterations. Each iteration processes different sets of input values for `num_fila` and `max_p`, along with corresponding lists `a_values` and `b_values`, to compute `custo`.

Since the loop iterates over `custos`, the only object in the loop head is `c`. For the loop to execute, `custos` must contain at least one element (since the loop will iterate over each element in the list).

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is that `custos` must contain at least one element.

State: **`custos` must contain at least one element**
