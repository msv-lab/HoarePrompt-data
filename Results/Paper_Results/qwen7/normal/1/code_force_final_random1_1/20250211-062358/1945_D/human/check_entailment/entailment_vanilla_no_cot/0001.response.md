Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads an integer `x` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of people `num_fila` and the maximum allowable final position `max_p`.
   - It then reads two lines of space-separated integers: `a_values` and `b_values`.

2. **Cost Calculation:**
   - The program initializes `custo` (total cost) to 0.
   - It iterates from `num_fila - 1` down to `max_p - 1`, adding the appropriate cost (`a_values[y]` or `b_values[y]`) to `custo`.
   - After reaching `max_p - 1`, it iterates from `max_p - 1` down to 1, adjusting the cost based on the conditions provided.

3. **Cost Adjustment Logic:**
   - The logic for adjusting costs seems to be checking whether moving Kirill to the previous position would save more coins compared to staying in the current position.
   - If moving to the previous position saves more coins, it updates the cost accordingly.

### Detailed Breakdown:

1. **Initial Cost Calculation:**
   - The initial part of the loop where it calculates costs from `num_fila - 1` down to `max_p - 1` is correct. This ensures that the initial cost is calculated correctly based on the given rules.

2. **Subsequent Cost Adjustment:**
   - The subsequent loop from `max_p - 1` down to 1 checks if moving Kirill to the previous position would result in a lower total cost. This is done by comparing the cost of moving to the previous position with the current cost.
   - The logic here seems to be correct as it ensures that Kirill minimizes the cost by making optimal moves.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The edge case handling, especially when `y == 1`, is correctly handled by adding the cost of the first position and breaking out of the loop.

### Conclusion:

After analyzing the program, it appears that the logic for calculating the minimum cost is sound and follows the problem statement correctly. There are no apparent errors in the logic or the implementation.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
