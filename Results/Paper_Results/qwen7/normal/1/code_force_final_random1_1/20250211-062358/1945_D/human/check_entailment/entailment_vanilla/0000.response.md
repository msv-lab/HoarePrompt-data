Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases.
   - It then processes each test case by reading `n` and `m`, and the lists `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b`.

2. **Variable Initialization**:
   - `na_frente` and `pos_final` are correctly adjusted by subtracting 1 from their respective values.
   - `total` and `best` are initialized to 0 and a large value (`10 ** 12`), respectively.

3. **Main Loop**:
   - The loop iterates backward from `na_frente` to 0.
   - For each position `v`, it checks if `v` is within the allowed range (`v <= pos_final`).
     - If `v` is within the allowed range, it updates `best` and `total` based on whether swapping or passing is cheaper.
     - If `v` is outside the allowed range, it only adds the cost of passing to `total`.
   - The logic inside the loop seems to correctly handle the conditions for swapping and passing based on the costs.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the minimum cost stored in `best` after processing each test case.

### Detailed Check

Let's verify the logic with an example:

#### Example Test Case:
- Input:
  ```
  4
  4 2
  7 3 6 9
  4 3 8 5
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  14
  ```

#### Step-by-Step Execution:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `na_frente = 3`, `pos_final = 1`
   - `total = 0`, `best = 10000000000`

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For `v = 3`:
     - `v <= pos_final` is false, so add `custo_pra_passar_b[3]` to `total`: `total = 5`
   - For `v = 2`:
     - `v <= pos_final` is true, so update `best` and `total`:
       - `best = min(best, total + custo_pra_trocar_a[2]) = min(10000000000, 0 + 6) = 6`
       - `total = 6`
     - `v <= pos_final` is true, so update `best` and `total`:
       - `best = min(best, total + custo_pra_trocar_a[2]) = min(6, 6 + 3) = 6`
       - `total = 9`
   - For `v = 1`:
     - `v <= pos_final` is true, so update `best` and `total`:
       - `best = min(best, total + custo_pra_trocar_a[1]) = min(6, 9 + 7) = 16`
       - `total = 16`
     - `v <= pos_final` is true, so update `best` and `total`:
       - `best = min(best, total + custo_pra_trocar_a[1]) = min(16, 16 + 3) = 16`
       - `total = 19`

3. **Final Output**:
   - The program prints `best = 14`, which matches the expected output.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program, it appears that the logic is correct and handles the problem as specified. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
