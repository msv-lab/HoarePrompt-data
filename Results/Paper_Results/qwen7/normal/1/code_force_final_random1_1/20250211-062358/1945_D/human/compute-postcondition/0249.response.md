Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `c` which iterates over the elements of `custos`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop continues as long as there are elements left in `custos`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**: 
   - `custos` must contain at least one element.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues as long as there are elements in `custos`, for the loop to execute one more time, `custos` must still contain at least one element.

5. **State Adjustment**:
   - The only variable in the loop head is `c`, but we cannot directly adjust `c` because it changes with each iteration.
   - We need to ensure that `custos` still contains at least one element for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `custos` must still contain at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`custos` must contain at least one element**
