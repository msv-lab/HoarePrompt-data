Output State: **`v` is -1, `best` is the minimum value found during the loop execution, `total` is the sum of costs accumulated according to the conditions specified in the loop body, `na_frente` is an input integer, `pos_final` is an input integer, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from input split and converted to integers, `c` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `custo_pra_passar_b = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `custo_pra_passar_b`. The other variables (`v`, `best`, `total`, `na_frente`, `pos_final`, and `c`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, their states remain unchanged except for `c`, which is incremented by 1.
