Output State: **`custo` is now the original value of `custo` plus `b_values[y]` for the current value of `y`.**

Explanation: The code `custo += b_values[y]` increments the value of `custo` by `b_values[y]`. The initial value of `custo` is defined based on the conditions given, but after executing this line of code, `custo` will be updated to include the value of `b_values[y]` for the current value of `y`. The other variables (`y`, `num_fila`, `max_p`, `a_values`, and `b_values`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
