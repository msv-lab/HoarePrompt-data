Output State: **`v` is -1, `best` is the minimum value found during the loop execution, `total` is the sum of costs accumulated according to the conditions specified in the loop body, `na_frente` is an input integer, `pos_final` is an input integer, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from input split and converted to integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` retains its initial value, `c` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of space-separated integers from the input and converts them to a list of integers using the `map` function and `int`. This list is assigned to the variable `custo_pra_trocar_a`. The values of `v`, `best`, `total`, `na_frente`, `pos_final`, `custo_pra_passar_b`, and `c` remain unchanged from their initial states.
