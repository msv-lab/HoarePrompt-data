Postcondition: **`i` is the first element of the list `s` after the swaps, `s` is the list after the swaps. If `i` equals `h`, then `z` is 1 and `ans1` is increased by 1. If `i` is greater than `h`, we break out of the loop or if statement. Otherwise, `i` is less than or equal to `h`, and if `z` is 1, then `ans1` is increased by 1.**
