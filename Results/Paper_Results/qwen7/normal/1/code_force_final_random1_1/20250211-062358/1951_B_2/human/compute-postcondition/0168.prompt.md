Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `p` is equal to `j`, `j` is equal to the length of the list `s` minus 1, `ans` is the count of elements in `s` that are greater than or equal to `h`, `i` is the last element of the list `s`, `z` is 0, `n` is the original input integer, `k` is the original input integer, `h` is the first element of the list `s`, `ans1` is 0, the first element of the list `s` and the last element of the list `s` have swapped positions, the element at index `p` in the list `s` and the element at index `k - 1` in the list `s` have swapped positions.
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    if i == h:
        if s[0] != h:
            ans1 += 1
        z = 1
    elif i > h:
        break
    elif z == 1:
        ans1 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is the first element of the list `s` after the swaps, `s` is the list after the swaps. If `i` equals `h`, then `z` is 1 and `ans1` is increased by 1. If `i` is greater than `h`, we break out of the loop or if statement. Otherwise, `i` is less than or equal to `h`, and if `z` is 1, then `ans1` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is the second element of the list `s` after the swaps, `s` is the list after the swaps, `z` is unchanged, and `ans1` is either unchanged or incremented by 1, depending on whether `z` equals 1 or the first element of `s` is not equal to `h`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is the third element of the list `s` after the swaps, `s` is the list after the swaps, `z` is unchanged, and `ans1` is incremented by 1 if `z` equals 1 or the first element of `s` is not equal to `h`. Otherwise, `ans1` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
