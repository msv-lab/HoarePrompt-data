Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in s[1:]`. The objects involved here are `i` and `s`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `s` is a list of integers with the first and the k-1th elements swapped.
   - `i` is the last element of the new list `s`.
   - `ans1` is the count of elements in `s` that are equal to `h` plus one if the first element was not `h`.
   - `z` is 1 if the last element of the new list `s` is equal to `h`, otherwise `z` remains 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `k` is an input integer.
   - `h` is the first element of the list `s`.
   - `ans` is 0.
   - `j` is -1.

3. **Adjust the state of `i` and `s` for the loop to execute**:
   - `i` is set to the last element of the list `s` after the swap operation.
   - For the loop to start, `s[1:]` should contain at least one element. This means `s` must have more than one element.

4. **Consider the initial conditions**:
   - Since `i` is the last element of `s`, and the loop starts from `s[1:]`, `i` will be the second-to-last element of `s` when the loop begins.
   - Therefore, `s` must have at least two elements for the loop to execute.

5. **Final state adjustment**:
   - We need to ensure that `s` has at least two elements.
   - `i` will be the second-to-last element of `s`.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `s` (to ensure it has at least two elements) and `i` (to be the second-to-last element of `s`).

**State:**
**`s` is a list of integers with the first and the k-1th elements swapped that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is the second-to-last element of `s`**
