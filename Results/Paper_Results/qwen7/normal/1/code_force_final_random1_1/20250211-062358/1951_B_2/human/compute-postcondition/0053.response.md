Postcondition: **The loop will continue to execute as long as there are more elements in the list `a` that have not been checked (i.e., `i < n`), and it will stop when `c` reaches 2 or when all elements in `a` have been checked. Additionally, `k` equals 14, the loop continues under the same conditions. `ind` is not an empty list, and the length of `ind` is not equal to 1. The first element of `ind` is not 0. The value of `k` is less than or equal to the second element of `ind`.**
