Output State: **`i` is an element in `s` such that `i` is not equal to `h`, `s` must still contain at least one element that is not equal to `h`, `z` and `ans1` remain unchanged and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This means that the `break` statement causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is within, without changing the values of `i`, `s`, `h`, `z`, and `ans1`.
