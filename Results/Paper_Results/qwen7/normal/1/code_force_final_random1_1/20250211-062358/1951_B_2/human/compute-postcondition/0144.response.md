Output State: **`i` is the second element of the list `s` after the swaps, `s` is the list after the swaps, `z` is unchanged, `ans1` is `ans1` + 1.**

Explanation: The code `ans1 += 1` increments the value of `ans1` by 1. Since `ans1` was unchanged before the execution of this line, after executing this line, `ans1` will be its original value plus one. All other variables remain unchanged.
