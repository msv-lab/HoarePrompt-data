Postcondition: `odd` is an empty list, `y` is `-next_gap // 2 - first_odd // 2 - second_odd // 2 - gap // 2`, `ans` is incremented by the value of `first_odd + 2 * y + gap + second_odd`, `even` must contain at least one element, and `gap` is the first element of `even`. If `y < gap // 2`, then `y` is set to 0 and `ans` is incremented by the value of `first_odd + 2 * y + gap + second_odd + 2 * y`. Otherwise, no change occurs to `y` and `ans`.
