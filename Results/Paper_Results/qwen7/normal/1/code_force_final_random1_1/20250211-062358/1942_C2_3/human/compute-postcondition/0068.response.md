Postcondition: `a` is a list of integers, `ans` is increased by 1 if the value of `a[i]` is exactly 2 more than the value of `a[i-1]`. If the difference between the i-th element and the (i-1)-th element is not equal to 2, or if the difference is even and the current value of `y` is less than or equal to the difference between the i-th element and the (i-1)-th element divided by 2 minus 2, then no changes occur to `tmp` and `ans`. Otherwise, `tmp` is a list containing one element, which is `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`, and `ans` is increased by `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`.
