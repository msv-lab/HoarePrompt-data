Output State: **`tmp` now contains an additional element which is `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`, `ans` is increased by `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`, `a` and `i` retain their previous values.**

This means that the value of `tmp` remains unchanged except for the addition of the new element `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`. The variable `ans` has been updated by adding the value of `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` to its current value. The lists `a` and the index `i` remain unchanged from their previous states.
