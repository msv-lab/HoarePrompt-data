Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in val`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i`.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is the second element in `val`.
   - `c` is `i // 2`.
   - `y` is decreased by `i // 2`.
   - `sx` is the new value of `i` plus the previous value of `sx`.
   - `y` is now `y - (i // 2)`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in `val`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is the second element in `val`, the next value of `i` will be the third element in `val`.
   - `c` will be updated to the new value of `i // 2`.
   - `y` will be further decreased by the new value of `i // 2`.
   - `sx` will be updated to include the new value of `i`.
   - `y` will be updated to reflect the new decrease.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is the third element in `val`.
- `c` is the new value of `i // 2`.
- `y` is further decreased by the new value of `i // 2`.
- `sx` includes the new value of `i` plus the previous value of `sx`.
- `y` reflects the new decrease.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `i` is the third element in `val`, `c` is the new value of `i // 2`, `y` is further decreased by the new value of `i // 2`, `sx` is the new value of `i` plus the previous value of `sx`, and `y` is now `y - (i // 2)`**
