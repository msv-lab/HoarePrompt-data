You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version 0 \leq y \leq n - x . You
can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , 0 \leq y \leq n - x )
— the number of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen,
and the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 2
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    7 3 1
    
    6 4 3
    
    4 2 2
    
    1 3

Output

    6
    5
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 6 , 5 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that Bessie chose, the yellow dots represent
vertices that you chose, the blue lines represent diagonals that are drawn,
and the red numbers represent triangles that are counted.

    #State: Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, and the following conditions hold:
    #
    #- `ii` is equal to the total number of iterations, which is the same as the length of the list `a`.
    #- `n` is the first integer input for each iteration.
    #- `x` is the second integer input for each iteration.
    #- `y` is the third integer input for each iteration, adjusted according to the conditions within the loop.
    #- `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order for each iteration.
    #- `ans` is the final result calculated after considering all the conditions within the loop. It starts as `x + y - 2` and is incremented by the differences between consecutive elements in `a` that satisfy certain conditions, as well as by the difference between `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` if it satisfies the condition.
    #- `tmp` is a list containing the valid differences between consecutive elements in `a` that satisfy the condition `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`.
    #- `i` is the length of the list `a`.
    #- `ans` is further incremented by `y` after all iterations.
    #
    #The final `ans` value is the minimum of itself and `n - 2`, ensuring it does not exceed `n - 2`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `tt`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `x`, and `y` and the list of chosen vertices `a`.
   - It sorts the list of chosen vertices `a`.

2. **Initial Calculation of Triangles:**
   - The initial number of triangles is calculated as `x + y - 2`. This is because initially, we have `x` chosen vertices, and adding `y` more vertices can form additional triangles.

3. **Finding Pairs of Vertices with Even Distance:**
   - The program iterates through the sorted list of chosen vertices to find pairs of vertices with an even distance.
   - For each pair where the distance is even, it calculates how many triangles can be formed and updates the answer accordingly.
   - It also updates the remaining count of `y` after forming these triangles.

4. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The program checks the distance between the first and last chosen vertices, considering the circular nature of the polygon.
   - If this distance is even, it forms additional triangles and updates the answer.

5. **Final Answer Calculation:**
   - The final answer is the minimum of the calculated number of triangles and `n - 2`. This ensures that the answer does not exceed the total number of possible triangles in a polygon with `n` sides.

### Correctness Check

To verify the correctness, let's consider the example provided in the problem statement:

#### Example 1:
- Input:
  ```
  3
  8 4 2
  1 6 2 5
  7 3 1
  6 4 3
  4 2 2
  1 3
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  6
  5
  2
  ```

#### Analysis of Example 1:
1. **Test Case 1:**
   - `n = 8`, `x = 4`, `y = 2`
   - Chosen vertices: `[1, 2, 5, 6]`
   - Initial triangles: `4 + 2 - 2 = 4`
   - Checking distances:
     - Distance between 1 and 2 is 1 (not even).
     - Distance between 2 and 5 is 3 (not even).
     - Distance between 5 and 6 is 1 (not even).
     - Distance between 6 and 1 is 2 (even). Forms 1 triangle.
   - Final triangles: `4 + 1 = 5`
   - Adding remaining `y = 1` vertex forms 1 more triangle.
   - Final answer: `5 + 1 = 6`

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - `n = 7`, `x = 3`, `y = 1`
   - Chosen vertices: `[4, 6, 3]`
   - Initial triangles: `3 + 1 - 2 = 2`
   - Checking distances:
     - Distance between 3 and 4 is 1 (not even).
     - Distance between 4 and 6 is 2 (even). Forms 1 triangle.
     - Distance between 6 and 3 is 4 (even). Forms 2 triangles.
   - Final triangles: `2 + 1 + 2 = 5`

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - `n = 4`, `x = 2`, `y = 2`
   - Chosen vertices: `[1, 3]`
   - Initial triangles: `2 + 2 - 2 = 2`
   - Checking distances:
     - Distance between 1 and 3 is 2 (even). Forms 1 triangle.
   - Final triangles: `2 + 1 = 3`

The program correctly handles the example cases and produces the expected output.

### Conclusion
