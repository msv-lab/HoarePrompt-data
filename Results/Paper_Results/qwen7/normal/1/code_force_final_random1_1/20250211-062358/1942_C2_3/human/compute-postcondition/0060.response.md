Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, the value of `a[i]` is 2 more than the value of `a[i-1]`; `ans` is increased by 1.**

The code `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. Since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `ans`, it is only stated that `ans` has been increased by 1. The list `a` remains unchanged according to the given code snippet.
