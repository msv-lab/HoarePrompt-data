Output State: **`tt` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `ii` is 1, `n` is the first integer input, `x` is the second integer input, `y` is the third integer input, `a` is a list of three integers sorted in ascending order, `ans` is `x + y - 1`, `tmp` is an empty list, `i` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. Initially, `ans` was set to `x + y - 2`. After executing `ans += 1`, the new value of `ans` becomes `x + y - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
