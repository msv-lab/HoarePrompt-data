Postcondition: `i` is 1, `a` is a list of integers, `ans` is either increased by 1 if the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is 2, or set to `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` if the difference is not 2, and `y` is decreased by `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1 if the difference is not 2. `tmp` is a list containing one element which is `(a[1] - a[0]) // 2` if the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is 2.
