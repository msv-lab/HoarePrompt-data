Postcondition: `tt` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `ii` is 1, `n` is the first integer input, `x` is the second integer input, `y` is the second integer input minus ((`a[i]` - `a[i - 1]`) // 2 - 1), `a` is a list of three integers sorted in ascending order, `ans` is `x + y - 2 + (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`, `tmp` is a list containing the value (`a[i]` - `a[i - 1]) // 2`, `i` is 1, `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is even, and the current value of `y` is greater than (`a[i] - a[i - 1]`) / 2 - 1.

This means that after the if-else block executes, `tt` remains within the specified range, `ii` is set to 1, `n`, `x`, and `y` retain their initial meanings with adjustments based on the conditions inside the if statement, `a` remains a sorted list of three integers, `ans` is updated based on the if condition, `tmp` contains the relevant value, `i` is 1, `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is even, and `y` satisfies the specified inequality.
