Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `c` is 1, `i` is `x`, `sx` is the sum of all `c` values added to `sx` during the loop's execution, `val` is a list containing all the `c` values added to it during the loop's execution, `x` is at least as large as the final value of `i - 1`, and `l` is a sorted list of random values with the additional element `n + l[0]` appended to it, with `val` sorted by a key that prioritizes even numbers over odd numbers and then by their natural order.
Code of the loop:
for i in val:
    c = i // 2
    if y < c:
        sx += y * 2
        break
    sx += i
    y -= c


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is the first element in `val`; `c` is `i // 2`; `y` is decreased by `i // 2`; `sx` is `i` plus the previous value of `sx`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is the second element in `val`, `c` is `i // 2`, `y` is decreased by `i // 2`, `sx` is the new value of `i` plus the previous value of `sx`, and `y` is now `y - (i // 2)`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is the third element in `val`, `c` is `i // 2`, `y` is decreased by `i // 2`, `sx` is the new value of `i` plus the previous value of `sx`, and `y` is now `y - (i // 2)`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
