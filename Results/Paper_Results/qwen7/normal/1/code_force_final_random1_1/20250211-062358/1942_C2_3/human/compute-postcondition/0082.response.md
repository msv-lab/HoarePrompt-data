Output State: **`i` is `k + 2`, `ans` is `ans + (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`, `tmp` is a list with one additional element which is `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans` by adding `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` to its current value. The value of `i` remains `k + 2`, and `tmp` gains an additional element which is `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`.
