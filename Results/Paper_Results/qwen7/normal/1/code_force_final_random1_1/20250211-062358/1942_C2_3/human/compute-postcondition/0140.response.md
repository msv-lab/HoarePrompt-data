Postcondition: `a` and `i` retain their previous values. If `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0` and `y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, then `tmp` now contains an additional element which is `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`, `ans` is increased by `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, and `y` is decreased by `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`. Otherwise, `tmp`, `ans`, and `y` retain their previous values.
