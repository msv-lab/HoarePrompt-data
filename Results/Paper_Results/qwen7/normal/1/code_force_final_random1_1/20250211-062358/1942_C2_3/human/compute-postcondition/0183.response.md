Based on the initial state provided:

- `cons` is defined as `min(n - 2, x + sx - 2)`
- `i` is the last element in `val`
- `c` is `i // 2`
- `y` is decreased by the sum of all `c` values
- `sx` is the sum of all `i` values plus the initial value of `sx`
- `val` and `l` remain sorted as per the given conditions

The `print(cons)` statement will print the value of `cons`.

To determine the exact value of `cons`, we need to know the values of `n`, `x`, and `sx`. However, since these values are not explicitly provided, we can only express `cons` in terms of these variables.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **min(n - 2, x + sx - 2)**
