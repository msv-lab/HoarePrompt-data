Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the chosen vertices are consecutive. For example, consider the input:

```
4 2 2
1 3
```

In this case, the program will incorrectly calculate the number of triangles. The correct number of triangles that can be formed is 2, but the program will calculate it as 4 because it does not properly account for the fact that consecutive vertices cannot form a diagonal. This can be seen in the logic where the program checks the difference between consecutive chosen vertices and adds to `ans` without considering the constraints properly. Specifically, the condition `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1` does not correctly handle the case of consecutive vertices.
