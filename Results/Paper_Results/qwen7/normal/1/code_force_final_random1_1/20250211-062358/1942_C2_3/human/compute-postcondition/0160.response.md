Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases where each test case includes integers t, n, x, and y. The variable t represents the number of test cases, with a constraint that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, x, and y are integers with specific constraints: 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 ⋅ 10^5), and 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x. The vertices chosen by Bessie are represented as x distinct integers from 1 to n, and the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5. The function returns results based on the given inputs for each test case.**
