Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tt` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `tt` ≤ 10^4.
Code of the loop:
for ii in range(tt):
    n, x, y = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort()
    ans = x + y - 2
    tmp = []
    for i in range(1, len(a)):
        if a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2:
            ans += 1
        elif (a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1:
            tmp.append((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2)
            ans += (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2
            y -= (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1
    if a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2:
        ans += 1
    elif (a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]
        ) // 2 - 1:
        tmp.append((a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2)
        ans += (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2
        y -= (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1
    ans += y
    print(min(ans, n - 2))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `tt` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `ii` is the total number of iterations the loop executed and is now equal to the length of the list `a`, `n` is the first integer input, `x` is the second integer input, `y` is the second integer input minus the sum of ((`a[i]` - `a[i - 1]`) // 2 - 1) for each valid pair of consecutive elements, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `ans` is `x + y - 2` plus the sum of (`a[i]` - `a[i - 1]) // 2 for each valid pair of consecutive elements, `tmp` is a list containing the values (`a[i]` - `a[i - 1]) // 2 for each valid pair of consecutive elements, `i` is the length of the list `a`, `ans` is increased by 1 if `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` equals 2. Otherwise, if `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is even and `y` is greater than (`a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, then `y` is updated to `y - 1` and `tmp` includes the value (`a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2, otherwise, `y` remains unchanged and `tmp` does not change, `ans` is increased by `y`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is `len(a)`, `ans` is an integer plus `y`, and `tmp` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `ans` is the sum of all increments made during the loop plus `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, `tmp` retains its original list of valid elements added during the loop based on the conditions and now includes the element \((a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2\), `y` is the final value after all decrements have been applied minus `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, and `ans` is incremented by `y`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
