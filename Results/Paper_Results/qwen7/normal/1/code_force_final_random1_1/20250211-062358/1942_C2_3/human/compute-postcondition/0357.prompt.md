Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `even` is a sorted list of all even gaps greater than 0 encountered during the loop's execution, `odd` is empty, `ans` is the sum of all gaps processed, and `y` is either 0 or has been reduced to a non-positive value after processing all gaps in `odd`.

In this final state, since the loop has executed all iterations, `odd` must have been fully processed, making it empty. The variable `even` will contain all even gaps greater than 0 that were encountered. The variable `ans` will hold the cumulative sum of all gaps processed from the `odd` list. The variable `y` will be 0 if it was reduced to or below 0 during any iteration, or it will be the remaining positive value of `y` after processing all gaps.
Code of the loop:
for gap in even:
    if y < gap // 2:
        ans += 2 * y
        y = 0
        break
    ans += gap
    y -= gap // 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `even` is a sorted list of all even gaps greater than 0 and must be non-empty, `y` is `-gap // 2`, and `ans` is `ans` + `gap`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `even` is a sorted list of all even gaps greater than 0 but has one less element than before, `y` is now `y - gap // 2`, `ans` is updated by adding `gap` to its previous value.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `even` is a sorted list of all even gaps greater than 0 but has one less element than before, `y` is `y - gap // 2`, `ans` is updated by adding `2 * (y - current_gap // 2)` to its previous value, and `ans` is now `ans + gap`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `y < gap // 2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
