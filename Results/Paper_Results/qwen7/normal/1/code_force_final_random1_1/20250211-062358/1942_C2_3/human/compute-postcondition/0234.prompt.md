Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `odd` is an empty list since it has been iterated over completely; `y` is `-next_gap // 2 - first_odd // 2 - second_odd // 2 - gap // 2`; `ans` is incremented by the value of `first_odd + 2 * y + gap + second_odd`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `odd` will be empty because all elements were processed. The variable `y` will be updated based on the last subtraction performed in the loop, which involves the last two gaps (`first_odd` and `second_odd`) and the current `gap`. The total `ans` will be the sum of all processed gaps plus twice the cumulative value of `y` adjusted for each iteration.
Code of the loop:
for gap in even:
    if y < gap // 2:
        ans += 2 * y
        y = 0
        break
    ans += gap
    y -= gap // 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `odd` is an empty list, `y` is `-next_gap // 2 - first_odd // 2 - second_odd // 2`, `ans` is incremented by the value of `first_odd + 2 * y + gap + second_odd + gap`, and `even` must contain at least one element.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `odd` is an empty list, `y` is `-next_gap // 2 - first_odd // 2 - second_odd // 2 - gap // 2`, `ans` is incremented by the value of `first_odd + 2 * y + gap + second_odd + gap`, and `even` must contain at least one element; `ans` is incremented by `gap`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `odd` is an empty list, `y` is `-next_gap // 2 - first_odd // 2 - second_odd // 2 - gap // 2 - gap // 2`, `ans` is incremented by `gap + first_odd + 2 * y + gap + second_odd + gap`, and `even` must contain at least one element.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
