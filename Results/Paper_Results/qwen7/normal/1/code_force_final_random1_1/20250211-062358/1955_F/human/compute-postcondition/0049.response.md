Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of four non-negative integers representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in an initial sequence. For each test case, it calculates the sum of the floor divisions of each count by 2 and prints the result. The function does not modify the input parameters and returns nothing.**
