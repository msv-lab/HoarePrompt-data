Postcondition: `cnt` is incremented by the floor division of `x` by 2, the first three elements of list `a` are equal and odd, and the first element of `a` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\). If `a[0]` is equal to `a[1]` which is equal to `a[2]` and `a[0]` is an odd number, then `cnt` is further incremented by 1.
