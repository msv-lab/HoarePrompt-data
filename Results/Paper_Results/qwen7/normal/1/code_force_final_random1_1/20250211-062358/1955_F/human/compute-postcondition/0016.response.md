Based on the initial state provided:

- `a` is a list of integers where the first three elements are equal and odd.
- The first element of `a` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
- `cnt` is initially set to 15.

The loop increments `cnt` by `math.floor(x / 2)` for each element `x` in the list `a`. Since the first three elements of `a` are equal and odd, and assuming they are the only elements in the list (as no further elements are mentioned), the loop will run three times, once for each of the first three elements.

For each of these elements:
- If the element is 1, `math.floor(1 / 2)` is 0.
- If the element is greater than 1, `math.floor(x / 2)` is 1.

Given that the first three elements are odd and equal, let's denote this common value as `odd_value`. The increment to `cnt` for each of these elements will be 1 (since odd numbers greater than 1 will contribute 1 to `cnt`).

Thus, the total increment to `cnt` from the first three elements is \(3 \times 1 = 3\). Since `cnt` was initially 15, after processing the first three elements, `cnt` will be \(15 + 3 = 18\).

Therefore, the print statement will output the value of `cnt`, which is 18.

Output: **18**
