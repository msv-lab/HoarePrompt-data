Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `a` is a list of integers where the first three elements are equal and odd.
   - The first element of `a` (`x`) is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
   - `cnt` is increased by the floor division of `x` by 2.
   - `cnt` is equal to `math.floor(x / 2)`.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for x in a:
       # the loop body is omit
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over each element in the list `a`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `x` was the current element being processed, and `cnt` was updated based on the value of `x`.

4. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - The only variable in the loop head is `x`.
   - Since the loop is iterating over the list `a`, the next value of `x` will be the next element in the list.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that there are more elements in the list `a`.

5. **State Adjustment:**
   - `x` will be the next element in the list `a`.
   - `cnt` will be updated based on the new value of `x`.

6. **New State:**
   - `a` remains the same list.
   - `x` will be the next element in the list `a`.
   - `cnt` will be updated to `math.floor(x / 2)`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`a` is a list of integers where the first three elements are equal and odd, and the first element of `a` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `x` is the next element in the list `a`, `cnt` is increased by the floor division of `x` by 2, `cnt` is equal to `math.floor(x / 2)**
