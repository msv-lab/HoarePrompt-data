Output State: **`p` is a list of integers where each element is the largest even number less than or equal to the corresponding input integer, and the input integer is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))` takes an input of space-separated integers, splits them into a list, converts each element to an integer, and then applies a lambda function to each element. The lambda function `lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2` calculates the largest even number less than or equal to the given integer by subtracting the remainder of the division by 2 from the integer itself. Since the initial state mentions that `p` is a list of integers where each element is the largest even number less than or equal to the corresponding input integer, and the input integer is decreased by 1, the code does not change the nature of `p`. It only updates the values within `p` according to the rule described. Therefore, the output state remains the same in terms of the description, but the elements of `p` are now updated to reflect the largest even numbers derived from the input.
