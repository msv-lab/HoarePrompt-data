Output State: **`a` is a list where all elements are equal and odd, the first element of `a` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\), and `cnt` is the sum of the floor divisions of each element in `a` by 2.**

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `a` will have all its elements equal (since the loop continues as long as `a` contains more elements), and these elements will be odd numbers within the specified range. The variable `cnt` will hold the total sum of the floor divisions of each element in `a` by 2.
