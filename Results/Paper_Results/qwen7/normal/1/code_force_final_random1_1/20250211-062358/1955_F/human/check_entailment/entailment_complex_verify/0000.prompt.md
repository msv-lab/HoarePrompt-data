You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))
        print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of four non-negative integers p_i (0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200), representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the initial sequence, respectively.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))
        
        print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)
        
    #State: Output State: The final state of `p` is a list of integers where each element is the largest even number less than or equal to the corresponding input integer, and the input integer has been reduced to 0 after all iterations of the loop.
    #
    #In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `p` will contain the largest even numbers possible for each of the initial counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s, with the input integer being decremented until it reaches 0. This means that each count in `p` will be the highest even number that was ever present in the sequence during any iteration of the loop, and the input integer will be 0 since it keeps decrementing by 1 in each iteration until it can no longer decrease.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes four non-negative integers representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in an initial sequence. For each input, it calculates the largest even number less than or equal to each of the counts and prints whether the sum of the counts of odd numbers (excluding the count of 4s) is 3, followed by the total sum of the processed counts divided by 2. After processing all inputs, the function outputs a series of results based on the given conditions.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win. Specifically, the program attempts to calculate the sum of the odd numbers in the first three elements of the input list and checks if this sum equals 3, which is not relevant to the problem description. Additionally, the program incorrectly divides the sum of the input list by 2 and adds the result to the sum of the odd numbers in the first three elements. This approach does not consider the bitwise XOR operation and the optimal strategy for Eve to maximize Bob's wins.

A correct solution would involve calculating the initial XOR of the sequence and then determining how many numbers need to be removed to ensure the final XOR is zero. The program provided does not address these requirements.
