Output State: **`a` is a list of integers where the first three elements are equal and odd, and the first element of `a` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\); `cnt` is 15; `_` is 3, and `a` is updated with user input split into integers.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes user input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `a`. Since the initial state specifies that the first three elements of `a` are equal and odd, and the first element is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\), these properties will be maintained after the input is processed. The variables `cnt` and `_` remain unchanged.
