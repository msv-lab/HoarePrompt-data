Output State: `a` is a list where all elements are equal and odd, the first element of `a` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\), and `cnt` is the sum of the floor divisions of each element in `a` by 2 after the loop has completed all its iterations.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `cnt` will be the total sum of the floor division of each element in the list `a` by 2. This is because the loop processes each element in the list `a` exactly once, adding `math.floor(x / 2)` to `cnt` for each element `x`. Since all elements in `a` are equal and odd, the value of `math.floor(x / 2)` for each element will be either 0 or 1, contributing to the final value of `cnt`. The exact value of `cnt` depends on the specific values of the elements in `a`, but it will be the sum of these contributions after processing all elements in the list.
