Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for result in results:`. This means the loop iterates over each element in the `results` list.

2. **Determine the variables in the loop head**: The only variable mentioned in the loop head is `result`.

3. **Understand the state at the end of the previous iteration**: We are not given specific values for `result` or `results` at the end of the previous iteration, but we know that the loop has just completed one iteration.

4. **Determine the next state for the loop to execute**: For the loop to execute one more time, the next `result` must be available from the `results` list. Since the loop has just completed one iteration, the next `result` will be the second element in the `results` list if it exists.

5. **Adjust the state accordingly**: Since the loop has just completed one iteration, the next `result` will be the second element in the `results` list. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect this.

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`result` is the second element in the `results` list**
