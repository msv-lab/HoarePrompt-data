Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 0 and 999 inclusive, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(a, b)`, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `winner` is the return value of `func_1(a, b)`**.

Explanation: The code `winner = func_1(a, b)` assigns the return value of the function `func_1(a, b)` to the variable `winner`. The values of `t`, `results`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `winner` as the return value of `func_1(a, b)`, while keeping the other variables in their original states.
