Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the winner of a game where Alice and Bob take turns removing one coin from their wallets, and the player who cannot make a move loses.
2. The key observation is that the game ends when both players' wallets are empty. The player whose turn it is when both wallets are empty loses.
3. The solution provided uses a simple parity check (`(a + b) % 2 == 0`) to determine the winner:
   - If the sum of the coins in both wallets is even, Bob wins.
   - If the sum is odd, Alice wins.
4. This logic is based on the fact that each move reduces the total number of coins by one. Therefore, the player who starts with an even sum of coins will always end up with an odd sum when it's their turn, and vice versa.
5. Given the problem constraints and the provided examples, the logic appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
