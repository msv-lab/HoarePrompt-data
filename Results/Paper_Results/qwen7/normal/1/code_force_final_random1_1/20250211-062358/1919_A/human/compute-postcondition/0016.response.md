Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for result in results:`. The only variables involved here are `result` and `results`.

2. **Understand the Loop Execution**: The loop iterates over each element in the `results` list. Each iteration assigns an element from the `results` list to the variable `result`.

3. **Initial State of `results`**: The initial state of `results` is given as a list containing 1000 elements, each of which is the return value of `func_1(a, b)`.

4. **Final State of `t`**: The variable `t` is mentioned in the context but is not directly involved in the loop head. It is stated that `t` will be 0 after the loop executes all its iterations, but this is not something we need to adjust for the loop to execute.

5. **Adjusting the States**: Since the loop is iterating over the `results` list, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the state of the `results` list. We need to ensure that `results` contains 1000 elements, each of which is the return value of `func_1(a, b)`.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted is the state of the `results` list.

**State:**
**`results` is a list containing 1000 elements, each of which is the return value of `func_1(a, b)`**
