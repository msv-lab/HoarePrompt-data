You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, a and b are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func_2():
    t = int(input('Enter the number of test cases: '))
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b = map(int, input().strip().split())
        
        winner = func_1(a, b)
        
        results.append(winner)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer between 0 and 997 inclusive, `results` is a list containing 1000 elements, each of which is the return value of `func_1(a, b)`. The variable `a` represents the first integer input for each iteration, `b` represents the second integer input for each iteration, and `winner` is the return value of `func_1(a, b)` for each iteration and is the last element in the `results` list.
    #
    #In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, `t` will be 0 because the range function will stop once it reaches `t` (which starts at a value between 1 and 1000 and decreases by 1 with each iteration until it reaches 0). The `results` list will contain 1000 elements, each being the result of calling `func_1(a, b)` for each pair of integers input during the loop's iterations.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: `t` is 0, `results` is a list of 1000 elements, each being the result of calling `func_1(a, b)` for each pair of integers input during the loop's iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters but processes values for t, a, and b where t is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and for each test case, a and b are positive integers between 1 and 10^9. The function returns different outputs based on the values of a and b for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
