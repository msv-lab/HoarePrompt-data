Output State: `t` is a positive integer between 0 and 997 inclusive, `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(a, b)` for each iteration of the loop, with each `winner` being the result of `func_1(a, b)`, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, and `winner` is the return value of `func_1(a, b)` for the final iteration, and `results` has been fully populated with `winner` values from all iterations.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `t` will be 0 because the loop runs exactly `t` times and then stops. The `results` list will contain `t` elements, each being the result of calling `func_1(a, b)` for every pair of integers `a` and `b` provided as input during the loop's iterations.
