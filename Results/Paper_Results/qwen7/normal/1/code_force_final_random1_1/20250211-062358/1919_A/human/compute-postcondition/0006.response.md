Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `t`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
   - `results` is a list containing one element which is the return value of `func_1(a, b)`.
   - `a` is an input integer.
   - `b` is an input integer.
   - `winner` is the return value of `func_1(a, b)`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, at the end of each iteration, `t` is decremented by 1.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0. If `t` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be 0 at the start of the next iteration, and the loop will terminate.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `t` is decremented by 1 from its previous value.

**Final State**:
- `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, but now it is decremented by 1.
- `results`, `a`, `b`, and `winner` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, decremented by 1, `results` is a list containing one element which is the return value of `func_1(a, b)`, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `winner` is the return value of `func_1(a, b)`**.
