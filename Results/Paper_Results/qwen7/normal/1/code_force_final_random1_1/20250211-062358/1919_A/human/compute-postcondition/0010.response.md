Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head**: The loop head is defined by the `for _ in range(t):` statement. This means the loop variable `_` is incremented in each iteration, and the loop runs `t` times.

2. **Determine the variables involved in the loop head**: The only variables directly involved in the loop head are `t` and the loop counter `_`. However, since `_` is an underscore (which is typically used as a throwaway variable), it doesn't affect the state outside the loop. Therefore, the only variable we need to consider is `t`.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is a positive integer between 0 and 999 inclusive.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1 from its current value. Since `t` was a positive integer, decrementing it by 1 will still keep it within the range of 0 to 999 inclusive, as long as it wasn't already 0.

5. **Update the state**: The other variables (`results`, `a`, `b`, and `winner`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**`t` is a positive integer between 0 and 998 inclusive, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(a, b)` plus the new element which is `winner`, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `winner` is the return value of `func_1(a, b)`**.

State: **`t` is a positive integer between 0 and 998 inclusive, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(a, b)` plus the new element which is `winner`, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `winner` is the return value of `func_1(a, b)`**
