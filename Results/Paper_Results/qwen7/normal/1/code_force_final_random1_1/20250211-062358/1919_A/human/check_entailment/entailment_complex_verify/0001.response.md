### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Dynamics:**
   - Each player can either swap wallets or keep them as is.
   - After each move, one coin is removed from the player's current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move loses.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - The game essentially reduces the total number of coins by 1 in each complete round (one move by Alice and one by Bob).
   - The player who faces the situation where the total number of coins is 1 will lose because they cannot make a valid move without having 0 coins in their wallet.

3. **Analyzing the Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even.
   - If `(a + b) % 2 == 0`, it returns 'Bob'.
   - Otherwise, it returns 'Alice'.

4. **Correctness of `func_1`:**
   - If the sum of `a` and `b` is even, there will be an odd number of moves until the total number of coins becomes 1.
   - Since Alice starts first, she will face the situation where the total number of coins is 1 on her turn, making her lose.
   - Conversely, if the sum is odd, there will be an even number of moves until the total number of coins becomes 1, and Bob will face the situation where the total number of coins is 1 on his turn, making him lose.

5. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function reads the number of test cases and processes each test case using `func_1`.
   - It correctly prints the winner for each test case.

6. **Annotated Code Analysis:**
   - The annotated code correctly describes the state transitions and the logic flow of the functions.
   - The initial state of `a` and `b` is described as positive integers within the given constraints.
   - The state after processing all test cases is correctly described as `t` being 0 and `results` containing the outcomes of `func_1(a, b)` for each test case.

7. **Validation Against Examples:**
   - The examples provided in the problem statement match the logic of the program. For instance:
     - When `a + b` is even (e.g., 1 + 1), `func_1` returns 'Bob', and Alice loses.
     - When `a + b` is odd (e.g., 1 + 4), `func_1` returns 'Alice', and Alice wins.
   - These examples align with the reasoning that the sum of `a` and `b` determines the winner.

### Conclusion:
- The logic in `func_1` correctly determines the winner based on whether the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd.
- The implementation of reading test cases and processing them is also correct.

**Final Answer: Correctness: **True**
