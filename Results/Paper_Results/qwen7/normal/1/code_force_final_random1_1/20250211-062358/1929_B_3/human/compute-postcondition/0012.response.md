Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer greater than 0.
- `n` is an integer input from the first split.
- `k` is an integer input from the second split.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(k // 2 + 1)
```

Here, `k // 2` performs integer division of `k` by 2, which means it divides `k` by 2 and rounds down to the nearest whole number. Adding 1 to this result gives us the final value to be printed.

Since `k` is an integer input from the second split, its exact value is unknown. Therefore, we cannot provide a specific numerical answer. However, we can describe the expression `k // 2 + 1` in terms of `k`.

Output: **k // 2 + 1 (where k is an integer input from the second split)**
