Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer, and it is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    if 4 * n - 2 == k:
        print(k // 2 + 1)
    else:
        print(ceil(k / 2))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is an input integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, `n` is the first integer input, and `k` is the second integer input. If `4 * n - 2` equals `k`, then no change is made to `k`. Otherwise, `k` remains unchanged and still does not equal `4 * n - 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer greater than 0; `n` is an integer input from the first split; `k` is an integer input from the second split. If `4 * n - 2` equals `k`, no changes are made. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` and `k` are integers input from the user, `t` is decremented by 1. If `4 * n - 2` equals `k`, no change is made to `n`, `k`, or `t`. Otherwise, no change is made to `n`, `k`, or `t` as well.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
