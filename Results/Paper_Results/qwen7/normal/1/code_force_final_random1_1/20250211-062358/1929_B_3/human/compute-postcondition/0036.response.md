Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes values for t, n, and k where t is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and for each test case, n and k are integers within specific ranges (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2). The function returns a result based on these inputs.**

This means the function indirectly accepts `t`, `n`, and `k` as inputs through its processing, where `t` represents the number of test cases, and for each test case, `n` and `k` are defined within given constraints. The function then computes and returns a result based on these values.
