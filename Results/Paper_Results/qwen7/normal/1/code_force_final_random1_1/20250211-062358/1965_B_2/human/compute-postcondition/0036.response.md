Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and the range parameters `lk` and `l`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `lk - 1`.
   - `ans` is a list containing the values `[2, 2]`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from `lk` to `l`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `l`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently `lk - 1`, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to `lk`.
   - The variable `ans` does not change within the loop head, so it remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is now `lk`.
- `ans` remains `[2, 2]`.

State: **`i` is `lk`, `ans` is a list containing the value `[2, 2]`**
