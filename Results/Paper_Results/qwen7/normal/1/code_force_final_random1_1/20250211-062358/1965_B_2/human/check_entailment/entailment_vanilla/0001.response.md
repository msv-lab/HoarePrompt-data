### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires generating a sequence `a` of at most 25 non-negative integers such that:
   - No subsequence sums to `k`.
   - All integers from 1 to `n` (except `k`) can be represented as a subsequence sum.

2. **Given Solution Analysis**:
   - The function `func_14()` is designed to solve this problem.
   - It uses binary representation to construct the sequence `a`.

3. **Binary Representation Insight**:
   - For `k == 1`, it handles special cases directly.
   - For other values of `k`, it constructs the sequence using binary numbers and some additional elements to ensure all sums from 1 to `n-1` are covered.

4. **Key Steps in `func_14()`**:
   - Converts `n` to its binary representation.
   - If `k == 1`, it handles the special case directly.
   - Otherwise, it constructs the sequence by:
     - Adding powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `k-1`.
     - Adding an element to cover the difference between `k-1` and the sum of these powers.
     - Adding `k+1` and `2*k+1` to ensure certain sums.
     - Adding more powers of 2 to cover higher sums.

5. **Verification**:
   - The constructed sequence ensures no subsequence sums to `k` (by avoiding `k` and ensuring other sums are covered).
   - All sums from 1 to `n-1` are covered by the construction method.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The solution handles edge cases like `k == 1` and ensures the sequence length is at most 25.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution correctly addresses the problem requirements and handles all specified cases.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
