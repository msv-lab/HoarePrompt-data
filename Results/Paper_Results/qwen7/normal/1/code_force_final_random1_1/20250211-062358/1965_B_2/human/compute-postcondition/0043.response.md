Functionality: **The function takes no parameters and returns a string. Depending on the value of `k`, it either returns the string '1\n2' or a string containing space-separated values starting with 3 followed by powers of 2 from \(2^2\) to \(2^{l-1}\), where `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix.**
