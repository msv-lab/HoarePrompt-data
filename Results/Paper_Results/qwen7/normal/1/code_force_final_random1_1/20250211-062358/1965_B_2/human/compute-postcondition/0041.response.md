Output State: **The program returns a string containing space-separated values from the list 'ans', which starts with the value 3 (since k == 1) followed by powers of 2 from \(2^2\) to \(2^{l-1}\)**.

Explanation:
- The initial state tells us that `i` is either `l` or `l - 1`.
- The list `ans` contains all powers of 2 from \(2^2\) to \(2^{l-1}\), inclusive.
- Additionally, if `k == 1`, there is an extra value `2 * k + 1` (which is 3) at the beginning of the list `ans`.
- The code `return ' '.join(map(str, ans))` converts each element of `ans` to a string and joins them with a space.
- Therefore, the output is a string with the value 3 (if `k == 1`) followed by the powers of 2 from \(2^2\) to \(2^{l-1}\), all separated by spaces.
