You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n.
def func_14():
    n, k = func_7()
    b = bin(n)[2:]
    l = len(b)
    if (k == 1) :
        if (n == 2) :
            return '1\n2'
            #The program returns the string '1\n2'
        #State: `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`. They have been reassigned to the values returned by `func_7()`. `b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, and `l` is the length of `b`. The current value of `k` is 1, and `n` is not equal to 2.
        ans = [2, 3]
        for i in range(2, l):
            ans.append(2 ** i)
            
        #State: Output State: `i` is equal to `l - 1`; `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n`; `ans` is a list containing all powers of 2 from \(2^2\) up to \(2^{l-1}\).
        #
        #Explanation: The loop continues until `i` reaches `l - 1`. Given that `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n`, and considering the constraints on `n` (2 ≤ `n` ≤ \(10^6\)), the maximum value for `l` would be 20 (since \(2^{20} = 1048576\), which is within the upper limit). Therefore, `i` will increment from 2 up to `l - 1`. For each iteration, `ans` appends \(2^i\). After the loop completes, `ans` will contain all values from \(2^2\) up to \(2^{l-1}\).
    else :
        bk = bin(k)[2:]
        ans = []
        lk = len(bk)
        for i in range(lk - 1):
            ans.append(2 ** i)
            
        #State: Output State: `i` is equal to `lk - 2`, `ans` is a list containing the values from \(2^0\) to \(2^{lk-2}\), and `lk` is greater than 1.
        #
        #In this final state, the variable `i` will have incremented up to `lk - 2` because the loop runs `lk - 1` times. The list `ans` will contain all powers of 2 starting from \(2^0\) up to \(2^{lk-2}\) as each iteration appends the next power of 2 to the list. The condition that `lk` must be greater than 1 ensures that the loop runs at least once.
        ans.append(k - 1 - sum(ans))
        ans.append(k + 1)
        ans.append(2 * k + 1)
        for i in range(lk, l):
            ans.append(2 ** i)
            
        #State: Output State: `i` is equal to `l - 1`, `lk` is less than `l`, and `ans` contains the values from \(2^0\) to \(2^{l-1}\).
        #
        #To understand this, let's break down the process:
        #
        #1. Initially, `i` is set to `lk - 2`.
        #2. The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `l`. Each iteration increments `i` by 1 and appends \(2^i\) to `ans`.
        #
        #Given that the loop executes until `i` reaches `l - 1`, it means the loop runs `l - (lk - 2)` times. Therefore, `ans` will contain all values from \(2^0\) to \(2^{l-1}\) because each iteration appends the next power of 2 starting from \(2^{lk-2}\) up to \(2^{l-1}\).
        #
        #Since the loop stops when `i` equals `l - 1`, `lk` must still be less than `l` for the loop to have completed its iterations.
    #State: `i` is equal to `l - 1`, `lk` is less than `l`, and `ans` contains all values from \(2^0\) to \(2^{l-1}\)
    return str(len(ans)) + '\n' + ' '.join(map(str, ans))
    #The program returns a string that starts with the length of 'ans', followed by a newline character, and then all values from \(2^0\) to \(2^{l-1}\) separated by spaces.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and returns either the string '1\n2' or a string that starts with the length of 'ans', followed by a newline character, and then all values from \(2^0\) to \(2^{l-1}\) separated by spaces.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the string '1\n2'

Case_2: The program returns a string that starts with the length of 'ans', followed by a newline character, and then all values from \(2^0\) to \(2^{l-1}\) separated by spaces.
