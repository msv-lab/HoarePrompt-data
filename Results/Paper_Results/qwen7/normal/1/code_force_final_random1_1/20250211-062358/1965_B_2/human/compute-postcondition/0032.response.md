Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i` and `lk`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: According to the given state, `i` is equal to `lk - 2`.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop `for i in range(lk, l)` will execute if `lk` is less than `l`.

4. **Adjust the state**: We need to ensure that the loop can start executing. This means `i` should be set to `lk - 2` and `lk` should be such that `lk < l`.

Given these points, we need to adjust the state of `i` and `lk` to ensure the loop can start.

**State after adjustment**:
- `i` should be `lk - 2`.
- `lk` must be greater than 1 (as given in the initial state) and also less than `l` for the loop to execute.

So, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is `lk - 2`, `lk` must be greater than 1 and less than `l`**.
