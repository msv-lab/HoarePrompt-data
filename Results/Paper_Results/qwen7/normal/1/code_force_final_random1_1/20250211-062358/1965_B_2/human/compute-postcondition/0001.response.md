Output State: **`func_14()` returns a positive integer**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.write(str(func_14()) + '\n')` writes the result of `func_14()` to the standard output after converting it to a string. Since the initial state specifies that `func_10()` must return a positive integer, and there's no direct relationship between `func_10()` and `func_14()`, we can only conclude that `func_14()` returns a positive integer. The other variables and their states remain unchanged.
