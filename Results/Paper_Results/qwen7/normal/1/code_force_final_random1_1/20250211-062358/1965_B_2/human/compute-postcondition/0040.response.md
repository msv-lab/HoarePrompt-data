Postcondition: **`i` is either `l` or `l - 1`, and `ans` is a list containing all powers of 2 from \(2^2\) to \(2^{l-1}\), inclusive, with an additional value `2 * k + 1` at the beginning if `k == 1`.**

To explain this in natural language: After the execution of the if-else block, the variable `i` will be either equal to `l` or `l - 1`, depending on whether `k` equals 1 or not. The list `ans` will contain all powers of 2 from \(2^2\) to \(2^{l-1}\), inclusive. If `k` equals 1, the list `ans` will also include the value `2 * k + 1` at the beginning.
