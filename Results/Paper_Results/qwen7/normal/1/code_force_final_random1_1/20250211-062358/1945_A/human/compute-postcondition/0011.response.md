Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `a` is the first integer from `s`.
   - `b` is the second integer from `s` plus the third integer from `s`.
   - `c` is the third integer from `s`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print((a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3])
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**

   - The expression inside the `print` function is a tuple `(a - -b // 3, -1)`.
   - The tuple contains two elements: `a - -b // 3` and `-1`.
   - The value to be printed is determined by the condition `c < b % 3`.

4. **Evaluating the Condition:**
   - `b % 3` computes the remainder when `b` is divided by 3.
   - `c < b % 3` checks if `c` is less than this remainder.

5. **Possible Values:**
   - If `c < b % 3` is `True`, then the value printed will be the first element of the tuple, i.e., `a - -b // 3`.
   - If `c < b % 3` is `False`, then the value printed will be the second element of the tuple, i.e., `-1`.

6. **Simplifying the Expression:**
   - `a - -b // 3` simplifies to `a + b // 3` because the double negative `- -b` becomes `+b`.

7. **Final Output:**
   - The exact value depends on the specific values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.
   - Since `a` is the first integer from `s`, `b` is the sum of the second and third integers from `s`, and `c` is the third integer from `s`, the output will be either `a + b // 3` or `-1`.

Given the general nature of the problem without specific values for `a`, `b`, and `c`, the most precise description of the output is:

Output: **a + b // 3 if c < b % 3, otherwise -1**
