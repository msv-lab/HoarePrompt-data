Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - There are exactly `t` lines of input, each containing three non-negative integers separated by spaces.
   - For each line, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from splitting the current line of input.
   - `b` is then increased by `c`.

2. **Expression to Evaluate**:
   ```python
   print((a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3])
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:
   - The expression inside the `print` function is a tuple `(a - -b // 3, -1)`.
   - The tuple contains two elements: `a - -b // 3` and `-1`.
   - The second part of the expression `[c < b % 3]` is a boolean condition that determines which element of the tuple is selected for printing.

4. **Evaluating the Boolean Condition**:
   - `c < b % 3`: This checks if `c` is less than the remainder of `b` divided by 3.
   - If `c < b % 3` is `True`, the expression will select the first element of the tuple (`a - -b // 3`).
   - If `c < b % 3` is `False`, the expression will select the second element of the tuple (`-1`).

5. **Simplifying the Expression**:
   - The expression `a - -b // 3` simplifies to `a + b // 3` because the double negation `- -b` results in `b`.
   - Therefore, the expression becomes `a + b // 3` if `c < b % 3` is `True`, otherwise it becomes `-1`.

6. **Final Output**:
   - Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are not specified, we need to consider the general case.
   - The output will either be `a + b // 3` or `-1` depending on the value of `c` relative to `b % 3`.

Given the general nature of the problem, the output will depend on the specific values of `a`, `b`, and `c` for each line of input. However, without specific values, we can only describe the possible outputs.

Output: **a + b // 3 if c < b % 3, otherwise -1**
