You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The organizing committee plans to take the participants of the Olympiad on a
hike after the tour. Currently, the number of tents needed to be taken is
being calculated. It is known that each tent can accommodate up to 3 people.

Among the participants, there are a introverts, b extroverts, and c
universals:

  * Each introvert wants to live in a tent alone. Thus, a tent with an introvert must contain exactly one person — only the introvert himself. 
  * Each extrovert wants to live in a tent with two others. Thus, the tent with an extrovert must contain exactly three people. 
  * Each universal is fine with any option (living alone, with one other person, or with two others). 

The organizing committee respects the wishes of each participant very much, so
they want to fulfill all of them.

Tell us the minimum number of tents needed to be taken so that all
participants can be accommodated according to their preferences. If it is
impossible to accommodate the participants in a way that fulfills all the
wishes, output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case is described by a single line containing three integers a , b ,
c (0 \le a, b, c \le 10^9 ) — the number of introverts, extroverts, and
universals, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of tents, or
-1 if it is impossible to accommodate the participants.

Note

In the first test case, 1 tent will be given to the introverts, 1 tent will be
shared by two extroverts and one universal, and the last tent will be shared
by two universals. In total, 3 tents are needed.

In the second test case, three extroverts will take 1 tent, and 1 tent will be
taken by an introvert. Then, one extrovert and one universal will be left.
This extrovert will not be able to live with two others.

- Program:
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (a, b, c) = map(int, s.split())
        b += c
        print((a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3])



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case consists of three non-negative integers a, b, and c. It updates b by adding c and then prints the result of a specific calculation involving a and b. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case. If a test case is invalid (i.e., the values of a, b, or c do not meet the specified conditions), it does not produce an error message but simply moves on to the next test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the accommodation of participants according to their preferences. Specifically, the program does not properly account for the needs of introverts and extroverts. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Handling Introverts**: The program incorrectly handles the number of tents required for introverts. An introvert requires a tent alone, but the program does not ensure that each introvert gets a separate tent.

2. **Handling Extroverts**: The program incorrectly combines the counts of extroverts and universals without considering the specific requirement of extroverts needing to share a tent with two others. The line `b += c` merges the counts of extroverts and universals, which is incorrect because universals can share tents with anyone, including introverts.

3. **Calculation Logic**: The logic `(a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3]` is flawed. It does not correctly calculate the number of tents needed for introverts and does not properly distribute the remaining participants among tents.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:
- Input: `1 2 3`
- Expected Output: `3`
- Program Output: `-1`

Here’s why:
- 1 introvert needs 1 tent.
- 2 extroverts and 3 universals can be accommodated in 2 tents (1 tent for 2 extroverts and 1 tent for 1 extrovert and 2 universals).

However, the program fails to correctly calculate this and outputs `-1`.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for all potential cases and is thus incorrect.
