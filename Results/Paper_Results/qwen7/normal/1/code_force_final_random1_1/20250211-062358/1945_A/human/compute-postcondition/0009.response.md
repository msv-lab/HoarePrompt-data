Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from splitting the third line of input, `s` contains the content of the third line of input, `a` is the first integer from `s`, `b` is the second integer from `s`, and `c` is the third integer from `s`.**

Explanation: The code splits the string `s` into three integers using `map(int, s.split())` and assigns them to `a`, `b`, and `c` respectively. The value of `t` remains unchanged. The initial conditions for `a`, `b`, and `c` depend on the content of the string `s`.
