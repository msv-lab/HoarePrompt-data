The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case consists of three non-negative integers a, b, and c. It updates b by adding c and then prints the result of a specific calculation involving a and b. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case. If a test case is invalid (i.e., the values of a, b, or c do not meet the specified conditions), it does not produce an error message but simply moves on to the next test case.
