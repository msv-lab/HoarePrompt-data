Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `z` is (y + 1) // 2, `m` is 15 * ((y + 1) // 2) - 4 * y**.

This means that the value of `a` remains a positive integer, `x` and `y` remain their respective input integers, `z` is calculated as `(y + 1) // 2`, and `m` is calculated as `15 * z - 4 * y`.
