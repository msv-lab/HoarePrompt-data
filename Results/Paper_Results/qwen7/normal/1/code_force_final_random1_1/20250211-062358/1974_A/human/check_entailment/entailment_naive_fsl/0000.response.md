Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed. Specifically, the logic for calculating `z` and `m` does not accurately reflect the constraints of the problem. 

Consider the following test case:
- Input: `10 10`
- Expected Output: `3` (since 10 * 2 × 2 icons take up 10 * 4 = 40 cells, and 15 - 4 = 11 cells can fit 1 * 1 icons, so we need 3 screens: 2 for 2 × 2 icons and 1 for 1 × 1 icons).

However, the program's logic does not account for the remaining space after placing the 2 × 2 icons, leading to incorrect results. For instance, the program might incorrectly calculate the number of 1 × 1 icons that can fit into the remaining space, which can lead to an underestimation or overestimation of the total number of screens needed.
