Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads an integer `a` which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then iterates over each test case using a loop from `i = 0` to `i = a - 1`.

2. **Reading Test Case Data**:
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y`, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

3. **Calculating Minimum Screens**:
   - The variable `z` is calculated as `(y + 1) // 2`. This formula seems to be intended to calculate the minimum number of 2x2 icons that can fit into the available space, considering each 2x2 icon takes up 2 cells (since 2x2 = 4 cells, and we need to account for the fractional part).
   - The variable `m` is calculated as `15 * z - y * 4`. This formula seems to be intended to calculate the remaining space after placing all 2x2 icons, but it does not make sense in this context because `15` is not a relevant factor here. The correct calculation should consider the total number of cells available and how many 1x1 icons can fit into the remaining space.
   - The condition `if m < a:` is not clear and does not seem to be necessary for the logic of calculating the minimum number of screens.
   - The final value of `z` is updated using `(x - m + 15 - 1) // 15`. This part of the logic seems to be trying to account for the remaining 1x1 icons, but it is incorrectly implemented.

### Correct Approach

To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Calculate the total number of cells available on one screen: \(5 \times 3 = 15\) cells.
2. Calculate the number of 2x2 icons that can fit into the available space: \(\left\lfloor \frac{15}{4} \right\rfloor = 3\) icons per screen.
3. Calculate the number of 1x1 icons that can fit into the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons.
4. Sum the number of screens needed for both types of icons.

### Corrected Program

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate the number of 2x2 icons that can fit on one screen
        num_2x2_screens = (y + 3) // 4
        # Calculate the number of 1x1 icons that can fit on the remaining space
        remaining_cells = 15 * num_2x2_screens - y * 4
        num_1x1_screens = (x + remaining_cells - 1) // 15
        # Total number of screens needed
        total_screens = num_2x2_screens + num_1x1_screens
        print(total_screens)
```

### Conclusion

The original program is incorrect due to the misinterpretation of the calculations and the unnecessary conditions. The corrected program above should work as expected.

**Correctness: False**
