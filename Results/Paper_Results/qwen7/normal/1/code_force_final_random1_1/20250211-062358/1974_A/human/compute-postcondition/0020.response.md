Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `z` is equal to (`y` + 1) // 2, `m` is 15 * z - y * 4, `x` is updated to the first integer input, `y` is updated to the second integer input.**

Explanation: The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `x` and `y` respectively. The values of `i` and `z` remain unchanged from their initial states, and `m` is recalculated based on the new value of `y`.
