Reasoning:
To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's break down the logic and verify it against the problem statement and examples.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `x` and `y` for each case.
2. **Calculation of Minimum Screens**:
   - `z = (y + 1) // 2`: This calculates the number of 2x2 icons that can fit into the grid. Since each 2x2 icon takes up 4 cells, we need to divide the number of 2x2 icons by 4 and round up to the nearest whole number.
   - `m = 15 * z - y * 4`: This calculates the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons. It seems to be a misinterpretation because the formula should directly calculate the remaining space without involving `a`.
   - The condition `if m < a:` is not logically sound in this context. The variable `a` is the number of test cases, which is irrelevant here. Instead, we should focus on the total number of cells available and the number of 1x1 icons to be placed.
   - The adjustment `z = z + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15` is intended to account for the remaining 1x1 icons but is incorrectly formulated. The correct approach would involve calculating the total number of cells and distributing the 1x1 icons optimally.

Given these points, the logic in the program does not accurately solve the problem as stated. The correct approach involves calculating the total number of cells available on the screens and distributing the icons optimally.

Correctness: **False**
