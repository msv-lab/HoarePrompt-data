Postcondition: `a` is a positive integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `z` is `(y + 1) // 2 + (x - m + 14) // 15`, `m` is `15 * ((y + 1) // 2) - 4 * y`. If the current value of `m` is less than `a`, then `m` remains as the current value. Otherwise, the value of `m` does not change.
