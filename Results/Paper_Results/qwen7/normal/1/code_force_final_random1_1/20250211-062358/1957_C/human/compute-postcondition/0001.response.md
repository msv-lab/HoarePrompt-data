Output State: **`dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n, the coordinates (r_i, c_i) for each move you made are integers such that 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n, and no two rooks share the same row or column after each move and its mirrored move by the computer.**

Explanation: The code `dp[2] = 3` updates the value of `dp[2]` to 3. The values of other variables (`dp[1]`, `t`, `n`, `k`, and the coordinates) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
