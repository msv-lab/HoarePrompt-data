Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution attempts to solve the problem using dynamic programming, but it contains several issues:

1. **Dynamic Programming Initialization and Calculation**: The `dp` array is initialized incorrectly. The logic used to fill the `dp` array is flawed. The formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007` does not correctly model the problem's constraints. Specifically, the number of configurations should depend on the number of available rows and columns, not just the previous values.

2. **Set Usage**: The `invalid` set is used to track positions where rooks cannot be placed. However, this approach does not correctly account for the constraints of the problem. The solution should consider the remaining valid positions for rooks, not just the invalid ones.

3. **Output Calculation**: The output calculation `print(max(1, dp[n - len(invalid)]))` is incorrect. This formula does not accurately represent the number of possible configurations based on the remaining valid positions.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, you need to consider the following:

- **Track Valid Positions**: Keep track of the rows and columns that are already occupied by rooks.
- **Calculate Remaining Valid Positions**: For each test case, calculate the number of valid positions left for placing rooks.
- **Use Combinatorics**: Use combinatorial methods to count the number of ways to place rooks in the remaining positions.

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
from math import comb
from collections import defaultdict

MOD = 1000000007

def solve(n, k, occupied_rows, occupied_cols):
    # Calculate the number of valid rows and columns left
    valid_rows = n - len(occupied_rows)
    valid_cols = n - len(occupied_cols)
    
    # Calculate the number of ways to place rooks in the remaining positions
    # Each rook placement reduces the number of valid positions by one
    # We need to choose k more positions out of the remaining valid positions
    if valid_rows == 0 or valid_cols == 0:
        return 0
    else:
        return comb(valid_rows + valid_cols - 1, k) % MOD

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    occupied_rows = defaultdict(bool)
    occupied_cols = defaultdict(bool)
    
    for _ in range(k):
        r, c = map(int, input().split())
        occupied_rows[r] = True
        occupied_cols[c] = True
    
    print(solve(n, k, occupied_rows, occupied_cols))
```

This solution correctly tracks the occupied rows and columns and uses combinatorial methods to calculate the number of valid configurations.
