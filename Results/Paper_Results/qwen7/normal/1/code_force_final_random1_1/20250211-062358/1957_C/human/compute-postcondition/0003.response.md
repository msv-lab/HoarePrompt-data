Output State: **`dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 5, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, `i` is 4**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `dp[3]` using the formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`. Given the initial values `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`, and setting `i = 3`, we calculate:

- `dp[3] = (dp[2] + 2 * (3 - 1) * dp[1]) % 1000000007`
- `dp[3] = (3 + 2 * 2 * 1) % 1000000007`
- `dp[3] = (3 + 4) % 1000000007`
- `dp[3] = 7 % 1000000007`
- `dp[3] = 7`

All other variables remain unchanged.
