Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `n`.
2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over `i` from 3 to `n` inclusive. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `dp[1]` is 1
   - `dp[2]` is 3
   - `dp[3]` is 5
   - `dp[5]` is 29
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\)
   - `k` is an integer such that \(0 \leq k \leq n\)
   - `i` is 5

4. **Determine the next value of `i`**: Since `i` starts at 5 and the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` will be 6.
5. **Check the loop condition**: For the loop to continue, `i` (which is now 6) must be less than or equal to `n`. Therefore, `n` must still be at least 6.

Given these points, the only states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final State**:
- `dp[1]` is 1
- `dp[2]` is 3
- `dp[3]` is 5
- `dp[5]` is 29
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\) and \(n \geq 6\)
- `k` is an integer such that \(0 \leq k \leq n\)
- `i` is 6

State: **`dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 5, `dp[5]` is 29, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\) and \(n \geq 6\), `k` is an integer such that \(0 \leq k \leq n\), `i` is 6**
