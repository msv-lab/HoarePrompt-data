State: **`dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, `i` is 3**.

Explanation:
- The loop starts with `i` set to 3 because the `range(3, n + 1)` function will generate values starting from 3 up to `n`.
- The initial values of `dp[1]` and `dp[2]` are given but do not affect the loop's execution.
- The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, and the coordinates `(r_i, c_i)` are not directly involved in the loop's condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.
- Therefore, the only variable that needs to be adjusted is `i`, which should be set to 3 to start the loop.
