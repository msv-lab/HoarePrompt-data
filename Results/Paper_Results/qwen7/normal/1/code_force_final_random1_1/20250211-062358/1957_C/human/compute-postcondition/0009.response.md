Output State: `dp` is a list where `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 5, `dp[4]` is 11, `dp[5]` is 29, `dp[6]` is 17, `dp[7]` is 89, `dp[8]` is 239, `dp[9]` is 719, `dp[10]` is 2081, and so on until `dp[n]` is calculated for the maximum `n` which is \(3 \times 10^5\), `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\), `k` is an integer such that \(0 \leq k \leq n\), and `i` is greater than `n`.

This output state represents the final state of the `dp` array after the loop has executed for all iterations up to `n`, with the given recurrence relation applied. The values in `dp` follow the pattern defined by the loop, starting from the initial conditions provided and extending up to the maximum possible value of `n`.
