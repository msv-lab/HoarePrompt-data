The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5. The functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` which represents the size of a board, and since no specific return value or operation on `n` is mentioned in the problem statement, it implies that the function might be setting up or validating the input conditions for further operations involving `n`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n`, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, representing the size of a board, and ensures that the input conditions are valid for further operations.**
