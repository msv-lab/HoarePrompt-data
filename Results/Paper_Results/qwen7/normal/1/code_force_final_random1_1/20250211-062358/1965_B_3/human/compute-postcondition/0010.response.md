Output State: **`i` is 2; `l` must be at least 2; `ans` contains the value 4**

Explanation: The code appends the value of \(2^i\) to the list `ans`. Given that `i` is 2, \(2^i = 2^2 = 4\). Therefore, `ans` now contains the value 4. The values of `i` and `l` remain unchanged from their initial states.
