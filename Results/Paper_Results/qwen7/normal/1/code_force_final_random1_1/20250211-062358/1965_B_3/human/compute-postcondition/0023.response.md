Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(lk - 1):`. The variables involved here are `i` and `lk`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `lk - 1`.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `lk` must be greater than 1
   - `ans` contains the value 1 (This variable is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted).

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 0, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1.
   - The condition for the loop to continue (`i < lk - 1`) implies that `lk - 1` must be greater than 1, meaning `lk` must be greater than 2.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
- `i` should be 1
- `lk` must be greater than 2

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1, `lk` must be greater than 2**
