You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n.
def func_14():
    n, k = func_7()
    b = bin(n)[2:]
    l = len(b)
    if (k == 1) :
        if (n == 2) :
            return '1\n2'
            #The program returns the string '1\n2'
        #State: Postcondition: `b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `k` is 1, `l` is the length of `b`, and `k` is the second return value of `func_7()`. `n` is not equal to 2.
        ans = [2, 3]
        for i in range(2, l):
            ans.append(2 ** i)
            
        #State: Output State: `i` is equal to `l`; `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix; `ans` is a list containing values from 4 up to \(2^l\).
        #
        #To explain this in natural language: After all the iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `i` will be equal to `l`, which is the length of the binary representation of `n`. The list `ans` will contain all powers of 2 starting from \(2^2\) (which is 4) up to \(2^l\). This means `ans` will include every power of 2 from \(2^2\) to \(2^l\), inclusive.
    else :
        bk = bin(k)[2:]
        ans = []
        lk = len(bk)
        for i in range(lk - 1):
            ans.append(2 ** i)
            
        #State: Output State: `i` is equal to `lk - 2`; `lk` must be greater than 1; `ans` is a list containing the values `[1, 2, ..., 2^(lk-2)]`.
        #
        #In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `lk - 2`, which means the loop has completed `lk - 2` iterations. The list `ans` will contain all powers of 2 starting from \(2^0\) up to \(2^{lk-2}\), because in each iteration of the loop, `ans.append(2 ** i)` adds the next power of 2 to the list, where `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration. Additionally, the condition `lk` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute at least once.
        ans.append(k - 1 - sum(ans))
        ans.append(k + 1)
        ans.append(2 * k + 1)
        for i in range(lk, l):
            ans.append(2 ** i)
            
        #State: Output State: `i` is `l - 1`, `ans` is a list containing the values `[2, 2, 4, 8, ..., 2^(lk-2), 2 * k + 1, 2^lk, 2^(lk+1), ..., 2^(l-1)]`.
        #
        #To understand this, let's break it down:
        #- Initially, `i` is set to `lk - 2`.
        #- The loop runs from `lk` to `l-1`, incrementing `i` by 1 each time.
        #- After the first iteration (`i = lk - 1`), `ans` contains `[2]`.
        #- After the second iteration (`i = lk`), `ans` contains `[2, 2]`.
        #- After the third iteration (`i = lk + 1`), `ans` contains `[2, 2, 4]`.
        #
        #Following this pattern, when the loop completes all its iterations (from `i = lk` to `i = l-1`), `i` will be `l - 1`. During each iteration, the value `2^i` is appended to `ans`. Therefore, `ans` will contain all values from `2` up to `2^(l-1)`, including the initial values `[1, 2, ..., 2^(lk-2), 2 * k + 1]` and the values added during the loop iterations.
    #State: `i` is either `l` or `l - 1`, and `ans` is a list containing all powers of 2 from \(2^2\) to \(2^{l-1}\), inclusive, with an additional value `2 * k + 1` at the beginning if `k == 1`.
    return ' '.join(map(str, ans))
    #The program returns a string containing space-separated values from the list 'ans', which starts with the value 3 (since k == 1) followed by powers of 2 from \(2^2\) to \(2^{l-1}\)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and returns either the string '1\n2' or a string containing space-separated values starting with 3 followed by powers of 2 from \(2^2\) to \(2^{l-1}\), depending on the value of k.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the string '1\n2'

Case_2: The program returns a string containing space-separated values from the list 'ans', which starts with the value 3 (since k == 1) followed by powers of 2 from \(2^2\) to \(2^{l-1}\)


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
