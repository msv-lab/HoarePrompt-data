You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

        #
        #To understand this, let's break it down:
        #- Initially, `i` is set to `lk - 2`.
        #- The loop runs from `lk` to `l-1`, incrementing `i` by 1 each time.
        #- After the first iteration (`i = lk - 1`), `ans` contains `[2]`.

        #- After the third iteration (`i = lk + 1`), `ans` contains `[2, 2, 4]`.
        #
        #Following this pattern, when the loop completes all its iterations (from `i = lk` to `i = l-1`), `i` will be `l - 1`. During each iteration, the value `2^i` is appended to `ans`. Therefore, `ans` will contain all values from `2` up to `2^(l-1)`, including the initial values `[1, 2, ..., 2^(lk-2), 2 * k + 1]` and the values added during the loop iterations.
    #State: `i` is either `l` or `l - 1`, and `ans` is a list containing all powers of 2 from \(2^2\) to \(2^{l-1}\), inclusive, with an additional value `2 * k + 1` at the beginning if `k == 1`.

    #The program returns a string containing space-separated values from the list 'ans', which starts with the value 3 (since k == 1) followed by powers of 2 from \(2^2\) to \(2^{l-1}\)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes no parameters and returns a string. Depending on the value of `k`, it either returns the string '1\n2' or a string containing space-separated values starting with 3 followed by powers of 2 from \(2^2\) to \(2^{l-1}\), where `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix.

    #State: Output State: The loop will execute a total number of times equal to the return value of `func_10()`. For each iteration, `func_14()` will return an integer, which will then be written to stdout.
    #
    #In Natural Language: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the output will consist of integers printed to the standard output, with the number of integers equal to the return value of `func_10()`. Each integer is the result of calling `func_14()` once per iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. Instead, it executes a loop a number of times determined by the return value of `func_10()`. During each iteration of the loop, it calls `func_14()` to generate an integer, which is then printed to the standard output. After completing all iterations, the function concludes, leaving the standard output containing a sequence of integers.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate a sequence `a` that satisfies the given conditions for all test cases. Specifically, the function `func_14()` does not ensure that there is no subsequence of `a` with a sum of `k`, and it also does not guarantee that for all `1 \le v \le n` where `v \ne k`, there is a subsequence of `a` with a sum of `v`.

For example, consider the test case `n = 8` and `k = 8`. The generated sequence is `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 15]`. This sequence does not meet the requirement because:

- It includes the number `8`, which means there is a subsequence with a sum of `8`.
- The sequence does not include all numbers from `1` to `7` in a way that ensures every number can be formed as a subsequence sum except `8`.

To meet the problem's requirements, the sequence needs to avoid having any subsequence sum equal to `k` while ensuring all other sums from `1` to `n` (excluding `k`) are possible. The current implementation does not guarantee this.
