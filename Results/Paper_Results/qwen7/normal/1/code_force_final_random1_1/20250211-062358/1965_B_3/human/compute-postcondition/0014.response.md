Output State: **`i` is 4, `l` must be at least 4, `ans` is [4, 8, 16]**.

The value of `i` remains unchanged at 4. The condition for `l` also remains the same, being at least 4. The list `ans` originally contains [4, 8], and after executing `ans.append(2 ** i)`, it appends `2 ** 4`, which is 16, making the updated list [4, 8, 16].
