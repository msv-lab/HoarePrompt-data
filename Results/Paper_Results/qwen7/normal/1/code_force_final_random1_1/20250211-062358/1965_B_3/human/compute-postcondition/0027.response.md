Output State: `i` is equal to `lk - 2`; `lk` must be greater than 1; `ans` contains the values `[1, 2, ..., 2^(lk-2)]`.

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `lk - 2`, meaning the loop has run `lk - 1` times. The list `ans` will contain all powers of 2 from `2^0` to `2^(lk-2)`, which can be written as `[1, 2, 4, ..., 2^(lk-2)]`. Additionally, `lk` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute at least once.
