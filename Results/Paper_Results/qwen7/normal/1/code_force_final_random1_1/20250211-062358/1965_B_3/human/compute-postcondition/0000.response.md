Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the expression `func_10()`, which returns an integer value. This integer value determines the number of iterations of the loop. The loop variable `_` is just a placeholder and does not affect the initial state.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `func_10()` returns a positive integer. Therefore, we need to ensure that `func_10()` returns a positive integer.

3. **Initial state before the loop**: The initial state is given as follows:
   - There is no integer `k` such that `1 <= k <= n` and there exists a subsequence of length at most 25 that sums to `k`.
   - For all `1 <= v <= n` where `v != k`, there must exist a subsequence of length at most 25 that sums to `v`.

4. **Adjusting the state**: Since the loop depends on the return value of `func_10()`, we need to ensure that `func_10()` returns a positive integer. The initial state does not provide any specific information about `func_10()`, so we need to assume that `func_10()` returns a positive integer.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the return value of `func_10()`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`func_10()` must return a positive integer**
