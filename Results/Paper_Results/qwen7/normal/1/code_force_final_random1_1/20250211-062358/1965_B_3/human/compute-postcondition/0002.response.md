Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for _ in range(func_10()):`.
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `func_10()` and `_`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `func_10()` returns a positive integer.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `func_10()` returned a positive integer.

3. **Determine the Next State:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `func_10()` must return a positive integer again.
   - The variable `_` is an underscore, which is typically used as a throwaway variable in Python loops. It does not affect the loop condition or the state outside the loop.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since the loop condition depends on `func_10()`, we need to ensure that `func_10()` returns a positive integer.
   - No other variables are involved in the loop head, so no other states need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`func_10()` returns a positive integer**
