Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables: `i`, `lk`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `lk - 1`. Therefore, `lk` must be greater than 1 (since `lk - 1` must be at least 0).

3. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will start from 0 and increment by 1 in each iteration. Hence, before the loop starts, `i` should be set to 0.
   - `lk` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute.

Given these conditions, we need to adjust the states accordingly.

**State:**
- `i` is 0
- `lk` must be greater than 1

So, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `lk` must be greater than 1**
