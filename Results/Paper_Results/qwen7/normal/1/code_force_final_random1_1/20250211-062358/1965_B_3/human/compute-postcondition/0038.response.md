Output State: `i` is `l - 1`, `ans` is a list containing the values `[2, 2, 4, 8, ..., 2^{lk-2}, 2 * k + 1, 2^{lk}, 2^{lk+1}, ..., 2^{l-1}]`.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `i` starting from `lk` until `i` reaches `l`. For each iteration, it appends `2 ** i` to the list `ans`. Given that the loop executes until `i` is `l - 1`, the final value of `i` will be `l - 1`. The list `ans` will contain all the previously mentioned values plus additional terms up to `2^{l-1}`.
