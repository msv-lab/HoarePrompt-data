Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Here are the issues:

1. **Handling Single Character Strings**: The solution does not handle single character strings correctly. For a single character string, there is no way to rearrange the characters to form a different string, so the output should always be "NO". However, the current implementation prints "YES" followed by the sorted string, which is incorrect.

2. **Handling Strings with Only Two Unique Characters**: The solution correctly identifies that if the string has only two unique characters, no rearrangement can produce a different string, and thus prints "NO". This part is correct.

3. **General Case**: For strings with more than two unique characters, the solution should generate a different string by swapping any two characters. The current implementation sorts the string in both ascending and descending order and outputs the non-identical one, which may not necessarily be a different string from the original. For example, for the string "abc", sorting in ascending order gives "abc" and in descending order also gives "cba", which is still the same string but in reverse order. 

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        a = set(s)
        
        # If the string has only one or two unique characters, it's impossible to rearrange.
        if len(a) <= 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            # Find the first character that appears only once and swap it with the last character.
            for j, char in enumerate(s):
                if s.count(char) == 1:
                    # Swap the first occurrence of this character with the last character.
                    new_s = s[:j] + s[-1] + s[j+1:-1] + s[j]
                    print(new_s)
                    break
```

This corrected function handles all edge cases and ensures that the output is a valid rearrangement of the string when possible.
