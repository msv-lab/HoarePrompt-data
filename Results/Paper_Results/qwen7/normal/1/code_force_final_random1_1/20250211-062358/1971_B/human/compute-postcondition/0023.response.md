Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` remains greater than 0, `s` is the input received, `t` remains the same, `a` is a set containing the unique characters from `s`, `b` is a sorted string of `s` in ascending order, `c` is a sorted string of `s` in descending order.**

Explanation: The code `c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))` sorts the string `s` in descending order and assigns the result to `c`. The other variables remain unchanged.
