Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `r` is decreased by 1, `l` is greater than or equal to `r`, `a` is the value of `B[r]`, `b` is the value of `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 2] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)`**.

Explanation: The variable `b` is updated by subtracting `(idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)` from its current value. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state and the given code snippet.
