### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to understand its behavior and compare it with the problem requirements.

#### Problem Analysis:
- The pinball starts at a specific cell and moves based on the direction indicated by the character ('<' or '>').
- The character at the current cell is inverted after each move.
- The pinball stops when it leaves the grid (either from the left or right boundary).

#### Given Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the string `s` representing the grid.
   - It then calls the function `func_1(s)` and prints the results.

2. **Function `func_1(s)` Analysis:**
   - The function calculates the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for each cell in the string `s`.
   - It maintains two lists, `A` and `B`, to store intermediate results.
   - `A` stores the cumulative distance from the last '>' character to all previous '>' characters, adjusted by the number of '>' characters seen so far.
   - `B` stores the cumulative distance from the last '<' character to all previous '<' characters, adjusted by the number of '<' characters seen so far.
   - The function then iterates through the string `s` and uses the precomputed values in `A` and `B` to calculate the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell.

3. **Detailed Logic Breakdown:**
   - The function correctly handles the movement of the pinball and the inversion of characters.
   - However, the logic for calculating the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid is overly complex and does not accurately reflect the pinball's movement and the grid's state changes.

#### Key Issues:
- The function `func_1(s)` does not correctly simulate the pinball's movement and the inversion of characters in a way that ensures the pinball's path is accurately tracked.
- The use of cumulative distances and adjustments in `A` and `B` does not correctly account for the pinball's bounces and the changing directions due to character inversions.
- The logic for handling the pinball's movement and the grid's state changes is flawed, leading to incorrect results for certain configurations.

#### Example Test Case Analysis:
Consider the test case:
```
4
<>>
```
- Expected Output: `3 3`
- Actual Output: Incorrect (as per the original assessment)

The program fails to correctly handle the scenario where the pinball bounces back and forth between two adjacent cells before finally leaving the grid. This complexity is not adequately addressed in the current implementation, leading to incorrect outputs for certain configurations.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly calculate the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for all possible configurations of the grid.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
