Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, the character `s[i]` is equal to '>', the length of `idx_A` is now 8 more than before, `x` is updated to the value of `A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`, and `A` has one additional element which is `x`.**

Explanation: 
- The code `A.append(x)` appends the value of `x` to the list `A`.
- The value of `x` is given by the expression `A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`.
- Since `A.append(x)` adds one more element to `A`, the length of `A` increases by 1.
- The length of `idx_A` increases by 4 from its previous state.
- The value of `n` remains greater than 0.
- The character `s[i]` remains equal to '>'.
- The value of `x` remains unchanged but is now part of the list `A`.
