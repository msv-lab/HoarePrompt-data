Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is greater than or equal to `r`, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, `b` is updated to `b + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `a` to `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`. The values of `i`, `n`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `b` is updated by adding `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r` to its current value.
