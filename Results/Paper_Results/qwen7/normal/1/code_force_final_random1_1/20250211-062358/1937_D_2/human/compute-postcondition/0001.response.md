Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `A` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list `A`. The string `s` and its length `n` remain unchanged from the initial state. Therefore, `s` is still a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', and `A` is now an empty list.
