Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `l` is greater than or equal to `r`
   - Depending on the value of `r`, `b` is either unchanged if `r` is 0, or `b` is updated to `b + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`.
   - If `r` is not 0, `a` is updated to `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r` and `b` is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`.
   - If `r` is not 0 and `l - r - 1 > 0`, `b` is further updated to `b - A[l - r - 2] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)`.
   - If `s[i] == '>', `l` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `r` is decreased by 1.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `0` to `n-1`.

3. **Next Iteration Analysis:**
   - Since `i` is currently 1, the next iteration will occur when `i` becomes 2.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

Given these points, let's determine the states that need to be adjusted:

- **Variable `i`:** It needs to be incremented by 1 to become 2.
- **Variable `n`:** It remains unchanged as it is a condition for the loop to continue but not an object in the loop head.
- **Variables `l` and `r`:** These variables depend on the conditions inside the loop body. We cannot predict their exact values without knowing the loop body execution, but they remain within the loop head scope.
- **Variables `a` and `b`:** These variables are updated based on the loop body execution and are part of the loop head.

Since the only variable that changes explicitly due to the loop iteration is `i`, and the other variables (`n`, `l`, `r`, `a`, `b`) are adjusted inside the loop body, we focus on `i`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is greater than or equal to `r`, and depending on the value of `r`, `b` is either unchanged if `r` is 0, or `b` is updated to `b + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`. If `r` is not 0, `a` is updated to `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r` and `b` is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`. If `r` is not 0 and `l - r - 1 > 0`, `b` is further updated to `b - A[l - r - 2] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)`. If `s[i] == '>', `l` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `r` is decreased by 1.**
