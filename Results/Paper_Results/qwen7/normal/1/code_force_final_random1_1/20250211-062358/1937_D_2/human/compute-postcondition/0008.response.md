Output State: **`x` is equal to `A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`, `n` must be greater than 0, and the current value of `s[i]` is equal to '>' and the length of `idx_A` is not equal to 0.**

This means that the variable `x` is now calculated as the sum of `A[len(A) - 1]` (the last element of list `A`) and the product of the difference between `i` and the last element of `idx_A` with the length of `idx_A`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged from the initial state.
