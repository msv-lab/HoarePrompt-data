Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is greater than or equal to `r`, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is equal to `B[r]`, `b` is updated to `A[l - 1]` if `r` is not 0, otherwise `b` remains unchanged if `r` is 0, `b` is decreased by `A[l - r - 2]`, `b` is further decreased by `(idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b` by subtracting two terms. The first term is `A[l - r - 2]`, which is already part of the initial conditions. The second term is `(idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)`. Since `r` is decreased by 1, the condition `r` is decreased by 1 is now true, and `b` will be updated accordingly. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
