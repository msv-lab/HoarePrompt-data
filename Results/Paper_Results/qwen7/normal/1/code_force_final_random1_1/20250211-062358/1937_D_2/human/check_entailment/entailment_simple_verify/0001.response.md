### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program step by step to ensure its correctness based on the provided problem description and the annotated code.

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the grid `n` and the string `s`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the time taken for a pinball starting at each position to leave the grid.
   - It uses two arrays `A` and `B` to store intermediate results:
     - `A` stores the time taken for a pinball starting from the leftmost position to reach each position.
     - `B` stores the time taken for a pinball starting from the rightmost position to reach each position.

3. **Calculating `A`**:
   - The loop iterates through the string `s` from left to right.
   - When a `>` is encountered, it updates the value in `A` based on the previous value and the distance covered so far.
   - `idx_A` keeps track of the positions where `>` is encountered.

4. **Calculating `B`**:
   - The loop iterates through the string `s` from right to left.
   - When a `<` is encountered, it updates the value in `B` based on the previous value and the distance covered so far.
   - `idx_B` keeps track of the positions where `<` is encountered.

5. **Final Calculation**:
   - The main logic for calculating the time taken for a pinball starting at each position is implemented in the nested loops.
   - The program uses the precomputed values in `A` and `B` to calculate the time taken for each position.
   - It handles different cases based on whether the current character is `>` or `<`, and whether the position is closer to the left or right boundary.

### Detailed Verification

1. **Boundary Conditions**:
   - The program correctly handles the boundary conditions where the pinball starts from the leftmost or rightmost position.

2. **Intermediate Results**:
   - The intermediate results stored in `A` and `B` are correctly updated based on the rules provided.

3. **Final Calculation Logic**:
   - The final calculation logic seems to handle all cases correctly, including the interactions between `A` and `B` values.
   - However, there are some issues with the logic that need to be addressed:
     - The logic for updating `A` and `B` is complex and may not cover all edge cases.
     - The nested loops for calculating the final result seem to have some logical errors, especially in handling the interactions between `A` and `B`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program should handle edge cases such as all characters being the same (`<` or `>`), or the grid being very long.

### Detailed Issues

1. **Updating `A` and `B`**:
   - The logic for updating `A` and `B` is based on the positions of `>` and `<` characters. However, the logic for updating these arrays is not straightforward and may lead to incorrect results for certain patterns in the string `s`.

2. **Nested Loops for Final Calculation**:
   - The nested loops for calculating the final result are complex and may not handle all edge cases correctly. For example, the logic for updating `a` and `b` in the nested loops seems to have some mistakes, particularly in handling the interactions between `A` and `B`.

### Conclusion

After re-evaluating the code, it appears that the program has some logical errors in the nested loops for calculating the final result. These errors may lead to incorrect results for certain patterns in the string `s`.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
