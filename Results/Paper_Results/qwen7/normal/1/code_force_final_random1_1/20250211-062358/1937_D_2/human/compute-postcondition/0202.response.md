Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is greater than or equal to `r`, `a` is now `A[l]`, `b` is updated to `(idx_B[r - 1] - 2) * (l + 1) - (idx_B[r - 1] - idx_B[r - (l + 2)]) + (2 - idx_A[l - 1]) * r - (idx_B[r - (l + 2)] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (r - (l + 2) + 1)`, `r` is unchanged, and `x` is `r - (l + 2)`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b` to `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`. Given that `i` is 2, `b` is now `(idx_B[r - 1] - 2) * (l + 1)`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
