Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is greater than or equal to `r`, `a` is now `A[l]`, `b` is updated to `B[r - 1] - B[r - (l + 2)] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)`, `r` is unchanged, and `x` is `r - (l + 2)`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b` by subtracting `(idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)` from the current value of `b`. Since `x` is defined as `r - (l + 2)`, the updated value of `b` is calculated as follows:

- Initially, `b` was `B[r - 1] - B[r - (l + 2)] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`.
- After the operation, `b` becomes `B[r - 1] - B[r - (l + 2)] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)`, where `x = r - (l + 2)`.
