Output State: **`B` is a list where if `len(idx_B)` is 0, then `B` is [0]. Otherwise, the last element of `B` is updated to `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - (n - 1 - 1)) * len(idx_B)`. `idx_B` is `[i]`. `n` is greater than 0. `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'. `A` is a list containing the sum of distances between '>' characters with appropriate multiplicative factors. `idx_A` is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in `s`. `j` is 2. `i` is `n - 3`. The current value of `s[i]` is '<'; `x` is `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - (n - 1 - 1)) * len(idx_B)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` is calculated as `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`.
- Given `i` is `n - 3`, the expression simplifies to `x = B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - (n - 3)) * len(idx_B)`.
- The value of `x` depends on the last element of `B` and `idx_B`, but since these values are not explicitly given, they remain as they are. The other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
