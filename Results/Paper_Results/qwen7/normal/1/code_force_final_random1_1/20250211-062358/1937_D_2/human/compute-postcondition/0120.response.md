Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `r` is decreased by 1, and the current value of `l` is greater than 0; `b` is equal to the value of `b + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b` by adding `(idx_B[r] - i) * l` to the current value of `b`. Since `i` is 0, the expression simplifies to `b + idx_B[r] * l`. The other variables (`n`, `r`, and `l`) remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
