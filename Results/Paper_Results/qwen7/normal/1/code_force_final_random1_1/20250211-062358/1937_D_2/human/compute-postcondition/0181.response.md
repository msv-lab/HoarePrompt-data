Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is greater than or equal to `r`, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is equal to `B[r]`, and `b` is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)` if `r` is not 0, otherwise `b` remains unchanged if `r` is 0.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `B[r]` to `a`. The value of `r` is decreased by 1. Depending on the new value of `r`, `b` is updated. If `r` is not 0, `b` is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`. If `r` is 0, `b` remains unchanged. All other conditions and variables remain as per the initial state.
