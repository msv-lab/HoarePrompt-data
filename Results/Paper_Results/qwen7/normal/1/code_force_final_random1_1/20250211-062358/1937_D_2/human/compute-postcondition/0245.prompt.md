Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `l` is 0, `B` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of distances from the rightmost '>' character to all '<' characters encountered so far, multiplied by the number of '<' characters seen up to that point, `idx_B` is a list containing all the indices of '<' characters in the string `s`, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `A` is a list containing the sum of distances between '>' characters with appropriate multiplicative factors, `idx_A` is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `r` is the length of `B`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n):
    if s[i] == '>':
        if l < r:
            a = A[l]
            x = r - (l + 2)
            b = B[r - 1]
            if x >= 0:
                b = b - B[x]
                b = b - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)
            b = (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)
            print(a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1, end=' ')
        elif r == 0:
            print(n - i, end=' ')
        else:
            a = B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r
            b = A[l - 1]
            if l - r > 0:
                b = b - A[l - r - 1]
                b = b - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)
            b = b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r
            print(a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i), end=' ')
        l += 1
    else:
        r -= 1
        if l <= r:
            if l == 0:
                print(i + 1, end=' ')
            else:
                a = A[l - 1]
                a = a + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l
                b = B[r]
                if r - l >= 0:
                    b = b - B[r - l]
                    b = b - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)
                b = b + (idx_B[r] - i) * l
                print(a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1, end=' ')
        elif r == 0:
            print(n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2, end=' ')
        else:
            a = B[r]
            b = A[l - 1]
            if l - r - 1 > 0:
                b = b - A[l - r - 2]
                b = b - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)
            b = b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)
            print(a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i), end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is greater than or equal to `r`, and depending on the value of `r`, `b` is either unchanged if `r` is 0, or `b` is updated to `b + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`. If `r` is not 0, `a` is the value of `B[r]` and `b` is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is greater than or equal to `r`, and depending on the value of `r`, `b` is either unchanged if `r` is 0, or `b` is updated to `b + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`. If `r` is not 0, `a` is updated to `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r` and `b` is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`. If `r` is not 0 and `l - r - 1 > 0`, `b` is further updated to `b - A[l - r - 2] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)`. If `s[i] == '>', `l` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `r` is decreased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is greater than or equal to `r`. Depending on the value of `s[i]`, `l` is either increased by 1 or `r` is decreased by 1. If `r` is 0, `a` is the value of `A[l - 1] + (2 - idx_A[l - 1]) * (l - 1)` and `b` is not defined. Otherwise, `a` is updated to `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - 2) * (r - 1)` and `b` is updated based on the value of `l - r - 1`: if `l - r - 1 > 0`, then `b` is `b - A[l - r - 2] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)`, otherwise `b` is `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)` if `l < r`, or `b` is `b + A[l - 1]` if `l >= r`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
