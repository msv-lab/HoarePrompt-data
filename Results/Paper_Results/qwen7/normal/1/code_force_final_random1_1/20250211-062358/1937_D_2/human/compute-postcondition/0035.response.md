Output State: **`B` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `A` is a list containing the sum of distances between '>' characters with appropriate multiplicative factors, `idx_A` is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `idx_B` is an empty list, `j` is 0, `i` is `n - 1 - j`**.

This means that the variable `i` is now assigned the value of `n - 1 - j`. Since `j` is initially 0, `i` is effectively `n - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
