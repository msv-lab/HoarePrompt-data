Let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `l` is greater than or equal to `r`.
   - `r` is decreased by 1.
   - `a` is equal to `B[r]`.
   - `b` is updated to `A[l - 1]` if `r` is not 0; otherwise, `b` remains unchanged if `r` is 0.
   - `b` is decreased by `A[l - 1]` if `r` is 0; otherwise, it is decreased by `A[l - r - 2]`.
   - Further decrease `b` by `(idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)` if `l - r - 1 > 0`.
   - Increase `b` by `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`.

2. **Code Execution:**
   ```python
   print(a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i), end=' ')
   ```

### Step-by-Step Breakdown:

1. **Values of Variables:**
   - `i = 1`.
   - `n > 0`.
   - `l ≥ r`.
   - `r` is decreased by 1, so let's assume `r = k` initially, then `r = k - 1`.

2. **Calculating `a`:**
   - `a = B[r] = B[k - 1]`.

3. **Calculating `b`:**
   - If `r` is not 0 (`k - 1 ≠ 0`), then `b = A[l - 1]`.
   - If `r` is 0 (`k - 1 = 0`), then `b` remains unchanged from its previous value.

4. **Further Adjustments to `b`:**
   - Decrease `b` by `A[l - 1]` if `r` is 0.
   - Decrease `b` by `A[l - r - 2]` if `r` is not 0.
   - Decrease `b` by `(idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)` if `l - r - 1 > 0`.
   - Increase `b` by `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`.

5. **Final Expression:**
   - The expression to be printed is `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)`.

### Final Output:
Given the initial state and the operations described, the exact values of `a` and `b` depend on the specific lists `B` and `A`, and the index `idx_A`. However, based on the provided information, we can express the final output as follows:

Output: **2 * B[k - 1] + 2 * b + (n - 1)**

Where `k` is the initial value of `r` before it is decreased by 1, and `b` is adjusted according to the rules described above.
