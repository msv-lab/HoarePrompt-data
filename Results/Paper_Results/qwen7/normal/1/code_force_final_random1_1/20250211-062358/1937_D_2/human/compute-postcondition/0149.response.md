Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is greater than or equal to `r`, `a` is `A[l]`, `b` is updated to `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r] - i) * l` if `r` is 0, otherwise `b` is updated to `B[r - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1), `x` is `r - (l + 2)`, `b` is `b - B[x]`**

Explanation: The code subtracts `B[x]` from `b`. Since `x` is defined as `r - (l + 2)`, `b` is updated to its previous value minus `B[r - (l + 2)]`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
