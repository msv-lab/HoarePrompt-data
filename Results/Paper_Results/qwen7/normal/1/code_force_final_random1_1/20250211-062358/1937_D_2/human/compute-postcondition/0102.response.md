Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and the character at index `i` of string `s` is equal to '>'; `l` is 1 (since it was previously 0 and was incremented by 1), `r` is 0, and the value of `b` is undefined since `r` is 0 and the formula for `b` only applies when `r` is not 0.**

Explanation: The variable `l` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. The other conditions and values remain unchanged as per the initial state. Since `r` is 0, the formula for calculating `b` does not apply, leaving `b` undefined.
