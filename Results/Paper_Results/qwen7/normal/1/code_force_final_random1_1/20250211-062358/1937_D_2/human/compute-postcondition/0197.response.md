Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is greater than or equal to `r`, `a` is now `A[l]`, `b` is updated to `B[r - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`, `r` is unchanged, and `x` is `r - (l + 2)`**.

Explanation:
- The code assigns `B[r - 1]` to `b`. Since `B[r - 1]` is a specific value from the list `B`, `b` is updated to this value.
- All other variables (`i`, `n`, `l`, `a`, `r`, and `x`) remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states.
