Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, and the character at index `i` of string `s` is equal to '>', and `l` is greater than or equal to `r`, and `r` is not equal to 0, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`**.

This means that the variable `a` has been assigned the value of `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`. All other variables remain in their initial or previously described states.
