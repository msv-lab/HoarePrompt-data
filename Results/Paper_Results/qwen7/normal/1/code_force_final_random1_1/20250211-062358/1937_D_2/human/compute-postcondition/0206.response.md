Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is greater than or equal to `r`, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, `b` is updated to `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`, `l` is increased by 1**.

Explanation: The code `b = A[l - 1]` updates the value of `b` to `A[l - 1]`. Since `l` was previously greater than or equal to `r`, and `l` is increased by 1 after this line, `l` is now increased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged according to the given conditions.
