Output State: **`l` is 0, `B` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of distances from the rightmost '>' character to all '<' characters encountered so far, multiplied by the number of '<' characters seen up to that point, `idx_B` is a list containing all the indices of '<' characters in the string `s`, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `A` is a list containing the sum of distances between '>' characters with appropriate multiplicative factors, `idx_A` is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in `s`.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `l` to 0. This does not affect the lists `B`, `idx_B`, `A`, `idx_A`, or the string `s`. The conditions and values of these variables remain as they were in the initial state. Therefore, the only change is that `l` is now explicitly set to 0.
