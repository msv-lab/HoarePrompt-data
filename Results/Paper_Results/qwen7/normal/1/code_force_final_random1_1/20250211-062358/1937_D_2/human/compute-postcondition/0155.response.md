Given the initial state:
- `i` is 1
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `l` is greater than or equal to `r`
- Depending on the value of `r`, `b` is either unchanged if `r` is 0, or `b` is updated to `b + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`. 
- If `r` is not 0, `a` is the value of `B[r]` and `b` is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1).

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(n - i, end=' ')`.

Let's break it down:

1. `i` is explicitly given as 1.
2. `n` is greater than 0 but its exact value is not specified.
3. `l` is greater than or equal to `r`, but their exact values are not specified.
4. The value of `b` depends on the value of `r`:
   - If `r` is 0, `b` remains unchanged.
   - If `r` is not 0, `b` is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`.
5. The value of `a` is only relevant if `r` is not 0, and it is set to `B[r]`.

The `print(n - i, end=' ')` statement will print the result of `n - i` followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

Since `i` is explicitly given as 1 and `n` is greater than 0, the expression `n - i` will be `n - 1`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **n - 1**
