Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is greater than or equal to `r`. Depending on the value of `s[i]`, `l` is either increased by 1 or `r` is decreased by 1. If `r` is 0, `a` is the value of `A[l - 1] + (2 - idx_A[l - 1]) * (l - 1)` and `b` is not defined. Otherwise, `a` is updated to `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - 2) * (r - 1)` and `b` is updated based on the value of `l - r - 1`: if `l - r - 1 > 0`, then `b` is `b - A[l - r - 2] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)`, otherwise `b` is `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)` if `l < r`, or `b` is `b + A[l - 1]` if `l >= r`.
