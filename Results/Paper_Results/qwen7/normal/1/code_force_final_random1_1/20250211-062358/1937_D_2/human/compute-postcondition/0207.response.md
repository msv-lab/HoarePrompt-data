Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is increased by 1, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, `b` is updated to `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r - A[l - r - 1]`**

Explanation: The variable `b` is updated by subtracting `A[l - r - 1]` from its current value. Since `l` is increased by 1, the new value of `l` is `l + 1`. The values of `i`, `n`, `a`, `A`, `B`, `idx_A`, and `idx_B` remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states.
