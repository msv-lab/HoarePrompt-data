Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `l` is greater than or equal to `r`.
   - `a` is equal to `B[r]`.
   - `r` is updated to `r - 1`.
   - `b` is calculated as follows:
     - If `l - r - 1 > 0`, then `b = b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`.
     - Otherwise, `b = b + A[l - 1]`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i), end=' ')
   ```

Given these details, let's analyze the variables and their values:

- `i` is explicitly given as 2.
- `n` is greater than 0 but its exact value is not specified.
- `l` is greater than or equal to `r`, but their exact values are not specified.
- `a` is set to `B[r]`, where `B` is not defined, so we cannot determine `a` without more information about `B`.
- `r` is updated to `r - 1`, but the initial value of `r` is not specified.
- `b` depends on the condition `l - r - 1 > 0`:
  - If `l - r - 1 > 0`, then `b = b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`.
  - Otherwise, `b = b + A[l - 1]`.

Since the exact values of `B`, `r`, `l`, `idx_A`, and `A` are not provided, we can only express the final expression in terms of these variables.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - 2)**
