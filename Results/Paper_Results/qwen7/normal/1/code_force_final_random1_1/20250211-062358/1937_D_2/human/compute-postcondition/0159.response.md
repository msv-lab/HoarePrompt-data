Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is greater than or equal to `r`, `b` is updated to `b - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)`, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, `b` is now `A[l - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b` by subtracting `(idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)` from its current value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
