Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `idx_A` is a list with `i` appended to it, `A` is a list containing 0.**

Explanation: The code `idx_A.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `idx_A`. Since `i` is equal to `n` from the initial state, `idx_A` now contains `n`. The conditions for `A` remain unchanged because no code has modified `A` or its conditions since the initial state. Therefore, `A` still contains only the value 0.
