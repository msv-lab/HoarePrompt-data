Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variables `i` and `x`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop iterates over the range `1` to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.
   - The variable `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `x` is an integer input from the user.
   - `n` is an integer input from the user.
   - `ans` is updated based on the condition `x % i == 0` and the additional condition `x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and (x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0`.
   - `i` is incremented by 1 and is still within the range `1` to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, the new value of `i` will be the previous value of `i` plus 1.
   - The value of `x` and `n` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop body.
   - The value of `ans` may change based on the loop condition, but since we are only adjusting the state for the next iteration, we do not need to consider the updated value of `ans`.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `x` remains the same.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` should be within the range `1` to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`x` is an integer input from the user, `n` is an integer input from the user, `i` is the previous value of `i` + 1, and `i` must be within the range 1 to int(sqrt(x)) + 1.**
