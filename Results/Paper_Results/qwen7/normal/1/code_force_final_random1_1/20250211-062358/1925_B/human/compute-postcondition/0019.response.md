Postcondition: **`x` is an integer input from the user, `n` is an integer input from the user, `ans` is the maximum of its current value and `x // i`, `i` is incremented by 1 and still within the range `1` to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.** 

This postcondition states that after the execution of the if statement, `x` remains an integer input from the user, `n` remains an integer input from the user, `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `x // i`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `i` still remains within the range `1` to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`. Since there is no else part, the postcondition directly follows the if part.
