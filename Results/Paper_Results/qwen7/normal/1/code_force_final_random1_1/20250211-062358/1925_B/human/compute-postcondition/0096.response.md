Output State: **`ans` is the maximum of `ans` and `x // i`; `i` is `k + 2`; `x` is the same as before; `n` is the same as before.**

Explanation: The code updates `ans` to be the maximum of its current value and `x // i`. The values of `i`, `x`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state.
