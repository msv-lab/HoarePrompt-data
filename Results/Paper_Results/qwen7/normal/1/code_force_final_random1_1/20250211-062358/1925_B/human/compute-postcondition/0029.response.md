Postcondition: `x` is an integer input from the user, `n` is an integer input from the user, `i` is the previous value of `i` + 1, and `i` must be within the range 1 to int(sqrt(x)) + 1; `ans` is the maximum value between the previous value of `ans` and `x // i` if `x - n * (x // i) >= 0` and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0`. If `x % i != 0`, `ans` remains unchanged.
