Output State: **`i` is `k + 1`, `x` is the same as before, `n` is the same as before, and `ans` is the maximum of `ans` and `(x // i)`**.

Explanation: The code updates `ans` to be the maximum of its current value and `x // i`. The values of `i`, `x`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states. The new value of `ans` depends on the comparison between its current value and `x // i`.
