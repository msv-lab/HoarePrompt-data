To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `ans` is the maximum value among all possible `i` values (from 1 to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`) that satisfy either of the two conditions within the loop.
   - `i` is `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.
   - `x` and `n` remain the same as their initial values.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(ans)
   ```

From the initial state, we know that `ans` is determined by evaluating a set of conditions over a range of `i` values from 1 to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`. The exact value of `ans` depends on the conditions that are satisfied within this range, but we don't have those conditions explicitly stated.

Given that `i` is set to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`, it means that `i` is one more than the integer square root of `x`. This implies that `i` is the last value in the range from 1 to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.

Since `ans` is the maximum value among the `i` values that satisfy the conditions, and `i` is the highest possible value in the range, `ans` must be `i` itself, which is `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.

Therefore, the print statement will output the value of `ans`, which is `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.

Output: **int(sqrt(x)) + 1**
