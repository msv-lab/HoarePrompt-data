Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and the range condition, which involves `x`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop increments `i` starting from 1 up to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.

3. **Determine the state adjustments**:
   - `i`: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is a divisor of `x` and is incremented by 1.
   - The range condition: `i` must be less than or equal to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.

Given that `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, we need to check if `i` is still within the range `1` to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.

4. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - If `i` was previously a divisor of `x`, it will still be a divisor of `x` after incrementing by 1.
   - We need to ensure that `i` is still less than or equal to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - We need to check if `i + 1` is still within the range `1` to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.

6. **Postcondition for the next iteration**:
   - `x` remains the same.
   - `i` becomes `i + 1`.
   - `ans` remains unchanged unless the conditions in the if-else block are met.

Since the conditions in the if-else block do not affect the loop head variables directly, we only need to update `i`.

**Final State**:
State: **`x` is an integer, `i` is a divisor of `x` and is incremented by 1, `ans` is the maximum value between the current `ans` and `i`, and `i` must still be less than or equal to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`**.

In summary:
State: **`x` is an integer, `i` is a divisor of `x` and is incremented by 1, `ans` is the maximum value between the current `ans` and `i`, and `i` must still be less than or equal to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`**.
