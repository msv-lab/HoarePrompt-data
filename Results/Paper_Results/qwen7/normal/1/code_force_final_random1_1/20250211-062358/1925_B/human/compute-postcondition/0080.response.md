Postcondition: **`i`, `x`, `n`, and `ans` are integers. `i` is such that `x - n * (x // i)` is greater than or equal to 0, `x // i` is greater than 0, and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0`. In this case, `ans` is updated to be the maximum value between the previous value of `ans` and `x // i`. Otherwise, the values of `i`, `x`, `n`, and `ans` remain unchanged.**
