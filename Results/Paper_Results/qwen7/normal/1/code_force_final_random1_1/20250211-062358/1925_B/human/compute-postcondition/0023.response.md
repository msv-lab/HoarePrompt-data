Output State: **`x` is an integer input from the user, `n` is an integer input from the user, `i` is the previous value of `i` + 1, and `i` must be within the range 1 to int(sqrt(x)) + 1; `ans` is the maximum value between the previous value of `ans` and `i`.**

Explanation: The line `ans = max(ans, i)` updates the value of `ans` to be the maximum of its current value and the new value of `i`. Since `i` is incremented by 1, `ans` will be updated to the higher value between the previous `ans` and the new `i`. The initial values and conditions for `x`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.
