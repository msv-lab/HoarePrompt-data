Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `i`: This variable is initialized to 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
   - `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`: This is the upper limit for the loop.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - **Variable `i`**: The loop starts with `i` set to 1.
   - **Expression `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`**: This expression determines the number of iterations the loop will run. For the loop to execute, `int(sqrt(x)) + 1` must be a positive integer (since `sqrt(x)` is a non-negative real number, `int(sqrt(x))` will be a non-negative integer, and adding 1 ensures it is at least 1).

3. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `i` starts at 1, no adjustment is needed for `i`.
   - We need to ensure that `int(sqrt(x)) + 1` is a positive integer. Given that `x` is an integer input from the user, `sqrt(x)` will be a non-negative real number, and `int(sqrt(x))` will be a non-negative integer. Adding 1 to this value ensures it is at least 1.

4. **Final State Adjustment**:
   - `x` is an integer input from the user.
   - `n` is an integer input from the user.
   - `ans` is 1, but this variable is not part of the loop head, so no adjustment is needed for `ans`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`x` is an integer input from the user, `n` is an integer input from the user, `int(sqrt(x)) + 1` must be a positive integer**.
