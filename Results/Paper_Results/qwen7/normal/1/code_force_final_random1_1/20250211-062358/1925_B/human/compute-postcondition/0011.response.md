Postcondition: `x` is an integer input from the user, `n` is an integer input from the user, `ans` is the maximum of its current value and `x // i` if the condition `x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and (x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0` is true; otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged, and `i` is a divisor of `x`.
