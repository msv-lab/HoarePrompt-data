Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program seems to correctly calculate the maximum balance for the given constraints. Here's why:

1. **GCD Calculation**: The program iterates through possible divisors of `x` up to the square root of `x`. For each divisor `i`, it checks if `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, and similarly for `x // i`.

2. **Max Balance Calculation**: The program updates `ans` with the maximum value found that satisfies the conditions for both `i` and `x // i`.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program handles the edge case where `n` is large enough to make `x // n` very small, ensuring that the balance is calculated correctly.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program appears to handle all potential cases correctly. There are no apparent flaws or missing edge cases that would cause the program to fail according to the problem description.
