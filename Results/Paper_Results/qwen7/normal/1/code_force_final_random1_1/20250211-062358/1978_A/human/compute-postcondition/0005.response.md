The only objects in the loop head are variables `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, and `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0.

Since `t` is initially a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 500\) and `_` is set to 0 at the start of each iteration, the only change needed is to decrement `t` by 1 so that it remains a positive integer and the loop can continue.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(0 < t \leq 500\), `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers**
