Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input data where t is a positive integer between 1 and 500, and for each test case, n is an integer between 2 and 100, followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n each between 1 and 10^9. The function returns a result based on the processed input data.**

This means the function is designed to handle a series of test cases defined by the values of `t` and `n`, along with an array of integers `a_i`. It processes these inputs without accepting them as direct function parameters but rather through the structure of the input data it receives.
