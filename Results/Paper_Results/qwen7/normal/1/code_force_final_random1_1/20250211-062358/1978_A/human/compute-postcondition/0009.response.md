The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is a positive integer such that \(0 < t \leq 500\), `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, and `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input by spaces and converting each element to an integer.

For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0. Since `_` is incremented by 1 at each iteration but does not affect the value of `t`, the value of `t` remains unchanged. Therefore, `t` must still be a positive integer such that \(0 < t \leq 500\).

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(0 < t \leq 500\), `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input by spaces and converting each element to an integer**
