Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(0 < t \leq 500\).
   - `_` is 1 (though this variable is not used in the code snippet, it is provided for completeness).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input by spaces and converting each element to an integer.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1])
   ```

3. **Explanation**:
   - `nums[:-1]` refers to all elements of the list `nums` except the last one.
   - `max(nums[:-1])` finds the maximum value among these elements.
   - `nums[-1]` refers to the last element of the list `nums`.
   - The expression `max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1]` adds the maximum value from the first part of the list to the last element of the list.

Given the initial state, the exact values of `n` and `nums` are not specified, so we cannot determine the precise numerical result. However, we can describe the output in terms of the values in `nums`.

Output: **max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1]** (where `max(nums[:-1])` is the maximum value among all but the last element of `nums`, and `nums[-1]` is the last element of `nums`)
