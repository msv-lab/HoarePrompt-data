Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that 0 < t â‰¤ 500, `_` is 3, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input by spaces and converting each element to an integer.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` will still be a positive integer within the range of 1 to 500 (inclusive), but it will have been decremented to 0 by the end of the loop. The variable `_` will hold the value 3, indicating the last iteration of the loop. For each iteration, `n` is set to an input integer, and `nums` is a list of integers derived from another input string split by spaces and converted to integers. The loop processes each of the `t` inputs in sequence, performing the specified operation on the last two elements of the list `nums` for each input.
