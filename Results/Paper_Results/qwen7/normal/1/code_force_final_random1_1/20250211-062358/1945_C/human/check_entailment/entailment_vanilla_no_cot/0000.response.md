Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Percentages**: The code calculates `zero_perc` and `one_perc` using percentages (`* 100 // ...`). However, the problem requires calculating the ceiling of the fraction of residents, not the percentage. For instance, if there are 2 zeros out of 3, the calculation should be `math.ceil(2 / 3)` instead of `2 * 100 // 3`.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**: The logic to handle edge cases where the entire village is considered as one side (either all zeros or all ones) is not properly addressed. The code does not correctly handle these scenarios.

3. **Sorting and Final Selection**: The final selection of the optimal position `i` is done incorrectly. The code sorts the list `final` and prints the first element, but it should ensure that the position is chosen such that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied.

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        sl = list(s)
        o = sl.count('1')
        z = sl.count('0')
        
        zero, one = 0, 0
        lst = []
        mini = float('inf')
        
        for i in range(n - 1):
            if sl[i] == '0':
                zero += 1
            else:
                one += 1
            
            if math.ceil(zero / (i + 1)) >= 0.5 and math.ceil(one / (n - i - 1)) >= 0.5:
                lst.append(i + 1)
        
        if not lst:
            # If no valid position found, check the entire village
            if math.ceil(o / n) >= 0.5:
                print(0)
            else:
                print(n)
        else:
            mini = min(abs(n // 2 - i) for i in lst)
            final = [i for i in lst if abs(n // 2 - i) == mini]
            print(min(final))

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the conditions for satisfaction are correctly checked and handles edge cases appropriately.
