Output State: **`mini` contains the minimum value among all `abs(pk - ele)` for each `ele` in `lst`, `lst` is a list with at least 4 elements, and `elem` is the second element of `lst`; `final` is a list with its first element being the second element of `lst`.**

Explanation: The code appends the second element of `lst` to the list `final`. The variables `mini` and `pk` remain unchanged from their initial state. The list `lst` and its second element `elem` are used to initialize `final` with the second element of `lst`.
