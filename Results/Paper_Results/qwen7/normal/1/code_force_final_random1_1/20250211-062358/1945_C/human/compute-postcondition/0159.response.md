Output State: **`mini` contains the smallest value among all `abs(pk - elem)` for each `elem` in `lst`, `final` is either `[0]` or `[n]` depending on whether `c1` (calculated as `o * 100 // n`) is greater than or equal to 50 or less than 50, and `t` is `t - 1`; `s` is the input string.**

Explanation: The code `s = input()` reads a string from the user input and assigns it to the variable `s`. The values of `mini`, `final`, `t`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
