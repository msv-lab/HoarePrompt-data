Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop variable here is `elem`, and the list being iterated over is `lst`.

2. **Understand the Postcondition**: The postcondition mentions that `mini` contains the minimum value among all `abs(pk - ele)` for each `ele` in `lst`. Also, if `abs(pk - elem)` equals `mini`, then `final` is a list with its first element being the second element of `lst`.

3. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `mini` contains the minimum value among all `abs(pk - ele)` for each `ele` in `lst`.
   - `lst` is a list with at least 4 elements.
   - `elem` is the second element of `lst`.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `elem` is the second element of `lst`, the next element in the list `lst` will be the third element.
   - The loop will continue as long as there are more elements in `lst` to iterate over.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - The only variables that change within the loop are `elem` (which moves to the next element in `lst`) and potentially `mini` (if a new minimum is found).
   - However, since the question asks us to focus on the loop head and no new information about `mini` is given, we assume `mini` remains unchanged for now.
   - The list `lst` will lose its first element, and the second element will become the third element.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`mini` contains the minimum value among all `abs(pk - ele)` for each `ele` in `lst`, `lst` is a list with at least 3 elements (since it lost its first element), and `elem` is the third element of `lst`**.
