Postcondition: **`zero` is either 1 or 0, `one` is either 0 or 2, `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, `s` is a string, `i` is an index within `s` that is 1 more than its previous value, `lst` is a list containing the element `i + 1`.**

This postcondition summarizes both possible outcomes of the if-else block. If the condition `s[i] == '0'` is true, `zero` becomes 2 and `one` remains either 0 or 1. If the condition is false, `one` becomes either 1 or 2 and `zero` becomes either 1 or 0, while all other variables retain their initial conditions as described in the precondition.
