Output State: `lst` must contain at least three elements; `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)` for each iteration of the loop.

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `lst` will contain at least three elements, which are the positions where the conditions (`zero_perc >= 50` and `one_perc >= 50`) were met during the loop iterations. The variable `mini` will hold the smallest absolute difference between `pk` and any element in `lst` encountered during all the iterations of the loop.
