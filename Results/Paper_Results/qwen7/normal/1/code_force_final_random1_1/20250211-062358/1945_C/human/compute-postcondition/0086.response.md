Output State: **`z` is the count of '0's in `s`, `mini` contains the minimum value among all `abs(pk - ele)` for each `ele` in `lst`, `final` is a list containing all elements from `lst` that have the minimum value of `mini` when subtracted from `pk`, and `final` is sorted, `s` is a list of characters, `pk` is `n / 2`, `o` is the count of '1's in `s`.**

Explanation: The code `z = s.count('0')` counts the number of '0's in the list `s` and assigns this count to the variable `z`. The other variables (`mini`, `final`, `pk`, and `o`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
