Postcondition: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `zero` is either 2 or 1, `one` is either 2 or 3, `zero_perc` is 0, and `one_perc` is 0, and `lst` is [2]**.

This postcondition states that after the execution of the if-else block, the variable `i` remains 3, `n` stays greater than 3, `zero_perc` and `one_perc` remain 0, and `lst` stays as [2]. Depending on the condition `s[i] == '0'`, either `zero` becomes 2 and `one` remains 2, or `zero` remains 1 and `one` becomes 3.
