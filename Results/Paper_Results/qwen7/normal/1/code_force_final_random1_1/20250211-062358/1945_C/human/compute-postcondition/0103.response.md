Postcondition: `i` is either 0 or 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `zero` is 1 if the first character of `s` is '0' and 0 otherwise, `zero_perc` is calculated as `zero * 100 // (i + 2)`, `one_perc` is calculated as `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 2)`, and if the condition `zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50` is true, then the condition holds. If the condition is false, no change occurs to the variables.
