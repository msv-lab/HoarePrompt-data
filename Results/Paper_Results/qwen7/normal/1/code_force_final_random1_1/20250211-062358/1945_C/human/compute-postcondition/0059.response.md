Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `mini` contains the minimum value among all `abs(pk - ele)` for each `ele` in `lst`.
   - `lst` is a list with at least 4 elements.
   - `elem` is the first element of `lst`.
   - If `abs(pk - elem)` equals `mini`, `final` is a list with its first element as `elem`.
   - If `abs(pk - elem)` does not equal `mini`, `final` remains unchanged.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for elem in lst:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop variable `elem` will change to the next element in the list `lst`.
   - We need to determine the new value of `elem` for the next iteration.
   - Since `lst` has at least 4 elements, the next element in the list will be the second element (index 1).

4. **Updating the State:**
   - `mini` remains unchanged because it is determined based on the entire list and not updated within the loop.
   - `lst` remains the same list but now `elem` will be the second element.
   - `final` remains unchanged unless the condition inside the loop changes it, but since the loop body is omitted, we assume it remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`mini` contains the minimum value among all `abs(pk - ele)` for each `ele` in `lst`, `lst` is a list with at least 4 elements, and `elem` is the second element of `lst`.**
