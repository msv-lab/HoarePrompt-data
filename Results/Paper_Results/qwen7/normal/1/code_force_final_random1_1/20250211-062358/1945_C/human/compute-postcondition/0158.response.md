Output State: **`mini` contains the smallest value among all `abs(pk - elem)` for each `elem` in `lst`, `final` is either `[0]` or `[n]` depending on whether `c1` (calculated as `o * 100 // n`) is greater than or equal to 50 or less than 50, and `t` is `t - 1`; `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the user input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This operation does not affect the values of `mini`, `final`, or `t`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The only new information is that `n` now holds the value of the integer input by the user.
