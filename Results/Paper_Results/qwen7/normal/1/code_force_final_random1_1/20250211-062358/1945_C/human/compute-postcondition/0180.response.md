Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `zero` is 1, `zero_perc` is 50, `one_perc` is 50, `lst` contains the value 2**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `i + 1` to the list `lst`. Since `i` is initially 1, `i + 1` evaluates to 2. The other variables (`n`, `zero`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`) remain unchanged. Therefore, `lst` now contains the value 2.
