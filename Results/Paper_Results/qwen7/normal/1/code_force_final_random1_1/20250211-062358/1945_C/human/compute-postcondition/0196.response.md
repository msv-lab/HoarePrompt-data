Output State: **`i` is 3, `zero` is either 3 or 2, `zero_perc` is 60, `one_perc` is -66.67, and `one` is increased by 1 if `s[i]` is not '0'.**

Explanation: The code updates `zero_perc` to be `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`. Given that `i` is 3 and `zero` is either 3 or 2, we calculate `zero_perc` as follows:

- If `zero` is 3, then `zero_perc` = `3 * 100 // (3 + 1)` = `300 // 4` = 75.
- If `zero` is 2, then `zero_perc` = `2 * 100 // (3 + 1)` = `200 // 4` = 50.

However, since the problem specifies that `zero_perc` is initially 50, it implies `zero` is 2. Thus, `zero_perc` becomes 60. The other variables (`i`, `zero`, `one_perc`, and `one`) remain unchanged as no operation affects them other than the calculation of `zero_perc`.
