Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for ele in lst:`. The only object involved here is `ele`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `ele`**: Since the loop iterates over each element in `lst`, `ele` will take on each value from `lst` in turn.

3. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop will execute once for each element in `lst`. The condition for the loop to execute is simply that `lst` must contain at least one element.

4. **Adjust the state**: To ensure the loop can execute, `lst` must contain at least one element. The values of `i`, `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, and `one_perc` do not affect whether the loop can execute; they are used within the loop body.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `lst` to ensure it contains at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`lst` must contain at least one element**
