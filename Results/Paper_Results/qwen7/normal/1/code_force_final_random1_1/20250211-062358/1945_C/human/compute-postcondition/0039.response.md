Postcondition: **`zero` is either 2 or 1, `one` is either 0 or 2 or 1 or 3, `zero_perc` is recalculated based on the new value of `zero`, `one_perc` is recalculated as ((`zero` - `one`) * 100) // (`n` - (`i` + 2) - 1), `s` is a string, `i` is an index within `s` that is 1 or 2 more than its previous value, `lst` is a list containing two elements both equal to `i + 1`.**
