Output State: **`mini` is the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`, `ele` is the next element in `lst`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `mini` to be the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`. The variable `ele` remains unchanged as it is only used in the calculation. The precondition that `mini` is the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - next_element_in_lst)` is updated to reflect the new comparison with `abs(pk - ele)`.
