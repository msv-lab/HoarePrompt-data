Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variable `elem` from the list `lst`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each element in the list `lst`. Therefore, the value of `elem` changes with each iteration.

3. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following conditions hold:
   - `pk` is an integer.
   - `elem` is an integer (the next element in `lst`).
   - `mini` is an integer.
   - `final` is a list containing the element `elem`.
   - If the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` equals `mini`, then `final` remains unchanged.

4. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, the next element in `lst` must be assigned to `elem`.

5. **Adjusting the State**: Since the loop is iterating through the list `lst`, the next value of `elem` will be the subsequent element in the list. The other variables (`pk`, `mini`, and `final`) remain unchanged unless the loop body modifies them, but based on the given postcondition, they do not change.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `elem` to the next element in the list `lst`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`pk` is an integer, `elem` is the next integer in `lst`, `mini` is an integer, and `final` is a list containing the element `elem`.**
