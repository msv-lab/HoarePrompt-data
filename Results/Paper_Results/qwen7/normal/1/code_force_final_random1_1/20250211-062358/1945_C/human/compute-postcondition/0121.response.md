Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `zero` is either 2 or 1, `one` is either 2 or 3, `zero_perc` is 66.67, `one_perc` is -100, and `lst` is [2, 4]**.

Explanation: The code appends the value of `i + 1` to the list `lst`. Since `i` is 3, `i + 1` is 4. The list `lst` originally contains the value 2. After appending 4, `lst` becomes [2, 4]. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
