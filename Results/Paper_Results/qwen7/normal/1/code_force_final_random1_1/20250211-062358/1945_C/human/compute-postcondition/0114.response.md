Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `zero` is 1, `one` is 2, `zero_perc` is 0, and `one_perc` is calculated as ((`o` - 2) * 100) // (`n` - 2), and `lst` is [2]. This is because if `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are both greater than or equal to 50, then `i` becomes 2, and `lst` is updated to include the value 2. If the condition is not met, `i` remains 1, but since there is no else part provided, the other variables retain their original values.
