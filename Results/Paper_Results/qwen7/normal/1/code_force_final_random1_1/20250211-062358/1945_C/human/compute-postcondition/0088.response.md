Output State: **`lst` is an empty list, `z` is the count of '0's in `s`, `mini` contains the minimum value among all `abs(pk - ele)` for each `ele` in `lst`, `final` is a list containing all elements from `lst` that have the minimum value of `mini` when subtracted from `pk`, and `final` is sorted, `s` is a list of characters, `pk` is `n / 2`, `o` is the count of '1's in `s`, `zero` is 0, `one` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list `lst`. This operation does not affect the values of the other variables (`z`, `mini`, `final`, `s`, `pk`, `o`, `zero`, `one`). Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged, and the only new information is that `lst` is now an empty list.
