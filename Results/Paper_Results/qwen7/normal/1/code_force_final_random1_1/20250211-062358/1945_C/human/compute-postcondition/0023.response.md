Output State: **`zero` is either 1 or 0, `one` is either 0 or 1, `zero_perc` is calculated as zero * 100 // (i + 1), `s` is a string and `i` is an index within `s`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `zero_perc` as `zero * 100 // (i + 1)`. The values of `zero` and `one` remain unchanged from their initial conditions. The string `s` and the index `i` within `s` also remain unchanged.
