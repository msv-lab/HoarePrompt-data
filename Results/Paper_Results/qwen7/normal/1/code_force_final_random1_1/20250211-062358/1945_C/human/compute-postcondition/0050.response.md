Output State: **`mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`, `lst` is the same list**.

Explanation: The code updates the variable `mini` to be the minimum value between its current value and the absolute difference between `pk` and the next element `ele` in the list `lst`. The list `lst` remains unchanged, and `mini` is updated based on the new comparison.
