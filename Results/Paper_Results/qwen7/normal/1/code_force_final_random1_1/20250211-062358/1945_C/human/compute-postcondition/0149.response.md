Output State: **`mini` contains the smallest value among all `abs(pk - elem)` for each `elem` in `lst`, `final` is now `[0]`, `c1` is calculated as `o * 100 // n` and the current value of `c1` is greater than or equal to 50.**

Explanation: The code snippet appends the value `0` to the list `final`. Initially, `final` was an empty list. After executing `final.append(0)`, `final` becomes `[0]`. The values of `mini` and `c1` remain unchanged from their initial states.
