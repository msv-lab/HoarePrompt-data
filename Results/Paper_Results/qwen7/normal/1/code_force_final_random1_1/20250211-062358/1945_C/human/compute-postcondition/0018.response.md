Output State: **`s` is a string, the index `i` points to a character in `s` which is '0', `zero` is 1**

Explanation: The variable `zero` is incremented by 1. Since the initial state indicates that the character at index `i` in string `s` is '0', `zero` is initialized to 1 (assuming it was 0 before this line of code). Therefore, after executing `zero += 1`, the value of `zero` becomes 1. The other variables and their states remain unchanged.
