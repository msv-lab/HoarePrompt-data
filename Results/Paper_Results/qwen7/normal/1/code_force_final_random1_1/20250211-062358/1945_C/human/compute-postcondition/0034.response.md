The code appends `i + 1` to the list `lst`. Given that `i` is an index within `s` that is 1 more than its previous value, and `lst` initially contains the element `i + 1`, appending `i + 1` again does not change the existing element but adds another instance of `i + 1` to the list. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`zero` is either 1 or 0; `one` is either 0 or 2; `zero_perc` is either 50 or 100; `one_perc` is calculated as ((o - one) * 100) // (n - i - 1); `s` is a string; `i` is an index within `s` that is 1 more than its previous value; `lst` is a list containing two elements both equal to `i + 1`.**
