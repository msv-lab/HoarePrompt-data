Output State: **`mini` contains the smallest value among all `abs(pk - ele)` for each `ele` in `lst`, `final` contains the element `elem` from `lst` where `abs(pk - elem)` equals `mini`, `lst` must contain at least one element, and there exists an `elem` in `lst` such that the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` equals `mini`.**

Explanation: The code `final.append(elem)` appends the element `elem` (which has the property that `abs(pk - elem) == mini`) to the list `final`. The other conditions and the value of `mini` remain unchanged.
