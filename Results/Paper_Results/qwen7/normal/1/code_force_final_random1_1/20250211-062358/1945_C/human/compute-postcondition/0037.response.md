`zero` is incremented by 1, changing its value from either 1 or 0 to either 2 or 1. The value of `one` remains unchanged, which is either 0 or 2. The value of `zero_perc` changes based on the new value of `zero`, but since the exact value of `n` and `i` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact new value of `zero_perc`. However, `one_perc` is recalculated using the updated value of `zero` and the unchanged value of `one`. The value of `s` remains a string, `i` is an index within `s` that is 1 more than its previous value, and `lst` is a list containing two elements both equal to `i + 1`.

Output State: **`zero` is either 2 or 1, `one` is either 0 or 2, `zero_perc` is recalculated based on the new value of `zero`, `one_perc` is recalculated as ((`zero` - `one`) * 100) // (`n` - (`i` + 2) - 1), `s` is a string, `i` is an index within `s` that is 1 more than its previous value, `lst` is a list containing two elements both equal to `i + 1`.**
