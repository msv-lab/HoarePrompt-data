Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `pk` is `n / 2`, `s` is a string input by the user, `sl` is a list containing the characters of `s`, `o` is the count of '1' in the list `sl`, `z` is the count of '0' in the list `sl`, `zero` is 0, `one` is 0, `lst` is an empty list, `mini` is 100000000
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if s[i] == '0':
        zero += 1
    else:
        one += 1
    zero_perc = zero * 100 // (i + 1)
    one_perc = (o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)
    if zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50:
        lst.append(i + 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `zero` is either 1 or 0; `one` is either 0 or 1; `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50; `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50; `s` is a string; `i` is an index within `s`; `lst` is a list containing the element `i + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`zero` is either 1 or 0; `one` is either 0 or 2; `zero_perc` is either 50 or 100; `one_perc` is calculated as ((o - one) * 100) // (n - i - 1); `s` is a string; `i` is an index within `s` that is 1 more than its previous value; `lst` is a list containing two elements both equal to `i + 1`. This condition holds if `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50. If the condition is not met, the variables retain their original values.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `zero` is either 2 or 1; `one` is either 0 or 2 or 1 or 3; `zero_perc` is 200 or 100; `one_perc` is recalculated as ((`zero` - `one`) * 100) // (`n` - (`i` + 2) - 1); `s` is a string; `i` is an index within `s` that is 1 or 2 more than its previous value; `lst` is a list containing three elements all equal to `i + 1`; `one` is decreased by `one`, and `one_perc` is recalculated as ((`zero` - `one`) * 100) // (`n` - (`i` + 2) - 1).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
