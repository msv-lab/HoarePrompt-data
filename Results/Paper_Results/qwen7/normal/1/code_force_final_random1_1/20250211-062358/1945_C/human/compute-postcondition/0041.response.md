Output State: **`zero` is either 2 or 1; `one` is either 0 or 2 or 1 or 3; `zero_perc` is 200 or 100; `one_perc` is recalculated as ((`zero` - `one`) * 100) // (`n` - (`i` + 2) - 1); `s` is a string; `i` is an index within `s` that is 1 or 2 more than its previous value; `lst` is a list containing two elements both equal to `i + 1`; `one` is decreased by `one`, and `one_perc` is recalculated as ((`zero` - `one`) * 100) // (`n` - (`i` + 2) - 1).**

Explanation: The code updates `one_perc` using the new value of `one`. Since `one` can be 0, 2, 1, or 3, and `zero` can be 2 or 1, the value of `one` decreases by itself, and `one_perc` is recalculated based on the updated value of `one`. The other variables remain unchanged.
