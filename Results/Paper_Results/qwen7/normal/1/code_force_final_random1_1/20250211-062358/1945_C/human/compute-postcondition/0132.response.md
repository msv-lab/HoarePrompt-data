Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variables `elem` and `lst`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `mini` contains the smallest value among all `abs(pk - ele)` for each `ele` in `lst`.
   - `final` is an empty list.

3. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop iterates over each element in `lst`, assigning the current element to `elem` in each iteration.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `mini` is not directly involved in the loop, its state does not need to be adjusted.
   - `final` is a list, and since the loop body is omitted, we cannot determine if `final` changes during the loop. However, the initial state of `final` being an empty list is correct and does not need adjustment.
   - `lst` remains unchanged during the loop, so no adjustment is needed for `lst`.
   - `elem` will take on the values from `lst` one by one during the loop iterations.

Given this analysis, the only state that needs to be considered for adjustment is the initial state of `lst` to ensure the loop can execute. Since the problem does not specify any constraints on `lst` other than it being a list, we assume it contains at least one element to ensure the loop can execute.

Therefore, the final answer is:

**State: **`mini` contains the smallest value among all `abs(pk - ele)` for each `ele` in `lst`, `final` is an empty list, `lst` must contain at least one element**.
