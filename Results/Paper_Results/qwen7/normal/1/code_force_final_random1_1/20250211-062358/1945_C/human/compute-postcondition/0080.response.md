Output State: **`mini` contains the minimum value among all `abs(pk - ele)` for each `ele` in `lst`, `final` is a list containing all elements from `lst` that have the minimum value of `mini` when subtracted from `pk`, and `final` is sorted; `s` is an input string, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `s = input()` reads a string from the user input and assigns it to the variable `s`. The variables `mini`, `final`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
