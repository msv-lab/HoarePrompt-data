Output State: **`mini` contains the smallest value among all `abs(pk - elem)` for each `elem` in `lst`, and `final` is an empty list; `c1` is calculated as `o * 100 // n`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `c1` as `o * 100 // n`, where `//` is integer division. However, without specific values for `o` and `n`, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `c1`. The variables `mini` and `final` remain unchanged from their initial state.
