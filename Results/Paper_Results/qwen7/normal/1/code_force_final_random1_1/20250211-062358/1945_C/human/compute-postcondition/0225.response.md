Output State: **`pk` is an integer, `mini` is an integer, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` where the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` equals `mini`.**

Explanation: The code `final.sort()` sorts the list `final` in ascending order. The values of `pk` and `mini` remain unchanged. The list `final` now contains all elements from `lst` where the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` equals `mini`, and this list is sorted.
