Output State: **`zero` is either 1 or 0, `one` is either 0 or 1, `zero_perc` is calculated as zero * 100 // (i + 1), `s` is a string and `i` is an index within `s`, `one_perc` is calculated as (o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)**.

Explanation: The code calculates `one_perc` based on the values of `o` (which is the same as `one`), `one`, and `n` (which is the same as `i`). Since `o` is the same as `one`, the expression simplifies to `(one - one) * 100 // (i - i - 1)`, which results in `0 * 100 // (n - i - 1)`. This expression evaluates to `0` because any number multiplied by `0` is `0`. Therefore, `one_perc` is `0`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
