Output State: **The loop has executed all its iterations. The value of `i` is `n-1`, indicating that the loop has gone through all elements in the string `s`. `zero` holds the total count of '0's in the string `s`, `one` holds the total count of '1's in the string `s`. `zero_perc` is calculated as `zero * 100 // n`, representing the percentage of '0's in the string. `one_perc` is calculated as `(o - one) * 100 // (n - i - 1)`, representing the percentage of '1's in the remaining part of the string. `lst` contains all positions where both conditions (`zero_perc >= 50` and `one_perc >= 50`) were met during the loop iterations.**

This means that after the loop completes, `i` will be `n-1`, `zero` will be the total count of '0's in `s`, `one` will be the total count of '1's in `s`, `zero_perc` will be the percentage of '0's in the entire string, `one_perc` will be the percentage of '1's in the remaining part of the string (which is effectively the percentage of '1's in the string since `i` is `n-1`), and `lst` will contain all positions where these conditions were satisfied during the loop's execution.
