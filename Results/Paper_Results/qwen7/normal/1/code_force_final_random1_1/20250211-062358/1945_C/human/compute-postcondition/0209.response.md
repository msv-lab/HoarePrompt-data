Output State: `lst` must contain all positions where both `zero_perc >= 50` and `one_perc >= 50` conditions were met during the loop iterations; `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its final value and `abs(pk - ele)` for each iteration.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `lst` will include all indices where the percentage of '0's and '1's met the specified criteria. The variable `mini` will hold the smallest absolute difference found between `pk` and any element in `lst` during the entire loop execution.
