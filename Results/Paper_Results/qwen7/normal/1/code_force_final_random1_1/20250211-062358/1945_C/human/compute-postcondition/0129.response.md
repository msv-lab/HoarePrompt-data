Output State: **`mini` is the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`, `ele` is the next element in `lst` and `mini` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`**.

This means that `mini` has been updated to store the smaller value between its previous value and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`. The value of `ele` remains unchanged as it is the next element in the list `lst`.
