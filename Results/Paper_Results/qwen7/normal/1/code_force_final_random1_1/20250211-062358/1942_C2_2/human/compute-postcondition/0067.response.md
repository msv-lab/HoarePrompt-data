Postcondition: `a` is a list of integers, where the difference between the i-th element and the (i-1)-th element is not equal to 2, and all other elements in the list retain their original values. If the difference between the i-th element and the (i-1)-th element is even and the current value of `y` is greater than the difference between the i-th element and the (i-1)-th element divided by 2 minus 2, then `tmp` is a list containing one element, which is `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`, and `ans` is increased by `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`. Otherwise, no changes occur to `tmp` and `ans`.
