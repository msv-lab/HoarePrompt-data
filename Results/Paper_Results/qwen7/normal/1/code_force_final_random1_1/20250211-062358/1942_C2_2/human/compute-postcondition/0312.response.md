Output State: **`even` is a sorted list of all even gaps greater than 0 encountered during the loop's execution, `odd` must have at least one element, `y` is decreased by `gap // 2`.**

This means that `y` has been decreased by half of `gap`, rounded down to the nearest integer, while `even` and `odd` remain unchanged from their initial states.
