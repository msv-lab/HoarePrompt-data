Postcondition: `i` is `k + 2`, `ans` is an integer, `tmp` is a list. If `a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2`, then `ans` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0` and `y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, then `ans` is updated to `ans + (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, `tmp` is a list with one additional element which is `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, and `y` is updated to `y - (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 + 1`. If none of these conditions are met, the values of `ans`, `y`, and `tmp` remain unchanged.
