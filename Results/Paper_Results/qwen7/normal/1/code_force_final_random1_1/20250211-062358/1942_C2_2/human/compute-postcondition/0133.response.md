Postcondition: `i` is 2, `a` is a list of integers, `ans` is increased by `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2` if the difference between `a[2]` and `a[1]` is even and `y` is greater than `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2 - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged, `tmp` is a list containing one element which is `(a[1] - a[0]) // 2` if the difference between `a[1]` and `a[0]` is not 2, and `y` is decreased by `(a[1] - a[0]) // 2 - 1` if the difference between `a[1]` and `a[0]` is not 2.
