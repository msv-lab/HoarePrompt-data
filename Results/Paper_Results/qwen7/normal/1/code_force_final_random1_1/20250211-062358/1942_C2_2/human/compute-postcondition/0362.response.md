Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes integers t, n, x, and y. It validates that t is within the range 1 to 10^4, n is within the range 4 to 10^9, x is within the range 2 to min(n, 2⋅10^5), and y is within the range 0 to n-x. Additionally, it ensures that the sum of x across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5. The function processes these inputs and returns the results based on the given constraints.**

Note: The actual return value is not specified in the provided output, so the functionality focuses on the parameter constraints and validation process.
