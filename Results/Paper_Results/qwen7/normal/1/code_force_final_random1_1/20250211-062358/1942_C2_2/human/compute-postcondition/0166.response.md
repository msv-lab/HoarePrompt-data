Output State: **`i` is the second element in `val`, `c` is `i // 2`, `y` is decreased by `i // 2`, `sx` is the new `i` plus the previous value of `sx`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block where the assignments to `c`, `y`, and `sx` were made. Since the `break` statement does not change the values of the variables, the values of `i`, `c`, `y`, and `sx` remain as they were before the `break` statement was executed.
