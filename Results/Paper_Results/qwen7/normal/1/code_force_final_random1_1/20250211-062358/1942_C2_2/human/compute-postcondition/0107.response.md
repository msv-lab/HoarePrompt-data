Output State: **`ii` is 1, `i` is `len(a)`, `ans` is an integer plus `y`, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers created from the input split.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in the list `a`. The values of `ii`, `i`, `ans`, `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged from their initial states.
