Output State: **`i` is the third element in `val`, `c` is `i // 2`, `y` is decreased by `i // 2`, `sx` is the new value of `i` plus the previous value of `sx`, and `sx` is updated by adding `y * 2` to its current value, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but indicates that the execution exits the most internal loop or if statement. All the preconditions remain valid after the execution of the `break` statement.
