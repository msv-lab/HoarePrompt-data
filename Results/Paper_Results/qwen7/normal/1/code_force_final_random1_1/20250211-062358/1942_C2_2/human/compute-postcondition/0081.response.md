Output State: **`i` is `k + 2`, `ans` is an integer, `tmp` is a list with one additional element which is `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` to the list `tmp`. Since `i` is `k + 2`, the expression `a[i]` refers to `a[k + 2]` and `a[i - 1]` refers to `a[k + 1]`. Therefore, the list `tmp` now contains one additional element, which is the integer result of `(a[k + 2] - a[k + 1]) // 2`. The values of `i`, `ans`, and `tmp` are updated accordingly, while other variables remain unchanged.
