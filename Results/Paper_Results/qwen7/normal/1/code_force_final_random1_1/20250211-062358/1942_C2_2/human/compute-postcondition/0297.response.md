Postcondition: `i` is `x`, `x` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to its initial value, `next_elem` is `a[i + 1]`, `gap` is `next_elem - a[i] - 1`. 

- If `gap > 1` and `gap` is odd, `odd` is a list containing two elements where the first element is `gap` and the second element is the original element from `odd`.
- If `gap > 0` and `gap` is even, `even` is a list containing two elements where the first element is `gap` and the second element is the original element from `even`.
- Otherwise, `even` remains unchanged.
