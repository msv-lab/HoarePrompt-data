Output State: **`i` is the third element in `val`, `c` is `i // 2`, `y` is decreased by `i // 2`, `sx` is the new value of `i` plus the previous value of `sx`, and `sx` is updated by adding `y * 2` to its current value.**

Explanation: 
- The value of `i` remains unchanged as it is the third element in `val`.
- The value of `c` remains unchanged as it is `i // 2`.
- The value of `y` is decreased by `i // 2`, so `y -= i // 2`.
- The value of `sx` is updated by adding the previous value of `i` plus the previous value of `sx`, and then adding `y * 2`. So, `sx` is now `i + (previous sx) + y * 2`.
