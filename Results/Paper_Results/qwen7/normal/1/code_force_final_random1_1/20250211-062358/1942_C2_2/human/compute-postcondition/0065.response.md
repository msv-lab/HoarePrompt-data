Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, where the difference between the i-th element and the (i-1)-th element is not equal to 2, and all other elements in the list retain their original values. The difference between the i-th element and the (i-1)-th element is even, and the current value of `y` is greater than the difference between the i-th element and the (i-1)-th element divided by 2 minus 2; `tmp` is a list containing one element, which is `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`; `ans` is increased by `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `y` is decreased by `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`. Since the difference between the i-th element and the (i-1)-th element is even, `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` is an integer. The new value of `y` is thus greater than this integer minus 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
