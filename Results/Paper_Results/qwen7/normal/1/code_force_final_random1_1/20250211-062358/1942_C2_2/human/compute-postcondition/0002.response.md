Output State: **`tt` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `ii` is 0, `n` is the first integer input, `x` is the second integer input, `y` is the third integer input.**

Explanation: The code `n, x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `x`, and `y` respectively. The initial state of `tt` and `ii` remains unchanged. Therefore, `tt` must still be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, and `ii` is still 0.
