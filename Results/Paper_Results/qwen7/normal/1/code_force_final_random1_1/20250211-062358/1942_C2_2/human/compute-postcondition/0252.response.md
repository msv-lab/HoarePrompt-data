Output State: **`x` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `t1` is `(a[1] + 1) % n`, `ans` remains unchanged, `t2` is `(a[1] + 2) % n`**

Explanation: The variable `i` is incremented by 1, making it 2. The value of `t2` is updated to `(a[i] + 2) % n`, which translates to `(a[1] + 2) % n`. The other variables (`x`, `t1`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.
