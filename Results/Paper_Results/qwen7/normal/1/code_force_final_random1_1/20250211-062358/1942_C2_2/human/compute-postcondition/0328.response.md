Output State: **`even` is a sorted list of all even gaps greater than 0, `odd` is empty, `ans` is increased by the value of `gap`, `y` is decreased by `gap // 2`.**

Explanation: The code `y -= gap // 2` decreases the value of `y` by `gap // 2`. The other variables (`even`, `odd`, and `ans`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
