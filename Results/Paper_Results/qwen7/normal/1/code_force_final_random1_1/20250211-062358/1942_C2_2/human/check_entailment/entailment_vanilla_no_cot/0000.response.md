Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Triangles:**
   - The logic for counting additional triangles when choosing new vertices is flawed. Specifically, the condition `if (a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1:` is incorrect. It should be checking if the gap between two chosen vertices can form multiple triangles, but the current implementation does not correctly handle this.
   
2. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The code incorrectly handles the edge case where the first and last chosen vertices form a gap of 2. The condition `elif a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2:` should be handled separately and correctly.

3. **Redundant Code:**
   - There is redundant code in the form of `tmp` list and unnecessary complexity in the logic.

4. **Final Calculation:**
   - The final calculation of `ans` does not properly account for the maximum number of triangles that can be formed with the given constraints.

### Correct Solution:
Here's a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    tt = int(input())
    for _ in range(tt):
        n, x, y = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        
        # Calculate initial triangles using x chosen vertices
        ans = x - 2
        
        # Handle gaps between chosen vertices
        for i in range(1, len(a)):
            gap = a[i] - a[i - 1] - 2
            if gap > 0:
                ans += gap // 2
                y -= gap // 2 - 1
        
        # Handle the gap between the first and last chosen vertices
        gap = a[0] + n - a[-1] - 2
        if gap > 0:
            ans += gap // 2
            y -= gap // 2 - 1
        
        # Use remaining y to form additional triangles
        ans += min(y, n - x - 2)
        
        print(min(ans, n - 2))

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Solution:
1. **Initial Calculation:**
   - Start by calculating the initial number of triangles using the `x` chosen vertices: `ans = x - 2`.

2. **Handle Gaps Between Chosen Vertices:**
   - Iterate through the sorted list of chosen vertices and calculate the gaps between consecutive chosen vertices. For each gap greater than 2, add half of the gap minus one to `ans` and decrease `y` accordingly.

3. **Handle the Gap Between First and Last Chosen Vertices:**
   - Calculate the gap between the first and last chosen vertices and handle it similarly.

4. **Use Remaining `y` to Form Additional Triangles:**
   - Add the minimum of `y` and the remaining number of vertices needed to form additional triangles (`n - x - 2`) to `ans`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - Ensure the final answer does not exceed `n - 2` and print it.

This corrected solution should handle all test cases correctly.
