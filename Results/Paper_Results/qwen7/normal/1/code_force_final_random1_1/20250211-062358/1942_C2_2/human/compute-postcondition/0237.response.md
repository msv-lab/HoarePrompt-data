Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer**.

The code `n, x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `x`, and `y`. This means that the values of `odd`, `even`, `ans`, and `y` from the previous state remain unchanged, while `n` and `x` are now specific input integers.
