Output State: **`x` must be greater than 0; `t1` is `(a[i] + 1) % n`; `t2` is `(a[i] + 2) % n`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `t2` to `(a[i] + 2) % n`. Since `t1` was previously defined as `(a[i] + 1) % n`, `t2` is simply the next value in sequence. The precondition that `x` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged.
