Output State: **The final value of `nx` will be a string of length `n`, consisting entirely of 'S' characters.**

Explanation: Given the loop structure and the conditions provided, for each iteration of the outer loop (controlled by `i`), the inner loop (controlled by `j`) checks the conditions to append either 'S' or 'F' to the string `nx`. If `i` is in the first quarter of `sb` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`, 'S' is appended; otherwise, 'F' is appended. Since `sb` contains all integers from 6 to `n` plus integers from 1 to `n`, the first quarter of `sb` will include the first \(\lceil \frac{n}{4} \rceil\) elements. However, because the loop runs for every `i` from 1 to `n`, and given the condition that `i` being in the first quarter of `sb` or `j` being in the first quarter of `sb` can happen for any `i` and `j`, it is guaranteed that for each `i`, there will be at least one `j` such that the condition is met, leading to 'S' being appended to `nx` for each position. Therefore, after all iterations, `nx` will be a string of length `n` filled with 'S'.
