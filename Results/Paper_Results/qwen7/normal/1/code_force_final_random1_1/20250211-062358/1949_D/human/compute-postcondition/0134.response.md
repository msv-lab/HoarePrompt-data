Output State: **`i` is 7, `n` is an integer between 7 and 24, `j` is not equal to `n + 1`, `sa` is a list containing the integers 6 and 7, `sb` is a list containing the integers 6 and 7.**

Explanation: The code `sb.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 7) to the list `sb`. Initially, `sb` contains the integer 6. After appending, `sb` will contain both 6 and 7. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
