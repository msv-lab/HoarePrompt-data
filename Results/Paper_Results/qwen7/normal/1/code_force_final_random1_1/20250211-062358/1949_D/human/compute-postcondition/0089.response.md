Output State: **`j` is `n + 1`, `x` is a list, `a[j]` is `a[j] + 1`, `b[j]` is unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `a[i] += 1` increments the value of `a[i]` by 1. However, there is no definition or assignment for `i` in the given code snippet, only `j` is defined as `n + 1`. Since `a[i]` is being incremented, it implies that `i` should be a valid index for the list `a`. The value of `j` remains `n + 1`, `x` remains a list, and `a[j]` is updated to `a[j] + 1`. The value of `b[j]` remains unchanged as there is no operation performed on it.
