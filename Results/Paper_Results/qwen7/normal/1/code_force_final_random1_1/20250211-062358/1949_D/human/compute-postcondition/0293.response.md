Output State: **`j` is within the range 2 to \( n \); `nx` is incremented by the value of `xx[i][j - 1]` if `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', otherwise it is set to 'S' followed by the original value of `nx` if either `i` is in the first quarter of `sb` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`, or is set to 'F' concatenated with the previous value of `nx` if neither `i` nor `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`.**

Explanation: The code `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` increments `nx` by the value of `xx[i][j - 1]` if `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?'. Otherwise, it sets `nx` to 'S' followed by the original value of `nx` if either `i` is in the first quarter of `sb` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`. If neither `i` nor `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`, it sets `nx` to 'F' concatenated with the previous value of `nx`. The conditions involving `i` and `j` being in the first quarter of `sb` remain unchanged from the initial state.
