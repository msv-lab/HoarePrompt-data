Output State: **`j` is 1, `nx` is `xx[i][0]`, `n` remains the same.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `nx` by adding `xx[i][j-1]` to it. Given that `j` is initially 1, `xx[i][j-1]` is equivalent to `xx[i][0]`. Therefore, `nx` is updated to be the value of `xx[i][0]`. The values of `j` and `n` remain unchanged.
