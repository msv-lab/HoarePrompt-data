Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is an integer between 2 and 24, `j` is not equal to `n + 1`, `sa` is a list containing all integers from 6 to `n`, `sb` is a list containing all integers from 6 to `n` with `i` appended.**

Explanation: The code `sb.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is `n + 1`) to the list `sb`. Since `sb` originally contained all integers from 6 to `n`, after appending `i`, `sb` now contains all integers from 6 to `n` with `i` (or `n + 1`) appended. All other variables remain unchanged.
