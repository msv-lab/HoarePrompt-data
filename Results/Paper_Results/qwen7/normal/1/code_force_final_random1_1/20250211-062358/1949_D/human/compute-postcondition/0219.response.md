Output State: **`nx` is a string that has been updated to include 'F', `j` is `n + 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to `1`, and `i` is `n + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the string `nx`. The values of `j`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state.
