Output State: **`nx` is 'S', `i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be at least 0, `j` is 1, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is equal to '?'**

Explanation: The code `nx += 'S'` appends the character 'S' to the end of the string `nx`. Since `nx` was initially an empty string, after executing this line, `nx` becomes 'S'. The values of `i`, `n`, `j`, and the condition regarding `xx[i][j - 1]` remain unchanged.
