Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `j` is within the range 1 to \( n \).
- \( n \) is an integer between 2 and 24.
- `nx` is either incremented by the value of `xx[i][j - 1]` if `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', or is set to 'S' followed by the original value of `nx` if either `i` is in the first quarter of `sb` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`, or is set to 'F' concatenated with the previous value of `nx` if neither `i` nor `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`.

### Loop Head
```
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
- The loop iterates over `j` from 1 to \( n \).
- The loop condition for the next iteration is that `j` should be within the range 1 to \( n \).

### Current Values at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `j` is within the range 1 to \( n \).
- \( n \) is an integer between 2 and 24.
- `nx` has been updated based on the conditions mentioned.

### Next Iteration
- For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1.
- Therefore, `j` will be \( j + 1 \).

### Updated States
- `j` will be \( j + 1 \), which means `j` will now be within the range 2 to \( n \).
- \( n \) remains the same.
- `nx` will be updated again based on the new value of `j`.

### Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration
State: **`j` is within the range 2 to \( n \), \( n \) is an integer between 2 and 24, and `nx` is either incremented by the value of `xx[i][j - 1]` if `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', or is set to 'S' followed by the original value of `nx` if either `i` is in the first quarter of `sb` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`, or is set to 'F' concatenated with the previous value of `nx` if neither `i` nor `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`.**
