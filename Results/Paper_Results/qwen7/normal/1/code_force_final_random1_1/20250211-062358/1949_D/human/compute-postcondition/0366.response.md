Output State: **`nx` is either 'SS', 'FS', 'SF', or 'FF' plus the character at index 2 of `xx[i]`, `j` is 3, `n` is a non-negative integer, and the character at position `j-1` (which is 2) in the list `xx[i]` is not '?'**.

This means that the value of `nx` is updated by appending the character at the 2nd position of the list `xx[i]` to the existing value of `nx`. All other variables remain unchanged.
