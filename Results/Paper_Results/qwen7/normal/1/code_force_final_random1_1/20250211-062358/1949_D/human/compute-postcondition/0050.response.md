Postcondition: `x` is an array, and `a[i]` and `a[j]` are integers. If the value at index `j-1` in `x` is 'F', then both `a[i]` and `a[j]` are increased by 1. If the value at index `j-1` in `x` is 'S', then the value at index `j` in `x` remains 'S' and, if the element at index `j` in `x` has not been incremented, it is increased by 1.
