Output State: **`i` is 1; `n` is at least 2; `j` is 2; `b[1]` is increased by 2.**

Explanation: The code `b[j] += 1` increments the value of `b[j]` by 1. Given that `j` is 2, this means `b[2]` is increased by 1. Since `b[1]` was already increased by 1 in the initial state, the new value of `b[2]` is effectively `b[1] + 1`, which is an increase of 2 from its original value. All other variables remain unchanged.
