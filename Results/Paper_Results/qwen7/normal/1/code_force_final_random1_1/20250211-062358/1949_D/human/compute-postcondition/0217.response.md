Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in the given code is `j`. The loop runs from `1` to `n + 1`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `j` is within the range `[1, n + 1)`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `nx` is a string that has been updated based on the condition of `xx[i][j - 1]`.
   - If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not `?`, `nx` is updated by appending `xx[i][j - 1]` to the original `nx`.
   - Otherwise, `nx` is updated to `"F"` followed by the original `nx`, or `'S'` followed by the original `nx`, depending on whether `i` is in the first quarter of `sa` or not.
   - Both `n` being greater than or equal to `1` and `i` being `n + 1` remain true after the execution.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts from `1` and goes up to `n + 1`, at the end of the previous iteration, `j` would be `n`.
   - For the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by `1`, so `j` will be `n + 1`.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `nx` remains unchanged because the loop body does not modify it outside the condition check.
   - `j` is updated to `n + 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged since it is not modified in the loop.
   - `i` remains `n + 1` as stated in the postcondition.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the next iteration are `j` and `nx`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`nx` is a string that has been updated based on the condition of `xx[i][j - 1]`, `j` is `n + 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to `1`, and `i` is `n + 1`.**
