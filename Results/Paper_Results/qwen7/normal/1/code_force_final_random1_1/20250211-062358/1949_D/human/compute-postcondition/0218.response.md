Output State: **`nx` is a string that now includes the character `xx[i][j - 1]`, `j` is `n + 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to `1`, and `i` is `n + 1`.**

Explanation: The code appends the character `xx[i][j - 1]` to the string `nx`. Since `i` is `n + 1` and `j` is `n + 1`, these values remain unchanged. The only change is that `nx` now includes the specified character from the list `xx`.
