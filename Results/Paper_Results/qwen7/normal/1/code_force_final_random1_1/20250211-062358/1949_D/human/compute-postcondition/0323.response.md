Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `nx` is either 'S' or 'F'.
- If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', then `nx` is set to `xx[i][j - 1]`.
- Otherwise, if `i` is in the first quarter of `sb` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`, then `nx` is 'S'.
- Otherwise, `nx` is 'F'.

### Loop Head
```
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
- The loop variable `j` starts from 1 and goes up to `n`.
- The only variable in the loop head that changes with each iteration is `j`.

### Adjusting the State
- Since `j` is the only variable in the loop head that changes, we need to update its value.
- The value of `j` at the start of the next iteration will be `j + 1`.

### New State
- `nx` remains unchanged unless the loop body updates it.
- `j` will be `j + 1`.

### Conclusion
Given that `j` is the only variable in the loop head, we only need to adjust its state.

**State:**
- `nx` is either 'S' or 'F'.
- `j` is `j + 1`.

Since the exact value of `nx` is not specified and can remain as it is unless updated by the loop body, we do not change it here.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`nx` is either 'S' or 'F', `j` is `j + 1`**
