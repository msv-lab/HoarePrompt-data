Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 24; `a` is a list of length `n + 1`, where all elements are 0; `b` is a list of length `n + 1`, where all elements are 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes a new list `b` with `n + 1` elements, all set to 0. The list `a` remains unchanged from its initial state, where it is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements being 0. Therefore, both lists `a` and `b` now have the same structure and values.
