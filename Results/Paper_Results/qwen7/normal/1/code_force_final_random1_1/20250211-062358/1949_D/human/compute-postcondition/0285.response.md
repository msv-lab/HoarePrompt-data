Output State: **`j` is within the range 1 to n, `n` is an integer between 2 and 24, and `nx` is 'S' + the original value of `nx`. Additionally, either `i` is in the first quarter of `sb` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`.**

Explanation: The variable `nx` is concatenated with the string `'S'`, which means `nx` now includes `'S'` followed by its original value. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
