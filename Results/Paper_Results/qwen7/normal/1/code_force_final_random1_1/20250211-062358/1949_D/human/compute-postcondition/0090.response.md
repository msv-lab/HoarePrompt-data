Output State: **`j` is `n + 1`, `x` is a list, `a[j]` is `a[j] + 2`, `b[j]` is unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `a[j] += 1` increments the value of `a[j]` by 1. Since initially `a[j]` was `a[j] + 1`, after executing the code, `a[j]` becomes `a[j] + 2`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
