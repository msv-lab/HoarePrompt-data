Output State: **Postcondition: `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is an integer between 2 and 24, `j` is not equal to `n + 1`, `sa` is a list containing all integers from 6 to `n` with 1 appended and all integers from 2 to `n` (excluding those for which `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`), `sb` is a list containing all integers from 6 to `n`, and the length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be `n + 1` because the loop increments `i` from 1 to `n`. The conditions inside the loop check if `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, and if so, it appends `i` to `sa`. Since the loop runs for each value of `i` from 1 to `n`, `sa` will contain all integers from 6 to `n` with 1 appended and all integers from 2 to `n` (excluding those for which `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`). The list `sb` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
