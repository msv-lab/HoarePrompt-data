Output State: **`nx` is a string that has been updated by appending `xx[i][j - 1]`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is `n + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` appends the character `xx[i][j - 1]` to the string `nx`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged, with `i` still being `n + 1`.
