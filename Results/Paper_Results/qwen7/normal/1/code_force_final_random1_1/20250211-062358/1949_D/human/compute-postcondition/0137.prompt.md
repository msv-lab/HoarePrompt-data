Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After the loop completes, `i` will be `n + 1`, `n` remains an integer between 2 and 24, `j` will be `n + 1`, `xx` is a list containing `n` arrays (each representing an input string `x`), and for every index `k` from 1 to `n`, `a[k]` is incremented by the total number of 'F's across all input strings `x` up to index `k-1`. Similarly, `b[k]` is incremented by the total number of 'S's across all input strings `x` up to index `k-1`. The variable `sa` is an empty list; `sb` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    if a[i] > 0 and b[i] == 0:
        sa.append(i)
    if b[i] > 0 and a[i] == 0:
        sb.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is an integer, `n` is an integer between 2 and 24, `j` is not equal to `n + 1`. If `b[i]` is greater than 0 and `a[i]` is 0, then `i` is added to the list `sa`. Otherwise, no change is made to the variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 6, `n` is an integer between 2 and 24, `j` is not equal to `n + 1`, `sa` is a list containing the integer 6, `sb` is a list containing the integer 6, and if `b[6] > 0` and `a[6] == 0`, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 7, `n` is an integer between 7 and 24, `j` is not equal to `n + 1`, `sa` is a list containing the integers 6 and 7, `sb` is a list containing the integers 6 and 7, if `b[7] > 0` and `a[7] == 0`, the conditions remain unchanged; otherwise, the conditions also remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
