Postcondition: `nx` is either 'S' or 'F', `j` is `j + 1`. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', then `nx` is either 'Sxx[i][j - 1]' or 'Fxx[i][j - 1]'. Otherwise, if `i` is in the first quarter of `sb` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`, then `nx` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `nx` becomes either 'SF' or 'FF'.
