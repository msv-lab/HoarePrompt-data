Output State: **`nx` is either 'FF' or 'SF', `n` must be between 2 and 24, and `xx[i][j]` is either 'F' or 'S'**.

Explanation: The value of `nx` is concatenated with 'F', which means if `nx` was 'F', it becomes 'FF', and if `nx` was 'S', it becomes 'SF'. The values of `n` and `xx[i][j]` remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
