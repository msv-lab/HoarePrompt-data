Output State: **`j` is n + 1, `x[j - 1]` is 'F', and `a[i]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The initial state has `j` set to `n + 1`, which means `j` is outside the range [1, n]. The value of `x[j - 1]` is 'F'. The code snippet `a[i] += 1` increments the value of `a[i]` by 1. Since no other variables are affected, the output state includes the updated value of `a[i]` and retains the unchanged values of `j` and `x[j - 1]`.
