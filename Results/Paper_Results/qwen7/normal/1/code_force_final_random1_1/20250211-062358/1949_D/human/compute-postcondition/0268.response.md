Postcondition: **`i` is within the range [1, n], `n` is an integer between 2 and 24, `j` is not equal to `n + 1`, `sa` is a list containing all integers from 6 to `n`, and `sb` is a list containing all integers from 6 to `n` with `i` appended. Additionally, the length of `sa` is less than the length of `sb`. If `a[i]` is 0 and `b[i]` is 0, then `a[i]` remains 0 and `b[i]` remains 0.**
