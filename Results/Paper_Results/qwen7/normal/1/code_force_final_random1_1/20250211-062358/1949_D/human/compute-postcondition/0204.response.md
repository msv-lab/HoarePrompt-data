Output State: **`nx` is 'S', `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n + 1`, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is `'?'`, and neither `i` is in `sa[:n // 4]` nor `j` is in `sa[:n // 4]`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `nx += 'S'` appends the character 'S' to the end of the string `nx`. Since `nx` was initially an empty string, after executing this line, `nx` becomes 'S'. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
