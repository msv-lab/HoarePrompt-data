Output State: **`nx` is either 'FFF' or 'FSF' or 'SFF' or 'SSF', `n` must be between 2 and 24, and `xx[i][j]` is either 'F' or 'S'. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', then `nx` remains unchanged. Otherwise, if either `i` is in the first quarter of `sa` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sa`, then `nx` is either 'FF' or 'SF'. Otherwise, `nx` is either 'FS' or 'SS'.**

Explanation: The code `nx += 'F'` appends 'F' to the end of the string `nx`. Given the initial conditions, `nx` could be one of 'FF', 'FS', 'SF', or 'SS'. After appending 'F', `nx` becomes 'FFF', 'FSF', 'SFF', or 'SSF'. The values of `n` and `xx[i][j]` remain unchanged, and the conditions regarding `xx[i][j - 1]`, `i`, and `j` relative to `sa` also remain valid.
