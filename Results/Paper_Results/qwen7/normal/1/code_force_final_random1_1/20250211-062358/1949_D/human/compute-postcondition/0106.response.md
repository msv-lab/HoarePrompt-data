Output State: **Postcondition: `j` is `n + 1`, `x` is a list, and for every index `k` from 1 to `n`, `a[k]` is incremented by the number of 'F's in `x` up to index `k-1`. Similarly, `b[k]` is incremented by the number of 'S's in `x` up to index `k-1`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `j` will be set to `n + 1`. The lists `a` and `b` will have been updated such that each element `a[k]` (where `k` ranges from 1 to `n`) will contain the cumulative count of 'F's in the string `x` up to the `k-1`th character. Likewise, each element `b[k]` will contain the cumulative count of 'S's in the string `x` up to the `k-1`th character.
