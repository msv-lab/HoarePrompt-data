Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = n`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `nx` is either 'SS', 'FS', 'SF', or 'FF'.
   - `j` is 2.
   - `n` is a non-negative integer.
   - The character at position `j-1` (which is 1) in the list `xx[i]` is not '?'.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `j` is currently 2, the next value of `j` would be 3 (because the loop increments `j` by 1 each time).
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body, but since no such modification is mentioned, `n` stays the same.
   - The character at position `j-1` (which will now be 2) in the list `xx[i]` must not be '?'. This condition is already satisfied as per the given postcondition.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `j` will be incremented to 3.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `nx` remains the same as it does not depend on the loop variable `j`.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`nx` is either 'SS', 'FS', 'SF', or 'FF', `j` is 3, `n` is a non-negative integer, and the character at position `j-1` (which is 2) in the list `xx[i]` is not '?'**.
