Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for j in range(1, n + 1):`. The variables involved here are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `nx` is an empty string.
   - `i` is `n + 1`.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute if `n + 1` is at least 1 (since `range(1, n + 1)` starts from 1).

4. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - Since `i` is `n + 1`, and the loop requires `n + 1` to be at least 1, `n` must be at least 0.
   - The variable `j` will start from 1 and increment by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `n + 1`. Therefore, before the loop starts, `j` should be 1.

5. **Formulate the final state**:
   - `nx` remains an empty string.
   - `i` is `n + 1`, but since `j` starts from 1, `n` must be at least 0.
   - `j` should be 1 initially.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`nx` is an empty string, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be at least 0, `j` is 1**.
