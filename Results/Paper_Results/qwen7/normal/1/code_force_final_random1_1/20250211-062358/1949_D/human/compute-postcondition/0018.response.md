Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `j` is 1, and if the element at index `j-1` in the list `x` is 'F', then `a[j]` is increased by 1. If the element at index `j-1` in the list `x` is 'S', then `b[j]` is incremented by 1. If the element at index `j-1` in the list `x` is neither 'F' nor 'S', the state remains unchanged.
