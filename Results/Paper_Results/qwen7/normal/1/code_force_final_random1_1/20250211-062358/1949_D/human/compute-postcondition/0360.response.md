Postcondition: `nx` is either 'SS' or 'FS' or 'SF' or 'FF', `j` is 2, `n` is a non-negative integer, and the character at position `j-1` (which is 1) in the list `xx[i]` is not '?'.

This postcondition summarizes that regardless of whether the condition `i in sb[:n // 4] or j in sb[:n // 4]` is true or false, `nx` will be one of the combinations 'SS', 'FS', 'SF', or 'FF', `j` remains 2, `n` remains a non-negative integer, and the character at position 1 in the list `xx[i]` remains not '?'.
