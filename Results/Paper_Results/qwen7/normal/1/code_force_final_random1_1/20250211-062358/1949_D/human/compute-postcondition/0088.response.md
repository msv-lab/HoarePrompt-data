Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = n + 1 - 1`, which means it runs from `j = 1` to `j = n`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is within the range `[1, n]`.
   - `x` is a list.
   - `a[j]` and `b[j]` are updated based on the value of `x[j - 1]`.
     - If `x[j - 1]` is 'F', then `a[j]` is incremented by 1.
     - If `x[j - 1]` is 'S', then `b[j]` is incremented by 1.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `j` by 1 at each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `n`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be `n + 1`.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `j` must be `n + 1`.
   - `x` remains the same.
   - `a[j]` and `b[j]` will be updated based on the value of `x[n]` (since `j` will now be `n + 1`).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`j` is `n + 1`, `x` is a list, and `a[j]` and `b[j]` are updated based on the value of `x[n]`**.
