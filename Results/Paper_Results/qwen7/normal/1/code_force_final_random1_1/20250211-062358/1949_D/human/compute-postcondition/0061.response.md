Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `n`.
2. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: The loop continues as long as `j` is within the range from 1 to `n + 1`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `x` is an array.
   - `a[i]` is an integer.
   - `b[j]` is incremented by 1.
   - `j` is `j_end + 1`.
   - `n` is the same as before.
   - If `x[j - 1]` equals 'F', then both `a[i]` and `a[j]` are increased by 1.
   - If `x[j - 1]` equals 'S', then only `b[j]` is incremented by 1.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` is currently `j_end + 1`, for the loop to continue, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `j` will become `j_end + 2`.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `b[j]` will be incremented by 1 if `x[j - 1]` equals 'S'. If it equals 'F', both `a[i]` and `a[j]` will be incremented by 1.

Given these points, let's write the updated state:

- `x` remains an array.
- `a[i]` remains an integer.
- `b[j]` will be incremented by 1 (since `j` will be `j_end + 2` and we don't know the value of `x[j - 1]` yet).
- `j` becomes `j_end + 2`.
- `n` remains the same.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `x` is an array, `a[i]` is an integer, `b[j]` is incremented by 1, `j` is `j_end + 2`, and `n` is the same as before.**
