To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the given code snippet:

- `nx` is a string constructed based on certain conditions within a loop.
- `i` and `j` are both set to `n + 1` after all iterations of the loop.

Given this information, we need to understand how `nx` is constructed. Since the specific construction logic within the loop is not provided, we can infer that `nx` is likely built up during the loop iterations, and it ends up being a string that reflects the final values of `i` and `j`.

Since `i` and `j` are both set to `n + 1` after all iterations, we can conclude that `nx` will contain the value of `n + 1` in some form (e.g., as a string representation).

Therefore, the output will be the string representation of `n + 1`.

Output: **n + 1**
