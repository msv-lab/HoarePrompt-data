Output State: **`j` is 4, `n` remains the same, `xx[i][0]` is `'?'`, and `nx` is a string with an additional 'F' appended to it.**

Explanation:
- The variable `nx` had a previous value that was either `'FF'` if either `i` or 3 is in the first quarter of `sa`, or a string with an additional 'S' appended to it otherwise.
- The code `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the current value of `nx`.
- Therefore, `nx` now becomes the previous value of `nx` plus 'F'.
- All other variables (`j`, `n`, and `xx[i][0]`) remain unchanged.
