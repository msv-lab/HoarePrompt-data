Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `i`.

2. **Determine the initial conditions at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `xx` is a list containing the array `x`.
   - `a[i]` is the total count of 'F' in `x` up to index `n`.
   - `b[j]` is the total count of 'S' in `x` up to index `n`.
   - `j` is `n + 1`.
   - `n` remains the same as before.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n + 1`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value less than `n + 1`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will be set to the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus 1.

5. **Update the other variables**:
   - Since `n` remains the same, `n` does not change.
   - `j` is `n + 1`, so it also remains the same.
   - The values of `a[i]` and `b[j]` depend on the current value of `i` and `n`, but they do not change just because `i` increments.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.
- `n` remains the same.
- `j` remains the same.
- `xx` remains the same.
- `a[i]` and `b[j]` remain the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**`xx` is a list containing the array `x`, `a[i]` is the total count of 'F' in `x` up to index `n`, `b[j]` is the total count of 'S' in `x` up to index `n`, `j` is `n + 1`, and `i` is `n` (since `i` starts from 1 and will be incremented to `n + 1` for the next iteration).**

State: **`xx` is a list containing the array `x`, `a[i]` is the total count of 'F' in `x` up to index `n`, `b[j]` is the total count of 'S' in `x` up to index `n`, `j` is `n + 1`, and `i` is `n + 1`**
