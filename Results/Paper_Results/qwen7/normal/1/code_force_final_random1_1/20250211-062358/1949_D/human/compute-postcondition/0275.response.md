Postcondition: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is an integer between 2 and 24, `j` is not equal to `n + 1`, `sa` is a list containing all integers from 6 to `n`, `sb` is a list containing all integers from 6 to `n` with `i` appended. This remains true regardless of the value of `a[i]` and `b[i]` since there is no modification to the lists `sa` and `sb` within the if block and no else part to consider.**
