Postcondition: **Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is an integer between 2 and 24, `j` is not equal to `n + 1`, `sa` is a list containing all integers from 6 to `n`, and `sb` is a list containing all integers from 6 to `n`. The length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`, indicating that the condition `len(sa) >= len(sb)` is satisfied.**
