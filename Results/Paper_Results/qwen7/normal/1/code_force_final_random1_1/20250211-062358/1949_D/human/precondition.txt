n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24. The input consists of n lines, where the j-th character of the i-th line corresponds to the transition video between the i-th and the j-th scenarios. Each line contains n characters, which can be F (funny), S (scary), ?, . (no transition video decided yet), or . (same scenario). At most \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor transition videos are already decided (represented by F or S).
