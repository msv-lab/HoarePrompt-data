Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires generating a complete transition video plan ensuring no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transition videos of the same type for any permutation of scenarios. Given the constraints, the function should handle the undecided transition videos ('?') appropriately.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - The function reads the input and initializes arrays `a` and `b` to count 'F' and 'S' transitions respectively.
   - It processes each line of input, updating the counts for 'F' and 'S'.
   - It categorizes positions into `sa` and `sb` based on the counts of 'F' and 'S'.
   - Depending on the lengths of `sa` and `sb`, it decides whether to fill the remaining undecided positions with 'F' or 'S'.

3. **Issues Identified**:
   - The function does not correctly handle the constraint of no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive 'F' or 'S'. The current logic only ensures that the undecided positions are filled with 'F' or 'S' based on the initial counts without considering the overall sequence.
   - The function does not ensure that the generated sequence meets the requirement for any permutation of scenarios.

4. **Correctness**:
   - Given the issues identified, the function does not correctly solve the problem as stated. It fails to ensure that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive 'F' or 'S' occur in any permutation of scenarios.

Correctness: **False**
