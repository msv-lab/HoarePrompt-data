Output State: **`nx` is 'S' + the original string value of nx, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is `n + 1`**.

Explanation: The code `nx += 'S'` appends the string 'S' to `nx`. Since `nx` was initially a string, after appending 'S', `nx` becomes 'S' concatenated with its original value. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged as no operations were performed on them.
