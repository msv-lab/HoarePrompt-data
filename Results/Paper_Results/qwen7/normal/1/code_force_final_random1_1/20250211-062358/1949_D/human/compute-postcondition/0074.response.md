Output State: **`xx` is a list containing the array `x`, `a[i]` is the total count of 'F' in `x` up to index `n`, `b[j]` is the total count of 'S' in `x` up to index `n`, `j` is `n + 1`, `i` is `n + 1`, `x` is an input string.**

The code `x = input()` assigns the input string to the variable `x`. The values of the other variables (`xx`, `a[i]`, `b[j]`, `j`, `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
