Output State: **`i` is 6, `n` is an integer between 2 and 24, `j` is not equal to `n + 1`, `sa` is a list containing the integer 6, `sb` is a list containing the integer 6.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `i` (which is 6) to the list `sb`. Since `i` was already 6, appending it to `sb` adds 6 to the list `sb`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state and the given conditions.
