Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = n`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is within the range 2 to \( n \).
   - \( n \) is an integer between 2 and 24.
   - `nx` is either incremented by the value of `xx[i][j - 1]` if `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', 'S' concatenated with the original value of `nx` if `i` is in the first quarter of `sb` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`, or 'F' concatenated with the original value of `nx` if neither `i` nor `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `j` by 1 each time, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `j + 1`.
   - `n` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.

5. **Check the new range for `j`**:
   - If `j` was within the range 2 to \( n \) before, then at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be 3 (since `j` was 2 before, and it increments by 1).
   - Therefore, `j` should now be within the range 3 to \( n \).

6. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `j` is now 3 (since it was 2 before and incremented by 1).
   - `n` remains the same.
   - The conditions for `nx` remain the same because they depend on the values of `i`, `j`, and `sb`, which are not modified by the loop itself.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `j` is within the range 3 to \( n \), \( n \) is an integer between 2 and 24, and `nx` is either incremented by the value of `xx[i][j - 1]` if `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', 'S' concatenated with the original value of `nx` if `i` is in the first quarter of `sb` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`, or 'F' concatenated with the original value of `nx` if neither `i` nor `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`.**
