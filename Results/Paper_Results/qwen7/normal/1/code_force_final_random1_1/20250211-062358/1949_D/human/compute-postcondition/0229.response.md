Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for j in range(1, n + 1):`. The variables involved here are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `j` is initially set to `n + 1`.
   - `n` remains the same as its initial value.

3. **Check if the loop can execute**:
   - The loop `for j in range(1, n + 1)` will execute as long as `1 <= j < n + 1`.
   - For the loop to start, `j` must be within the range `[1, n + 1)`, but since `j` is initially `n + 1`, it is not within this range.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - To ensure the loop can execute, `j` must be within the range `[1, n + 1)`. Therefore, `j` should be set to `1` (the smallest possible value in the range).

5. **Final state**:
   - `nx` is an empty string and does not affect the loop execution.
   - `i` is not involved in the loop head and does not need adjustment.
   - `j` should be set to `1`.
   - `n` remains the same.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`j` is 1, `n` remains the same**
