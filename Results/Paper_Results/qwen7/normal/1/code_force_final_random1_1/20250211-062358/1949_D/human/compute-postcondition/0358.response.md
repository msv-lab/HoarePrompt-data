Output State: **`nx` is either 'SS' or 'FS', `j` is 2, `n` is a non-negative integer, and the character at position `j-1` (which is 1) in the list `xx[i]` is not '?'**.

Explanation: The variable `nx` is concatenated with the string 'S'. Since `nx` was either 'S' or 'F', after concatenation, `nx` becomes either 'SS' or 'FS'. The values of `j`, `n`, and the character at position `j-1` in the list `xx[i]` remain unchanged.
