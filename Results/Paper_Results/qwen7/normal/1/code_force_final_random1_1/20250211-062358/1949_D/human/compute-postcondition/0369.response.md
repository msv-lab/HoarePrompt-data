Postcondition: `nx` is either 'SSS', 'FSS', 'SFS', 'FFS', 'SSF', 'FSF', 'SFF', or 'FFF', `j` is 3, `n` is a non-negative integer, and the character at position `j-1` (which is 2) in the list `xx[i]` is not '?'.

This means that after the execution of the if-else block, `nx` can take on any of the specified values ('SSS', 'FSS', 'SFS', 'FFS', 'SSF', 'FSF', 'SFF', 'FFF'), `j` remains 3, `n` remains a non-negative integer, and the character at index 2 of the list `xx[i]` is not '?'.
