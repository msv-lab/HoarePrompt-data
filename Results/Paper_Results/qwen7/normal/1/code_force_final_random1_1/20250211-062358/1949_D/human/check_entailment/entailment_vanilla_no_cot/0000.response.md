Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided solution does not correctly address the problem requirements. Here are some key issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Transition Video Types**: The logic for determining the types of transition videos (funny or scary) is flawed. The code attempts to categorize scenarios into `sa` (funny) and `sb` (scary) based on the counts of previously decided videos, but it does not ensure that the final arrangement meets the requirement of no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type for any permutation of scenarios.

2. **Handling Undecided Videos**: The logic for assigning types to undecided videos (`?`) is also problematic. The current implementation tries to assign types based on whether the scenario or the transition is in the top \( \frac{n}{4} \) list, which does not guarantee the required constraint.

3. **No Consideration of Permutations**: The solution does not consider the permutations of scenarios to ensure that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type appear for any permutation. This is a critical aspect of the problem.

To solve this problem correctly, a more sophisticated approach is needed, possibly involving graph theory or dynamic programming to ensure the constraints are met for all permutations. The current implementation does not meet these requirements and thus is incorrect.
