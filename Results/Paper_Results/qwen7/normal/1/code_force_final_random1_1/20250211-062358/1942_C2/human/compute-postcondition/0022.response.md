Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `a`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `tt` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\).
   - `ii` is 1.
   - `n` is the first integer input.
   - `x` is the second integer input.
   - `y` is the second integer input minus \((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1\).
   - `a` is a list of three integers sorted in ascending order.
   - `ans` is \(x + y - 2 + (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2\).
   - `tmp` is a list containing the value \((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2\).
   - `i` is 1.
   - `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is even.

3. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop iterates over `range(1, len(a))`.
   - Therefore, the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(a)`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 2.
   - Since `a` is a list of three integers, `len(a)` is 3.
   - Therefore, the loop will continue if `i` is less than 3.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented from 1 to 2.
   - `a[i] - a[i - 1]` remains even (since it was true for `i = 1`, and the values in `a` are fixed).

So, the updated states at the start of the next iteration are:

- `tt` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\).
- `ii` is 2.
- `n` is the first integer input.
- `x` is the second integer input.
- `y` is the second integer input minus \((a[2] - a[1]) // 2 - 1\).
- `a` is a list of three integers sorted in ascending order.
- `ans` is \(x + y - 2 + (a[2] - a[1]) // 2\).
- `tmp` is a list containing the value \((a[2] - a[1]) // 2\).
- `i` is 2.
- `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is even.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`tt` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `ii` is 2, `n` is the first integer input, `x` is the second integer input, `y` is the second integer input minus ((`a[2]` - `a[1]`) // 2 - 1), `a` is a list of three integers sorted in ascending order, `ans` is `x + y - 2 + (a[2] - a[1]) // 2`, `tmp` is a list containing the value (`a[2]` - `a[1]) // 2`, `i` is 2, and `a[2] - a[1]` is even.**
