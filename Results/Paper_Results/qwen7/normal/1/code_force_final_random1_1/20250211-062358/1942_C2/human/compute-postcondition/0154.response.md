Postcondition: `i` is `len(a)` - 1; `ans` is the sum of all increments made during the loop plus `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`; `tmp` retains its original list of valid elements added during the loop based on the conditions and now includes the element \((a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2\); `y` is the final value after all decrements have been applied minus `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`.
