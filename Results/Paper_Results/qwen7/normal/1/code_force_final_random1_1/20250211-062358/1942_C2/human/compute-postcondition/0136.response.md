Output State: **`tmp` now contains an additional element which is `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`, `a` and `i` retain their previous values.**

This means that the list `tmp` has had one more element appended to it, which is the result of the expression `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`. The variables `a` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
