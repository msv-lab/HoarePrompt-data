Postcondition: **`tt` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `ii` is 3, `n` is the first integer input, `x` is the second integer input, `y` is the second integer input minus ((`a[2]` - `a[1]`) // 2 - 1) - ((`a[3]` - `a[2]`) // 2 - 1), `a` is a list of four integers sorted in ascending order, `ans` is `x + y - 2 + (a[3] - a[2]) // 2 + (a[2] - a[1]) // 2`, `tmp` is a list containing the value (`a[2]` - `a[1]) // 2 + 1, `i` is 4, and `a[3] - a[2]` is even.**

This postcondition describes the state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block. If the condition `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1` is true, then `i` becomes 3, `y` is adjusted by subtracting `((a[3] - a[2]) // 2 - 1)`, and `ans` is recalculated. If the condition is false, the else part does not change the variables, and they retain the values specified in the if part.
