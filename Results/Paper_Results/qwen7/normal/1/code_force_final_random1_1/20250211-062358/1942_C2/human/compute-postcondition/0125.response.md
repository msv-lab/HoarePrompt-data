Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable is `i`.
   - The list `a` is mentioned but not directly used in the loop head.
   - The variables `ans`, `tmp`, and `y` are mentioned but not directly used in the loop head.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop starts with `i = 1` and increments `i` by 1 each iteration.
   - The loop continues as long as `i < len(a)`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `ans` is increased by 1 if the difference between `a[1]` and `a[0]` is 2, otherwise it remains unchanged.
   - `tmp` is a list containing one element which is `(a[1] - a[0]) // 2`.
   - `y` is decreased by `(a[1] - a[0]) // 2 - 1` if the difference between `a[1]` and `a[0]` is not 2.

4. **Adjusting the States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1, the next value of `i` will be `2`.
   - The condition for the next iteration is `i < len(a)`, so `i` must be less than the length of the list `a`.

5. **Update the States:**
   - `i` will be updated to `2`.
   - The other variables (`a`, `ans`, `tmp`, and `y`) remain unchanged because they are not directly modified within the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 2, `a` is a list of integers, `ans` is increased by 1 if the difference between `a[1]` and `a[0]` is 2, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged, `tmp` is a list containing one element which is `(a[1] - a[0]) // 2`, and `y` is decreased by `(a[1] - a[0]) // 2 - 1` if the difference between `a[1]` and `a[0]` is not 2**.
