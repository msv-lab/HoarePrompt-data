Postcondition: **`tt` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `ii` is 3, `n` is the first integer input, `x` is the second integer input, `y` is the second integer input minus ((`a[2]` - `a[1]`) // 2 - 1) - ((`a[3]` - `a[2]`) // 2 - 1) - ((`a[i]` - `a[i - 1]`) // 2 - 1), `a` is a list of four integers sorted in ascending order, `ans` is `x + y - 2 + (a[3] - a[2]) // 2 + (a[2] - a[1]) // 2 + (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`, `tmp` is a list containing the values (`a[2]` - `a[1]) // 2 + 1 and (`a[3] - a[2]`) // 2, `i` is 5, and `a[3] - a[2]` is even.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of all variables after the execution of the if-else block. If the condition `a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2` is true, `y` is adjusted by subtracting `((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1)`, and `ans` is updated accordingly. Otherwise, `y` is adjusted by subtracting `((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1)`, and `ans` is updated to include `((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2)`. The other variables retain their original values as specified in the precondition.
