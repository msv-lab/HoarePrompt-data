Postcondition: `i` is `x`, `x` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to its initial value, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n` if `i` equals `x - 1` else `a[i + 1]`, `gap` is `next_elem - a[i] - 1`, and `even` is a list containing one element which is `gap` if `gap > 0` and `gap` is even. Otherwise, `even` remains unchanged.
