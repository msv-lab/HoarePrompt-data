Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the following variables: `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `len(a)` (exclusive).

3. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: According to the given state before the loop, `i` is initially set to `len(a)`.

4. **Determine the required state of `i` for the loop to start**: For the loop to start, `i` should be in the range `[1, len(a))`. Since the loop starts with `i = 1`, `i` must be exactly 1 for the loop to begin.

5. **Determine the required state of `n`**: In this case, `n` is not used directly in the loop condition but could be a variable that influences the loop's behavior or is used elsewhere in the loop body. However, since no specific action involving `n` is mentioned in the loop head, we do not need to adjust `n` for the loop to start.

6. **Adjust the other variables**: The other variables (`ii`, `ans`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `tmp`) are not involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start.

Based on the above steps, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` must be 1.
- `n` is not needed to be adjusted as it is not part of the loop condition.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is 1**.
