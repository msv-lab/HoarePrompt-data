Output State: **`even` is a sorted list of all even gaps greater than 0 but has one less element than before, `y` is now `y - gap // 2`, `ans` is updated by adding `gap` to its previous value.**

Explanation: The variable `y` is decreased by `gap // 2`. The value of `even` and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states. The new value of `y` is expressed as `y - gap // 2`.
