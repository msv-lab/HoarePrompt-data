Postcondition: `x` must be greater than 0. If `t1` is not in set `st` and `t2` is in set `st`, then `ans` is increased by 1, `t1` remains as `(a[i] + 1) % n`, and `t2` remains as `(a[i] + 2) % n`. If the condition `t1 not in st and t2 in st` is not met, the values of `ans`, `t1`, and `t2` remain unchanged.
