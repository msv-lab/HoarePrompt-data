Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers, where the difference between the i-th element and the (i-1)-th element is not equal to 2, and all other elements in the list retain their original values. The difference between the i-th element and the (i-1)-th element is even, and the current value of `y` is greater than the difference between the i-th element and the (i-1)-th element divided by 2 minus 1.**
