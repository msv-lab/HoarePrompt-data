Postcondition: `tt` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `ii` is 1, `n` is the first integer input, `x` is the second integer input, `y` is the second integer input minus ((`a[i]` - `a[i - 1]`) // 2 - 1), `a` is a list of three integers sorted in ascending order, `ans` is `x + y - 2 + (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`, `tmp` is a list containing the value (`a[i]` - `a[i - 1]) // 2`, `i` is 1, and `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is even, provided that the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is 2. If the difference is not 2, then `tt` remains within the specified range, `ii` is 1, `n` is the first integer input, `x` is the second integer input, `y` is the second integer input minus ((`a[i]` - `a[i - 1]`) // 2 - 1), `a` is a list of three integers sorted in ascending order, `ans` is `x + y - 2 + (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`, `tmp` is a list containing the value (`a[i]` - `a[i - 1]) // 2`, `i` is 1, and `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is even, and the current value of `y` is greater than (`a[i] - a[i - 1]`) / 2 - 1.
