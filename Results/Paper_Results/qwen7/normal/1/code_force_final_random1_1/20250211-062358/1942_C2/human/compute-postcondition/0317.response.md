Postcondition: `even` is a sorted list of all even gaps greater than 0 encountered during the loop's execution, `odd` must have at least one element, `gap` is the first element from the `odd` list, `ans` is increased by 2 times the value of `y`, and `y` is 0. If `y < gap // 2`, then `y` remains unchanged; otherwise, the condition `y < gap // 2` does not hold.
