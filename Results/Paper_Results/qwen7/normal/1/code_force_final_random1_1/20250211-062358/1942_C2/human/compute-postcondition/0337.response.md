Postcondition: `even` is a sorted list of all even gaps greater than 0 and must be non-empty, `y` is 0, `ans` is 0, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if `y < gap // 2`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `y`, `ans`, and the program continues without breaking the loop.
