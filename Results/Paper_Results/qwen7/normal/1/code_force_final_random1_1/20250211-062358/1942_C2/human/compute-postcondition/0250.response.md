Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `x`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < x`. Therefore, the loop can continue if `i < x`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `x` must be greater than 0.
   - The loop body is omitted, but based on the postcondition, we know that if the condition `t1 not in st and t2 in st` is met, `ans` is incremented, and `t1` and `t2` are updated.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop can continue if `i < x`, we need to increment `i` by 1.
   - `x` remains the same unless the loop body changes it, but since no such change is mentioned, `x` stays the same.
   - `ans`, `t1`, and `t2` remain unchanged unless the condition `t1 not in st and t2 in st` is met, but since the loop body is omitted, these values stay as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the only variable that needs to be adjusted is `i`, which should be incremented by 1.

**State: **`x` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `ans`, `t1`, and `t2` remain unchanged**.
