Output State: **`i` is `x`, `x` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to its initial value, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n` if `i` equals `x - 1` else `a[i + 1]`**, `gap` is `next_elem - a[x - 1] - 1`.

This means that the value of `i` remains unchanged as `x`. The value of `x` stays within its initial range (greater than 0 and less than or equal to its initial value). The value of `next_elem` changes based on the condition: if `i` equals `x - 1`, then `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`; otherwise, `next_elem` is `a[i + 1]`. The value of `gap` is recalculated based on the new value of `next_elem` and the previous value of `a[x - 1]`.
