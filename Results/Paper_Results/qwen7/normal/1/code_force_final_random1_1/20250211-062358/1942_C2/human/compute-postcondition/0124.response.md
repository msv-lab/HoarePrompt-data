Postcondition: `i` is 1, `a` is a list of integers, `ans` is increased by 1 if the difference between `a[1]` and `a[0]` is 2, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged, `tmp` is a list containing one element which is `(a[1] - a[0]) // 2`, and `y` is decreased by `(a[1] - a[0]) // 2 - 1` if the difference between `a[1]` and `a[0]` is not 2.
