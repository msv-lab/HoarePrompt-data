Output State: **`x` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `t1` is `(a[1] + 1) % n`, `ans`, and `t2` remain unchanged**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `t1` to `(a[i] + 1) % n`. Given that `i` is 1, `t1` becomes `(a[1] + 1) % n`. The other variables (`x`, `i`, `ans`, and `t2`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
