Output State: **`i` is `k + 1`, `ans` is an integer, `tmp` is a list with an additional element `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` to the list `tmp`. Since `i` is `k + 1`, `a[i]` refers to `a[k + 1]` and `a[i - 1]` refers to `a[k]`. Therefore, the new element added to `tmp` is `(a[k + 1] - a[k]) // 2`. The values of `i`, `ans`, and `tmp` are updated accordingly, while the rest of the initial conditions remain unchanged.
