Output State: **`i` is the third element in `val`, `c` is `i // 2`, `y` is decreased by `i // 2`, `sx` is the new value of `i` plus the previous value of `sx`.**

Explanation: The code `c = i // 2` assigns the value of `i // 2` to `c`. The other variables (`i`, `y`, `sx`) remain unchanged from their previous states. Therefore, the updated state includes the assignment of `i // 2` to `c`.
