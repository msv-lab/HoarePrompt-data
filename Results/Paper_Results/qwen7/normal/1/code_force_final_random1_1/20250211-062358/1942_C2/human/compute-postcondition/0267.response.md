Output State: **`i` is `x - 1`, `x` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to its initial value, `next_elem` is `a[i + 1]`, `gap` is `next_elem - a[i] - 1`**

Explanation: The code calculates the value of `gap` as `next_elem - a[i] - 1`. Since `next_elem` is defined as `a[i + 1]` when `i` does not equal `x - 1`, and given that `i` is `x - 1`, `next_elem` would be `a[x]`. Therefore, `gap` is calculated as `a[x] - a[i] - 1`, which simplifies to `a[x] - a[x - 1] - 1`. However, since the exact values of `a[x]` and `a[x - 1]` are not provided, we keep the expression as `next_elem - a[i] - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
