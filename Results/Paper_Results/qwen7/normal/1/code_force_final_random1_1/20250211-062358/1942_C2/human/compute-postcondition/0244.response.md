Output State: **`x` must be greater than 0; `t1` is `(a[i] + 1) % n`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `(a[i] + 1) % n` to the variable `t1`. The initial state of `x` being greater than 0 is unaffected by this operation. The value of `t1` depends on the values of `a[i]`, `1`, and `n`, but since these values are not specified, `t1` is expressed as `(a[i] + 1) % n`.
