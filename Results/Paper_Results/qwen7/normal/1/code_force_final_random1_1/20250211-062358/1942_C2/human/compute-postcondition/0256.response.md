Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the condition `range(x)`. Therefore, the only variables that can be adjusted are `i` and `x`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `x` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `t1` is `(a[1] + 1) % n`.
   - `t2` is `(a[1] + 2) % n`.
   - The postcondition for the loop is that if `t1` is not in set `st` and `t2` is in set `st`, then `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2. For the next iteration, `i` will be 3.
   - The value of `x` does not change within the loop itself unless explicitly modified, so `x` remains the same as it was at the start of the current iteration.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated value of `i` while keeping `x` unchanged.

**State: **`x` is greater than 0, `i` is 3, `t1` is `(a[1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[1] + 2) % n`**.
