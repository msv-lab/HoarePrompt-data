Postcondition: `i` is `k + 1`, `ans` is an integer, `tmp` is a list. If `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) == 2`, then `ans` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0` and `y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, then `ans` is updated to `ans + (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1`, `tmp` has an additional element `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` appended to it, and `y` is reduced by `((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1)`. If none of these conditions are met, the values of `ans` and `y` remain unchanged, and `tmp` remains the same list.
