Output State: **`cons` is `min(n - 2, x + sx - 2)`, `i` is the last element in `val`, `c` is `i // 2`, `y` is decreased by the sum of all `c` values, `sx` is the sum of all `i` values plus the initial value of `sx`, and `val` and `l` remain sorted as per the given conditions.**

Explanation: The variable `cons` is updated to be the minimum of `n - 2` and its current value (`x + sx - 2`). The other variables (`i`, `c`, `y`, `sx`, `val`, and `l`) remain unchanged and retain their previous states.
