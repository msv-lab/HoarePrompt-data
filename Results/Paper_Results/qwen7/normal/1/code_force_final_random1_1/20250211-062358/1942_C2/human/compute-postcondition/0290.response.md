Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the constant `x`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i < x`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is `x`.
   - `x` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to its initial value.
   - `next_elem` is `a[0] + n` if `i` equals `x - 1` else `a[i + 1]`.
   - `gap` is `next_elem - a[i] - 1`.
   - `odd` is a list containing one element which is `gap` if `gap > 1` and `gap` is odd. Otherwise, `even` is a list containing one element which is `gap` if `gap > 0` and `gap` is even. If `gap` does not meet these conditions, `even` remains unchanged.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently `x`, it cannot increment further because `i` must be less than `x` for the loop to continue.
   - Therefore, `i` will remain `x` in the next iteration.
   - `x` remains unchanged as it is a constant.
   - `next_elem`, `gap`, `odd`, and `even` will remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop body and depend on the current values of `i` and other variables, which do not change in this context.

5. **Final State**:
   - `i` remains `x`.
   - `x` remains greater than 0 and less than or equal to its initial value.
   - `next_elem`, `gap`, `odd`, and `even` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is `x`, `x` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to its initial value, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n` if `i` equals `x - 1` else `a[i + 1]`, `gap` is `next_elem - a[i] - 1`, `odd` is a list containing one element which is `gap` if `gap > 1` and `gap` is odd. Otherwise, `even` is a list containing one element which is `gap` if `gap > 0` and `gap` is even. If `gap` does not meet these conditions, `even` remains unchanged.**
