Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `s` is the sum of elements in `a`, `m` is the maximum element in `a`, `ops` is the number of operations performed during the computation of `s` and `m`.**

Explanation: The code `s, m, ops = func_2(a)` calls a function `func_2` with the list `a` as an argument. This function computes the sum (`s`) of all elements in the list `a`, the maximum element (`m`) in the list `a`, and the number of operations (`ops`) performed during these computations. Since the exact implementation of `func_2` is not provided, we assume it performs these calculations. The initial state of `n` and `a` remains unchanged, but new variables `s`, `m`, and `ops` are introduced with their respective values.
