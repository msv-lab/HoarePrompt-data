You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nene gave you an array of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of length n .

You can perform the following operation no more than 5\cdot 10^5 times
(possibly zero):

  * Choose two integers l and r such that 1 \le l \le r \le n , compute x as \operatorname{MEX}(\\{a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r\\}) , and simultaneously set a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, \ldots, a_r:=x . 

Here, \operatorname{MEX} of a set of integers \\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k\\} is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer m which does not occur in the set
c .

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a . Find the
maximum sum and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.
Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations in this
sequence, you only should use no more than 5\cdot 10^5 operations in your
solution.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 18 ) — the length of the
array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n (0\leq a_i \leq 10^7 )
— the array a .

Output

In the first line, output two integers s and m (0\le m\le 5\cdot 10^5 ) — the
maximum sum of elements of the array a and the number of operations in your
solution.

In the i -th of the following m lines, output two integers l and r (1 \le l
\le r \le n ), representing the parameters of the i -th operation.

It can be shown that the maximum sum of elements of the array a can always be
obtained in no more than 5 \cdot 10^5 operations.

Note

In the first example, after the operation with l=1 and r=2 the array a becomes
equal to [2,2] . It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum
of the elements of a , so the answer is 4 .

In the second example, the initial sum of elements is 13 which can be shown to
be the largest.

In the third example, the array a changes as follows:

  * after the first operation (l=3 , r=3 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,0,1] ; 
  * after the second operation (l=3 , r=4 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,2,2] . 

It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum of the elements
of a , so the answer is 105 .

        #
        #Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be set to `r + 1` because the loop increments `i` from `l` to `r`. Since the loop condition `i <= r` is no longer satisfied when `i` becomes `r + 1`, the loop terminates. Therefore, none of the elements in the list `a` are modified beyond the index `r`, and the rest of the elements, including `a[r+1]`, remain unchanged at their initial values, which are `0` if they were not initialized otherwise.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a list `a` of non-negative integers and updates it based on the indices `l` and `r`. It appends operations to the list `ops` that describe the changes made. Specifically, if `a[l]` is not zero and within the range `[l, r]`, it sets `a[l]` to zero and records the operation. If `a[l]` is not equal to `r - l + 1`, it updates all elements from `l` to `r` to `r - l + 1` and records the operation. The function recursively processes the subarray defined by `l + 1` to `r`.

After processing, it returns the sum of all elements in the list `a`, the length of a list `ops` which is initialized to 0, and an empty list `ops`.

    #State: `s` is the sum of elements from index `l` to index `r` inclusive in list `a`. If `s` is less than or equal to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, then `i` will be `r + 1`, `l` and `r` remain unchanged, and all elements from index `l` to index `r` in list `a` will be set to the value `r - l + 1`. Otherwise, `s` is greater than `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`, `pos` is the position of `mx` in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]` plus `l`, and if `pos` is not equal to `r`, the function `recursive_maximize_sum(pos + 1, r)` has been called.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `recursive_maximize_sum` takes a list `a` and updates it to maximize the sum of any subarray defined by indices `l` and `r`. If the sum of the current subarray is less than or equal to the square of its length, it sets all elements within the subarray to the subarray's length. Otherwise, it finds the maximum element in the subarray and recursively processes the subarrays before and after this maximum element. The function does not return a value but modifies the input list `a` in place.

    for (l, r) in ops:
        print(l + 1, r + 1)
        
    #State: Output State: `ops` is a list that contains exactly the number of tuples equal to the number of iterations the loop has executed, which is the same as the initial value of `n`.
    #
    #Natural Language Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the `ops` list will contain exactly `n` tuples. Each tuple represents a pair of indices `(l, r)` that were printed during each iteration of the loop. Since the loop runs `n` times based on the initial state where `n` is the length of the list `a`, the `ops` list will have `n` elements, each being a tuple that was printed during the corresponding iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a list `a` of integers and prints the sum and maximum value of the list. It also generates and prints a series of index pairs `(l, r)` that represent operations performed on the list. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value; instead, it modifies and prints the output based on the input list `a`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Specifically, the function `func_2` and its helper functions do not ensure that the array is maximized to the full potential allowed by the operations. Here are a few issues:

1. **Incorrect Base Case Handling**: The function `func_1` does not handle the base case properly. When `l == r`, it should directly check if `a[l]` is 0 and update it if necessary. However, the current implementation sets `a[l]` to 0 and then calls itself recursively, which is unnecessary and incorrect.

2. **Incorrect Sum Calculation**: The function `recursive_maximize_sum` checks if the sum of the subarray is less than or equal to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`. This condition is too restrictive and does not always lead to the optimal solution. For example, consider an array `[1, 100, 2, 1]`. The function might not correctly identify that setting all elements to 100 would yield a higher sum.

3. **Incorrect Operation Application**: The function `recursive_maximize_sum` applies operations but does not always choose the optimal value to set the subarray to. It uses the maximum value in the subarray but does not consider the possibility of setting all elements to a smaller value that could still maximize the sum.

To illustrate, let's consider the following example:

**Input:**
```
4
1 100 2 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
105 2
3 3
3 4
```

However, the provided program might not produce this output because it does not correctly handle the operations to maximize the sum.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not guarantee the optimal solution for all inputs.
