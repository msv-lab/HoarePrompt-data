### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the provided program and the annotated code to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Function `func_1`:
- The function `func_1` is intended to set the elements in a subarray to the MEX value. However, it is not correctly implemented.
- The base case `if (l == r) :` is incorrect. If `a[l]` is not 0, it should set `a[l]` to 0 and append the operation to `ops`. But the function does not handle the MEX calculation properly.
- The recursive call `func_1(a, l + 1, r, ops)` is made without checking if the current element `a[l]` needs to be updated, which leads to incorrect behavior.

#### Function `func_2`:
- This function is intended to maximize the sum of the array `a` by calling `recursive_maximize_sum`.
- However, `func_2` does not pass the `ops` list to `recursive_maximize_sum`, which means the operations performed are not tracked.
- The function returns the sum of the array and the number of operations, but the logic to maximize the sum is flawed due to the incorrect implementation of `func_1` and `recursive_maximize_sum`.

#### Function `recursive_maximize_sum`:
- This function attempts to maximize the sum of the subarray from `l` to `r`.
- It checks if the current sum of the subarray is less than or equal to \((r - l + 1) \times (r - l + 1)\). If true, it calls `func_1` to set all elements to the MEX value.
- However, the MEX calculation is missing, and the function does not correctly handle the recursive calls to maximize the sum. The MEX value is not computed, and the recursive calls do not ensure the correct update of the subarray.

#### Function `func_3`:
- This function reads the input, calls `func_2`, and prints the result.
- The issue lies in the implementation of `func_2` and `recursive_maximize_sum`, which do not correctly maximize the sum of the array.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the provided functions do not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the array. The MEX calculation and the recursive approach are not correctly handled, leading to incorrect results.

### Correctness

**Correctness: False**
