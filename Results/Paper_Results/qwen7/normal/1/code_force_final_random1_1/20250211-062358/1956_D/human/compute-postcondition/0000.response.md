Output State: **`n` is an input integer, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. However, the initial state of `a` remains unchanged because no operation was performed on `a` in the given code snippet. The precondition that `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 18\) and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies \(0 \leq a_i \leq 10^7\) is still valid after the code has been executed.
