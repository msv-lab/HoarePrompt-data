Output State: `ops` is a list that contains exactly the number of tuples equal to the number of iterations the loop has executed, which is the same as the initial value of `n`.

Natural Language Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the `ops` list will contain exactly `n` tuples. Each tuple represents a pair of indices `(l, r)` that were printed during each iteration of the loop. Since the loop runs `n` times based on the initial state where `n` is the length of the list `a`, the `ops` list will have `n` elements, each being a tuple that was printed during the corresponding iteration.
