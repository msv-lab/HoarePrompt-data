Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Base Case Handling**: The `func_1` function is designed to set all elements in the range `[l, r]` to the MEX value of the subarray. However, the base case where `l == r` is handled incorrectly. If `a[l]` is already equal to the MEX value, there's no need to perform any operation. The current implementation sets `a[l]` to 0 if it's not already 0, which is not correct.

2. **Recursive Function Naming**: The function `recursive_maximize_sum` is called from `func_2`, but it is not defined within `func_2`. This indicates that `recursive_maximize_sum` should be defined inside `func_2` or passed as a parameter.

3. **Incorrect Logic in `func_2`**: The logic in `func_2` is flawed. It calls `recursive_maximize_sum` without defining or passing `ops`, which is used to store the operations. Also, the conditions for updating the subarray and calling the recursive function are not correctly implemented.

4. **Incorrect MEX Calculation**: The MEX value calculation is not explicitly defined or used correctly in the provided functions. The MEX of a subarray should be calculated before setting all elements in the subarray to this value.

5. **Output Format**: The output format requires the sum of the array and the number of operations, followed by the operations themselves. The current implementation does not correctly format the output as required.

To fix these issues, the solution needs to correctly calculate the MEX of a subarray, handle the base cases properly, and ensure that the recursive function is correctly defined and used.
