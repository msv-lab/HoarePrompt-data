Reasoning:
1. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: This function updates the subarray from `l` to `r` to the MEX (Minimum Excludant) of the subarray. The MEX of a set of integers is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set. This function ensures that all elements in the specified subarray are set to the MEX value.
   - **func_2**: This function calls `recursive_maximize_sum` to maximize the sum of the array using the operations defined in `func_1`. It returns the maximum sum, the number of operations, and the list of operations.
   - **recursive_maximize_sum**: This function recursively maximizes the sum of the subarray from `l` to `r`. If the current sum of the subarray is less than or equal to the theoretical maximum possible sum (`(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`), it sets all elements in the subarray to the MEX value. Otherwise, it splits the subarray into two parts and recursively processes them.
   - **func_3**: This function reads the input, calls `func_2` to get the result, and prints the maximum sum and the operations performed.

2. **Program Flow**:
   - The program correctly initializes the necessary variables and calls the main function `func_3`.
   - `func_3` reads the input, processes it using `func_2`, and prints the results.
   - The logic in `func_2` and `recursive_maximize_sum` is sound and correctly implements the algorithm to maximize the sum of the array.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases like single-element arrays and arrays with all elements already set to the optimal value.
   - The recursive approach ensures that all subarrays are processed correctly, and the operations are recorded accurately.

4. **Correctness**:
   - The program follows the problem specification and correctly implements the algorithm to maximize the sum of the array using the allowed operations.
   - The logic in `func_1` and `recursive_maximize_sum` ensures that the operations are applied optimally to achieve the maximum sum.

The given program is correct based on the problem description and the provided execution states.
