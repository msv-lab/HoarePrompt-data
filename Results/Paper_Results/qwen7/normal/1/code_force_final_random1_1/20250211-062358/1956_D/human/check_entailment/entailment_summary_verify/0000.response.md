### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the solution for the given problem.

#### Function `func_1`:
This function is intended to set all elements in the subarray from `l` to `r` to a specific value `x` if they are not already set to `x`. However, the current implementation has a flaw where it unnecessarily calls itself recursively even when `l == r` and `a[l]` is not 0. This is incorrect because when `l == r`, we should directly check if `a[l]` is 0 and set it to 0 if necessary. 

#### Function `func_2`:
This function is the main driver function that calls `func_1` and returns the sum of the array and the number of operations performed. However, the logic within `func_2` is flawed due to the issues in `func_1`.

#### Function `recursive_maximize_sum`:
This function attempts to maximize the sum of the subarray by checking if the sum of the subarray is less than or equal to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`. If this condition holds, it calls `func_1` to set all elements in the subarray to `r - l + 1`. This condition is too restrictive and does not always lead to the optimal solution. For example, consider the array `[1, 100, 2, 1]`. The function might not correctly identify that setting all elements to 100 would yield a higher sum.

#### Function `func_3`:
This function reads the input, calls `func_2`, and prints the results. However, the logic within `func_2` is flawed, leading to incorrect results.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Base Case Handling**:
   - In `func_1`, when `l == r`, the function should directly check if `a[l]` is 0 and set it to 0 if necessary. The current implementation is incorrect because it calls itself recursively, which is unnecessary.

2. **Sum Calculation**:
   - In `recursive_maximize_sum`, the condition `s <= (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)` is too restrictive. This condition does not always lead to the optimal solution. For example, consider the array `[1, 100, 2, 1]`. The function might not correctly identify that setting all elements to 100 would yield a higher sum.

3. **Operation Application**:
   - The function `recursive_maximize_sum` applies operations but does not always choose the optimal value to set the subarray to. It uses the maximum value in the subarray but does not consider the possibility of setting all elements to a smaller value that could still maximize the sum.

### Conclusion:

Based on the detailed analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. The issues identified include incorrect handling of the base case, overly restrictive sum conditions, and insufficient consideration of optimal values during operation application.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**

The program is incorrect as it does not guarantee the optimal solution for all inputs.
