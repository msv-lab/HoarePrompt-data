Output State: **`n` is an input integer, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 â‰¤ `a_i` â‰¤ 10^7, and the values of `a` are the integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input from the user and converts them into a list of integers. The length of this list is equal to the value of `n`. Each element in the list `a` is an integer between 0 and 10^7, inclusive, as specified in the initial state. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and the updated list `a` contains the integers entered by the user.
