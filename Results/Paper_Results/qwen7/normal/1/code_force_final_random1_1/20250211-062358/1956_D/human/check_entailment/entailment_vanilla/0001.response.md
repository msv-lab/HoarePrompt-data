Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have an array `a` of integers.
   - We can perform operations where we choose a subarray from `a[l]` to `a[r]` and set all elements in this subarray to the MEX (Minimum EXcluded) value of the subarray.
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the array `a` using at most \(5 \times 10^5\) operations.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function seems to be incorrectly named and its purpose is unclear from the provided code. It appears to be trying to set the elements in a subarray to a specific value but is not correctly implemented.
   - Specifically, the function `func_1` is supposed to recursively set elements to the MEX value, but it does not handle the MEX calculation properly and has a logical error in its base case.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function is intended to maximize the sum of the array `a`.
   - It calls `recursive_maximize_sum` but does not pass the `ops` list, making it difficult to track the operations performed.
   - The function returns the sum of the array and the number of operations, but it does not seem to be correctly implementing the logic to maximize the sum.

4. **Function `recursive_maximize_sum`:**
   - This function attempts to maximize the sum of the subarray from `l` to `r`.
   - It checks if the current sum of the subarray is less than or equal to \((r - l + 1) \times (r - l + 1)\). If true, it calls `func_1` to set all elements to the MEX value.
   - However, the MEX calculation is missing, and the function does not correctly handle the recursive calls to maximize the sum.

5. **Function `func_3`:**
   - This function reads the input, calls `func_2`, and prints the result.
   - The issue lies in the implementation of `func_2` and `recursive_maximize_sum`, which do not correctly maximize the sum of the array.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the provided functions do not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the array. The MEX calculation and the recursive approach are not correctly handled, leading to incorrect results.

### Correctness

**Correctness: False**

The program does not correctly solve the problem as stated.
