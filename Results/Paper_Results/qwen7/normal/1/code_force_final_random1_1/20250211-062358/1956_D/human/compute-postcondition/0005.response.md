Based on the initial state, `ops` is a list that must contain at least one tuple. However, the specific tuple(s) within the list are not provided, so we cannot determine the exact values of `l` and `r` from the given information alone. 

Given the print statement `print(l + 1, r + 1)`, we know that `l` and `r` are components of a tuple in the `ops` list. Since the exact tuple is not specified, we can only say that `l` and `r` are the first and second elements of a tuple, respectively.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **(l + 1, r + 1)** (where `l` and `r` are the first and second elements of a tuple in the `ops` list)
