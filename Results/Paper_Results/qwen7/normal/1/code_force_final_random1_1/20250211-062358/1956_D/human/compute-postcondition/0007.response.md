Based on the initial state, `ops` is a list that must contain at least one tuple. However, the specific tuple(s) within `ops` are not provided, so we cannot determine the exact values of `l` and `r`. Therefore, we can only describe the values in terms of the tuple elements.

Given that `ops` contains at least one tuple, let's assume the tuple in `ops` is of the form `(l, r)`. When the `print(l + 1, r + 1)` statement is executed, it will print the values of `l + 1` and `r + 1`.

Output: **l + 1, r + 1 (where l and r are the elements of the tuple in the list `ops`)**
