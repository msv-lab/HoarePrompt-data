Based on the initial state provided, `ops` is a list that must contain at least one tuple. Each tuple in the list `ops` would have at least two elements, typically representing the left (`l`) and right (`r`) indices.

However, the specific values of `l` and `r` from the tuple are not explicitly stated. Since `ops` contains at least one tuple, let's assume the first tuple in `ops` for the sake of this example. Let's denote the first tuple in `ops` as `(l, r)`.

When the code `print(l + 1, r + 1)` is executed, it will print the values of `l` and `r` from the first tuple in `ops`, each incremented by 1.

Output: **2, 2 (assuming l and r are both 1 in the first tuple of ops)**

To be more precise without additional information about the actual values of `l` and `r` in the tuple, we can describe it as follows:

Output: **(l + 1), (r + 1) (where (l, r) is the first tuple in the list ops)**
