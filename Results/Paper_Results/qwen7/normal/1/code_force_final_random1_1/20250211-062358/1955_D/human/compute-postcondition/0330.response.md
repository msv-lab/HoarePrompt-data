Output State: All elements in `b_values` have been iterated over, so `cnt_b[i]` is 0 for every `i` in `b_values`. The variable `i` will be equal to `n - m - 1` after the loop finishes, `ans` will be incremented by 1 for each iteration where `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `cnt_b[a[i]]` and `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` will reflect the final decremented and incremented counts respectively based on the elements in `b_values`, and `curr` will be the final count of elements in `a` that are also present in `b_values` and have non-negative decremented counts.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes, `cnt_b` will have been reset to zero for all its entries corresponding to the elements in `b_values`, `i` will be the last index that was processed (one less than the number of elements in `b_values`), `ans` will have been incremented appropriately based on the condition involving `curr` and `k`, and `curr` will represent the net count of elements in `a` that are found in `b_values` with valid decremented counts.
