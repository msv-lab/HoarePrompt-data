Output State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 zeros with each `b[i]` (where \(0 \leq i < m\)) incremented by 1, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `i` is equal to `m`, `m` is the total number of iterations the loop has executed.

In this final state, the variable `i` will be equal to `m`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The `cnt_b` list will have been updated for every index corresponding to the elements in the list `b`, with each count incremented by 1 for the respective index. All other variables remain in their initial or pre-loop states as they were not affected by the loop.
