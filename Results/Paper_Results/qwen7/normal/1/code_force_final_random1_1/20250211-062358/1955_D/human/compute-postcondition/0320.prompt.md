Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ans` is equal to `ans` + 1, `a` is a list of integers, `b_values` is a set of integers, `curr` is equal to the count of elements in `a` that are also present in `b_values`, and `cnt_b` reflects the decremented counts of these elements as long as they remain non-negative. The condition `curr >= k` is true.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - m):
    if a[i] in b_values:
        cnt_b[a[i]] += 1
        if cnt_b[a[i]] > 0:
            curr -= 1
    if a[i + m] in b_values:
        cnt_b[a[i + m]] -= 1
        if cnt_b[a[i + m]] >= 0:
            curr += 1
    if curr >= k:
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is either 0 or 1, `n - m` must be at least 1, `a[i]` (or `a[i + m]` if the condition is true) is an element in the set `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is adjusted: if `a[i + m]` (or `a[i]`) is in `b_values` and was greater than 0, it is decremented by 1; otherwise, `curr` remains unchanged, and if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is either 1 or 2 depending on the previous value, `n - m` must be at least 1, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1, `curr` is incremented by 1, and `ans` is incremented by 1 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2 or 3; `n - m` must be at least 1; `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1; `curr` is incremented by 1; if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
