Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `i` is an index such that `i + 1` is within the range of `a`, `b_values` is a set of integers, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1, `curr` is incremented by 1, and `ans` is incremented by 1 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `curr += 1` increments the value of `curr` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
