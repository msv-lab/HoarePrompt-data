Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variable `i`, which is taken from the list `b_values`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be the next element in the list `b_values`.

3. **Adjust the States Based on the Loop Head**:
   - The variable `i` will be set to the next element in `b_values`.
   - The variable `cnt_b[i]` will be updated based on the loop body, but since we don't know the exact operations inside the loop body, we focus on the initial state before the loop body is executed.
   - The condition that `b_values` must have at least `n - m` elements remains unchanged as it is an external condition that doesn't change within the loop.

Given these points, let's adjust the states:

- `i` will be the next element in `b_values`.
- `cnt_b[i]` will be 0 initially (since it is reset at the start of each iteration).
- The condition that `b_values` must have at least `n - m` elements remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is the second element of `b_values`, `cnt_b[i]` is 0, `b_values` must have at least `n - m` elements**
