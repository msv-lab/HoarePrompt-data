Output State: **`i` is less than `m`, `m` is the total number of iterations the loop has executed, `i` is incremented by 1, `curr` is incremented by 1, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `curr += 1` increments the value of `curr` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `i` is still less than `m`, `m` remains the total number of iterations the loop has executed, `i` is incremented by 1, `curr` is incremented by 1, and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decremented by 1.
