Output State: **`i` is 0, `n - m` must be at least 1, `a[i + m]` is an element in the set `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `cnt_b[a[i + m]] -= 1` decrements the value of `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` by 1. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged from the initial state.
