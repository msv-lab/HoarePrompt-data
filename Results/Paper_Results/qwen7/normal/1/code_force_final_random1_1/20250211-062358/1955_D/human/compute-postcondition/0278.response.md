Output State: **`i` is 1, `n - m` must be at least 1, `a[i + m]` is an element in the set `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0.**

Explanation: The variable `curr` is updated by adding 1 to its current value. Since `curr` was not explicitly defined before, it is assumed to be another name for `i` in this context. Therefore, `i` is incremented by 1. The conditions involving `n - m`, `a[i + m]`, and `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` remain unchanged.
