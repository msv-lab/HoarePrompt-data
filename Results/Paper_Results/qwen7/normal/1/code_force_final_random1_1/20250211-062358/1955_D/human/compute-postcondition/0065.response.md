Postcondition: `a` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the range of `a`, `b_values` is a set of integers. If `a[i + m]` is present in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, then `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1 and `curr` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the values of `a`, `b_values`, `cnt_b`, and `curr` remain unchanged.
