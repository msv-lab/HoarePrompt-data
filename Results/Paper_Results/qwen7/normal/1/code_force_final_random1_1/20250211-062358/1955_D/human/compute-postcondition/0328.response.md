Output State: **`cnt_b[i]` is 0, `i` is the third element of `b_values`, `b_values` must have at least `n - m` elements**

Explanation: The code `cnt_b[i] = 0` sets the value of `cnt_b[i]` to 0. Since `i` was previously the third element of `b_values`, this value remains unchanged. The precondition that `b_values` must have at least `n - m` elements also remains valid. Therefore, the updated state includes `cnt_b[i]` being set to 0, while `i` and the condition on `b_values` remain as initially stated.
