Output State: **All values in `cnt_b` are 0.**

Natural Language Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `cnt_b[i]` for every `i` in `b_values` will be set to 0. This means that regardless of how many times the loop runs (from `0` to `n - m - 1`), it initializes each element in `cnt_b` to 0 at the beginning of each iteration cycle. Since the loop does not modify the values of `cnt_b` once they are initialized to 0, all entries in `cnt_b` remain 0 after the loop completes.
