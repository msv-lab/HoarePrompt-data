Postcondition: `i` is 2 or 3; `n - m` must be at least 1; `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1; `curr` is incremented by 1; `ans` is incremented by 1 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `a[i + m]` is in `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1, `curr` is incremented by 2, and `ans` is incremented by 1 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`.
