Output State: **`i` is 2 or 3; `n - m` must be at least 1; `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1; `curr` is incremented by 1; `ans` is incremented by 1 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than 0, `curr` and `ans` are further incremented by 1 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`.**

Explanation: The code decrements `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` by 1. The values of `i`, `n - m`, `cnt_b[a[i]]`, `curr`, and `ans` are updated based on their previous conditions. The specific values or expressions for these variables remain as per the initial postconditions, except for `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` which is now decremented by 1.
