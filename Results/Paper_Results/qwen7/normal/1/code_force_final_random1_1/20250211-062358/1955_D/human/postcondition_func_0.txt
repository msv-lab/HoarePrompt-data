The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers n, m, k, a (a list of n integers), and b (a list of m integers). For each test case, it counts how many times the condition (the number of elements in `a` that are also in `b` being at least `k`) is met within a sliding window of size `m` across `a`. It then prints the total count of such occurrences across all test cases. After processing, it resets the count arrays and values for the next test case.
