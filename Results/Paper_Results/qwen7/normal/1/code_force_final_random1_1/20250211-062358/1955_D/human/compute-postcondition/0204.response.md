Postcondition: `a[i]` is an element of array `a`, `b_values` retains its previous set of values, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1, `curr` is incremented by 1, `i` is now `i + 1`, and `n` must be greater than `i + m`. If `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is non-negative, then `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is further decremented by 1 and `curr` is incremented by 1. In all cases, `i` is incremented by 1 and `n` remains greater than `i + m`.
