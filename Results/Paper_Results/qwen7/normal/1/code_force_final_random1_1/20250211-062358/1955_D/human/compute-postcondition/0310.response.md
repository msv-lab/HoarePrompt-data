Postcondition: `i` is 2 or 3; `n - m` must be at least 1; `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1; `curr` is incremented by 1; `ans` is incremented by 1 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, `curr` and `ans` are further incremented by 1 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`.
