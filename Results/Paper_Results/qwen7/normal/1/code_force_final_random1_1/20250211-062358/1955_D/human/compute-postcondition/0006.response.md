Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable is `i`.
   - The loop runs for `m` iterations, where `m` is not explicitly defined in the given state but is a constant or a variable in the context of the loop.

2. **Determine the Initial State of the Variables:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `max_val` is 1000000.
   - `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 zeros.
   - `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split.

3. **Analyze the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `m` iterations, where `i` ranges from 0 to `m-1`.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since the loop runs for `m` iterations, `i` must be initialized to 0 and incremented within the loop.
   - The value of `m` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be initialized to 0.
- `m` must be at least 1.

The other variables (`t`, `max_val`, `cnt_b`, and `b`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the final state is:
**`i` is 0, `m` must be at least 1**.
