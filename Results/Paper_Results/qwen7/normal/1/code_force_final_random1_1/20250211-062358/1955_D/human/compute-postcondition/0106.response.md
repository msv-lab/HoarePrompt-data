Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in b_values:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `b_values`.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `cnt_b[i]` is 0.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are values left in `b_values` for `i` to iterate over.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `b_values`, the variable `i` will take the next value from `b_values`.
   - The variable `cnt_b[i]` will be updated based on the loop body, but since the loop body is omitted, we cannot determine the exact value change. However, we know that `cnt_b[i]` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, and it will be updated in the next iteration.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` will be the next value from `b_values`.
   - `cnt_b[i]` will be updated, but we don't know the exact value yet. It could be any value depending on the loop body, but we know it will be different from 0.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the fact that `i` will be the next value from `b_values` and `cnt_b[i]` will be updated.

**State: **`cnt_b[i]` is updated (but not known precisely), `i` is the next value from `b_values`**
