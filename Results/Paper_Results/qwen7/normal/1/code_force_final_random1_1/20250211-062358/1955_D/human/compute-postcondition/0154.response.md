Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Initial States:
- `ans` is 1
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces
- `n`, `m`, and `k` retain their original input values
- `b` is a list of integers obtained from the new input split by spaces
- `m` must be greater than 0
- `cnt_b` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `b` and its corresponding value is the count of that element in `b` plus 1 for each element in the range from `m-1` to `m-1 + (m - 1)`
- `i` is equal to `m`
- `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`
- `curr` is incremented by 1 for each element in `a` that is found in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is non-negative
- `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decremented by 1 if `a[i]` is found in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is non-negative
- `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`

### Loop Head:
The loop head is:
```python
for i in range(n - m):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Variables in the Loop Head:
- `i` ranges from `0` to `n - m - 1`.

### Adjustments Needed:
1. **Variable `i`:**
   - The loop starts with `i = 0` and increments `i` until `i < n - m`.
   - Therefore, `i` must be in the range `[0, n - m - 1]`.

2. **Other Variables:**
   - The other variables (`ans`, `a`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `b`, `cnt_b`, `b_values`, `curr`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Final State Adjustment:
Given the above analysis, the only variable that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `i`. Specifically, `i` must be within the range `[0, n - m - 1]`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is in the range [0, n - m - 1]**
