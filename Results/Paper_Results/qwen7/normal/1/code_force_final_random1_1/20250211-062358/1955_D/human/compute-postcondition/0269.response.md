Output State: **`i` is 0, `n - m` must be at least 1, `a[i]` is an element in the set `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1, and the current value of `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0; `curr` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `curr` is decremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
