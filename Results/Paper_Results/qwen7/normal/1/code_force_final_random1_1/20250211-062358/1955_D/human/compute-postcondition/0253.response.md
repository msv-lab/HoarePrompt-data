Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `b_values` is a list of integers, `curr` is incremented by 1, `i` is `k + 2`, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decremented by 1.**

The code `curr += 1` increments the value of `curr` by 1. The other variables (`a`, `b_values`, `i`, and `cnt_b[a[i]]`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
