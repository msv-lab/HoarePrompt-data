Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `n`, `m`, and `k` retain their original input values, and all values in `cnt_b` are 0.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a single line of input from the user, splits it into individual elements based on spaces, and converts each element to an integer. These integers are then stored in the list `a`. The initial values of `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged, and all values in `cnt_b` remain 0.
