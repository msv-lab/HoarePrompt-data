Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, max_val is 1000000, cnt_b is a list of 1000001 zeros**.

Explanation: The code initializes a list `cnt_b` with 1000001 elements, all set to 0. This list is created with a size of `max_val + 1`, where `max_val` is 1000000. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was part of the initial state and was not affected by the code.
