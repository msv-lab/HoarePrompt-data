Output State: After all iterations of the loop, `b_values` must contain at least one element, `i` will be equal to `n - m`, `cnt_b[i]` will be 0 for all `i` in `b_values`.

Explanation: The loop iterates over each element in `b_values`, setting `cnt_b[i]` to 0 for each `i` in `b_values`. Since the loop continues as long as there are elements left in `b_values`, and it processes each element exactly once, after all iterations, `cnt_b[i]` will be 0 for every `i` in `b_values`. Additionally, since the loop increments `i` with each iteration and stops when `i` reaches `n - m`, `i` will be equal to `n - m` after all iterations have completed. The other variables (`a`, `curr`, `ans`) are not modified by the loop and thus retain their initial or previous states.
