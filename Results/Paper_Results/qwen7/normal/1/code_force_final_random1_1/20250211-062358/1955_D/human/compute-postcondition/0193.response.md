Postcondition: `a[i]` is an element of array `a`, and `b_values` is a set of values. If `a[i + m]` is found in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than 0, then `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1 and `curr` is increased by 1, and `ans` is incremented by 1 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`. Otherwise, the values of `cnt_b[a[i + m]]`, `curr`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
