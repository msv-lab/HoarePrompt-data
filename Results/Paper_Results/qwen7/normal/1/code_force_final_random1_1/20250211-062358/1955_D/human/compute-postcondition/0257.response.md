Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be `m - 1`, `curr` will be the total count of elements in `a` that are also present in `b_values`. The variable `cnt_b` will have been updated such that for each element `x` in `b_values`, `cnt_b[x]` will be decremented by the number of times `x` appears in `a` and is also in `b_values`.

In simpler terms, `curr` will hold the count of common elements between lists `a` and `b_values`, and `cnt_b` will reflect how many times each common element has been counted.
