Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `b_values`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop iterates over each element in `b_values`.
   - The loop continues as long as there are elements left in `b_values`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `cnt_b[i]` is 0 (this is not directly relevant to the loop continuation).
   - `i` is the second element of `b_values`.
   - `b_values` must have at least `n - m` elements.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is the second element of `b_values`, the next element in `b_values` will be accessed in the next iteration.
   - Therefore, `i` will now be the third element of `b_values`.
   - For the loop to continue, `b_values` must still have at least `n - m` elements.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `cnt_b[i]` is 0, `i` is the third element of `b_values`, `b_values` must have at least `n - m` elements**
