Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the constants `m`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `m`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `b_values` must contain at least one element.
   - `i` is `n - m`.
   - `n - m` must be less than `m`.
   - `cnt_b[b[i]]` is incremented by 1.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from `n - m` and the loop continues as long as `i < m`, the next value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - Therefore, `i` will become `(n - m) + 1`.
   - To ensure the loop can execute again, `(n - m) + 1` must still be less than `m`.

5. **Update the States**:
   - `b_values` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `i` changes to `(n - m) + 1`.
   - The condition `n - m` must be less than `m` must still hold true for the next iteration, but since `i` is incremented, this condition will no longer be relevant as `i` will now be `(n - m) + 1`.

6. **Final State**:
   - `b_values` must contain at least one element (unchanged).
   - `i` is updated to `(n - m) + 1`.
   - The condition `n - m` must be less than `m` is no longer relevant for the next iteration.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`b_values` must contain at least one element, `i` is `(n - m) + 1`**
