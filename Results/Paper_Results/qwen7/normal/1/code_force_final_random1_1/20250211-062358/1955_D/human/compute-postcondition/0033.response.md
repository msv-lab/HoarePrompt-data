Postcondition: `i` is less than `m`, `m` is the total number of iterations the loop has executed, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decreased by 1, and `curr` is increased by 1 if `cnt_b[a[i]]` is non-negative. Otherwise, `i` is still less than `m`, `m` is the total number of iterations the loop has executed, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decreased by 1, and `curr` remains unchanged.
