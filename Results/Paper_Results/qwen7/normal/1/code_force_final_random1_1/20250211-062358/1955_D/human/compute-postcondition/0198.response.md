Postcondition: **`a[i]` is an element of array `a` with its count in `cnt_b` incremented by 1, `b_values` retains its previous set of values, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` retains its previous value, `curr` is decremented by 1, `i` is now `i + 1`, and `n` must be greater than `i + m`.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block. If the condition `cnt_b[a[i]] > 0` is true, then `curr` is decremented by 1. Regardless of whether the condition is true or false, `a[i]` is an element of array `a` with its count in `cnt_b` incremented by 1, `b_values` retains its previous set of values, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` retains its previous value, and `i` is now `i + 1`. The condition that `n` must be greater than `i + m` is maintained.
