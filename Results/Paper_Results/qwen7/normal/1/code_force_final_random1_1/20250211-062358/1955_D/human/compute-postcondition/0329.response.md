Output State: All elements in `b_values` have been iterated over, so `cnt_b[i]` is 0 for every `i` in `b_values`. The variable `i` will be equal to `n - m - 1` (since it starts from the first element and increments by 1 with each iteration until it reaches `n - m - 1`). The variable `ans` will be incremented by 1 for each iteration where `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`. The variable `cnt_b[a[i]]` will reflect the final decremented counts for elements in `a` that are also present in `b_values`, and `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` will reflect the final incremented counts for those elements. The variable `curr` will be the final count of elements in `a` that are also present in `b_values` and have non-negative decremented counts.

This means that after all iterations, `cnt_b` will show how many times each element in `b_values` was decremented across all elements in `a`, and `curr` will represent the net count of elements that meet the criteria specified by `k`.
