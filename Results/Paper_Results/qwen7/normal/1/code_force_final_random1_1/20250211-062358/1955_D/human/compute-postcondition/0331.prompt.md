Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, max_val is 1000000, cnt_b is a list of 1000001 zeros
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(m):
        cnt_b[b[i]] += 1
    b_values = set(b)
    ans = 0
    curr = 0
    for i in range(m):
        if a[i] in b_values:
            cnt_b[a[i]] -= 1
            if cnt_b[a[i]] >= 0:
                curr += 1
    if curr >= k:
        ans += 1
    for i in range(n - m):
        if a[i] in b_values:
            cnt_b[a[i]] += 1
            if cnt_b[a[i]] > 0:
                curr -= 1
        if a[i + m] in b_values:
            cnt_b[a[i + m]] -= 1
            if cnt_b[a[i + m]] >= 0:
                curr += 1
        if curr >= k:
            ans += 1
    print(ans)
    for i in b_values:
        cnt_b[i] = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: All values in `cnt_b` are 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: After all iterations of the loop, `b_values` must contain at least one element, `i` will be equal to `n - m`, `cnt_b[i]` will be 0 for all `i` in `b_values`.

Explanation: The loop iterates over each element in `b_values`, setting `cnt_b[i]` to 0 for each `i` in `b_values`. Since the loop continues as long as there are elements left in `b_values`, and it processes each element exactly once, after all iterations, `cnt_b[i]` will be 0 for every `i` in `b_values`. Additionally, since the loop increments `i` with each iteration and stops when `i` reaches `n - m`, `i` will be equal to `n - m` after all iterations have completed. The other variables (`a`, `curr`, `ans`) are not modified by the loop and thus retain their initial or previous states.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: All elements in `b_values` have been iterated over, so `cnt_b[i]` is 0 for every `i` in `b_values`. The variable `i` will be equal to `n - m - 1` after the loop finishes, `ans` will be incremented by 1 for each iteration where `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, `cnt_b[a[i]]` and `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` will reflect the final decremented and incremented counts respectively based on the elements in `b_values`, and `curr` will be the final count of elements in `a` that are also present in `b_values` and have non-negative decremented counts.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes, `cnt_b` will have been reset to zero for all its entries corresponding to the elements in `b_values`, `i` will be the last index that was processed (one less than the number of elements in `b_values`), `ans` will have been incremented appropriately based on the condition involving `curr` and `k`, and `curr` will represent the net count of elements in `a` that are found in `b_values` with valid decremented counts.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
