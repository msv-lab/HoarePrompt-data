Output State: **`ans` is `ans` + 1, `i` equals `m`, `curr` is incremented by 1 each time `a[i]` is found in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is non-negative, and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decremented by 1 each time `a[i]` is processed. The current value of `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`.**

Explanation: The line `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. All other conditions and behaviors of the variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
