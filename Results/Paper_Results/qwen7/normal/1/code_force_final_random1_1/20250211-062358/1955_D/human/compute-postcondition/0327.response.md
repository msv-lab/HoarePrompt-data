Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case involves the variable `i` and the iterable `b_values`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `cnt_b[i]` is 0 (though this is not directly relevant to the loop execution).
   - `i` is the second element of `b_values`.
   - `b_values` must have at least `n - m` elements.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element in `b_values`. For the loop to continue executing, `i` must be an element of `b_values`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is the second element of `b_values`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must move to the next element in `b_values`.
   - Therefore, `i` will be the third element of `b_values`.
   - The condition that `b_values` must have at least `n - m` elements remains unchanged because it is a precondition for the loop to start and does not change within the loop itself.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `cnt_b[i]` is still 0 (as it was not modified in the loop body).
   - `i` will be the third element of `b_values`.
   - `b_values` must still have at least `n - m` elements.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`cnt_b[i]` is 0, `i` is the third element of `b_values`, `b_values` must have at least `n - m` elements**
