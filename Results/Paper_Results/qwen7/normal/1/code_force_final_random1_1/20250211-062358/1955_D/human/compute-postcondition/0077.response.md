Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the range of `a`, `b_values` is a set of integers, `cnt_b[a[i + 1]]` is decremented by 1, `curr` is incremented by 1, `ans` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `curr += 1` increments the value of `curr` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state. Specifically, `cnt_b[a[i + 1]]` is decremented by 1, which was already part of the initial state and is maintained here.
