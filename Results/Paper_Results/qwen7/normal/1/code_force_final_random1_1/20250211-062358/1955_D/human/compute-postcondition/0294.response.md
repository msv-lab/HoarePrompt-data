Postcondition: **`i` is either 1 or 2 depending on the previous value, `n - m` must be at least 1, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 if `a[i]` is in `b_values`. If `cnt_b[a[i]]` is greater than 0, `curr` is decremented by 1.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block. If `i` was 0 previously, it becomes 1; if `i` was 1 previously, it becomes 2. The value of `n - m` remains unchanged and must still be at least 1. Additionally, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 if `a[i]` is in `b_values`. If `cnt_b[a[i]]` was greater than 0, `curr` is decremented by 1.
