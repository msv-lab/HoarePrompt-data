Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `n`, `m`, and `k` retain their original input values, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the new input split by spaces, `m` must be greater than 0, `cnt_b` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `b` and its corresponding value is the count of that element in `b` plus 1 for the element at index `m-1`, `i` is `m`, `cnt_b[b[i]]` is incremented by 1.**

In this output state, the variable `cnt_b[b[i]]` (which is `cnt_b[b[m-1]]` since `i` is `m`) is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
