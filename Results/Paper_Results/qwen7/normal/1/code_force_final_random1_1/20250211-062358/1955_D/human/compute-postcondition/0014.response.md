Output State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 zeros with each `b[i]` for \(0 \leq i < m\) incremented by 1, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `i` is equal to `m`, `m` is the total number of iterations the loop executed.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `t` remains within the range of 1 to 10,000, `max_val` stays at 1,000,000, and `cnt_b` is a list where each index `b[i]` (for every `i` from 0 to `m-1`) has been incremented by 1. The variable `i` will be equal to `m`, indicating the last iteration of the loop, and `m` represents the total number of times the loop was executed.
