Output State: **`x` is an integer, a is a list of integers, and the value of `a[i]` is present in the list `b_values`; `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code decrements the count of the value `a[i]` in the dictionary `cnt_b`. Since `a[i]` is present in the list `b_values`, the count of `a[i]` in `cnt_b` is reduced by 1. The values of `x` and the list `a` remain unchanged.
