Postcondition: `ans` is 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `n`, `m`, and `k` retain their original input values, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the new input split by spaces, `m` must be greater than 0, `cnt_b` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `b` and its corresponding value is the count of that element in `b` plus 1 for each element in the range from `m-1` to `m-1 + (m - 1)`, `i` is equal to `m`, `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`, `curr` is incremented by 1 for each element in `a` that is found in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is non-negative, and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decremented by 1 if `a[i]` is found in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is non-negative, and `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`.

This postcondition describes the state of all relevant variables after the if-else block executes. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is set to 1, and the other variables maintain their specified properties. If `curr` is not greater than or equal to `k`, the postcondition remains as initially described in the if part.
