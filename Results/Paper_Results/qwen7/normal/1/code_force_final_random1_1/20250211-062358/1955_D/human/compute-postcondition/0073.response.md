Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the range of `a`, `b_values` is a set of integers, `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1, `curr` is decremented by 1, and `ans` remains unchanged.**

The value of `curr` is decremented by 1, while the other variables remain unchanged. The initial state of `a`, `i`, `b_values`, `cnt_b[a[i]]`, and `ans` is preserved.
