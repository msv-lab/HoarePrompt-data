Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ans` is 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `n`, `m`, and `k` retain their original input values, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the new input split by spaces, `m` must be greater than 0, `cnt_b` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `b` and its corresponding value is the count of that element in `b` plus 1 for each element in the range from `m-1` to `m-1 + (m - 1)`, `i` is equal to `m - 1 + (m - 1), `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`, `curr` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(m):
    if a[i] in b_values:
        cnt_b[a[i]] -= 1
        if cnt_b[a[i]] >= 0:
            curr += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `ans` is 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `n`, `m`, and `k` retain their original input values, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the new input split by spaces, `m` must be greater than 0, `cnt_b` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `b` and its corresponding value is the count of that element in `b` plus 1 for each element in the range from `m-1` to `m-1 + (m - 1)`, `i` is less than `m`, `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`, `curr` is 1 if `a[i]` is found in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is non-negative, and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decremented by 1 if `a[i]` is found in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is non-negative.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `ans` is 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `n`, `m`, and `k` retain their original input values, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the new input split by spaces, `m` must be greater than 0, `cnt_b` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `b` and its corresponding value is the count of that element in `b` plus 1 for each element in the range from `m-1` to `m-1 + (m - 1)`, `i` is less than `m`, `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`, `curr` is incremented by 1 if `a[i + 1]` is found in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i + 1]]` is non-negative, and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decremented by 1 if `a[i]` is found in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is non-negative.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `ans` is 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `n`, `m`, and `k` retain their original input values, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the new input split by spaces, `m` must be greater than 0, `cnt_b` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `b` and its corresponding value is the count of that element in `b` plus 1 for each element in the range from `m-1` to `m-1 + (m - 1)`, `i` is incremented by 1, `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`, `curr` is incremented by 1 if `a[i + 1]` is found in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i + 1]]` is non-negative, and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decremented by 1 if `a[i]` is found in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is non-negative.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
