Output State: All elements in `b_values` have been set to 0 in `cnt_b`.

Explanation: The loop iterates over each element in `b_values`, setting the corresponding value in `cnt_b` to 0. Since the loop continues to execute for as many times as there are unique elements in `b_values`, after all iterations, every element in `b_values` will have its corresponding count in `cnt_b` set to 0.
