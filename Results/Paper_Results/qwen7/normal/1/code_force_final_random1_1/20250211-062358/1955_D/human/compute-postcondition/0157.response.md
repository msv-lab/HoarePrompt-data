Output State: **Postcondition: `i` is in the range [0, n - m - 1], `a` is a list of integers, `b_values` is a set of integers, and the current value of `a[i]` is present in `b_values`; `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code increments the count of `a[i]` in the dictionary `cnt_b`. Since `a[i]` was originally present in `b_values`, it remains in `b_values`. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
