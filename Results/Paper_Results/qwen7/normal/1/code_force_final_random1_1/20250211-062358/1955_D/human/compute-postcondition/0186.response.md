Output State: **`cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1, `a[i]` is an element of array `a`, and `b_values` is a set of values.**

Explanation: The code `cnt_b[a[i + m]] -= 1` decrements the value of `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` by 1. The other variables and their conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, `a[i]` is still an element of array `a`, and `b_values` remains a set of values.
