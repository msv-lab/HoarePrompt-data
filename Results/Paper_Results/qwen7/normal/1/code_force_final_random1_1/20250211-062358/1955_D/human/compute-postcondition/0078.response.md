Postcondition: `a` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the range of `a`, `b_values` is a set of integers, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1, `curr` is incremented by 1, and `ans` remains unchanged. If `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is greater than or equal to 0, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is further decremented by 1 and `curr` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, no changes occur to `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` and `curr`.
