Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 zeros except for indices in `b` which are incremented by 1, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `i` is equal to `m`, `m` is the total number of iterations the loop has executed, `b_values` is a set containing unique values from the list `b`, `ans` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `ans` to 0. Since no other operations are performed on `ans` or any other variables, the values of `t`, `max_val`, `cnt_b`, `b`, `i`, `m`, and `b_values` remain unchanged from their initial states.
