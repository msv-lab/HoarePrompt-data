Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `m`.

2. **Understand the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < m`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, it is given that `i` is less than `m`.

3. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is less than `m`, the loop will execute again.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so if `i` was previously `i < m`, then after incrementing, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - `m` remains unchanged.

5. **Other states remain the same**:
   - `ans`, `a`, `n`, `b`, `cnt_b`, `b_values`, and `curr` do not change based on the loop head alone.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

**State: **`ans` is 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `n`, `m`, and `k` retain their original input values, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the new input split by spaces, `m` must be greater than 0, `cnt_b` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `b` and its corresponding value is the count of that element in `b` plus 1 for each element in the range from `m-1` to `m-1 + (m - 1)`, `i` is less than `m`, `b_values` is a set containing unique elements from `b`, `curr` is incremented by 1 if `a[i + 1]` is found in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i + 1]]` is non-negative, and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is decremented by 1 if `a[i]` is found in `b_values` and `cnt_b[a[i]]` is non-negative. Additionally, `i` is incremented by 1.**
