Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the range of `a`, `b_values` is a set of integers, and the current value of `a[i]` is present in `b_values`; `cnt_b[a[i]]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The line of code `cnt_b[a[i]] += 1` increments the count of the value `a[i]` in the dictionary `cnt_b`. Since `a[i]` is present in `b_values`, the count for `a[i]` in `cnt_b` is increased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
