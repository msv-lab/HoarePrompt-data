Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `b_values` must contain at least one element.
- `i` is an element of `b_values`.
- `cnt_b[i]` is 0.

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in b_values:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each element `i` in `b_values`.
2. **State Changes**: Inside the loop body (which is omitted), some operations might change the values of `b_values` or `cnt_b[i]`.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Initial Values**:
   - `b_values` contains at least one element.
   - `i` is one of the elements in `b_values`.
   - `cnt_b[i]` is currently 0.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `b_values` must still contain at least one element.
   - The value of `i` will change to the next element in `b_values`.
   - `cnt_b[i]` will be updated inside the loop body, but we don't know the exact update yet.

3. **State After One More Iteration**:
   - Since `b_values` must contain at least one element for the loop to continue, it remains unchanged from the previous iteration.
   - `i` will be set to the next element in `b_values`.
   - `cnt_b[i]` will be updated, but we don't know the exact new value yet.

### Conclusion:
Given the information, the only state that changes is `i`, which will be set to the next element in `b_values`. The condition for `b_values` to contain at least one element remains the same.

### Final State:
- `b_values` must contain at least one element.
- `i` will be the next element in `b_values`.
- `cnt_b[i]` will be updated inside the loop body, but its exact value is unknown.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`b_values` must contain at least one element, `i` is the next element in `b_values`, `cnt_b[i]` is unknown**
