Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the range function parameters `m`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` being set to `n - m`. Therefore, `i` should be initialized to `n - m` before the loop starts.

3. **Determine the Condition for the Loop to Execute**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `m`. For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be less than `m` initially.

4. **Adjust the State**:
   - `i` should be initialized to `n - m`.
   - To ensure the loop executes at least once, `n - m` should be less than `m`.

Given these points, let's formulate the required state adjustments:

- `b_values` must contain at least one element (this is already given).
- `i` should be initialized to `n - m`.
- For the loop to execute at least once, `n - m` must be less than `m`.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

**State: **`b_values` must contain at least one element, `i` is `n - m`, `n - m` must be less than `m`**.
