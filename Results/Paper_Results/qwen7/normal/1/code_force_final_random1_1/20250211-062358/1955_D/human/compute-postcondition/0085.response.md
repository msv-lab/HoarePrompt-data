Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `n - m`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `i` is an index within the range of `a`.
   - `b_values` is a set of integers.
   - `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1.
   - `curr` is incremented by 1.
   - `ans` is incremented by 1 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 at each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value, say `i_end`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be `i_end + 1`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `i < n - m`. Therefore, `i_end + 1 < n - m` must hold true for the loop to continue.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `i_end + 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.

Given the above reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`a` is a list of integers, `i` is an index such that `i + 1` is within the range of `a`, `b_values` is a set of integers, `cnt_b[a[i + m]]` is decremented by 1, `curr` is incremented by 1, and `ans` is incremented by 1 if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**
