Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `max_val` is 1000000, `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 zeros with the element at index `b[1]` incremented by 1, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `i` is 3, `m` is at least 1**.

Explanation: The code `cnt_b[b[i]] += 1` increments the count at the index `b[i]` in the list `cnt_b`. Initially, `i` is 2, so `b[2]` is incremented by 1. After the increment, `i` becomes 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
