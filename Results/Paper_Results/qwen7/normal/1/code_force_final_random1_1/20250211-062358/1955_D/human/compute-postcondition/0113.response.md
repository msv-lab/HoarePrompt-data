Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(m)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `m`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is not explicitly initialized in the given code snippet, but it will start from 0 in the first iteration of the loop.
   - `m` is an input value that determines the number of iterations the loop will perform.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `m`. Therefore, `m` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0, it doesn't need adjustment for the loop to start.
   - `m` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.

Given the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `m` (it must be greater than 0).

**Final Answer**:
State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `n`, `m`, and `k` retain their original input values, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the new input split by spaces, `m` must be greater than 0**
