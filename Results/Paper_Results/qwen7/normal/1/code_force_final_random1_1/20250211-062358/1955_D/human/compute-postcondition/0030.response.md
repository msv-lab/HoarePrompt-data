Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case involves the variable `i` and `m`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `m`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is less than `m`.
   - `m` is the total number of iterations the loop has executed.
   - If `a[i]` is present in the set `b_values`, then `curr` is equal to the previous value of `curr` plus 1; otherwise, `curr` remains unchanged.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 at each iteration, `i` will be incremented from its current value.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must still be less than `m`.

Given the conditions:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is less than `m`.
- After incrementing `i`, `i` will become `i + 1`.
- For the loop to execute again, `i + 1` must still be less than `m`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
- `i` becomes `i + 1`.
- `m` remains the same since it is the total number of iterations and does not change within the loop.

So, the new state is:
State: **`i` is less than `m`, `m` is the total number of iterations the loop has executed, and if the value `a[i+1]` is present in the set `b_values`, then `curr` is equal to the previous value of `curr` plus 1; otherwise, no change occurs to `curr`**.
