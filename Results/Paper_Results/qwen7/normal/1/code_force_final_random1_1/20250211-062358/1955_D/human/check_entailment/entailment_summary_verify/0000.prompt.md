You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Maxim has an array a of n integers and an array b of m integers (m \le n ).

Maxim considers an array c of length m to be good if the elements of array c
can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of
array b .

For example, if b = [1, 2, 3, 4] and k = 3 , then the arrays [4, 1, 2, 3] and
[2, 3, 4, 5] are good (they can be reordered as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4] and [5,
2, 3, 4] ), while the arrays [3, 4, 5, 6] and [3, 4, 3, 4] are not good.

Maxim wants to choose every subsegment of array a of length m as the elements
of array c . Help Maxim count how many selected arrays will be good.

In other words, find the number of positions 1 \le l \le n - m + 1 such that
the elements a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_{l + m - 1} form a good array.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
k \le m \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in arrays a and b ,
the required number of matching elements.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a . Elements of the array a are not
necessarily unique.

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b . Elements of the array b are not
necessarily unique.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of good subsegments of array a on a
separate line.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers n, m, k, a (a list of n integers), and b (a list of m integers). For each test case, it counts how many times the condition (the number of elements in `a` that are also in `b` being at least `k`) is met within a sliding window of size `m` across `a`. It then prints the total count of such occurrences across all test cases. After processing, it resets the count arrays and values for the next test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of good subsegments. Specifically, the program does not properly handle the sliding window approach to check each subsegment of length `m` in `a`.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Initialization and Counting**: The program initializes `cnt_b` to count the occurrences of elements in `b`. However, it does not correctly update the counts as it slides through the subsegments of `a`.

2. **Sliding Window Logic**: The program attempts to slide the window across `a` but does not correctly maintain the count of matching elements within the current window. It incorrectly updates the count of elements in `a` that are present in `b` without ensuring that the count reflects the current window.

3. **Condition Check**: The condition `if curr >= k:` is used to determine if the current window is good. However, this check is not performed correctly because the count of matching elements (`curr`) is not updated properly as the window slides.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:

- **Input**:
  ```
  1
  7 4 3
  4 1 2 3 4 5 6
  1 2 3 4
  ```

- **Expected Output**:
  ```
  4
  ```

- **Actual Output**:
  The program outputs `3`, which is incorrect.

The program fails to correctly count the number of good subsegments because it does not properly update the counts of elements in the sliding window. A correct implementation would involve maintaining a sliding window and updating the counts of elements in `b` as the window moves through `a`.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, hence the correctness is **False**.
