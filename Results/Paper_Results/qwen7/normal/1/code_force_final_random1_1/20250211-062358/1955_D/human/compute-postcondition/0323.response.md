Output State: **`i` is the first element of `b_values`, `cnt_b[i]` is 0, `b_values` must have at least `n - m` elements**

Explanation: The code sets `cnt_b[i]` to 0. Here, `i` is the first element of `b_values`. The value of `i` does not change, and neither does the condition that `b_values` must have at least `n - m` elements. Therefore, these conditions remain unchanged, and only `cnt_b[i]` is updated to 0.
