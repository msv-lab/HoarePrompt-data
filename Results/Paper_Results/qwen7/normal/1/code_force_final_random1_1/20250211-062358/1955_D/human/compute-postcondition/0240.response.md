Output State: **`x` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, and the value of `a[i]` is present in the list `b_values`. The count of `a[i]` in `cnt_b` is greater than or equal to 0; `curr` is incremented by 1.**

The variable `curr` is incremented by 1, while the other variables (`x`, `a`, `a[i]`, `b_values`, `cnt_b`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
