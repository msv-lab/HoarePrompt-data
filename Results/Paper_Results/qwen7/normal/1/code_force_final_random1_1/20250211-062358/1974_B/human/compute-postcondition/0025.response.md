Output State: **`s` remains unchanged, `char` is the next character in `s`, `j` is adjusted (incremented by 1), and `unique_chars` has the new character `i` inserted, `i` is increased by 1**.

This means that the value of `j` has been incremented by 1, while the other variables (`s`, `char`, `unique_chars`, and `i`) remain in their respective states as described in the initial state.
