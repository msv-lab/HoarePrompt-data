Reasoning:
- The provided program does not correctly implement the decoding logic as described in the problem statement.
- The function `func_1` is intended to sort the unique characters of the encoded string `s`, but it actually constructs an auxiliary string `unique_chars` and replaces characters in `s` with these sorted unique characters. This is not the correct approach for decoding.
- The problem requires decoding, which means reversing the process of encoding. Given the encoded string `b`, we need to map each character back to its original position in the auxiliary string `r` (which contains all distinct letters of the original string `s` in sorted order).
- The current implementation does not create the auxiliary string `r` and does not correctly reverse the encoding process.

Given the above analysis, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
