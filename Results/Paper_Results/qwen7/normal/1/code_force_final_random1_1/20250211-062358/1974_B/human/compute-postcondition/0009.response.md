Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `char` is not in `unique_chars`, `unique_chars` contains the character `char` at index `i+1`, `j` is increased by 1.**

The code `j += 1` increments the value of `j` by 1. The other variables (`s`, `char`, and `unique_chars`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
