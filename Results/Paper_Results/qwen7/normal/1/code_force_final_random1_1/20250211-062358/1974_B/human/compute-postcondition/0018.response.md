Postcondition: `s` remains unchanged, `char` becomes the next character in `s`, and `j` is adjusted (decremented if `char` is in `unique_chars`, incremented otherwise). If `char` is in `unique_chars`, `s` is modified to replace `char` with the corresponding character in `unique_chars`. If `char` is not in `unique_chars`, `j` is incremented, and `unique_chars` is updated to include the character `i + 1`.
