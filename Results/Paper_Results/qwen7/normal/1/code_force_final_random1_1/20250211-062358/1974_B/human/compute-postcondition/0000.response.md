Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters; `unique_chars` is a list of unique characters from `s` sorted alphabetically.**

Explanation: The code creates a set of unique characters from the string `s` and then converts this set into a sorted list. Since `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `unique_chars` will be a list of these unique characters sorted in alphabetical order. The original string `s` remains unchanged.
