Postcondition: `s` is a non-empty string. If `char` is a character in the set `unique_chars`, then all occurrences of `char` in `s` are replaced by `unique_chars[j]`, and `j` is decremented by 1. If `char` is not in `unique_chars`, then `unique_chars` contains the character `char` at index `i+1`, and `j` is increased by 1.
