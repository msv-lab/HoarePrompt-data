Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly decodes the encoded string according to the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then iterates through the list to process each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it extracts the length `n` of the encoded string `b`.
   - It then processes the encoded string `b` to decode it.

3. **Decoding Function (`func_1`):**
   - **Step 1:** Construct the string `r` which contains all distinct characters of the encoded string `b`, sorted alphabetically.
     - This is done using `set(encoded)` to get unique characters and `sorted()` to sort them.
   - **Step 2:** Create a dictionary `mapping` where each character in `r` is mapped to its corresponding symmetric character in `r`.
     - The symmetric character is found by mapping the current character to the character at the position `len(r) - 1 - i` (where `i` is the index of the current character).
   - **Step 3:** Decode the encoded string `b` by replacing each character with its corresponding symmetric character from the `mapping` dictionary.

### Verification:

1. **Correctness of `func_1`:**
   - The function correctly constructs the auxiliary string `r` by sorting the unique characters of the encoded string.
   - The `mapping` dictionary is correctly created to map each character to its symmetric counterpart.
   - The decoded string is correctly generated by replacing each character in the encoded string with its symmetric counterpart.

2. **Handling Multiple Test Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases by iterating through the input data and processing each one separately.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program should handle edge cases such as empty strings or single-character strings correctly.
   - For an empty string, the function should return an empty string.
   - For a single-character string, the function should return the same character since there are no symmetric characters to map to.

### Conclusion:

After analyzing the program, it appears that the logic for decoding the string is correct and handles the problem as specified. There are no apparent errors in the implementation.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
