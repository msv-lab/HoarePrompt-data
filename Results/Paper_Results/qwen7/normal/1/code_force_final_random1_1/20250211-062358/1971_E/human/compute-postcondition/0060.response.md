Output State: **`i` is 1, `l` is 2, `m` is 0, `ql` is `ql` - `a[s - 1]**.

Explanation: The code sets `m` to 0, directly updating its value. The values of `i`, `l`, and `ql` remain unchanged from their initial states. The expression for `m` simplifies to 0 since `m` is reassigned without using its previous value. The value of `ql` is left as `ql` - `a[s - 1]` because the subtraction operation is not performed again; instead, `m` is simply set to 0.
