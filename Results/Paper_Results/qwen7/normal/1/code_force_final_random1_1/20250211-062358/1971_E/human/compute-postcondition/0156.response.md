Output State: **`ad` has had its last element updated to `a[2] - a[1]`, `i` is 5, `ad` now includes `a[5] - a[4]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` to the list `ad`. Given that `i` is 4, `ad.append(a[4] - a[3])` is executed, updating the last element of `ad` to `a[4] - a[3]`. Since `i` is incremented by 1 in the process, `i` becomes 5. The initial condition that `len(a)` must be greater than 4 remains valid.
