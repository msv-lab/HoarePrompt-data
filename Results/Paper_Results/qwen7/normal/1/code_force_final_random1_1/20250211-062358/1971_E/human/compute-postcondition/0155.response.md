Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, len(a)):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `len(a)`.

2. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `ad` has had its last element updated to `a[2] - a[1]`.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is appended to `ad`.

3. **Determine the Next Iteration**:
   - The loop starts from `i = 1` and goes up to `i = len(a) - 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3.
   - For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 4.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `i < len(a)`. Since `i` is now 4, `len(a)` must be greater than 4 for the loop to execute again.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` is now 4.
   - `len(a)` must be greater than 4 for the loop to continue.

5. **Consider the List `ad`**:
   - The value of `ad` does not directly depend on the loop variable `i`, but it is updated based on the values of `a`. Therefore, we do not need to adjust `ad` explicitly in this context.

Based on the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `len(a)`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`ad` has had its last element updated to `a[2] - a[1]`, `i` is 4, `len(a)` must be greater than 4**
