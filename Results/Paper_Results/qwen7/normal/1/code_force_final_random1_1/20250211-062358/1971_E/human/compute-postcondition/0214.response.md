Output State: **`i` is 1, `m` is `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql / ad[s])`, `q` is equal to `len(a)`, `s` is the result of `bisect_left(a, ql)`, `ql` is an input integer reduced by `a[s - 1]`, `l` is `q + 1`, and if `a[s]` equals `ql`, the condition is met as is; otherwise, the condition remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The value of `m` is updated by adding `bd[s] * ql / ad[s]` to its current value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
