Output State: **`i` is 1, `l` is 2, `m` is `bd[s] * (ql / ad[s]) + b[s - 1]`, `ql` is `ql - a[s - 1]`**

Explanation: The value of `m` is updated by adding `bd[s] * (ql / ad[s])` to its current value, which was `b[s - 1]`. The values of `i`, `l`, `ql`, and `ad[s]` remain unchanged. Therefore, `m` now holds the value of `b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql / ad[s])`. The value of `ql` is also updated by subtracting `a[s - 1]` from its current value.
