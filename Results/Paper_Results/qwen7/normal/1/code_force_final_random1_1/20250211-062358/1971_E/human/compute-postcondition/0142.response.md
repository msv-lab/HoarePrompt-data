To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the expression for `m`.

1. **Initial State:**
   - `q` is defined as `len(a) - q`. This implies that `q` is being set to the length of the list `a` minus itself, which is not possible without knowing the actual value of `q`. However, since `q` is being redefined in this way, it suggests that `q` is being set to the length of `a` minus the current value of `q`. For simplicity, let's assume `q` is initially 0, so `q` would be set to `len(a)`.
   - `l` is explicitly given as `2`.
   - `m` is defined as `b[s - 1] + (bd[s] * (a[s] - a[s - 1])) / ad[s]`.
     - Here, `s` is not defined, but assuming `s` is an index within the bounds of the lists `a`, `b`, `bd`, and `ad`, we need to know their values.
   - `i` is explicitly given as `1`.

2. **Expression for `m`:**
   - `m = b[s - 1] + (bd[s] * (a[s] - a[s - 1])) / ad[s]`
   - Without specific values for `a`, `b`, `bd`, and `ad`, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `m`. However, we can describe `m` in terms of these variables.

Given the above, the print statement will output the integer value of `m` followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

Output: **int(b[s - 1] + (bd[s] * (a[s] - a[s - 1])) / ad[s])**
