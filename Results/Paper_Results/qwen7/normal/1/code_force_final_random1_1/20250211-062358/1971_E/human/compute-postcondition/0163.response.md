Output State: **`i` is 3; `bd` is a list with two elements, where the first element is `b[1] - b[0]` and the second element is `b[3] - b[2]`**.

Explanation: The code `bd.append(b[i] - b[i - 1])` appends a new element to the list `bd`. Given that `i` is 3, the new element added to `bd` is `b[3] - b[2]`. The initial state of `bd` is a list with one element equal to `b[1] - b[0]`. Therefore, after executing the code, `bd` will have two elements: `b[1] - b[0]` and `b[3] - b[2]`. The value of `i` remains unchanged.
