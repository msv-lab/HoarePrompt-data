Output State: **`i` is 3; `ad` is a list containing the values `a[1] - a[0]` and `a[3] - a[2]`; `len(a)` must be greater than 1.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `a[i] - a[i - 1]` to the list `ad`. Given that `i` is 3, `ad` initially contains the value `a[1] - a[0]`. After executing the code, `ad` will now contain `a[1] - a[0]` and `a[3] - a[2]`. The length of the list `a` must remain greater than 1 as no changes were made to it.
