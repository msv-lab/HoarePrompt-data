Output State: **`q` is `len(a) - a[s - 1]`, `l` is `1`, `m` is `0`, `i` is `1`, `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted to keep the list `a` sorted, and we perform a binary search.**

Explanation: The code `s = bisect_left(a, ql)` performs a binary search on the list `a` to find the index `s` where the value `ql` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `a`. The values of `q`, `l`, `m`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
