Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, len(a))`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 3
   - `v` contains the value `ad[2] / bd[2]`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop starts from `1` and goes up to but does not include `len(a)`. Therefore, the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(a)`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1. Thus, `i` will be 4.
   - The value of `v` remains unchanged because it is derived from `ad[2] / bd[2]`, which does not depend on `i`.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - The variable `i` changes to 4.
   - The variable `v` remains as `ad[2] / bd[2]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 4, `v` contains the value `ad[2] / bd[2]`**
