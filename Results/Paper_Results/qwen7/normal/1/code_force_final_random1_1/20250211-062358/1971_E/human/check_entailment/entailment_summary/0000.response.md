Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the input values \(n\), \(k\), and \(q\) for each test case, as well as the lists \(a\) and \(b\).
2. **Distance Calculation**: The program calculates the distances between consecutive points in both \(a\) and \(b\) lists.
3. **Speed Calculation**: It computes the speed between each pair of consecutive points using the formula \(v = \frac{ad[i]}{bd[i]}\).
4. **Query Handling**: For each query, the program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the appropriate segment in the \(a\) list where the query point lies. If the exact point is found, it directly returns the corresponding time from the \(b\) list. Otherwise, it interpolates the time using the calculated speeds and distances.
5. **Output**: The program prints the interpolated times for each query, rounded down to the nearest integer.

Given the detailed steps and the logical flow of the program, it appears to correctly implement the required functionality based on the problem description and the provided execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
