Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `ad` has a new element which is `a[i] - a[i - 1]`.

### Loop Statement
```
for i in range(1, len(a)):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head involves the variable `i`.
2. **Condition for Next Iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(a)`.
3. **Current Value of `i`**: Since this is the state after the previous iteration, `i` was one less than its current value for the next iteration. Let's assume `i` was `k` in the previous iteration, then it is now `k + 1`.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Determine the Current Value of `i`**:
   - If the loop just finished an iteration, `i` was `k` before the last iteration.
   - Therefore, for the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`.

2. **Adjust the State**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value.
   - The new value of `i` will be `k + 1`.

3. **Ensure `i` is within the Range**:
   - The loop runs from `1` to `len(a) - 1`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` should still be within this range.

### Conclusion
Since `i` was `k` in the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`. The state of `ad` will be updated with the new element `a[k + 1] - a[k]`.

### Final State
- `i` will be `k + 1`.
- `ad` will have a new element `a[k + 1] - a[k]`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`ad` has a new element which is `a[i] - a[i - 1]`, `i` is `k + 1` where `k` was the value of `i` in the previous iteration.**
