Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, len(a)):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `len(a)`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ad` has had its last element updated to `a[i] - a[i - 1]`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**:
   - The loop starts from `i = 1` and goes up to `i < len(a)`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was one less than the current value it needs to take for the next iteration.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time, if `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then for the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`.
   - Therefore, `i` will be `2` (since it started from `1` and incremented once).

5. **Ensure `len(a)` remains unchanged**:
   - `len(a)` does not change within the loop, so it remains the same as it was at the start of the loop.

6. **Consider the state of `ad`**:
   - The state of `ad` is determined by the value of `a[i] - a[i - 1]`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be `2`, so the last element of `ad` will be `a[2] - a[1]`.

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` will be `2`.
- `len(a)` remains the same.
- `ad` will have its last element updated to `a[2] - a[1]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`ad` has had its last element updated to `a[2] - a[1]`, `i` is 2, `len(a)` is the same as before**.
