Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, len(b))`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is given as:
   - `i` is 2
   - `bd` is a list with one element equal to `b[1] - b[0]`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `len(b) - 1`. For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `len(b)`.

4. **Calculate the next value of `i`**: Since `i` starts from `1` and increments by `1` each iteration, if `i` is currently `2`, it will be incremented to `3` in the next iteration.

5. **Check the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `len(b)`. Given that `i` is now `3`, the loop will execute again as long as `3 < len(b)`.

6. **Adjust the state**: We need to update the state to reflect the new value of `i` and ensure that the condition for the next iteration is met. Since `bd` is derived from the list `b`, its value does not change based on the loop itself but rather on the initial setup or the values in `b`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 3, `bd` is a list with one element equal to `b[1] - b[0]`**
