Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the calculation of the time taken to travel between points. Specifically, the program does not properly calculate the speed between each pair of points and apply it to the distance queries. Here's a detailed breakdown of the issue:

1. **Speed Calculation**: The program calculates the speed between each pair of points using `v.append(ad[i] / bd[i])`. However, this approach assumes that the speed between each pair of points is constant, which is not necessarily true. The speed should be calculated based on the total distance and total time between the points.

2. **Query Handling**: When handling queries, the program uses `bisect_left` to find the relevant segment and then calculates the time based on the speed. However, the speed calculation is incorrect because it does not account for the varying speeds between segments.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following example:

- **Test Case**: 
  ```
  1
  2 2 3
  1 2
  1 2
  0
  1
  2
  ```

- **Expected Output**:
  ```
  0 1 2 
  ```

- **Actual Output**:
  The program will incorrectly calculate the times because it does not properly handle the varying speeds between segments.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the required functionality for all potential cases, hence the correctness is **False**.
