Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - It reads the values of `n`, `k`, and `q`.
   - It constructs the lists `a` and `b` which represent the positions and times at those positions.
   - It calculates the distances between consecutive points in `a` and `b` to get `ad` and `bd`.
   - It computes the speeds between consecutive points using the formula `speed = distance / time`.
3. **Handling Queries**:
   - For each query, it uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the segment where the queried position lies.
   - If the queried position exactly matches a known position, it directly outputs the corresponding time.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the additional time taken to travel from the last known position to the queried position and adds it to the previous time.
4. **Output**: The program prints the calculated time for each query, rounded down to the nearest integer.

The logic is sound and should handle all the constraints and examples provided in the problem statement. Therefore, the given program is correct.
