### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**:
   - The program correctly parses the input for the number of test cases (`t`), and for each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `q`. It initializes lists `a` and `b` with the given points and times, respectively.
   - It calculates the distances between consecutive points in `a` and the corresponding speeds in `v`.

2. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query `d`, the program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the appropriate segment `[a[s-1], a[s]]` where `d` lies.
   - It then calculates the time taken to travel from `a[s-1]` to `d` using the speed `bd[s]` and adds this to the accumulated time `b[s-1]`.
   - The result is printed, rounded down to the nearest integer.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `d` exactly matches a known point `a[s]`, the program directly outputs the corresponding time `b[s]`.

4. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop processes all queries for each test case correctly, and the final state of the variables is consistent with the expected behavior.

5. **Output**:
   - The output is formatted correctly, with each query result printed on a new line.

Given the provided code and the problem description, the program appears to handle all aspects of the problem correctly. There are no apparent logical errors or omissions that would cause the program to produce incorrect results.

### Correctness:
**True**
