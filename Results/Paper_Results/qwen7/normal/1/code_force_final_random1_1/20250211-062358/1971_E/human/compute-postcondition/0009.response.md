Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is defined by the `for i in range(1, len(a)):` statement. The variables involved here are `i` and `len(a)`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `ad` is a list containing the value `a[1] - a[0]`
   - `len(a)` must be greater than 1

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i` is within the range defined by `range(1, len(a))`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, so the loop will continue if `i < len(a)`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 2, it will be incremented to 3 in the next iteration.
   - For the loop to continue, `len(a)` must still be greater than 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is 3
- `len(a)` must be greater than 1

So, the final state is:
State: **`i` is 3, `ad` is a list containing the value `a[1] - a[0]`, `len(a)` must be greater than 1**
