Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `m` is 0, `q` is equal to `len(a)`, `s` is the result of `bisect_left(a, ql)`, `ql` is an input integer, `l` is `q`. If `a[s]` equals `ql`, the condition holds true. If `a[s]` does not equal `ql`, the condition also holds true as there is no else part changing these variables.**
