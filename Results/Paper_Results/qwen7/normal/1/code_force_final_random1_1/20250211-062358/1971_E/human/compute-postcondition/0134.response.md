Output State: **`q` is `len(a) - q`, `l` is `2`, `m` is `0`, `i` is `1`, `s` is `bisect_left(a, ql)`**

Explanation: The variable `s` is assigned the value of `bisect_left(a, ql)`. The function `bisect_left` returns the index where the value `ql` would be inserted to keep the list `a` sorted. The values of `q`, `l`, `m`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
