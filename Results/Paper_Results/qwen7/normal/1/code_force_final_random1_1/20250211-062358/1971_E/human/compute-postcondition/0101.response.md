Output State: **`i` is 4; `v` contains the value `[ad[2] / bd[2], ad[4] / bd[4]]`**

Explanation: Initially, `i` is 4 and `v` contains the value `ad[2] / bd[2]`. The code snippet `v.append(ad[i] / bd[i])` appends the value of `ad[i] / bd[i]` to the list `v`. Since `i` is 4, the new value appended to `v` is `ad[4] / bd[4]`. Therefore, `v` now contains both `ad[2] / bd[2]` and `ad[4] / bd[4]`.
