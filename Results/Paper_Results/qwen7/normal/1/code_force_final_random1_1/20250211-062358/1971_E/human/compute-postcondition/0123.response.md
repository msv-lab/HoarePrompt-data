The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. However, since no loop was specified in the initial state, and the `continue` statement does not modify any variables, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`q` is `len(a) - a[s - 1]`, `l` is `1`, `m` is `0`, `i` is `1`, `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted to keep the list `a` sorted.**
