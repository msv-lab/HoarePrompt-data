Output State: **`i` is 1, `l` is 2, `m` is 0, `s` is the index where `ql` would be inserted to keep the list `a` sorted. We continue to the next iteration of the loop.**

The `continue` statement causes the flow of execution to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since there are no changes to the values of the variables `i`, `l`, `m`, and `s`, their values remain the same. The statement also indicates that the next iteration of the loop will start.
