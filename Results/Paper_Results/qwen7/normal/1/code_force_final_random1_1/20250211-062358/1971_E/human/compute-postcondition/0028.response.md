Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable is `i`.
   - The loop condition is `range(1, len(a))`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is `len(b) + 1`.
   - `bd` is a list containing the differences between each pair of consecutive elements in `b`.
   - `v` is a list containing the elements `0` with an additional element `ad[i] / bd[i]`.

3. **Determine the Next State:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be within the range `1` to `len(a) - 1`.
   - Since `i` is currently `len(b) + 1`, it needs to be incremented by 1 to start the next iteration.
   - Therefore, `i` will be `len(b) + 2` at the start of the next iteration.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - `i` will be `len(b) + 2`.
   - `bd` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
   - `v` will have an additional element at the end, which is `ad[i] / bd[i]`. Since `i` is now `len(b) + 2`, the new element in `v` will be `ad[len(b) + 2] / bd[len(b) + 2]`.

5. **Formulate the New State:**
   - `i` is `len(b) + 2`.
   - `bd` is a list containing the differences between each pair of consecutive elements in `b`.
   - `v` is a list containing the elements `0` with an additional element `ad[i-1] / bd[i-1]`, which is now `ad[len(b) + 2] / bd[len(b) + 2]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is `len(b) + 2`, `bd` is a list containing the differences between each pair of consecutive elements in `b`, and `v` is a list containing the elements `0` with an additional element `ad[len(b) + 2] / bd[len(b) + 2]`.**
