Output State: **The final value of `l` will be `len(a) - 1`, `m` will be `b[s - 1] + (bd[s] * (a[len(a) - 1] - a[s - 1])) / ad[s]`, `i` will be `1`, `ql` will be `q - a[s - 1]`, and `s` will be `bisect_left(a, q)`**.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, the variable `l` will increment until it reaches `len(a) - 1`. At each iteration, `m` accumulates the sum of `b[s - 1]` and the fraction `(bd[s] * (a[s] - a[s - 1])) / ad[s]`. Since `i` remains `1` and does not change within the loop, its final value will still be `1`. The value of `ql` will be updated to `q - a[s - 1]` at the start of each iteration, but since `q` is effectively reduced by the total of `a[s - 1]` over iterations, `ql` will eventually reflect the remaining difference. The variable `s` remains unchanged as it is determined by the `bisect_left(a, ql)` operation at the beginning of each iteration and does not get modified inside the loop.
