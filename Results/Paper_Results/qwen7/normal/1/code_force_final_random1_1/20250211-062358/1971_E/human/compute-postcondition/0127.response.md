Output State: **`q` is `len(a) - q`, `l` is `1`, `m` is `b[s - 1]`, `i` is `1`, and `ql` is `q - a[s - 1]`**.

Explanation: The code `m += b[s - 1]` increments the value of `m` by `b[s - 1]`. Since the initial value of `m` was `0`, after executing this line, `m` becomes `b[s - 1]`. The other variables (`q`, `l`, `i`, and `ql`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
