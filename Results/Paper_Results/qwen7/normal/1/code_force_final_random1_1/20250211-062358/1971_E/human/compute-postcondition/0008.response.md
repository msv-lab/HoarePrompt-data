Output State: **`i` is 2; `ad` is a list containing the value `a[1] - a[0]`; `len(a)` must be greater than 1**

Explanation: The code `ad.append(a[i] - a[i - 1])` appends the difference between the current element `a[i]` and the previous element `a[i - 1]` to the list `ad`. Given that `i` is initially 1, the expression `a[i] - a[i - 1]` evaluates to `a[1] - a[0]`. The precondition that `len(a)` must be greater than 1 remains valid after the code execution. The variable `i` is incremented implicitly by the operation, making it 2.
