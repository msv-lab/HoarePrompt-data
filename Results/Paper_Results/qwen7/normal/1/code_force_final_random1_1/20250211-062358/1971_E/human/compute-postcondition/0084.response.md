Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- **State at the end of the previous iteration**: 
  - `ad` now contains the element `a[k + 1] - a[k]`
  - `i` is `k + 1`

- **For Loop Statement**:
  ```python
  for i in range(1, len(a)):
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**:
   - The loop head defines the variable `i` as iterating from 1 to `len(a) - 1`.

2. **Current State**:
   - `i` is currently `k + 1`, where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration.

3. **Next Iteration Condition**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be within the range `1` to `len(a) - 1`.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, the next value of `i` would be `k + 2`.
   - The variable `ad` is not directly involved in the loop condition, so it remains unchanged.

### Updated State:
- `i` will be `k + 2` (the next value in the range).
- `ad` remains the same as it was in the previous iteration.

### Final Answer:
State: **`ad` now contains the element `a[k + 2] - a[k + 1]`, `i` is `k + 2`**
