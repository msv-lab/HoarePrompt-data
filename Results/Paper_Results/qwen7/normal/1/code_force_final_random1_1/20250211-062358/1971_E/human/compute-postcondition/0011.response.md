Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `len(a)`.
2. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(a)`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 3
   - `ad` is a list containing the values `a[1] - a[0]` and `a[3] - a[2]`
   - `len(a)` must be greater than 1
4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, if `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be 4 at the start of the next iteration.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` (which is now 4) must be less than `len(a)`.
   - Therefore, `len(a)` must be greater than 4.

Given these points, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 4, `ad` is a list containing the values `a[1] - a[0]` and `a[3] - a[2]`, `len(a)` must be greater than 4**
