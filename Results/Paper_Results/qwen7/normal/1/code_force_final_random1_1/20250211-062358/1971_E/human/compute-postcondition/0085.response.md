Output State: **`ad` now contains the element `a[k + 2] - a[k + 1]` and `a[i - 1] - a[i - 2]`, `i` is `k + 2`**.

Explanation: The code appends the value of `a[i] - a[i - 1]` to the list `ad`. Given that `i` is `k + 2`, the new element added to `ad` is `a[k + 2] - a[k + 1]`. Since `ad` initially contained the element `a[k + 2] - a[k + 1]`, after appending, `ad` now contains both `a[k + 2] - a[k + 1]` and `a[i - 1] - a[i - 2]`, which simplifies to `a[k + 1] - a[k]` given that `i` is `k + 2`. The value of `i` remains `k + 2`.
