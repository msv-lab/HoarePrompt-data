Output State: **`q` is `len(a) - q`, `l` is `2`, `m` is `b[s - 1] + 0`, `i` is `1`, `ql` is `a[s] - a[s - 1]`**

Explanation: The code `m += b[s - 1]` increments the value of `m` by `b[s - 1]`. Initially, `m` is `0`, so after the addition, `m` becomes `b[s - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
