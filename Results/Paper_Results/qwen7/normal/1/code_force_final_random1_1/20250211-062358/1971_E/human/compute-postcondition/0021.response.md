Output State: **`i` is 3, `b` must have at least 3 elements, `bd` is a list containing `b[1] - b[0]`, `b[2] - b[0]`, `b[3] - b[2]`, and `b[3] - b[2]` (i.e., `b[3] - b[2]` is appended)**.

Explanation: The code appends the value of `b[i] - b[i - 1]` to the list `bd`. Given that `i` is 3, `b[i]` is `b[3]` and `b[i - 1]` is `b[2]`. So, `b[3] - b[2]` is appended to `bd`. The other variables remain unchanged.
