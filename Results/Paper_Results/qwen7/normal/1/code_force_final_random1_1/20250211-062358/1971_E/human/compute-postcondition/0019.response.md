Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i` and `b`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop runs from `1` to `len(b) - 1`. Therefore, the loop continues as long as `i` is less than `len(b)`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2.
   - `b` must have at least 3 elements.
   - `bd` is a list containing `b[1] - b[0]` and `b[2] - b[1]`.

4. **Next iteration requirements**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented by 1. So, `i` should be 3.
   - Since `i` is now 3, the condition `i < len(b)` must still hold true. This means `b` must have at least 4 elements (because `i` will be 3, and it needs to be less than `len(b)`).

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` is incremented to 3.
   - `b` must have at least 4 elements.
   - `bd` will now contain `b[1] - b[0]`, `b[2] - b[1]`, and `b[3] - b[2]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `i` is 3, `b` must have at least 4 elements, `bd` is a list containing `b[1] - b[0]`, `b[2] - b[1]`, and `b[3] - b[2]`**.
