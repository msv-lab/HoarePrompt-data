Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 2
   - `b` must have at least 3 elements
   - `bd` is a list containing `b[1] - b[0]` and `b[2] - b[0]`

2. **Loop Head Analysis:**
   - The loop is defined as `for i in range(1, len(b)):`

3. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.

4. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(b)`.

5. **Next Value of `i`:**
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` will be `i + 1`, which is `3`.

6. **Adjusting States:**
   - `i` will be incremented to 3.
   - `bd` will include an additional element, which is `b[3] - b[2]`.

7. **Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `i` will be 3.
   - `b` must still have at least 3 elements (this condition remains unchanged).
   - `bd` will contain `b[1] - b[0]`, `b[2] - b[0]`, and `b[3] - b[2]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is 3, `b` must have at least 3 elements, `bd` is a list containing `b[1] - b[0]`, `b[2] - b[0]`, and `b[3] - b[2]`**
