The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or change the state of the program. All variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`q` is `len(a)`, `l` is 0, `m` is 0, `i` is 1, `s` is `bisect_left(a, q)`, and `a[s]` is equal to `q`.**
