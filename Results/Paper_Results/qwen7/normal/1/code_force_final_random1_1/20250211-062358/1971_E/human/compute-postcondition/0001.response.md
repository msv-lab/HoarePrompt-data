Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t)`. The only variable here is `t`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `t`**: According to the given information, `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the state**: Since `t` is the only variable in the loop head and it determines whether the loop will execute, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0.

5. **Consider the other variables**: The variables `n`, `k`, `q`, `a`, `b`, and `d` are not part of the loop head and their values do not directly affect whether the loop will execute. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Based on the above steps, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` being greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
