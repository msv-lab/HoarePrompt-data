Output State: **`l` is `len(a) - 1`, `m` is `b[s - 1] + (bd[s] * (a[len(a) - 1] - a[s - 1])) / ad[s]`, `i` is `1`, `ql` is `q - a[s - 1]`, `s` is `bisect_left(a, q)`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n, k, q = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, and `q`. The values of the other variables (`l`, `m`, `i`, `ql`, and `s`) remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, these variables retain their initial values and states.
