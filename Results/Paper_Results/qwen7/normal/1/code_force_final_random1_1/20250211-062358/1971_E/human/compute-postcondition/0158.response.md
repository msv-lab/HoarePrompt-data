Output State: **`ad` is a list containing differences between consecutive elements of `a`, starting from the second element. The length of `ad` is `len(a) - 1`.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `ad` will contain the differences between each pair of consecutive elements in `a`, starting from the second element to the last. The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = len(a) - 1`, appending `a[i] - a[i - 1]` to `ad` in each iteration. Therefore, `ad` will have `len(a) - 1` elements, each representing the difference between two consecutive elements in the original list `a`.
