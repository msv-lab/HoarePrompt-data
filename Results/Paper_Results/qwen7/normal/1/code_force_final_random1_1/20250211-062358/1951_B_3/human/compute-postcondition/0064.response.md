Output State: **`z` is 1, `i` is the second element of the list `s` + 1, and `s` is the list without its first element.**

Explanation: The code `z = 1` assigns the value 1 to the variable `z`. This does not affect the values of `i` or `s`. Therefore, the value of `i` remains as the second element of the list `s` + 1, and `s` remains the list without its first element.
