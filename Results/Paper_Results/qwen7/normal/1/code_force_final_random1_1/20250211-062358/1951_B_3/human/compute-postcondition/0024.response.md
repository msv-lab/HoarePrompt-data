Output State: **`i` is 2; `n` must be greater than 1; `ind` is a list containing 1.**

Explanation: The variable `c` is incremented by 1, but since `c` was not defined in the initial state, it is not included in the output state. The other variables (`i`, `n`, and `ind`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
