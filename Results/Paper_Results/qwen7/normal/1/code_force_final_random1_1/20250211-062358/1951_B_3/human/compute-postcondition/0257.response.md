Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers n and k, and a list of n distinct integers a. For each test case, it swaps the first and the k-th elements of the list, then calculates two counts: `ans` representing the maximum number of consecutive elements starting from the second element that are not less than the first element of the original list, and `ans1` representing the count of elements equal to the first element of the original list or the first element of the list itself if it is not equal to the first element of the original list. After these calculations, it prints the maximum of `ans` and `ans1`.**
