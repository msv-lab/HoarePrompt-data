Output State: **`i` is the second element of the list `s` after the swaps, `s` is the list after the swaps, `z` is unchanged, `ans1` is `ans1` + 1.**

Explanation: The code `ans1 += 1` increments the value of `ans1` by 1. The other variables (`i`, `s`, and `z`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
