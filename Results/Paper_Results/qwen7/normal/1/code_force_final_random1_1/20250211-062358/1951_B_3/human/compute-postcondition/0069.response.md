Postcondition: `i` is either the second element of the list `s` and `s` is the list without its first element (if it originally had more than one element), or `i` is the second element of the list `s` plus 1 and `s` is the list without its first element (if it originally had more than one element). If the condition `i > h` is true, then `i` remains as the second element of the list `s`. Otherwise, `i` is incremented by 1.
