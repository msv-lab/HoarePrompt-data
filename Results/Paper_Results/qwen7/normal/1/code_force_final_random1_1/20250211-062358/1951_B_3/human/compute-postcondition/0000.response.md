Output State: **`a` is a list of n integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, where n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and all a_i's are distinct positive integers not exceeding 10^9. The list a is sorted in non-decreasing order; `x` is the k-th element in the list `a`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the k-th element of the list `a` to the variable `x`. Since the list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order, `x` now holds the value of the k-th element in the list. All other conditions and the structure of the list `a` remain unchanged.
