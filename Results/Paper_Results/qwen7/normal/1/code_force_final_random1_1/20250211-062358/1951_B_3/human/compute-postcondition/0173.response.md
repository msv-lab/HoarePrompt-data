Output State: **`s` is a list of integers with the first element and the k-1th element swapped.**

Explanation: The code swaps the first element (`s[0]`) with the element at index `k-1` (`s[k-1]`). This means that the values at these two positions in the list `s` are exchanged. All other elements in the list remain unchanged.
