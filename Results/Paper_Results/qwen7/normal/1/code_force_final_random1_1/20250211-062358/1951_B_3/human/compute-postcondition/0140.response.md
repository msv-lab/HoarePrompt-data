Postcondition: `i` is the first element of the list `s` after the swaps, and `s` is the list after the swaps. If `i` is greater than `h`, we break out of the loop or if statement. If `i` is not greater than `h`, then `i` is less than or equal to `h`. Additionally, if `z` is 1, then `ans1` is increased by 1.
