Output State: **`i` is the next element in `s` that is not equal to `h`, `s` must still contain at least one element that is not equal to `h`, `z` remains unchanged, `ans1` is incremented by 1**.

Explanation: The code `ans1 += 1` increments the value of `ans1` by 1. The other variables (`i`, `s`, `z`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
