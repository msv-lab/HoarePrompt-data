Output State: **`i` is 1; `n` must be greater than 1; `ind` is a list containing 1.**

The code `ind.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 1) to the list `ind`. Since `i` is 1, `ind` becomes a list containing 1. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and the condition that `n` must be greater than 1 is still valid.
