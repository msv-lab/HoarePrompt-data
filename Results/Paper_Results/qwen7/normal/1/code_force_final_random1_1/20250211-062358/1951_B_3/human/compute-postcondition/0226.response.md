Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in s`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `s`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in `s` that satisfy the condition `i != h`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is an element in `s` such that `i` is not equal to `h`.
   - If `i` is greater than `h`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken.
   - If `i` is less than or equal to `h`, then `i` is an integer within `s` that is not equal to `h`.
   - If `z` equals 1, `ans1` is set to 1; otherwise, `ans1` remains unchanged.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop continues based on the presence of elements in `s` that are not equal to `h`, we need to ensure that `s` still contains at least one such element.
   - The value of `i` will change to the next element in `s` that satisfies the condition `i != h`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be updated to the next element in `s` that is not equal to `h`.
   - `s` should still contain at least one element that is not equal to `h`.

6. **Consider Other Variables**:
   - `z` and `ans1` are not directly affected by the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted here.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `s`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is an element in `s` such that `i` is not equal to `h`, `s` must still contain at least one element that is not equal to `h`, `z` and `ans1` remain unchanged**.
