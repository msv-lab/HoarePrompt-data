`ans1` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` remains as the third element of the list `s` after the swaps, `s` remains the list after the swaps, and `z` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is the third element of the list `s` after the swaps, `s` is the list after the swaps, `z` is unchanged, and `ans1` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`i` is the third element of the list `s` after the swaps, `s` is the list after the swaps, `z` is unchanged, and `ans1` is incremented by 1.**
