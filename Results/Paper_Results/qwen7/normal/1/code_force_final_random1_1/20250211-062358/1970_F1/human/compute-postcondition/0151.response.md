Postcondition: `command` is a list of three strings, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`. If `el` is equal to '.Q', then `allPlayers[obj]` is set to `True`. If `el` is '.S.', then `team` is set to 1 and `points[team]` is set to 10. If `el` is neither '.Q' nor '.S.', then no changes are made to `allPlayers`, `team`, or `points`.
