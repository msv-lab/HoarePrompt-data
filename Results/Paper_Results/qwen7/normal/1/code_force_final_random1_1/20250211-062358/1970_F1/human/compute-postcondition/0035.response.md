Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for ind in range(len(line)):`. The variables involved here are `ind`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `ind` is within the range defined by `range(len(line))`. This means `ind` should be less than the length of `line`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is incremented by the value of `elements[line[len(line) - 1]]`.
   - `ind` is updated to the new value of `line[len(line) - 1]`.
   - `n` is an odd integer between 3 and 99 inclusive.
   - `line` is a non-empty list of strings.
   - `grid` is a list containing one element which is the list `line`.
   - `isPlayer(line[ind])` is either `False` or `True` depending on the value of `line[ind]`.
   - In both cases (`isPlayer(line[ind])` being `True` or `False`), `goal[0]` or `goal[1]` (depending on whether the first character of `line[ind]` is 'B' or not) appends a tuple `(elements[line[len(line) - 1]], line[len(line) - 1])` or `(i, ind)` to the list `goal`.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `ind` is updated to the new value of `line[len(line) - 1]`. For the loop to continue, `ind` must be less than the length of `line`.
   - Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `ind` must be incremented by 1.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` remains unchanged from the previous state since it is only updated inside the loop.
   - `ind` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - `n` remains an odd integer between 3 and 99 inclusive.
   - `line` remains a non-empty list of strings.
   - `grid` remains a list containing one element which is the list `line`.
   - `isPlayer(line[ind])` remains either `False` or `True` depending on the value of `line[ind]`.
   - `goal` will append a tuple based on the value of `line[ind]` and `ind`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: `i` is incremented by the value of `elements[line[len(line) - 1]]`, `ind` is updated to the new value of `line[len(line) - 1] + 1`, `n` is an odd integer between 3 and 99 inclusive, `line` is a non-empty list of strings, `grid` is a list containing one element which is the list `line`, `isPlayer(line[ind])` is either `False` or `True` depending on the value of `line[ind]`, and in both cases (`isPlayer(line[ind])` being `True` or `False`), `goal[0]` or `goal[1]` (depending on whether the first character of `line[ind]` is 'B' or not) appends a tuple `(elements[line[len(line) - 1]], line[len(line) - 1])` or `(i, ind)` to the list `goal`.**

However, to simplify the answer, we focus on the key variables that change:

**State: **`i` is incremented by the value of `elements[line[len(line) - 1]]`, `ind` is `line[len(line) - 1] + 1`, `n` is an odd integer between 3 and 99 inclusive, `line` is a non-empty list of strings, `grid` is a list containing one element which is the list `line`, `isPlayer(line[ind])` is either `False` or `True` depending on the value of `line[ind]`, and in both cases (`isPlayer(line[ind])` being `True` or `False`), `goal[0]` or `goal[1]` (depending on whether the first character of `line[ind]` is 'B' or not) appends a tuple `(elements[line[len(line) - 1]], line[len(line) - 1])` or `(i, ind)` to the list `goal`.**
