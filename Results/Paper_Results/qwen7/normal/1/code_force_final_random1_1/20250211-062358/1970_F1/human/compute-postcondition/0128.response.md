Postcondition: `ind` is 3, `elements[line[1]]` is either `(i, 3)` or remains as `False, 1`, `isPlayer(line[1])` evaluates to False, `allPlayers[line[1]]` is `False`, `tmp` is 0 if `line[1][0]` equals 'B' or `isPlayer(line[ind])` is True, otherwise `tmp` is 1, and `goal[tmp]` has appended `(i, 1)` or `(i, 3)` depending on the condition evaluated.
