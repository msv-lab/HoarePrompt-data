Postcondition: `command` is a list of strings, `command` is ('obj', 'com'), `time` is `time` + 1, `pos` is updated to (pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1]). If `obj` is a player and `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]` is also a player, `player` is determined based on whether `obj` is a player or not, otherwise it is `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`. If `obj` is not a player, `elements[obj]` is updated to (pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1]). If the command is 'T' and the goalIn(pos) is not -1, then the team corresponding to the goal position has its points incremented by 1.
