Functionality: **The function processes a game board represented by a 2D grid and updates the game state based on commands. It reads the initial setup of the game, including the grid, players, and goals, and then processes a series of commands. For each command, it updates the positions of the players, checks for eliminations, catches of the golden snitch, and goals scored. Finally, it prints the final scores of the two teams.**
