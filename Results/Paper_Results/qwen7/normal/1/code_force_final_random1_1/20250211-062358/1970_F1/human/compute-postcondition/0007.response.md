Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an odd integer between 3 and 99 inclusive, `line` is a list of strings obtained from the first line of standard input after stripping and splitting.**

The code reads a line of input from the standard input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and splits the line into a list of strings. This operation does not modify the values of `i` or `n`, but it introduces a new variable `line` which holds the result of the split operation. Since no specific values are provided for the input, `line` remains a list of strings based on the input received.
