Output State: **`elements[line[ind]]` is now `(i, ind)`, `ind` is `ind + 2`, `line` is a list of strings read from `stdin`, `i` remains 0, `n` remains an odd integer between 3 and 99 inclusive, `grid` is a list containing two elements where the second element is the list `line`, `isPlayer(line[ind + 1])` is either `False` or `True` depending on the value of `line[ind + 1]`, and `goal[0]` or `goal[1]` (depending on whether the first character of `line[ind + 1]` is 'B' or not) contains tuples `(i, ind + 1)` for each non-`.` character in `line`, and `ind + 2` is less than `len(line)`, and the current value of `line[ind + 1]` is not `'..', allPlayers[line[ind]]` is set to `False`, and `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0] == 'B'` else 1, and `allPlayers[line[ind + 1]]` is set to `False` if `isPlayer(line[ind + 1])` is `True`, otherwise `goal[tmp]` is updated to contain `(i, ind + 1)`, and if `line[ind][1] == 'G'`, `goal[tmp]` now includes an additional tuple `(i, ind + 1)`; `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is now `False`.**

This output state reflects that the variable `allPlayers[line[ind]]` has been set to `False`, while all other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
