Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `command` is a list of three strings.
   - `obj` is the first element of `command`, so `obj = command[0]`.
   - `com` is the second element of `command`, so `com = command[1]`.
   - `el` is set to `.S.`.
   - `team` is set to 1.
   - `points[team]` is set to 10.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement is: `print('%d %s CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' % (time, GoalName[team]))`.

From the initial state, we know:
- `team` is 1.
- `points[team]` is 10, but this value is not used in the print statement.
- `time` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so it must be a variable that needs to be provided or assumed to have a specific value.
- `GoalName[team]` refers to `GoalName[1]`, but since `GoalName` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value. However, we know that `team` is 1, so `GoalName[1]` will be the value at index 1 of the `GoalName` list.

Given the format of the print statement, we need to assume that `time` is a variable that holds a numeric value. Let's denote it as `time_value`.

Therefore, the print statement will output:
Output: **time_value .S. CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH**
