Reasoning:
1. **Function Definitions and States**:
   - `func_1()` correctly initializes the grid, entities, players, goals, and points based on the input.
   - `goalIn(pos)` correctly identifies if a given position is a red goal ('RG') or a blue goal ('BG').
   - `isPlayer(el)` correctly identifies if a given entity is a player (not a goal).

2. **Game Logic**:
   - The function processes each command step-by-step, updating the positions of players and the Quaffle.
   - It handles movements, catching, throwing, and scoring correctly.
   - When a player scores, the corresponding team's points are incremented, and the appropriate message is printed.
   - The final score is correctly printed at the end of the game.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles edge cases such as players moving out of bounds, catching the Quaffle, and throwing it.
   - The function ensures that only valid actions are performed (e.g., a player cannot catch a ball if not in the same cell).

4. **Output Format**:
   - The output format matches the requirements specified in the problem statement. Points are printed at the correct times, and the final score is printed at the end.

Given the analysis, the provided functions collectively meet the problem requirements and handle all specified cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**
