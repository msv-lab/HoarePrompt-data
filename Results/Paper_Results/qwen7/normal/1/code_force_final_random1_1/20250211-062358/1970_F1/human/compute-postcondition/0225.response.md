Output State: **`time` is the previous value of `time` + 1, `comand` is an empty list, `team` is 1, `obj` is undefined, `com` is undefined, `el` is undefined, `points[team]` is 10**.

Explanation: The code `points[team] += 10` increments the value of `points[team]` by 10. Given that `team` is 1, `points[1]` is updated to 10. All other variables remain unchanged.
