Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the scenario where a player throws the Quaffle into their own goal, which results in the opposing team scoring a point. According to the problem description, if a player throws the Quaffle into their own goal, the other team wins the point. However, the `func_1` function does not account for this case. Specifically, the function checks if the Quaffle is thrown into a goal using `if goalIn(pos) != -1:` but does not handle the case where the goal is the player's own team's goal.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3 5
.. .. R0 .. ..
RG .. .Q .. BG
.. .. B0 .. ..
12
R0 D
R0 C .Q
R0 R
R0 T
R0 D
B0 R
B0 U
B0 C .Q
B0 L
B0 L
B0 L
B0 T
```

In this case, the red player throws the Quaffle into the red goal, which should result in the blue team scoring a point. However, the program does not handle this scenario correctly, leading to incorrect output.
