Output State: **`command` is a list of three strings, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `el` is '.S.', `team` is 1, and `points[team]` is 10**.

Explanation: The code `points[team] += 10` increments the value of `points[team]` by 10. Given that `team` is initially 1, `points[1]` is incremented by 10. Since `points` is not defined in the initial state, we assume it is a dictionary or list where `points[1]` was initially 0 (or undefined), and now it is 10. All other variables remain unchanged.
