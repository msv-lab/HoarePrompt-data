Output State: **`command` is a list of strings obtained from stripping and splitting the input read from stdin, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `pos` is the value of the element in the `elements` list at index `obj`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of the element in the `elements` list at the index specified by `obj` to the variable `pos`. The other variables (`command`, `obj`, and `com`) remain unchanged.
