Postcondition: `time` is the previous value of `time` + 1, `comand` is an empty list, `obj` is defined but `allPlayers[obj]` is set to `False`, `com` is an undefined variable, `pos` is equal to `elements[obj]`, `nxt` is equal to `pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1]`. If `goalIn(pos)` is not `-1`, then `team` is the result of the function `goalIn(pos)` and `points[team]` is increased by 1. If `goalIn(pos)` is `-1`, then no changes occur to the variables.
