Postcondition: `command` is a list of strings obtained from stripping and splitting the input read from stdin, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `pos` is the value of the element in the `elements` list at index `obj`, `nxt` is a tuple with the value of `pos[0] + mov[com][0]` as its first element and `pos[1] + mov[com][1]` as its second element, `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`, `obj` is not equal to '.B', `isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])` is False, `com` is not equal to 'T', and `isPlayer(obj)` is True, and `elements['.B']` is not equal to `nxt`.

This postcondition summarizes that if `obj` is a player, then `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`, and all the specified conditions remain true. Since there is no else part, the postcondition directly follows from the if part.
