Output State: **`tmp` is 0 if the first character of `line[ind]` is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1; `i` is incremented by the value of `elements[line[len(line) - 1]]`, `ind` is `line[len(line) - 1] + 1`, `n` is an odd integer between 3 and 99 inclusive, `line` is a non-empty list of strings, `grid` is a list containing one element which is the list `line`, `isPlayer(line[ind])` is either `False` or `True` depending on the value of `line[ind]`, and in both cases (`isPlayer(line[ind])` being `True` or `False`), `goal[0]` or `goal[1]` (depending on whether the first character of `line[ind]` is 'B' or not) appends a tuple `(i, ind)` to the list `goal`; `elements[line[ind]]` is set to the tuple `(i, ind); `goal[tmp]` now contains the tuple `(i, ind)` appended to its existing contents.**

This means that the tuple `(i, ind)` has been appended to the list `goal[tmp]`. The values of `tmp`, `i`, `ind`, `n`, `line`, `grid`, `isPlayer(line[ind])`, and `elements[line[ind]]` remain as described in the initial state, except that `goal[tmp]` now includes the new tuple.
