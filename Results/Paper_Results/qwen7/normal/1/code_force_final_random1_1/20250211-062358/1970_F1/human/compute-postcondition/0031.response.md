Postcondition: **`i` is updated to `elements[line[len(line) - 1]]`, `ind` is updated to the new value of `line[len(line) - 1]`, `n` is an odd integer between 3 and 99 inclusive, `line` is a non-empty list of strings, `grid` is a list containing one element which is the list `line`, `isPlayer(line[ind])` is either `False` or `True` depending on the value of `line[ind]`, and if `isPlayer(line[ind])` is `False`, the character at index `ind` in `line` is 'G' and `goal[tmp]` appends a tuple `(i, ind)` to the list `goal`.**

This means that regardless of whether the condition `line[ind][1] == 'G'` is true or false, the values of `i`, `ind`, `n`, `line`, `grid`, `isPlayer(line[ind])`, and the appending operation to `goal[tmp]` remain consistent with the specified rules.
