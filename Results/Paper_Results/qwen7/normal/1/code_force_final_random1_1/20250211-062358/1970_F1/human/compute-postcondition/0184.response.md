Postcondition: `command` is a list of strings. If `len(command)` equals 3, then `command` remains a list of three strings, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`. Additionally, if `el` is equal to '.Q', `allPlayers[obj]` is set to `True`. If `el` is '.S.', `team` is set to 1 and `points[team]` is set to 10. If `el` is neither '.Q' nor '.S.', no changes are made to `allPlayers`, `team`, or `points`. If `len(command)` does not equal 3, then `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`, `obj` is set to '.B', `isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])` is False, and `isPlayer(obj)` is True or `elements['.B']` is not equal to `nxt`. If `com` is 'T' and `goalIn(pos)` is not `-1`, `team` is `team_value` and `points[team]` is incremented by 1.
