Output State: **`command` is a list of strings, `comand` is ('obj', 'com'), `time` is `time` + 1, `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`, `nxt` is (pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1]), `allPlayers[obj]` is False, `team` is the result of goalIn(pos)**

The function `goalIn(pos)` is called with the current position `pos`. The result of this function call is stored in the variable `team`. However, since the exact value of `team` cannot be determined without knowing the implementation of `goalIn(pos)`, we simply state that `team` holds the result of this function call. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
