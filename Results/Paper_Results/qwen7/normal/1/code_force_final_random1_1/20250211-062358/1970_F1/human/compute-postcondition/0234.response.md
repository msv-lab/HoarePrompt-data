Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `time`: This is the previous value of `time` + 1. Since the previous value of `time` is not explicitly given, let's denote it as `prev_time`. Therefore, `time = prev_time + 1`.
   - `command`: An empty list.
   - `obj`: An undefined variable.
   - `com`: An undefined variable.
   - `pos`: Equal to `elements[obj]`. Since `obj` is undefined, `pos` is also undefined.
   - `nxt`: Equal to `pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1]`. Since both `pos` and `com` are undefined, `nxt` is also undefined.
   - `player`: Either `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` is true, otherwise it is `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`. Since both `obj` and `nxt` are undefined, `player` is also undefined.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('%d %s ELIMINATED' % (time, player))
   ```

Given the above breakdown, since `player` is undefined, the print statement will essentially print an undefined value for `player`. However, the format of the print statement suggests that `player` should be a string representing a player who was eliminated.

Since `player` is undefined, the print statement will output a string with the format but without a valid `player` value.

Output: **%d undefined ELIMINATED** (where `%d` is the value of `time` and `undefined` represents the undefined value of `player`)
