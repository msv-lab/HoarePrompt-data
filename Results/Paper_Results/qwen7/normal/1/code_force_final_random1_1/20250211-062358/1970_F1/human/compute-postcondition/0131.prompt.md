Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: elements is a dictionary containing {'.B': (-1, -1)}; (n, m) are positive integers such that 3 ≤ n, m ≤ 99 and both are odd; grid is an empty list; allPlayers is an empty dictionary; goal is a list containing two empty lists; points is [0, 0]
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    line = stdin.readline().strip().split()
    grid.append(line)
    for ind in range(len(line)):
        if line[ind] != '..':
            elements[line[ind]] = i, ind
            if isPlayer(line[ind]):
                allPlayers[line[ind]] = False
            elif line[ind][1] == 'G':
                tmp = 0 if line[ind][0] == 'B' else 1
                goal[tmp].append((i, ind))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The loop has executed all iterations, and the final state of the variables is as follows: `i` is incremented by the sum of the values of `elements[line[ind]]` for each iteration, `ind` is set to the last index processed in the loop, `n` remains an odd integer between 3 and 99 inclusive, `line` is a non-empty list of strings, `grid` is a list containing one element which is the list `line`, `isPlayer(line[ind])` is either `False` or `True` depending on the value of `line[ind]`, and `goal[0]` or `goal[1]` (depending on whether the first character of `line[ind]` is 'B' or not) contains tuples `(i, ind)` for each non-`.` character in `line`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After the loop executes all its iterations, `ind` will be equal to `len(line)`, `i` will still be 0, `n` will remain an odd integer between 3 and 99 inclusive, `line` will be a list of strings read from `stdin`, `grid` will be a list containing two elements where the second element is the list `line`, `elements` will be a dictionary where for every non-`.` character in `line`, the key is the character and the value is a tuple `(i, ind)` where `ind` is the index of the character in `line`. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` is `True`, then `allPlayers[line[ind]]` will be `False`, and if `line[ind][1] == 'G'`, `goal[0]` or `goal[1]` (depending on whether the first character of `line[ind]` is 'B' or not) will contain tuples `(i, ind)` for each non-`.` character in `line`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ind` is equal to `len(line)`, `elements` contains entries for each non-`.` character in `line` with keys being the characters and values being tuples `(i, ind)` where `ind` is the index of the character in `line`. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `True`, then `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is `False`. If `isPlayer(line[ind])` returns `False`, then either `line[ind][1]` is 'G' and `tmp` is 0 if `line[ind][0]` equals 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1, and `goal[tmp]` has appended `(i, ind)`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
