Postcondition: `command` is a list of strings read from stdin, `time` is incremented by 1. If `command` has exactly 3 elements, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, and `el` is the third element of `command`. 

- If `el` equals '.Q', then `allPlayers[obj]` is set to `True`.
- If `el` does not equal '.Q', then `team` is 1 if the first character of `obj` is 'B', otherwise `team` is 0, and `points[team]` is increased by 10.

- If `command` does not have exactly 3 elements, `command` is updated to be `('obj', 'com')`, `time` remains `time + 1`, `pos` is updated to `(pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])`, `elements[obj]` is updated to `nxt`, where `nxt` is the new position after moving in direction `com`. 
- If `obj` is a player and `isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])` is true, or if `obj` is not a player but `elements['.B']` equals `nxt`, then `player` is determined based on whether `obj` is a player or not. Otherwise, `player` is `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`.
- If the command is 'T' and the goalIn(pos) is not -1, then the team corresponding to the goal position has its points incremented by 1.
