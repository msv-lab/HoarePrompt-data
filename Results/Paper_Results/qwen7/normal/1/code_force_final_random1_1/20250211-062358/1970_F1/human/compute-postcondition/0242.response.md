Postcondition: `time` is the previous value of `time` + 1, `command` is an empty list, `obj` is unchanged, `com` is an undefined variable, `pos` is equal to `nxt`, and `nxt` is updated to `pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1]` if the player is identified by `obj`. If the player is not identified, the values of `pos` and `nxt` remain unchanged.
