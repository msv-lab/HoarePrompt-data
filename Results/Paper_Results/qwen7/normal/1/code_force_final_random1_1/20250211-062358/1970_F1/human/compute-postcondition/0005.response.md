Output State: **elements is a dictionary containing {'.B': (-1, -1)}; (n, m) are positive integers such that 3 ≤ n, m ≤ 99 and both are odd; grid is an empty list; allPlayers is an empty dictionary; goal is a list containing two empty lists; points is [0, 0]**.

Explanation: The code initializes the `points` list with `[0, 0]`. No other changes are made to the existing variables or their values. Therefore, the initial conditions for `elements`, `(n, m)`, `grid`, `allPlayers`, and `goal` remain unchanged.
