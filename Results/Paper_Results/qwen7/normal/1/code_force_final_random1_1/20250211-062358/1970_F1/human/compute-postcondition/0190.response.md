Output State: **`command` is a list of strings read from stdin, `time` is incremented by 1, `obj` is the first element of `command`, `com` is the second element of `command`, `el` is the third element of `command`, `team` is 1 if the first character of `obj` is 'B', otherwise `team` is 0.**

This means that the value of `team` is determined based on whether the first character of `obj` is 'B' or not. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
