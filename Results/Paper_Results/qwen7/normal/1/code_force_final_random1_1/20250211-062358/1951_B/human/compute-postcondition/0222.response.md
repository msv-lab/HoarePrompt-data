Postcondition: `i` is an element in `s` such that `i` is not equal to `h`. If `i` is greater than `h`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. If `i` is less than or equal to `h`, then `i` is an integer less than or equal to `h` and not equal to `h`. Additionally, if `z` equals 1, `ans1` is set to 1; otherwise, `ans1` remains unchanged.
