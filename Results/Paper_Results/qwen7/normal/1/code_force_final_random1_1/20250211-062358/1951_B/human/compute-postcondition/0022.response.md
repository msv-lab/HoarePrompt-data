The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 0.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. Since `i` is currently 1, `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to continue executing.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
