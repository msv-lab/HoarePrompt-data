Output State: **`i` is the next element in the list `s`, `j` is increased by 1, `h` is compared to `i`, and `ans` is increased by 1, with `j` being increased by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it breaks out of the loop or conditional block that was checking `h` against `i` and incrementing `ans`. The values of `i`, `j`, `h`, and `ans` remain as they were before the `break` statement, but the program now exits the current loop or conditional block.
