Output State: **`i` is the next element in the list `s`, `j` is increased by 1, `h` is compared to `i`, and `ans` is increased by 1, with `j` being increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `j += 1` increments the value of `j` by 1. All other variables (`i`, `h`, and `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
