Output State: **`s` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is the last element of the original list `s`, `ans1` is the count of elements in `s` that are equal to `h` plus one if the first element was not `h`, `z` is 1 if the last element of the original list `s` is equal to `h`, otherwise `z` remains 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `s = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in the list `s`. The variable `i` is updated to be the last element of the original list `s`. The values of `ans1`, `z`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
