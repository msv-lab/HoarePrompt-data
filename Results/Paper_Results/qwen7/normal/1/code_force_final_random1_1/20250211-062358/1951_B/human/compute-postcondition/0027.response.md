Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, and `ind` is a list containing 1. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `i`, `n`, or `ind`. It only indicates that the program breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it was in. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged from their initial or last known states.
