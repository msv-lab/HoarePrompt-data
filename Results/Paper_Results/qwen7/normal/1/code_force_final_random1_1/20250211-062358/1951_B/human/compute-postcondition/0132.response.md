Output State: **Postcondition: `i` is the first element of the list `s` after the swaps, `s` is the list after the swaps, `i` is not equal to `h`, and the current value of `i` is greater than `h`. We break out of the loop or if statement we were inside.**

The `break` statement is used to exit the loop or conditional block it is within. Since the initial postconditions specify the values of `i`, `s`, and the relationship between `i` and `h`, these conditions remain unchanged after the `break` statement is executed. The only change is that the program breaks out of the loop or conditional block it was in.
