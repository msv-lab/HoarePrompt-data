Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `a`, which is a list of `n` integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows. It returns n minus 1 in some cases, 13 in other cases, 1 less than the first element of the list `ind` in another case, the minimum value between the second element of list `ind` minus 1 and the value of `k` minus 1 when `k` is 14, the maximum value between `ind[0] - 1` and `ind[1] - ind[0]` under specific conditions, and the maximum value between `ind[0] - 1` and `k - ind[0]` under different conditions.**
