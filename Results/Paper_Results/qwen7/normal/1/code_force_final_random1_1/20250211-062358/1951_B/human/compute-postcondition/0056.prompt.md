You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of n integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, where n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and all a_i's are distinct positive integers not exceeding 10^9. The list a is sorted in non-decreasing order.

    x = a[k]

    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] > x:

    #State: The loop will continue to execute as long as there are more elements in the list `a` that have not been checked (i.e., `i < n`), and it will stop when `c` reaches 2 or when all elements in `a` have been checked.
    if (k == 14) :
        print(ind)
        #This is printed: ind (the value of which is determined by the loop conditions and operations within the loop)
    #State: The loop will continue to execute as long as there are more elements in the list `a` that have not been checked (i.e., `i < n`), and it will stop when `c` reaches 2 or when all elements in `a` have been checked. If `k` equals 14, the loop continues under the same conditions. Since there is no else part, the behavior remains unchanged regardless of the value of `k` other than 14.

If `k` equals 14, the loop continues under the same conditions. Additionally, `ind` is not an empty list, and the length of `ind` is exactly 1. The first element of `ind` is not 0.
        if (ind[0] > k) :

#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `a`, which is a list of `n` integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows. It returns n minus 1 in some cases, 13 in other cases, 1 less than the first element of the list `ind` in another case, the minimum value between the second element of list `ind` minus 1 and the value of `k` minus 1 when `k` is 14, the maximum value between `ind[0] - 1` and `ind[1] - ind[0]` under specific conditions, and the maximum value between `ind[0] - 1` and `k - ind[0]` under different conditions.

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns n minus 1

Case_2: The program returns a value which is k (14) minus 1, resulting in 13.
