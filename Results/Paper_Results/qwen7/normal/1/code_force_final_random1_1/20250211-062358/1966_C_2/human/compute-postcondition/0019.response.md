Output State: **`tc` must be at least 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `n` is the length of `arr` minus 1, `arr` is a list of unique integers in descending order followed by 0, `dp` is True, `arr` is updated from user input.**

Explanation: The line `dp = True` sets the variable `dp` to the boolean value `True`. All other variables (`tc`, `i`, `n`, `arr`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
