Output State: **`tc` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `n` is an input integer, `dp` is True, `arr` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order followed by 0.**

Explanation: The line `dp = True` sets the variable `dp` to `True`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
