Output State: `dp` is a boolean value determined by the condition `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1` or the negation of the previous value of `dp` for every `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1`, inclusive; `i` is now `n`; `n` is the final length of `arr` minus 1; `tc` must be at least 1; `arr` is updated from user input.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `dp` will hold the result of applying the condition `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1` or the negation of the previous `dp` value for each `i` from 1 to `n-1`. The variable `i` will be equal to `n`, `n` will be the length of `arr` minus 1, and `tc` will still be at least 1. The array `arr` remains as it was updated from user input.
