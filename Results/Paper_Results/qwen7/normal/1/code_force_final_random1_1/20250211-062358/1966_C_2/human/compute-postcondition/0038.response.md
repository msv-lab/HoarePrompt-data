Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial conditions at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `dp` is a boolean value based on the condition `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1`.
   - `i` is at least 1.
   - `n` is at least 1.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time it runs, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is at least 1 (let's assume it was 1 before the first iteration, and now it is 1).
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. Therefore, `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - `n` remains the same since the loop does not change its value.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `dp` remains unchanged because the loop body is omitted, and there is no operation that updates `dp`.
   - `i` is incremented to 2.
   - `n` remains at least 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**`dp` is a boolean value based on the condition `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1`, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 1**.

So, the final answer is:

State: **`dp` is a boolean value based on the condition `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1`, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 1**
