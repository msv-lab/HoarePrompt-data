Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `dp` is a boolean value based on the condition `arr[2] - arr[3] > 1` or not `dp`.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` is at least 1.

4. **Update the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 3.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must remain at least 1 (since it was already at least 1 and no changes were made to it in the loop body).

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `dp` remains unchanged because the loop body is omitted and no operations affecting `dp` are mentioned.
   - `i` is incremented to 3.
   - `n` remains at least 1.

Therefore, the updated states for the next iteration are:

State: **`dp` is a boolean value based on the condition `arr[2] - arr[3] > 1` or not `dp`, `i` is 3, `n` is at least 1**
