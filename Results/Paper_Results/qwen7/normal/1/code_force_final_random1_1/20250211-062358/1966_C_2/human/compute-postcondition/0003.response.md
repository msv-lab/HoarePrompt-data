Output State: **`tc` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers in descending order with 0 appended as the last element.**

Explanation: The code first takes an input of integers separated by spaces, converts them into a list of integers, removes duplicates using `set()`, sorts the list in descending order using `sorted()` with `reverse=True`, and finally appends `0` to the list. The initial value of `tc` and `n` remains unchanged. The resulting list `arr` contains unique integers from the input in descending order followed by `0`.
