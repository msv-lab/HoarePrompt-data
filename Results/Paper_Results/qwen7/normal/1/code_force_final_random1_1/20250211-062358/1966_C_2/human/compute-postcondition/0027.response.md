Output State: `dp` will be a boolean value determined by the condition `arr[n-1] - arr[n] > 1` or not the value of `dp` after the last iteration; `i` will be equal to `n`; `n` will be at least 2.

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `dp` will hold a boolean value that is either `arr[n-1] - arr[n] > 1` or the negation of the `dp` value from the previous iteration. The variable `i` will be set to `n`, and `n` will be at least 2.
