Output State: `dp` is `arr[n-1] - arr[n] > 1 or not dp`, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is at least 1.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n-1` because the loop increments `i` starting from 1 up to `n-1`. The final value of `dp` will be determined by the condition `arr[n-1] - arr[n] > 1` combined with the previous value of `dp` using the logical OR operation. The other variables (`tc`, `n`, `arr`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
