Output State: **`tc` is an input integer, and the initial conditions for `t`, `n`, and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `tc = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `tc`. It does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial conditions specified in the initial state.
