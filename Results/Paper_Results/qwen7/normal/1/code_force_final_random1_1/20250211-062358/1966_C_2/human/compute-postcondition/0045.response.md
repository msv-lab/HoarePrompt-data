Output State: **`tc` is reduced by 1, `dp` will be the result of evaluating the condition `arr[n-1] - arr[n] > 1` or not `dp`, `i` will be `n-1`, `n` remains at least 1.**

Explanation: The code `tc -= 1` decrements the value of `tc` by 1. The values of `dp`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged from their previous states. Therefore, `dp` still holds the final boolean value determined by evaluating the condition `arr[n-1] - arr[n] > 1` or the negation of the previous value of `dp`. The variable `i` is still set to `n-1`, and `n` remains at least 1.
