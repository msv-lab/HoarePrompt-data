Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.
2. The function `func_1` processes the commands in the string `s` and constructs the list `b` by appending elements from `a` based on whether the command is 'L' or 'R'.
3. The function then computes the running product of the elements in `b` modulo `m` and stores intermediate results in the list `ans`.
4. The final step is to return the reversed list `ans`, which contains the required outputs in the correct order.

Given the problem description and the annotated program, the function `func_1` correctly implements the specified behavior. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
