Output State: **`i` is either 1 or 2; `n` must be at least 2; `b` is a list with one additional element from `a[r]` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code snippet `b.append(a[r])` appends an element from the list `a` at index `r` to the list `b`. However, the initial state does not provide any specific values for `a` or `r`, nor does it specify what `b` is initially. Therefore, the only thing we can conclude is that `b` now contains one more element than it did before, specifically the element from `a[r]`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
