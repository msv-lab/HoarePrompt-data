Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for v in reversed(b):`. The only variable mentioned here is `v`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `v`**: Since `v` is being assigned from the reversed version of `b`, the value of `v` will be one of the elements in `b` but in reverse order.

3. **Initial state of `b`**: The problem states that `b` is a list containing exactly `n` elements, each element in `b` will either be `a[l]` or `a[r]` based on the corresponding character in `s`. This means `b` is already defined and contains the necessary elements.

4. **Loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in `b` to iterate over. Since `b` is a list of length `n`, the loop will run `n` times, with `v` taking on each value in `b` in reverse order.

5. **Adjusting the states**: We need to ensure that `b` is correctly defined and contains the necessary elements. The initial state of `v` will be the last element of `b` because it is being iterated in reverse order.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `b` should be a list of length `n` containing the correct elements.
- `v` should be initialized to the last element of `b` (since the loop iterates in reverse).

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be:

**State: **`b` is a list of length `n` containing the correct elements, `v` is the last element of `b`**.
