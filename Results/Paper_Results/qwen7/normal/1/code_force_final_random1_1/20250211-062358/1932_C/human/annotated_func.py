#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a list of integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^4], and s is a string consisting of 'L' and 'R' characters with length n.
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'L':
            b.append(a[l])
            l += 1
        else:
            b.append(a[r])
            r -= 1
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, `b` will be a list containing exactly `n` elements. Each element in `b` will either be `a[l]` or `a[r]` based on the corresponding character in `s`. If the character in `s` at index `i` is 'L', then `b[i]` will be `a[l]` and `l` will be incremented. If the character in `s` at index `i` is 'R', then `b[i]` will be `a[r]` and `r` will be decremented. The final values of `l` and `r` will be such that `l` is less than or equal to `r`, and both will be within their valid ranges as defined initially.
    ans = []
    p = 1
    for v in reversed(b):
        p = p * v % m
        
        ans.append(p)
        
    #State: `p` is the product of all elements in `b` modulo `m`; `ans` is a list containing all intermediate values of `p` computed during each iteration of the loop in reverse order.
    return reversed(ans)
    #The program returns a reversed list `ans` which contains all intermediate values of `p` computed during each iteration of the loop in reverse order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `m` (a positive integer), `a` (a list of integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^4]), and `s` (a string consisting of 'L' and 'R' characters with length `n`). It constructs a new list `b` by iterating through `s` and appending elements from `a` based on whether the character is 'L' or 'R'. Then, it computes a running product of the elements in `b` modulo `m`, storing intermediate results in a list `ans`. Finally, it returns a reversed list `ans` containing these intermediate results.
