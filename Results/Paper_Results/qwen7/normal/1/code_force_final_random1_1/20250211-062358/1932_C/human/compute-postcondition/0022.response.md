Output State: **`i` is either 1 or 2; `n` must be at least 2; the variable `b` has been appended with the value of `a[l]`; `l` is increased by 1.**

The code `l += 1` increments the value of `l` by 1. Since `i` is either 1 or 2 and `n` must be at least 2, these conditions remain unchanged. The action of appending the value of `a[l]` to `b` also remains valid, but the specific value of `b` is not provided, so it is mentioned that `b` has been appended with the value of `a[l]`. The only change is that `l` is now one more than its previous value.
