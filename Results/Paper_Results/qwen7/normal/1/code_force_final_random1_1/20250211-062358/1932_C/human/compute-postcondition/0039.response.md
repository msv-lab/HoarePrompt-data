Output State: **`ans` now contains the value of `p` appended, `p` is updated to `p * v % m` where `v` is the next value from `reversed(b)`**

Explanation: The code `ans.append(p)` appends the current value of `p` to the list `ans`. After this operation, `p` is updated to `p * v % m`, where `v` is the next value from `reversed(b)`. The initial state of `ans` containing the value of `p` appended is maintained, and `p` is updated according to the given formula.
