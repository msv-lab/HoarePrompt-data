Output State: `p` will be the product of all elements in `b` (each element raised to its respective position's inverse in the reversed order) modulo `m`; `ans` will be a list containing all intermediate values of `p` calculated during each iteration of the loop, starting from the first iteration up to the last one, with each value being the result of `p * v % m` where `v` is the current element from `reversed(b)`.
