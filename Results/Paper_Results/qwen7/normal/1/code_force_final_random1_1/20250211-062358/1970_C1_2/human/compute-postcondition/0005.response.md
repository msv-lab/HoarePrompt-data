Output State: **`x` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `lst[a]` now contains the additional element `b`**.

Explanation: The code appends the value of `b` to the list at index `a` in the list `lst`. Since `a` and `b` are input integers, their values remain unchanged. However, the list `lst` at index `a` now includes the new element `b`. The conditions and values of `x` and the nature of `a` and `b` remain as they were initially.
