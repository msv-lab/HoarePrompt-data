Output State: **`x` must be greater than 0; `a` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer; `a, b` are updated to new integer values from input; `rev[b]` now contains the additional element `a`.**

Explanation: The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `a` and `b` respectively. The initial conditions that `x` must be greater than 0 and `rev[b]` contains the additional element `a` remain unchanged, but the specific values of `a` and `b` are updated based on the input.
