Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Postcondition: `queue` is updated to remove the first element, `current` is the first element of the original `queue`, and `dist` is the second element of the original `queue`. If `current` equals `target`, the function returns the second element of the original queue (stored in `dist`). Otherwise, the function does not return anything.
Code of the loop:
for neighbor in tree[current]:
    if neighbor not in visited:
        visited.add(neighbor)
        queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `queue` now contains the tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`, `current` is the first element of the original `queue`, `dist` is the second element of the original `queue`, `tree[current]` must contain at least one element, `neighbor` is a neighbor of `current` and is not in `visited`, `visited` now includes the `neighbor`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `queue` now contains the tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` added to its end, `current` remains the next neighbor of the original `current` in `tree[current]`, `dist` remains the distance corresponding to the new `current`, `tree[current]` must contain at least one element, `neighbor` is the next neighbor of `current` and is not in `visited`, `visited` now includes the `neighbor`, `neighbor` is added to `visited`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `queue` now contains the tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` added to its end, `current` remains the next neighbor of the original `current` in `tree[current]`, `dist` remains the distance corresponding to the new `current`, `tree[current]` must contain at least one element, `neighbor` is the next neighbor of `current` and is not in `visited`, `visited` now includes the `neighbor`, `neighbor` is added to `visited`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
