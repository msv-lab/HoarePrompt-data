Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `start` and `target`. `start` is an integer representing the starting node where the stone is initially placed, and `target` is an integer representing one of the leaves of the tree. The function returns 0 if the target is not reachable from the start. If the target is reached, it returns the second element of the original queue, which is stored in the variable `dist`. If the function finds the distance `dist` from the original starting node to the current node, it returns that distance. If no valid path is found, it returns -1.**
