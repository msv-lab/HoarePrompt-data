Output State: All nodes in the tree that are reachable from the starting node are visited, and the `queue` contains tuples of all these nodes along with their respective distances from the starting node. The `visited` set includes every node that has been processed, ensuring no node is visited more than once. The `queue` is filled with nodes to be processed next, each paired with its distance from the starting node, incrementing by 1 for each level of depth.

This final state represents a breadth-first search traversal of the tree, where the `queue` will eventually be empty when all reachable nodes have been processed, and the `visited` set contains all unique nodes in the tree that can be reached from the starting node.
