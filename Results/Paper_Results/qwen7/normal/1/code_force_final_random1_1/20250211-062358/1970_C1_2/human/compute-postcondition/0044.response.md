Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but seems to operate based on predefined constraints where n is an integer between 2 and 2Ã—10^5, t is 1, u and v are integers between 1 and n, and there is a list of starting nodes containing exactly one integer between 1 and n. The function returns information based on these predefined conditions.**

This means the function does not take any parameters through its definition but works under specific conditions regarding the variables `n`, `t`, `u`, `v`, and a list of starting nodes, and provides output based on these conditions.
