Output State: **`tree[current]` is not empty, `neighbor` is not in `visited`; `visited` includes the `neighbor`.**

The code `visited.add(neighbor)` adds the `neighbor` to the set `visited`. This means that after the execution, `neighbor` is now part of the `visited` set. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
