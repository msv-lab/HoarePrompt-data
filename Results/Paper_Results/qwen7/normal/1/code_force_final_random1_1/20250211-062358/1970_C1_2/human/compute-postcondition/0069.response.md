Output State: All nodes in the tree that are reachable from the starting node have been visited, and their distances from the starting node are stored in the `queue`. Specifically, each element in the `queue` is a tuple containing a node and its distance from the starting node. The `visited` set contains all nodes that have been processed, ensuring no node is visited more than once.

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, every node in the subtree rooted at the starting node has been explored, and the `queue` contains the distance information for all these nodes. The `visited` set is complete, indicating that no node was revisited during the traversal.
