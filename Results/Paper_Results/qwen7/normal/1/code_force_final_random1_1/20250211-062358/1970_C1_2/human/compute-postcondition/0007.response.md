The only objects in the loop head are variables `_` (which is just a placeholder), `x`, `a`, and `b`. Since `_` is just a placeholder and does not affect the loop condition, we only need to focus on `x`, `a`, and `b`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `x` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer.
- `rev[b]` now contains the additional element `a`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be greater than 0 (since `x - 1` was the number of iterations completed).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`x` must be greater than 0; `a` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer; `rev[b]` now contains the additional element `a`.**
