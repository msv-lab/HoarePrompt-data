Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `neighbor` and `current`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are neighbors in `tree[current]` that have not been visited.

3. **State at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `tree[current]` is not empty.
   - If `neighbor` is not in `visited`, then `neighbor` is added to `visited` and `queue` includes `(neighbor, dist + 1)`.

4. **Determine the state adjustments needed**:
   - Since `neighbor` is a variable that changes during each iteration, it needs to be updated.
   - `current` remains the same unless explicitly changed outside the loop, but since the loop is iterating over `tree[current]`, `current` does not change within the loop.
   - `visited` and `queue` are updated based on the value of `neighbor`, so they need to reflect the new state after processing `neighbor`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - After processing a `neighbor`, `neighbor` is no longer in `tree[current]` because it has been visited.
   - `visited` now includes the newly added `neighbor`.
   - `queue` includes `(neighbor, dist + 1)`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `neighbor` has been processed and removed from `tree[current]`, and `visited` and `queue` have been updated accordingly.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`tree[current]` is not empty (excluding the previously processed `neighbor`), `visited` includes the previously processed `neighbor`, `queue` includes `(neighbor, dist + 1)`**
