You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vasya has two hobbies — adding permutations^{\dagger} to arrays and finding
the most frequently occurring element. Recently, he found an array a and
decided to find out the maximum number of elements equal to the same number in
the array a that he can obtain after adding some permutation to the array a .

More formally, Vasya must choose exactly one permutation p_1, p_2, p_3,
\ldots, p_n of length n , and then change the elements of the array a
according to the rule a_i := a_i + p_i . After that, Vasya counts how many
times each number occurs in the array a and takes the maximum of these values.
You need to determine the maximum value he can obtain.

^{\dagger} A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then
follows the description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the maximum number of elements
equal to the same number after the operation of adding a permutation.

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal to choose p = [2, 1] . Then after
applying the operation, the array a will be [3, 3] , in which the number 3
occurs twice, so the answer is 2 .

In the second test case, one of the optimal options is p = [2, 3, 1, 4] .
After applying the operation, the array a will be [9, 4, 5, 5] . Since the
number 5 occurs twice, the answer is 2 .

    return ans



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 9 : The function accepts a list of positive integers `arr` and returns a list `ans` containing all intermediate products of the cumulative product of elements in `arr`, calculated from the end to the beginning. After processing, the index `i` is set to -1 and the variable `tem` holds the product of all elements in `arr`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - We need to find the maximum frequency of any element in the array `a` after rearranging its elements using a permutation `p`.
   - The goal is to maximize the count of the most frequent element in the transformed array.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - Adding a permutation `p` to the array `a` means we can rearrange the elements of `a` in any order.
   - To maximize the frequency of any element, we should try to group as many identical elements together as possible.

3. **Analysis of Provided Functions**:
   - The functions provided (`func_1`, `func_2`, etc.) are utility functions for reading input data, but they do not contribute to solving the problem directly.
   - The core logic for solving the problem is missing in the provided code.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - Count the frequency of each element in the original array.
   - Determine the maximum frequency among these counts.
   - Check if it's possible to achieve this frequency by rearranging the elements.

5. **Implementation**:
   - Read the input values.
   - Count the frequency of each element.
   - Find the maximum frequency.
   - Check if it's possible to achieve this frequency by rearranging the elements (this is always possible since we can permute the array).

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not contain the necessary logic to solve the problem. It only provides utility functions for reading input data but lacks the actual algorithm to compute the required result.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Suggested Solution:
Here is a correct implementation of the solution:

```python
def max_frequency_after_permutation(arr):
    from collections import Counter
    
    # Count the frequency of each element in the array
    freq = Counter(arr)
    
    # Find the maximum frequency
    max_freq = max(freq.values())
    
    # Check if we can achieve this frequency by rearranging the elements
    # This is always possible since we can permute the array
    return max_freq

# Reading input
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    print(max_frequency_after_permutation(arr))
```

This solution correctly reads the input, counts the frequencies, and outputs the maximum frequency achievable by rearranging the elements.
