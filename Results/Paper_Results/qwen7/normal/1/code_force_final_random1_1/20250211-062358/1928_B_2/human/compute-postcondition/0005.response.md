Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `arr`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `len(arr) - 1` down to `0` with a step of `-1`. This means `i` starts at `len(arr) - 1` and decreases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `0`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `arr` is a list of positive integers that must have at least one element.
   - `i` is `len(arr) - 1`.
   - `tem` is the product of all elements in `arr`.
   - `ans` is a list containing the value `tem`.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `i` is currently `len(arr) - 1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will become `len(arr) - 2`.

5. **Adjust the other variables**:
   - The variable `tem` remains unchanged because the product of all elements in `arr` does not change within the loop.
   - The variable `ans` remains unchanged because it already contains the product of all elements in `arr`.

6. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `arr` remains a list of positive integers with at least one element.
   - `i` is now `len(arr) - 2`.
   - `tem` remains the product of all elements in `arr`.
   - `ans` remains a list containing the value `tem`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`arr` is a list of positive integers that must have at least one element, `i` is `len(arr) - 2`, `tem` is the product of all elements in `arr`, `ans` is a list containing the value `tem`**.
