Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of positive integers. It processes each element of `arr` from the end to the beginning, maintaining a running product (`tem`) of all elements. For each element, it appends the current value of `tem` to a list `ans`. After processing all elements, it returns the list `ans`, with `i` set to -1 and `tem` being the product of all elements in `arr`.**
