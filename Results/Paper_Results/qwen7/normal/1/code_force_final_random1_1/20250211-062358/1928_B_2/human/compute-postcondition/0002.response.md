Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i`, `len(arr) - 1`, and `-1`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` set to `len(arr) - 1`. This is because the loop iterates in reverse order from the last index of `arr` to the first index (0).

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0. If `i` becomes less than 0, the loop terminates.

4. **List the objects that need adjustment**: The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `len(arr) - 1`. However, since `len(arr)` is a property of the list `arr`, and `arr` itself is not directly modified within the loop head, we focus on `i`.

5. **Adjust the state**: To ensure the loop can execute, `i` must start at a value that is greater than or equal to 0. Since `i` starts at `len(arr) - 1`, this value must be non-negative, meaning `arr` must have at least one element.

6. **Final state**: The state of `tem` and `ans` is not relevant to the loop execution, so they remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`arr` is a list of positive integers that must have at least one element, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, `tem` is 1, `ans` is an empty list**.
