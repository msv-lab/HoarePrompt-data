You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of positive integers.
def func_9(arr):
    ans = []
    tem = 1
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1):
        tem *= arr[i]
        
        ans.append(tem)
        
    #State: Output State: `arr` is a list of positive integers, `i` is `-1`, `tem` is the product of all elements in `arr`, `ans` is a list containing all intermediate products of `tem` as each element of `arr` is processed from the end to the beginning.
    #
    #To explain this output state in natural language:
    #After the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be set to `-1` because the loop runs in reverse from `len(arr) - 1` down to `0`. The variable `tem` will hold the product of all elements in the list `arr`, as it multiplies each element of `arr` in sequence during the loop. The list `ans` will contain all the intermediate values of `tem` after each iteration, starting from the product of all elements down to the product of all but the last element of `arr`.
    return ans
    #`ans` is a list containing all intermediate products of `tem` as each element of `arr` is processed from the end to the beginning, `i` is -1, and `tem` is the product of all elements in `arr`
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of positive integers. It processes each element of `arr` from the end to the beginning, maintaining a running product (`tem`) of all elements. For each element, it appends the current value of `tem` to a list `ans`. After processing all elements, it returns the list `ans`, with `i` set to -1 and `tem` being the product of all elements in `arr`.

```

Return Postconditions: `ans` is a list containing all intermediate products of `tem` as each element of `arr` is processed from the end to the beginning, `i` is -1, and `tem` is the product of all elements in `arr`


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
