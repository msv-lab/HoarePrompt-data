Output State: **`arr` is a list of positive integers that must have at least one element, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, `tem` is the product of all elements in `arr`, `ans` is a list containing the value `tem`.**

Explanation: The code `ans.append(tem)` appends the value of `tem` (which is the product of all elements in `arr`) to the list `ans`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `ans` becomes a list containing the single element `tem`.
