Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the value entered by the user as a string, `b` is the value entered via input()**

Explanation: The variable `b` is assigned the value entered via the `input()` function. Since no specific value is provided, `b` will hold the string input by the user. The other variables (`t`, `n`, and `a`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
