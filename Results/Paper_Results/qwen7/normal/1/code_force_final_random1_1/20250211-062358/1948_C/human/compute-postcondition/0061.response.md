Output State: The loop will continue to execute as long as `n` remains an odd number greater than or equal to the current value of `i`. After all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n-1` because the loop increments `i` by 2 each time and stops when `i` reaches `n`.

If during any iteration, the condition `i + 1 < n and (a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<')` is met, the loop will break and print 'No'. If the loop completes all iterations without breaking, it will print 'Yes'.

In summary, after all iterations of the loop have finished, if the loop did not break due to the condition being met, the output will be 'Yes'. Otherwise, if the condition was met at any point, the output will be 'No'. The variables `n`, `a`, and `b` will retain their final values from the last iteration of the loop, and `i` will be equal to `n-1`.
