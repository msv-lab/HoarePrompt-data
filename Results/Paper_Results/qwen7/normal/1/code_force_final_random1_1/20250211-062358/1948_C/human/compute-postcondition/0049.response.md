Output State: **`n` must be at least 1 and an odd number, `i` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or condition.**

The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the condition specified, but does not change the values of `n` or `i`. The precondition that `n` must be at least 1 and an odd number, and the condition involving `i` remains unchanged.
