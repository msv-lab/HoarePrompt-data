Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

    >><<><
    
    ><>>><

Output

    YES
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and n is even; each test case consists of two strings of length n, where each character in the strings is either '<' or '>' representing the direction of the arrow in each cell of the respective row of the grid.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
                print('No')
                break
        else:
            print('yes')
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will execute for all odd numbers from 1 up to (but not including) `n`. After all iterations, if the loop completes without breaking, the output will be 'yes'. If the loop breaks due to the condition `i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` being true at any point, the output will be 'No'. The final value of `n` will be the last odd number processed by the loop, `i` will be equal to `n - 1`, and the strings `a` and `b` will retain their original values from the last input provided to the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two strings of length n, where each character is either '<' or '>'. For each test case, it checks if there exists an index i (where i is an odd number less than n) such that the character at index i in the first string matches the character at either index i+1 or i-1 in the second string and both are '<'. If such an index is found, it prints 'No' and stops processing further. If no such index is found after checking all valid indices, it prints 'Yes'. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.
