Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    for i in range(1, n, 2):
        if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
            print('No')
            break
    else:
        print('yes')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: The loop will execute for all odd numbers from 1 up to (but not including) `n`. If at any point during the loop, the condition `i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` is true, the loop will break and print 'No'. If the loop completes without breaking, it will print 'Yes'.

In the final output state, if the loop completes all its iterations without breaking, the output will be 'Yes'. If the loop breaks due to the condition being met at any iteration, the output will be 'No'. The values of `n`, `i`, `step`, `a`, and `b` will reflect the last state of the loop before printing the result.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `t` is 0, `n` is an integer such that it is at least 3, `a` is an input string, `b` is the input string from the user, and the loop has either printed 'No' and exited due to the condition being met at some point, or printed 'yes' if no break statements were executed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `n` must be at least 5 and an odd number, `i` is equal to `n-1`. The variable `t` remains 0, and the strings `a` and `b` remain as they were initially input by the user. If the loop completes without breaking (i.e., none of the conditions `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` are met for any `i`), the final output will be 'yes'. If any of these conditions are met for any `i`, the loop will break and the output will be 'No'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
