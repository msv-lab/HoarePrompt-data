Output State: **Postcondition: `t` is 0, `n` is an integer such that it is at least 3, `a` is an input string, `b` is the input string from the user, and the loop has either printed 'No' and exited due to the condition being met at some point, or printed 'yes' if no break statements were executed.**

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the value of `t` remains 0 as it was not modified within the loop. The variable `n` must be at least 3 because the loop starts from 1 and increments by 2, meaning the smallest possible value for `n` to allow even one iteration is 3. The strings `a` and `b` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop. The loop will either print 'No' and exit early if the specified condition (`i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`) is met for any `i`, or it will print 'yes' if the loop completes without finding such a condition.
