Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i`, `n`, and the range function parameters (which depend on `n`).

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `t` is 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is the input string from the user.
   - `b` is the input string from the user.
   - `b` is updated to the new input string from the user.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop `for i in range(1, n, 2)` will execute if `n` is at least 1 and is an odd number because the range starts at 1 and increments by 2.

4. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - `t` is not directly involved in the loop condition, so it does not need to be adjusted.
   - `n` must be at least 1 and an odd number for the loop to execute.
   - `i` will start at 1 and increment by 2, so before the loop starts, `i` should be 1.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` and `i`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` must be at least 1 and an odd number, `i` is 1**
