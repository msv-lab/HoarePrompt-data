#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers representing the initial number of stones in each pile, and the length of arr (n) satisfies 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. Each integer in arr (a_i) satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9.
def func_1(arr):
    A = False
    if (arr[0] != 1) :
        return 'Alice'
        #The program returns 'Alice'
    #State: `A` is False, and the first element of `arr` is 1
    set_ = list(set(arr))
    set_.sort()
    not_c = True
    for i in range(1, len(set_)):
        if set_[i] - set_[i - 1] > 1:
            not_c = False
            break
        
        A = not A
        
    #State: Output State: `not_c` is False, `A` is True, `i` is 5.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop continues to increment `i` until the condition `set_[i] - set_[i - 1] > 1` is met or the loop completes all iterations. Given that `not_c` becomes False after the first iteration when the condition is met, it remains False throughout the rest of the loop. The variable `A` alternates between True and False with each iteration of the loop. Since the loop runs from `i=1` to `i=len(set_)`, and we know the loop executed up to `i=3` in the given states, it will continue to the end. With `i` starting from 1 and incrementing by 1 each iteration, after 4 more iterations (from 4 to 5), the loop will finish. Therefore, `A` will be True after the 5th iteration because it alternates and started as True.
    if not_c :
        A = not A
    #State: Postcondition: `not_c` is False, `A` is True, `i` is 5. If `not_c` is False, then `A` alternates between True and False with each iteration, starting from True, and `i` increments from 1 to 5. After 5 iterations, `A` is True and `i` is 5.
    return 'Alice' if A else 'Bob'
    #The program returns 'Alice'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `arr`, representing the initial number of stones in each pile. It checks if the first element of `arr` is 1. If not, it returns 'Alice'. Otherwise, it creates a sorted list of unique elements from `arr`. It then iterates through this list to check if any two consecutive elements have a difference greater than 1. If such a pair is found, it sets `not_c` to False. The variable `A` alternates between True and False with each iteration. Finally, based on the value of `A`, it returns either 'Alice' or 'Bob'. In all cases, the function returns 'Alice'.
