Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of piles `n` and the sizes of the piles `arr`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function takes an array `arr` as input and determines the winner.
   - It checks if the smallest pile has more than one stone. If so, it directly returns "Alice".
   - Otherwise, it creates a sorted list of unique pile sizes (`set_`).
   - It then iterates through the sorted unique pile sizes to check if the difference between consecutive pile sizes is exactly 1. If any difference is greater than 1, it sets `not_c` to `False`.
   - It toggles the boolean variable `A` based on the parity of the number of piles with consecutive sizes.
   - Finally, it returns "Alice" if `A` is `True`, otherwise "Bob".

### Correctness Check:

1. **Initial Condition:**
   - If the smallest pile has more than one stone, Alice can always reduce all piles to 1 stone and then Bob will be forced to make the smallest pile empty, thus losing. Hence, "Alice" should be returned immediately in this case.

2. **Consecutive Pile Sizes:**
   - The logic for checking if the pile sizes are consecutive (with differences of exactly 1) and toggling `A` based on the parity of such piles is correct.
   - If the pile sizes are consecutive, the game is essentially a Nim game with a single pile, and the winner depends on the parity of the number of such piles.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where the smallest pile has more than one stone.
   - The logic for determining the winner based on the parity of consecutive piles is sound.

### Example Verification:

- **Example 1:** 
  - Input: `3 3 3 3 3`
  - Output: `Alice` (Correct, Alice can reduce all piles to 1 stone and force Bob to lose.)
- **Example 2:**
  - Input: `1 7`
  - Output: `Bob` (Correct, Alice can only reduce the pile to 1 stone, and Bob can then reduce it to 0, forcing Alice to lose.)

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
