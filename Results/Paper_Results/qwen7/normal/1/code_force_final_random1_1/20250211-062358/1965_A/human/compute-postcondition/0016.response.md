Output State: **`not_c` is False, `A` is True, `i` is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `not_c`, `A`, and `i`. It only breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such block is specified in the given code, the variables retain their initial values.
