Output State: **`i` is 1, `t` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object created from the integers split from the new input string, `lis` is a sorted list of unique elements from `l`, `j` is set based on the conditions involving `lis`, and `test` is True since no pair of consecutive elements in `lis` has a difference greater than 1.**

Explanation: The code `l = map(int, input().split())` takes a new input string, splits it into individual strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer, and creates a map object `l` from these integers. The initial values of `i`, `t`, `n`, `lis`, `j`, and `test` remain unchanged. The `test` variable remains True because the conditions involving `lis` have not yet been evaluated.
