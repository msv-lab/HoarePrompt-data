Output State: **`i` is 1, `t` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object created from the integers split from the new input string, `lis` is a sorted list of unique elements from `l`, `j` is set based on the conditions involving `lis`, and `test` is True since no pair of consecutive elements in `lis` has a difference greater than 1.**

Explanation: The code `lis = sorted(set(l))` first removes duplicate elements from the map object `l` using `set(l)`, and then sorts the resulting set into a list `lis`. The values of `i`, `t`, `n`, `l`, `j`, and `test` remain unchanged from their initial states. The `test` variable remains `True` because the condition for `test` (no pair of consecutive elements in `lis` having a difference greater than 1) is still satisfied.
