Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is explicitly stated to be 1.
- `lis` is a sorted list of unique elements from `l` that must have more than one element.
- The difference between the current element `lis[j]` and the previous element `lis[j - 1]` is greater than or equal to 1.

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('Alice')
```

This statement will print the string `'Alice'`.

Output: **Alice**
