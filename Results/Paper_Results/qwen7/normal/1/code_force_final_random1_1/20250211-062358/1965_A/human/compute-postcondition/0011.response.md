Postcondition: `not_c` is True, `A` is False, `i` is 1, and `set_` remains a sorted list containing the unique elements of `arr` starting from the first element which is 1, and `set_` must contain at least 2 elements. If `set_[i] - set_[i - 1] > 1`, then `not_c` becomes False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
