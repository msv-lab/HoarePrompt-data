Postcondition: `not_c` is True, `A` is True, `i` is 2, and if the element at index `i` in `set_` minus the element at index `i-1` in `set_` is greater than 1, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not met, the values of `not_c`, `A`, and `i` remain unchanged.
