Postcondition: `i` is 1, `t` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object created from the integers split from the new input string, `lis` is a sorted list of unique elements from `l` that must have at least 2 elements, `j` is 2, and `test` remains False if `lis[2] - lis[1] > 1`, otherwise `test` remains True. If `lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1`, then `test` becomes False and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.
