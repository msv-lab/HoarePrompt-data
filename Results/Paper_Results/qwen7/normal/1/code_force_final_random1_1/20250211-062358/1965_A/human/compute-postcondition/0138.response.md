Postcondition: **The loop has executed all its iterations. The value of `j` is the length of `lis` minus 1, `lis` remains a sorted list of unique elements from `l`, `test` is still False, indicating that no condition `lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1` was met during the loop's execution. Additionally, the length of `lis` is odd in the if part and even in the else part.**
