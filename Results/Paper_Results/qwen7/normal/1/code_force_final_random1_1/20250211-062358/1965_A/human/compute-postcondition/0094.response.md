Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `t` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object created from the integers split from the new input string, `lis` is a sorted list of unique elements from `l`. If `1` is not in `lis` or `len(lis) == 1`, then `j` is set based on the conditions involving `lis` and `test` remains True. Otherwise, `lis` must have at least 3 elements, `j` is set to 3, and `test` is set to False.**
