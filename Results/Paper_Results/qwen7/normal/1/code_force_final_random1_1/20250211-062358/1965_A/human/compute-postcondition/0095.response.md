Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(t)`. The only variable here is `i`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i < t`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `t` is an input integer
   - `n` is an input integer (not relevant for the loop condition)
   - `l` is a map object created from the integers split from the new input string (not relevant for the loop condition)
   - `lis` is a sorted list of unique elements from `l` (not relevant for the loop condition)
   - `test` is a boolean value (not relevant for the loop condition)

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1 and the loop continues as long as `i < t`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will be 2.

5. **Final state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `t` remains the same (unchanged)
   - `n` remains the same (unchanged)
   - `l` remains the same (unchanged)
   - `lis` remains the same (unchanged)
   - `test` remains the same (unchanged)

Based on the above reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is 2, `t` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object created from the integers split from the new input string, `lis` is a sorted list of unique elements from `l`, `test` remains the same**
