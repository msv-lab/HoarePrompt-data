Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `t`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i < t`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `t` is an input integer.
   - `n` is an integer input by the user.
   - `l` is a map object created from the integers split from the input string.
   - `lis` is a sorted list of unique elements from `l`.
   - `j` is set based on certain conditions involving `lis`.
   - `test` is `True` if no pair of consecutive elements in `lis` has a difference greater than 1.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 0, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented to 1.
   - The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is an input integer and not modified within the loop.
   - The values of `n`, `l`, `lis`, `j`, and `test` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop head variables.

5. **New State at the Start of the Next Iteration**:
   - `i` is now 1.
   - `t` remains the same (an input integer).
   - `n` remains the same (an integer input by the user).
   - `l` remains the same (a map object created from the integers split from the input string).
   - `lis` remains the same (a sorted list of unique elements from `l`).
   - `j` remains the same (set based on the conditions involving `lis`).
   - `test` remains `True` (since no pair of consecutive elements in `lis` has a difference greater than 1).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `t` is an input integer, `n` is an integer input by the user, `l` is a map object created from the integers split from the input string, `lis` is a sorted list of unique elements from `l`, `j` is set based on the conditions involving `lis`, and `test` is `True` since no pair of consecutive elements in `lis` has a difference greater than 1.**
