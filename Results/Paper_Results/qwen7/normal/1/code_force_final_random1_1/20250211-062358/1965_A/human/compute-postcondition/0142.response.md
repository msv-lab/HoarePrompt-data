Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), followed by an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). It returns information about the initial number of stones in each pile for each test case.**

Note: The function description focuses on what the function does in terms of accepting and processing inputs without detailing the internal operations.
