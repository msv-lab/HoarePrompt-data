Output State: **`i` is 1, `t` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object created from the integers split from the new input string, `lis` is a sorted list of unique elements from `l` that must have at least 2 elements, `j` is 3, `test` is False.**

Explanation: The line `test = False` simply assigns the value `False` to the variable `test`. None of the other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, their previous states remain unchanged.
