Postcondition: `not_c` is False, `A` is True, `i` is 2, and if the element at index `i` in `set_` is greater than the element at index `i-1` by more than 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If not, the conditions remain as they were initially (with `not_c` being False, `A` being True, and `i` being 2).
