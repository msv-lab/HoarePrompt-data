Postcondition: `i` is 0, `t` is an input integer, `n` is an integer input by the user, `l` is a map object created from the integers split from the input string, `lis` is a sorted list of unique elements from `l`. If the first element of `lis` is not 1 or the length of `lis` is 1, then `j` is equal to the length of `lis` minus 1, `lis` remains a sorted list of unique elements from `l`, and `test` is `True` since no pair of consecutive elements in `lis` has a difference greater than 1. If neither of these conditions is met, `j` is still equal to the length of `lis` minus 1, `lis` remains a sorted list of unique elements from `l`, and `test` is `True` since no pair of consecutive elements in `lis` has a difference greater than 1.
