Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the variable `j` and the condition for the loop to continue. Therefore, the only variable that needs to be adjusted is `j`.

2. **Determine the Initial Value of `j`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 2.

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `j` is within the range specified by `range(1, len(lis))`. Given that `j` starts at 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `j` should be 3.

4. **Check the Condition for Breaking the Loop**: The loop will break if the difference between `lis[j]` and `lis[j - 1]` is greater than 1. Since `j` is currently 2, the condition for breaking the loop would be checked with `j = 3` (if the loop continues).

5. **Adjust the State**: We need to update the state such that `j` is set to 3, and all other variables remain unchanged.

**Final State**:
State: **`j` is 3, `lis` is a sorted list of unique elements from `l` that must have more than one element**
