Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an input integer, and the initial state of n and the list of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n remains unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    l = map(int, input().split())
    lis = sorted(set(l))
    if 1 not in lis or len(lis) == 1:
        print('Alice')
    else:
        test = True
        for j in range(1, len(lis)):
            if lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1:
                if j % 2 == 1:
                    print('Bob')
                else:
                    print('Alice')
                test = False
                break
        if test == True:
            if len(lis) % 2 == 1:
                print('Alice')
            else:
                print('Bob')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 0, `t` is an input integer, `n` is an integer input by the user, `l` is a map object created from the integers split from the input string, `lis` is a sorted list of unique elements from `l`. If the first element of `lis` is not 1 or the length of `lis` is 1, then `j` is equal to the length of `lis` minus 1, `lis` remains a sorted list of unique elements from `l`, and `test` is `True` since no pair of consecutive elements in `lis` has a difference greater than 1. If neither of these conditions is met, `j` is still equal to the length of `lis` minus 1, `lis` remains a sorted list of unique elements from `l`, and `test` is `True` since no pair of consecutive elements in `lis` has a difference greater than 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 1, `t` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object created from the integers split from the new input string, `lis` is a sorted list of unique elements from `l`. If `1` is not in `lis` or `len(lis) == 1`, then `j` is set based on the conditions involving `lis` and `test` remains True. Otherwise, `lis` must have at least 3 elements, `j` is set to 3, and `test` is set to False.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 2, `t` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object created from integers split from the new input string, `lis` is a sorted list of unique elements from `l`, `test` remains the same (indicating no condition `lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1` was met), and the length of `lis` is either odd or even depending on the path taken through the if-else block.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
