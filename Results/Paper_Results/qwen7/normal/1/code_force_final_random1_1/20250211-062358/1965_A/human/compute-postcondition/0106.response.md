Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is 1.
- `lis` is a sorted list of unique elements from `l` that must have more than one element.
- The difference between the current element `lis[j]` and the previous element `lis[j - 1]` is greater than 1.
- Since `j % 2 == 1`, the current value of `j` is odd.

The print statement is:
```python
print('Bob')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'Bob'`.

Output: **'Bob'**
