Output State: **`i` is 2, `t` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a map object created from integers split from the new input string, `lis` is a sorted list of unique elements from `l`, `test` remains the same, `n` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `lis = sorted(set(l))` creates a sorted list of unique elements from the map object `l`. The original list `l` is converted to a set to remove duplicates, and then sorted to create `lis`. The values of `i`, `t`, `n`, `l`, `test`, and the second occurrence of `n` remain unchanged.
