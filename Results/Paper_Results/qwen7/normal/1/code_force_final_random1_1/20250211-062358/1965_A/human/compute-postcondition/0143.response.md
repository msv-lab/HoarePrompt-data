Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer t, followed by an integer n and a list of n integers representing the number of stones in each pile. For each test case, it determines and prints whether Alice or Bob wins based on the initial distribution of stones. Specifically, it checks if the sequence of unique stone counts is consecutive starting from 1. If not, it further checks the parity of the position where the sequence breaks to decide the winner. If the sequence is either not starting from 1 or consists of only one unique value, Alice wins. Otherwise, the winner depends on the parity of the unique values' count and their consecutive nature.**
