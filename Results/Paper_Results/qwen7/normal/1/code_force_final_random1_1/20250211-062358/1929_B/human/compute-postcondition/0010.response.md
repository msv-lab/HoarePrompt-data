Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for _ in range(t)`. The only variable directly involved in the loop condition is `t`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. After each iteration, `t` is decremented by 1 (since `range(t)` generates numbers from 0 to `t-1`).

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**: At the end of the previous iteration, the postcondition states that `t` is an input integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000. This means `t` was decremented by 1 from its value in the previous iteration.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0. Since `t` was decremented by 1 in the previous iteration, it must have been greater than 1 at the start of the previous iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `t` will be exactly 1 if it was 2 at the start of the previous iteration, or greater than 1 if it was greater than 2.

5. **Formulate the new state**: Given that `t` was decremented by 1, the new value of `t` will be `t - 1` from the previous value. Since `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to continue, the new state will be `t` being a positive integer, but we don't know its exact value without knowing the previous value. However, we know it must be at least 1.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0**
