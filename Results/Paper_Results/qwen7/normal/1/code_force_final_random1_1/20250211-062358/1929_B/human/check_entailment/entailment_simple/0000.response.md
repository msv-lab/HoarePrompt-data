Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the minimum number of cells to color in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell.
2. There are \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals in total (both main diagonals and anti-diagonals).
3. If \( 4n - 2 = k \), then we need to color at least half of these diagonals, plus one additional cell if necessary, because each cell can cover up to two diagonals (one main and one anti-diagonal). This is why the code checks if \( 4n - 2 \) equals \( k \) and prints \( \frac{k}{2} + 1 \) in this case.
4. For other cases, the code correctly uses `ceil(k / 2)` to ensure that at least \( k \) diagonals are covered, as each cell can cover up to two diagonals.

Given the logic in the code, it correctly handles both scenarios:
- When \( 4n - 2 = k \), it prints \( \frac{k}{2} + 1 \).
- For other values of \( k \), it prints \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \).

Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description and the provided examples.

Correctness: **True**
