Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer that must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000.
- `n` is the first integer input.
- `k` is the second integer input, and its value is described as 4 times the current value of `n` minus 2.

We need to determine the value of `k // 2 + 1`.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. The value of `k` is given by the formula: \( k = 4 \times n - 2 \).
2. We need to compute `k // 2 + 1`.

Substituting the formula for `k` into the expression:

\[ k // 2 + 1 = (4 \times n - 2) // 2 + 1 \]

Simplifying the expression:

\[ (4 \times n - 2) // 2 + 1 = (2 \times n - 1) + 1 = 2 \times n \]

So, the expression simplifies to `2 * n`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **2 * n**
