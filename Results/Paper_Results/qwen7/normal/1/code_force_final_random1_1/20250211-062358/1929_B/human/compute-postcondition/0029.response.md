Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Description:**
   - `s` is the next line from the input.
   - `n` is an integer value obtained from splitting `s` and converting it to an integer.
   - `k` is another integer value obtained from splitting `s` and converting it to an integer.
   - The roles of `n` and `k` are swapped, meaning if originally `n` was the first split value and `k` was the second, after swapping, `n` now holds the second split value and `k` holds the first split value.
   - If `k > 4 * n - 4`, then `k` is either `4 * n - 3` or `4 * n - 2`, and the roles of `n` and `k` remain swapped.

2. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   - The print statement is `print(2 * n)`.
   - We need to determine the value of `n` after the roles have been swapped.

Given the conditions:
- `k` is either `4 * n - 3` or `4 * n - 2`.
- After swapping, `n` takes the value of `k`.

Therefore, `n` can be either `4 * n - 3` or `4 * n - 2` after the swap.

3. **Calculating the Output:**
   - If `n = 4 * n - 3`, then `2 * n = 2 * (4 * n - 3) = 8 * n - 6`.
   - If `n = 4 * n - 2`, then `2 * n = 2 * (4 * n - 2) = 8 * n - 4`.

However, since `n` cannot be `4 * n - 3` or `4 * n - 2` itself (as it would imply `n` is negative or zero), the only feasible scenario is when `n` is derived from the swapped values.

Since the exact values of `n` and `k` are not provided, we can only express the output in terms of the relationship between `n` and `k`.

Output: **2 * (4 * n - 3) or 2 * (4 * n - 2)**
