Output State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will be 0, and `n` and `k` will be the values provided in the last iteration of the loop. No further changes will be made to `n` and `k` if `4 * n - 2` does not equal `k`.**

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, `t` will have been decremented to 0. The values of `n` and `k` will be the ones provided in the last execution of the loop, unless the condition `4 * n - 2 == k` was met in the last iteration, in which case `k` would not be changed.
