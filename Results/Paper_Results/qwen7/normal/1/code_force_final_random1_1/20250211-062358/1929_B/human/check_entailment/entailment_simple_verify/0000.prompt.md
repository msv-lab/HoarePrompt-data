You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Even in kindergarten, Sasha liked a girl. Therefore, he wanted to give her a
drawing and attract her attention.

As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size n \times n , in which
some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to
color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants at least k
diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size
n \times n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the
minimum number of cells he needs to color.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \leq n \leq
10^8 , 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 ) — the size of the square grid and the minimum
number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cells that
need to be colored.

Example

Input

    7
    
    3 4
    
    3 3
    
    3 10
    
    3 9
    
    4 7
    
    7 11
    
    2 3

Output

    2
    2
    6
    5
    4
    6
    2
    
Note

In the pictures below, the colored cells are marked in black, and all
diagonals are marked in purple.

In the first test case, you can color 2 cells so that 4 diagonals contain at
least one colored cell:

In the third test case, you can color 6 cells so that all 10 diagonals contain
at least one colored cell:

- Program: 
from math import ceil

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if 4 * n - 2 == k:
            print(k // 2 + 1)
        else:
            print(ceil(k / 2))



- Annotated Code: 
from math import ceil

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^8 and 1 <= k <= 4n - 2.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        if 4 * n - 2 == k:
            print(k // 2 + 1)
        else:
            print(ceil(k / 2))
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will be 0, and `n` and `k` will be the values provided in the last iteration of the loop. No further changes will be made to `n` and `k` if `4 * n - 2` does not equal `k`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program fails to account for the minimum number of cells needed when `k` is less than `4 * n - 2`. According to the problem description, the minimum number of cells required to ensure at least `k` diagonals have at least one colored cell is calculated using the formula `ceil(k / 2)`, but this formula alone is insufficient for all cases.

Consider the following test case:
- Input: `2 3`
- Expected Output: `2`

However, the program outputs `2`, which seems correct at first glance. But let's analyze further:
- For a `2x2` grid (`n=2`), there are `4 * 2 - 2 = 6` diagonals.
- To satisfy `k=3` diagonals having at least one colored cell, we need to color at least 2 cells such that these 3 diagonals are covered. The correct solution is to color the cells in the corners, ensuring that 3 diagonals are covered. This means the minimum number of cells to color is indeed `2`.

But consider another case:
- Input: `3 10`
- Expected Output: `6`

Here, the program also outputs `6`, which is correct because for a `3x3` grid, there are `4 * 3 - 2 = 10` diagonals, and we need to color all cells to ensure all 10 diagonals have at least one colored cell.

However, the critical issue arises with the case:
- Input: `3 9`
- Expected Output: `5`

The program outputs `5`, but the correct answer should be `6`. To cover 9 out of 10 diagonals, we need to color 6 cells, not 5. Coloring 5 cells will leave one diagonal uncovered.

Thus, the program does not correctly handle the case where `k` is close to but less than `4 * n - 2`. It fails to ensure that the minimum number of cells required is always correctly calculated. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
