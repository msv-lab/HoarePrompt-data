Postcondition: **`s` is the next line from the input, `n` is an integer value obtained from splitting `s` and converting to int, `k` is an integer value obtained from splitting `s` and converting to int, and the variables `n` and `k` have swapped their roles in terms of holding the split values of `s`. Additionally, if `k <= 4 * n - 4`, the condition holds as is. Otherwise, `k` is either `4 * n - 3` or `4 * n - 2`, and the roles of `n` and `k` remain swapped.**
