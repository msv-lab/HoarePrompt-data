Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2.
Code of the loop:
for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
    n, k = map(int, s.split())
    if k <= 4 * n - 4:
        print(math.ceil(k / 2))
    elif k == 4 * n - 3:
        print(2 * n - 1)
    elif k == 4 * n - 2:
        print(2 * n)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `s` is a string, `n` is an integer value obtained from splitting `s` and converting to int, `k` is an integer value obtained from splitting `s` and converting to int. If `k` is less than or equal to `4 * n - 4`, no changes are made to `n` and `k`. If `k` equals `4 * n - 3`, the condition holds true. If `k` does not equal `4 * n - 3`, then `k` equals `4 * n - 2` and no changes are made to `n` and `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `s` is the next line from the input, `n` is an integer value obtained from splitting `s` and converting to int, `k` is an integer value obtained from splitting `s` and converting to int, and the variables `n` and `k` have swapped their roles in terms of holding the split values of `s`. Additionally, if `k <= 4 * n - 4`, the condition holds as is. Otherwise, `k` is either `4 * n - 3` or `4 * n - 2`, and the roles of `n` and `k` remain swapped.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `s` is the next line from the input, `n` is an integer value obtained from splitting `s` and converting to int, `k` is an integer value obtained from splitting `s` and converting to int, and the variables `n` and `k` have swapped their roles in terms of holding the split values of `s`. If `k <= 4 * n - 4`, then `k` is either less than or equal to `4 * n - 4`. If `k > 4 * n - 4`, then `k` is either `4 * n - 3` or `4 * n - 2`. In both cases, the roles of `n` and `k` remain swapped.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
