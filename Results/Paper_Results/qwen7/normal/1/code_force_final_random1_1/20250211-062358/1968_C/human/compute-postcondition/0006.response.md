Output State: **The value of `a[i]` is updated to `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`. `n` must be at least 2.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `a[i]` to the sum of `a[i - 1]` and `x[i - 1]`. However, since no specific values for `a`, `x`, or `i` are given, we only know that `a[i]` has been updated according to the formula. The precondition that `n` must be at least 2 remains unchanged.
