Output State: **`a` is a list of length `n` with the first element being 1000 and all other elements being 0, `x` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `a[0] = 1000` changes the first element of the list `a` to 1000 while keeping the rest of the elements as 0 (since the list was initially filled with zeros). The list `x` remains unchanged as no operation was performed on it.
