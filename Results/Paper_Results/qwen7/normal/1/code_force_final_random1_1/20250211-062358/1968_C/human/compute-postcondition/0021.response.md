Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n-1` (inclusive), as indicated by `range(1, n)`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a[i]` is updated to `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`.
   - `n` remains at least 2.

4. **Analyze the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Since the loop starts from `1` and increments `i` by `1` each iteration, the next value of `i` would be `i + 1`.
   - Therefore, if `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` would be `k + 1`.
   - Given that `n` remains at least 2, `n` does not change and still needs to be at least 2 for the loop to continue.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - The value of `a[i]` will be updated based on the new value of `i`.
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1, the new value of `i` will be `k + 1` where `k` was the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged and must still be at least 2.

Given that `i` was incremented by 1, let's assume `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration. The next value of `i` will be `k + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `a[i]` will be updated to `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]` for the new value of `i` (which is `k + 1`).
- `n` remains at least 2.

Since we don't know the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we'll denote it as `k` and the next value as `k + 1`.

State: **`a[i]` is updated to `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]` for `i = k + 1`, while `n` must be at least 2**.

However, to provide a concrete example, let's assume `i` was `k = 1` at the end of the previous iteration. The next value of `i` will be `2`.

State: **`a[i]` is updated to `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]` for `i = 2`, while `n` must be at least 2**.

Thus, the final state is:
State: **`a[i]` is updated to `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]` for `i = 2`, while `n` must be at least 2**.
