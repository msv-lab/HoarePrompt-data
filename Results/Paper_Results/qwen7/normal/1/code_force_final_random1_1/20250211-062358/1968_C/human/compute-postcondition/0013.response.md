Based on the initial state described, the list `a` will be constructed such that each element `a[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n-1`) is the sum of `a[0]` (which is 1000) and the sum of the first `i` elements of the list `x`.

Let's break down the process:

1. `a[0]` is initialized to 1000.
2. For each subsequent element `a[i]` (where `i` ranges from 1 to `n-1`), `a[i]` is computed as `a[0]` plus the sum of the first `i` elements of `x`.

Given this, if we assume `x` is a list of integers and `n` is the length of `x`, the final list `a` will look like this:

- `a[0] = 1000`
- `a[1] = 1000 + x[0]`
- `a[2] = 1000 + (x[0] + x[1])`
- ...
- `a[n-1] = 1000 + (x[0] + x[1] + ... + x[n-2])`

When the `print(*a)` statement is executed, it will print the elements of the list `a` separated by spaces.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **1000, 1000 + x[0], 1000 + (x[0] + x[1]), ..., 1000 + (x[0] + x[1] + ... + x[n-2])**
