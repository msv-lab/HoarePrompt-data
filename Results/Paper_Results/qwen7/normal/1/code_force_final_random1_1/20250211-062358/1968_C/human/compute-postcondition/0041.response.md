Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `a` is a list of length `n` with the first element being 1000.
   - Each subsequent element in `a` is the sum of the previous element in `a` and the corresponding element in `x`.
   - `x` is a list of integers obtained from splitting an input string and converting each element to an integer.
   - `i` is set to `n`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(*a)
   ```

3. **Understanding the List `a`**:
   - The first element of `a` is explicitly given as 1000.
   - For the remaining elements, each element is the sum of the previous element in `a` and the corresponding element in `x`.

   Let's denote the elements of `x` as `x[0], x[1], ..., x[n-1]`.

   Therefore, the elements of `a` will be:
   - `a[0] = 1000`
   - `a[1] = 1000 + x[0]`
   - `a[2] = (1000 + x[0]) + x[1] = 1000 + x[0] + x[1]`
   - ...
   - `a[n-1] = 1000 + x[0] + x[1] + ... + x[n-2]`

4. **Output**:
   When the `print(*a)` statement is executed, it will print all the elements of the list `a` separated by spaces.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **1000 1000 + x[0] 1000 + x[0] + x[1] ... 1000 + x[0] + x[1] + ... + x[n-2]**
