Output State: **`t` must be a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is not used in the code snippet. The variable `n` is assigned the value of the integer input provided by the user. The precondition that `t` must be a positive integer between 1 and 10^4 is still valid, but `t` itself is not affected by the code.
