Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1`. This means the loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a[i]` is updated to `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`.
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `n` must be at least 2.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 and should still be less than `n`.
   - Since `i` is currently `n`, incrementing `i` by 1 would make `i` equal to `n + 1`, which would make the condition `i < n` false.
   - Therefore, the loop cannot execute again because `i` is already at its maximum value (`n`), and incrementing it would violate the loop condition.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` remains `n` because it cannot be incremented further without violating the loop condition.
   - `n` remains unchanged as there is no operation that changes `n` within the loop head.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration (which actually won't happen) would remain the same as the current state.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`a[i]` is updated to `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`, `i` is `n`, `n` must be at least 2**
