Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`.
   - The only variable involved here is the input value used in the `range` function, which is `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the State Adjustments:**
   - Since the loop will execute as long as the input value is a positive integer (as per the given constraints), we need to ensure that the input value is within the specified range.
   - The constraints are: `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, where `t` is the input value.

3. **Adjust the States:**
   - We need to ensure that the input value is a valid integer within the specified range. Therefore, the state should reflect this constraint.

Given the above analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input value, ensuring it falls within the specified range.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` must be a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
