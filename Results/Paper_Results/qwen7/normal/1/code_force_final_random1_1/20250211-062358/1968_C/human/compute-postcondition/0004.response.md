Output State: **`t` must be a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `a` is a list of `n` zeros, `a[0]` is 1000.**

Explanation: The code `a[0] = 1000` assigns the value 1000 to the first element of the list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
