Output State: **`a[2]` is now `a[1] + x[1]`, `i` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, `a[i]` (which is `a[2]`) is now `a[1] + x[1] + x[1]`**.

Explanation: The code updates `a[i]` to `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`. Given that `i` is 2, `a[i]` becomes `a[1] + x[1]`. Then, the code again updates `a[i]` to `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`, making `a[2]` become `a[1] + x[1] + x[1]`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the precondition that `n` must be at least 2 is still valid.
