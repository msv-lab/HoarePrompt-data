Output State: **`a[i]` is updated to `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`, `i` is `n`, `n` must be at least 2**

Explanation: The code updates `a[i]` to the value of `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`. Given the initial state where `a[i]` is updated to `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`, `i` is `n`, and `n` must be at least 2, the value of `a[i]` is now specifically `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
