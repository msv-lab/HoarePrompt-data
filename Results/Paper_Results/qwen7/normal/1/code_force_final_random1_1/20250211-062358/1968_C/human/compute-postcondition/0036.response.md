Output State: **`a` is unchanged except for the element at index 3, which is now the sum of the element at index 2 and the element at index 2 of `x`. `i` is 3.**

This means that the value of `a[3]` has been updated to `a[2] + x[2]`, while the other elements of `a` remain unchanged. The value of `i` remains 3.
