Output State: **`a` is a list of length `k`, each element initialized to 1000, `x` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `x = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual elements (assuming space-separated values), converts each element to an integer using `map(int, ...)`, and then creates a list from these integers. The list `a` remains unchanged with its original state, while a new list `x` is created and populated with the integer values from the input.
