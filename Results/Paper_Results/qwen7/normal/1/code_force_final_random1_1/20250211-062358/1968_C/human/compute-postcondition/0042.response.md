Output State: **The list `a` will be a list of length `n` with the first element being 1000, and each subsequent element being the cumulative sum of 1000 plus the sum of all elements in `x` up to that point.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `a` will have been updated such that the first element remains 1000, and each subsequent element from the second to the last will be the cumulative sum of 1000 plus the sum of all elements in `x` up to that point. This means that `a[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n-1` will be calculated as follows:

\[ a[i] = 1000 + \sum_{j=0}^{i-1} x[j] \]

where \( \sum_{j=0}^{i-1} x[j] \) represents the sum of the first `i` elements of the list `x`.
