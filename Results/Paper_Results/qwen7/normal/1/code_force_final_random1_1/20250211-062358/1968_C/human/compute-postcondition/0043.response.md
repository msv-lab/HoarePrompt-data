Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 500), and a list `x` of n-1 integers (1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500 for all 2 ≤ i ≤ n). For each test case, it returns information based on the given inputs.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing specific parameters `t`, `n`, and `x`. The function does not take any parameters directly but processes these inputs to produce the desired output for each test case.
