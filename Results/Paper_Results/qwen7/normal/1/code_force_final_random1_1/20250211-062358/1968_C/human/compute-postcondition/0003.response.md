Output State: **`t` must be a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `a` is a list of `n` zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `a` with `n` elements, all set to 0. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and `x` remains as a list of integers obtained from the input string.
