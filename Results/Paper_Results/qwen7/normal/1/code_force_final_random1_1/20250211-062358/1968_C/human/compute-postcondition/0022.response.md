Output State: **`a[2]` is updated to `a[1] + x[1]`, and `n` must be at least 2.**

This means that the value of `a[2]` is now the sum of `a[1]` and `x[1]`, while the condition that `n` must be at least 2 remains unchanged. Other elements of the array `a` and the value of `n` remain as they were in the initial state.
