Output State: **`a` is unchanged except for the element at index 3, which is now the sum of the element at index 2 and the element at index 2 of `x`, `i` is 4**.

Explanation: The code updates the element at index 3 of list `a` to be the sum of the element at index 2 of `a` and the element at index 2 of list `x`. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 4. The variable `n` is not affected by this operation and retains its previous value.
