Output State: **`tc` is 2, `i` is 1, `ans` is 'NO', `impossible` is False**

Explanation: The line `impossible = False` simply assigns the value `False` to the variable `impossible`. No other variables are affected, so their previous states remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions with `impossible` explicitly set to `False`.
