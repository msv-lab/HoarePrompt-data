Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4.
Code of the loop:
for tc in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    gr = []
    for i in range(n):
        gr.append(input())
    ans = 'YES'
    if gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]:
        impossible = True
        for j in range(m - 1):
            if gr[0][j] != gr[0][j + 1] or gr[n - 1][j] != gr[n - 1][j + 1]:
                impossible = False
        if impossible:
            ans = 'NO'
        impossible = True
        for i in range(n - 1):
            if gr[i][0] != gr[i + 1][0] or gr[i][m - 1] != gr[i + 1][m - 1]:
                impossible = False
        if impossible:
            ans = 'NO'
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `tc` is 1, `i` is `n - 2`, `n` is `j + 1`, `m` is greater than 3, `ans` is 'NO', and `impossible` is True. If `gr[0][0]` is not equal to `gr[n - 1][m - 1]`, then `impossible` is set to True, `m` is set to a value greater than 3, `ans` is set to 'NO', `i` is set to `n - 2`, and `n` is set to `j + 1`. Since there is no else part, these changes apply regardless of the condition.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `tc` is 2, `i` is `n-2`, `ans` is 'NO', `impossible` is True, `n` must be at least 2, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements where the first element is not equal to the last element, `m` must be greater than 1, `j` is 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `impossible` remains `True`, `ans` is 'NO', `i` is `n-2`, `n` must be greater than `1`. After the loop executes all its iterations, if none of the conditions `gr[i][0] != gr[i + 1][0]` or `gr[i][m - 1] != gr[i + 1][m - 1]` were met for any `i` in the range of `n-1`, then `impossible` will still be `True`. If any of these conditions were met at any point, `impossible` would become `False`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
