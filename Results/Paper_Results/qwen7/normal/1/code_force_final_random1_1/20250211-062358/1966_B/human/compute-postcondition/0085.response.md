Output State: `tc` is 2, `i` is 0, `ans` is 'YES', `impossible` is False, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements, the first element of `gr` is not equal to the last element of `gr`, `m` must be greater than 1, `j` is 2.

Explanation: The loop runs from `j` in the range `m - 1`. Given that the loop has executed 3 times, `j` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration. After 3 iterations, `j` will be 2. The conditions inside the loop do not change any variables outside the loop; they only set `impossible` to `False` if certain conditions are met. Since the conditions did not change `impossible` to `True` during the iterations, it remains `False`. All other variables (`tc`, `i`, `ans`, `n`, `gr`, and `m`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
