Based on the initial state provided:

- `tc` is 2.
- `i` is `n-2`.
- `ans` is 'NO'.
- `impossible` is True.
- `n` must be at least 2.
- `gr` is a list containing `n` elements where the first element is not equal to the last element.
- `m` must be greater than 1.
- `j` is 2.

The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of the variable `ans`, which is explicitly stated to be 'NO'.

Output: **'NO'**
