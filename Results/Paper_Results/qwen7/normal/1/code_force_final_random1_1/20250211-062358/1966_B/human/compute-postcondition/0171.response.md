Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a grid of size n x m where n and m are positive integers (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500), and each cell in the grid contains either 'W' or 'B'. The function also receives a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it checks the grid and returns information based on specific conditions.**

Note: The actual processing logic and conditions are not described here as per the instruction to only describe the parameters and return value without detailing the operations.
