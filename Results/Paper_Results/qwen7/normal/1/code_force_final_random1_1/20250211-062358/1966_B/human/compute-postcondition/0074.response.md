Output State: **`tc` is 2, `i` is 0, `ans` is 'YES', `impossible` is False, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements, the first element of `gr` is not equal to the last element of `gr`, `m` must be greater than 1, `j` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `impossible = False` simply updates the value of the variable `impossible` to `False`. No other changes are made to the other variables or their conditions. Therefore, the output state retains the same conditions and values as the initial state except for the updated value of `impossible`.
