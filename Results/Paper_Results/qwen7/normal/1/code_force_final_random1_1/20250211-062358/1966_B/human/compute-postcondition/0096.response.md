Postcondition: `tc` is 2, `i` is 0, `ans` is 'NO', `impossible` is False, `n` must be at least 2, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements where the first element is not equal to the last element, `m` must be greater than 1, `j` is 2, and the condition `gr[i][0] != gr[i + 1][0] or gr[i][m - 1] != gr[i + 1][m - 1]` holds true.
