Postcondition: `j` is equal to `m - 2`, `impossible` is False, `m` must be greater than 3, `ans` is 'NO', `i` is 0, `n` is `j + 1` if `gr[i][0]` is not equal to `gr[i + 1][0]` or `gr[i][m - 1]` is not equal to `gr[i + 1][m - 1]`. Otherwise, the conditions remain as initially specified (i.e., `impossible` is True, `m` must be greater than 3, `ans` is 'NO', `i` is 0, `n` is `j + 1`).
