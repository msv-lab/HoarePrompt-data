Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following conditions hold:
   - `tc` is 2
   - `i` is 0
   - `ans` is 'YES'
   - `impossible` is False

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `range(m - 1)`, meaning it runs from `j = 0` to `j = m - 2`.

3. **Loop Head Variables**: The only variables involved in the loop head are `j` and `m`.

4. **Postcondition**: If the first element's `j`-th index in `gr` is not equal to the `(j+1)`-th index of the first element, or the last element's `j`-th index in `gr` is not equal to the `(j+1)`-th index of the last element, then these variables retain their initial values.

5. **Current Iteration**: At the end of the previous iteration, `j` must have been the value it had before the last execution of the loop. Since the loop starts from `j = 0` and increments `j` by 1 each iteration, if the loop just finished its previous iteration, `j` would have been incremented from the previous value.

6. **Adjusting States**: For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 from its current value. Therefore, `j` should be `1` at the start of the next iteration.

7. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`tc`, `i`, `ans`, `impossible`) remain unchanged unless the loop body modifies them, but since no such modification is mentioned, they retain their initial values.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`tc` is 2, `i` is 0, `ans` is 'YES', `impossible` is False, `j` is 1**
