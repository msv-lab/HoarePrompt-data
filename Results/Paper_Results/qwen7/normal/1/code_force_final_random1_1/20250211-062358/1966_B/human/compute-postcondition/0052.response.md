Postcondition: **`impossible` is True, `m` must be greater than 3, `ans` is 'NO', `i` is `n - 2`, `n` is `j + 1`.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block. If the condition `impossible` is true, then `impossible` remains true, `m` remains greater than 3, `ans` remains 'NO', `i` is `n - 2`, and `n` is `j + 1`. Since there is no else part, these conditions hold regardless of the outcome of the if condition.
