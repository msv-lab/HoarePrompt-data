Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for tc in range(t)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `tc` and `t`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `tc` is less than `t`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `tc` is 2
   - `i` is `n-2`
   - `ans` is 'NO'
   - `impossible` is True
   - `n` must be at least 2
   - `gr` is a list containing `n` elements where the first element is not equal to the last element
   - `m` must be greater than 1
   - `j` is 2

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `tc` is currently 2, for the loop to continue, `tc` must be incremented to 3 (since `tc` starts from 0).
   - The value of `t` remains unchanged.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `tc` becomes 3
   - `i` remains `n-2` (since it is not part of the loop head)
   - `ans` remains 'NO' (since it is not part of the loop head)
   - `impossible` remains True (since it is not part of the loop head)
   - `n` remains at least 2 (since it is not part of the loop head)
   - `gr` remains a list containing `n` elements where the first element is not equal to the last element (since it is not part of the loop head)
   - `m` remains greater than 1 (since it is not part of the loop head)
   - `j` remains 2 (since it is not part of the loop head)

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`tc` is 3, `i` is `n-2`, `ans` is 'NO', `impossible` is True, `n` must be at least 2, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements where the first element is not equal to the last element, `m` must be greater than 1, `j` is 2**
