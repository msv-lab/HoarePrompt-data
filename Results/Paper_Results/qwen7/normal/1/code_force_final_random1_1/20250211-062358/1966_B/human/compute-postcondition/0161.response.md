Output State: `impossible` remains `True`, `ans` is 'NO', `i` is `n - 2`, `n` must be greater than `0`. After the loop completes all its iterations, if none of the conditions `gr[i][0] != gr[i + 1][0]` or `gr[i][m - 1] != gr[i + 1][m - 1]` were met for any `i` in the range `0` to `n - 2`, then `impossible` will still be `True`. Otherwise, if any of these conditions were met, `impossible` would become `False`. Since the loop exits when it has iterated through all possible pairs, `i` will be `n - 2` upon completion.
