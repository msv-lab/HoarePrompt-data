### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to determine if it's possible to make all squares in an \( n \times m \) grid the same color using the given operations.
   - An operation involves selecting any two squares of the same color and changing the color of all squares within the subrectangle defined by those two squares.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - If the top-left and bottom-right corners of the grid have different colors, it's impossible to make the entire grid the same color because no operation can affect both corners simultaneously.
   - If the top-left and bottom-right corners have the same color, we need to check if the rest of the grid can be made uniform through operations.

3. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - It initializes the answer as 'YES'.
   - It checks if the top-left and bottom-right corners have different colors. If they do, it sets the answer to 'NO' and exits.
   - If the top-left and bottom-right corners have the same color, it further checks if the entire row and column boundaries can be made uniform without conflicts.

4. **Issues in the Code**:
   - The code only checks if the top-left and bottom-right corners have the same color. This is necessary but not sufficient.
   - The code does not handle cases where the grid has more complex patterns that can still be made uniform. For example, a grid with alternating colors in rows or columns might still be able to be made uniform.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - To correctly solve this problem, we should check if every row and every column can be made uniform independently. If any row or column has mixed colors, it's impossible to make the entire grid uniform.

6. **Evaluation of the Given Code**:
   - The code correctly identifies when the top-left and bottom-right corners have different colors, making the entire grid impossible to uniform.
   - However, it fails to check if any row or column has mixed colors, which could still allow the entire grid to be uniform.

Given the analysis, the original assessment was accurate. The provided code is incomplete and does not cover all scenarios. Therefore, the given program is **incorrect**.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
