State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 10^4, tc is 1**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop variable `tc` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration. For the first iteration of the loop, `tc` should be set to 1.
2. The loop condition `range(t)` means that the loop will run `t` times. Therefore, `t` must be a positive integer.
3. Given that `t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\), we need to ensure that `t` falls within this range for the loop to execute.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect these conditions.
