Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies `for i in range(n)`. Therefore, the variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `tc` is 2
   - `i` is `n - 1`
   - `ans` is 'NO'
   - `impossible` is True
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 1
   - `gr` is a list containing two elements where the first element is the original input and the second element is the new input from the user.

3. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from `n - 1` and the loop increments `i` by 1 each time, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `n - 1 + 1 = n`.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged unless modified within the loop body, but since no such modification is mentioned, `n` stays as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the only adjustments needed are for `i` and `n`.

4. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` will be `n` (since `i` is incremented by 1).
   - `n` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

Given that `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, this condition remains unchanged.

So, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`tc` is 2, `i` is `n`, `ans` is 'NO', `impossible` is True, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `gr` is a list containing two elements where the first element is the original input and the second element is the new input from the user.**
