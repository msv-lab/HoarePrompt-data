Postcondition: **`tc` is 2, `i` is 0, `ans` is 'YES', `impossible` is False, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements, the first element of `gr` is not equal to the last element of `gr`, `m` must be greater than 1, `j` is 0. If the first element of the first sublist in `gr` is not equal to the second element of the first sublist or the first element of the last sublist in `gr` is not equal to the second element of the last sublist, the conditions remain unchanged.**
