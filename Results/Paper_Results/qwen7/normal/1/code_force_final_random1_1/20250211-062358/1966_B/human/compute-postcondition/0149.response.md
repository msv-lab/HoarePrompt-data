Let's break down the task step by step:

1. Identify the variables and objects involved in the loop head:
   - The loop head involves the variable `i` and the variable `n`.

2. Determine the initial state of these variables:
   - `impossible` remains `True` (this is not directly related to the loop execution).
   - `ans` is 'NO' (also not directly related to the loop execution).

3. Analyze the loop condition:
   - The loop runs for `i` in the range from 0 to `n-1`.
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1 because the range function will not generate any values if `n` is 0 or less.

4. Adjust the necessary states:
   - We need to ensure that the loop can start, which means `n` must be greater than 0.
   - The value of `i` at the start of the loop is 0 since the range function starts from 0 by default.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` and `i`.

State: **`impossible` remains `True`, `ans` is 'NO', `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
