Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that prevent it from correctly determining whether it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Checking Impossibility**: The logic for checking if it's impossible to make all squares the same color is flawed. Specifically, the conditions used to check if the grid can be made uniform are not sufficient. The current implementation only checks the corners and adjacent cells, but it doesn't consider the entire grid.

2. **Missing Handling of General Cases**: The solution does not handle general cases where it might be possible to make all squares the same color through a series of operations. It only checks specific patterns and fails to account for more complex scenarios.

3. **Incomplete Check for Uniformity**: The solution should check if there exists at least one color that can be propagated to all cells through the allowed operations. This involves checking if all rows or columns can be unified under one color.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for tc in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        gr = [input() for _ in range(n)]
        
        # Check if all rows have the same color
        all_rows_same = all(gr[0] == row for row in gr)
        
        # Check if all columns have the same color
        all_cols_same = all(gr[row][0] == gr[col][0] for row in range(n) for col in range(m))
        
        # If either all rows or all columns have the same color, it's possible to make the whole grid uniform
        if all_rows_same or all_cols_same:
            print("YES")
        else:
            print("NO")

```

This revised solution checks if all rows or all columns have the same color, which would allow the grid to be made uniform through the allowed operations. If such a condition is met, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".
