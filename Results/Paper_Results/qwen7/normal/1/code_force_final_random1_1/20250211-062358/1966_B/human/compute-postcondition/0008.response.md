Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `tc` is 1
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `gr` is a list containing an input value

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Therefore, `n` must be greater than 1.

Given this information, we need to update the state such that `i` is increased by 1 (from 1 to 2) and `n` must be greater than 1.

**Final State**:
- `tc` remains 1
- `i` is now 2
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `gr` remains a list containing an input value

So, the updated state is:
State: **`tc` is 1, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `gr` is a list containing an input value**
