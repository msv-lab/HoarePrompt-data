Output State: **`tc` is 1, `i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 3, `gr` is a list containing 4 elements which are the input values appended in each iteration, `ans` is 'YES'**.

Explanation: The code simply assigns the string `'YES'` to the variable `ans`. This assignment does not affect the values of `tc`, `i`, `n`, or `gr`. Therefore, their values remain the same as they were in the initial state. The only change is that `ans` is now set to `'YES'`.
