Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(n - 1)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is equal to `m - 2`
   - `impossible` is False
   - `m` must be greater than 3
   - `ans` is 'NO'
   - `i` is 0
   - `n` is `j + 1` if `gr[i][0]` is not equal to `gr[i + 1][0]` or `gr[i][m - 1]` is not equal to `gr[i + 1][m - 1]`. Otherwise, the conditions remain as initially specified.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 0 to `n - 2`. Therefore, the loop will execute again if `i < n - 1`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop runs for `i` in the range from 0 to `n - 2`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1. Given that `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be 1 at the start of the next iteration.
   - The value of `n` remains the same unless the conditions inside the loop change it. Since no information about changes inside the loop is provided, we assume `n` remains the same.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `i` will be 1.
   - `n` remains the same, which is `j + 1` based on the initial conditions.

Given the above analysis, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`j` is equal to `m - 2`, `impossible` is False, `m` must be greater than 3, `ans` is 'NO', `i` is 1, `n` is `j + 1` if `gr[0][0]` is not equal to `gr[1][0]` or `gr[0][m - 1]` is not equal to `gr[1][m - 1]`. Otherwise, the conditions remain as initially specified (i.e., `impossible` is False, `m` must be greater than 3, `ans` is 'NO', `i` is 1, `n` is `j + 1`).**
