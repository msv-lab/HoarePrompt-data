Output State: `tc` is 2, `i` is 0, `ans` is 'YES', `impossible` is False, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements, the first element of `gr` is not equal to the last element of `gr`, `m` must be greater than 1, `j` is 2.

Explanation: The loop runs from `j` in `range(m - 1)`. After the loop executes 3 times, `j` becomes 2. Since the loop does not change the values of `tc`, `i`, `ans`, `impossible`, `n`, `gr`, or `m`, these variables retain their initial or previous values. The condition inside the loop does not change any of these variables either. Therefore, after all iterations of the loop, `j` will be 2, and all other variables will remain as specified in the initial and output states after 3 iterations.
