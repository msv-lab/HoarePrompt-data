Output State: `tc` is 2, `i` is `0`, `ans` is 'NO', `impossible` is True, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements where the first element is the original input, the second element is the original input, and the rest of the elements are new inputs from the users.

This means after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be 0 because the loop decrements `i` with each iteration until it reaches 0. The variable `ans` remains 'NO' and `impossible` remains True as there's no indication in the provided code snippet that these variables change based on the loop. The list `gr` will contain `n` elements, starting with the original input repeated twice, followed by `n-2` new inputs provided by the user during each iteration of the loop.
