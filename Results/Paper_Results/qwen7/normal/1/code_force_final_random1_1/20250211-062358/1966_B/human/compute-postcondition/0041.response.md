Output State: **`impossible` is False, `m` must be greater than 3, `ans` is 'NO', `i` is 1, `n` is `j + 1`**

Explanation: The code simply sets `impossible` to `False`. This does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the values of `m`, `ans`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
