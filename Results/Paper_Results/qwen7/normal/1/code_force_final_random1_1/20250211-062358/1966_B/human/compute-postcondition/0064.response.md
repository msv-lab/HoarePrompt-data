Output State: **`tc` is 2, `i` is `n`, `ans` is 'NO', `impossible` is True, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `gr` is a list containing three elements where the first element is the original input, the second element is the original input, and the third element is the new input from the user.**

Explanation: The code `gr.append(input())` appends the new input from the user to the list `gr`. Initially, `gr` contains two elements: the original input and the original input again. After executing the code, `gr` now contains three elements: the original input, the original input, and the new input from the user. All other variables remain unchanged.
