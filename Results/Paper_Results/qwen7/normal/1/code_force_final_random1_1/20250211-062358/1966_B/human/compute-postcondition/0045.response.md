Output State: **`impossible` is False, `m` must be greater than 3, `ans` is 'NO', `i` is 2, `n` is `j + 1`**

Explanation: The code simply reassigns the value of `impossible` to `False`, which was already its value in the initial state. All other variables (`m`, `ans`, `i`, `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
