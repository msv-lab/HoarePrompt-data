Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `tc` is 1 (this variable is not part of the loop head).
   - `n` is an integer from the input split (this variable is part of the loop head).
   - `m` is an integer from the input split (this variable is not part of the loop head).
   - `gr` is a list containing one element which is the input string (this variable is not part of the loop head).
   - `i` is 0 (this variable is part of the loop head).

3. **Adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time**:
   - `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `i < n`. Since `i` is currently 0, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 0.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final State**:
State: **`tc` is 1, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0**
