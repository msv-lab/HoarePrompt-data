Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i` to `n-1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n-1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `tc` is 2
   - `i` is 1
   - `ans` is 'NO'
   - `impossible` is False
   - The current value of `gr[i][0]` is not equal to `gr[i + 1][0]` or the current value of `gr[i][m - 1]` is not equal to `gr[i + 1][m - 1]`

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented by 1. Thus, `i` will be 2.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `tc` remains 2.
   - `i` changes to 2.
   - `ans` remains 'NO'.
   - `impossible` remains False.
   - The condition about `gr[i][0]` and `gr[i][m - 1]` remains the same because it does not depend on the loop variable `i`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`tc` is 2, `i` is 2, `ans` is 'NO', `impossible` is False, and the current value of `gr[2][0]` is not equal to `gr[3][0]` or the current value of `gr[2][m - 1]` is not equal to `gr[3][m - 1]`**.
