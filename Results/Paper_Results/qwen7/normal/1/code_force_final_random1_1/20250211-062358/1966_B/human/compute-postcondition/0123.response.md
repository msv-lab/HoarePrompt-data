Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `ans` is 'NO', `impossible` is True, `gr` is a list containing two elements where the first element is the original input and the second element is the new input from the user plus an additional input from the user, `j` is 2**.

Explanation: The code `gr.append(input())` appends the result of `input()` to the list `gr`. Since `gr` originally contained two elements (the first being the original input and the second being the new input from the user), after appending the new input, `gr` now contains three elements: the original input, the new input from the user, and the latest input from the user. All other variables remain unchanged.
