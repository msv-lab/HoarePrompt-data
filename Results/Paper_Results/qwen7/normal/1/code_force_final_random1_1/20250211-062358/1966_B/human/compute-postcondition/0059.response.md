Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the range function which takes `n` as its argument.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i` and `n`**: According to the given state before the loop, `i` is set to `n - 2`.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1 (since `range(n)` generates numbers from 0 to `n-1`).

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**: We need to ensure that the loop can start executing, which means `n` must be greater than or equal to 1. The value of `i` (`n - 2`) is derived from `n`, so we don't need to adjust `i` directly; instead, we focus on ensuring `n` meets the loop's requirement.

5. **List the necessary adjustments**: The only variables that need adjustment are `n` and `i`. Since `i` is derived from `n`, the primary adjustment needed is ensuring `n` is at least 1.

Therefore, the state after adjustment should be:

**State: **`tc` is 2, `i` is `n - 2`, `ans` is 'NO', `impossible` is True, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `gr` is an empty list**
