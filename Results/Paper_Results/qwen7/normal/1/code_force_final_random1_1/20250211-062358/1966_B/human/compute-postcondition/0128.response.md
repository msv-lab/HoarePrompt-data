Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `ans` is 'YES', `impossible` is True, `gr` is a list containing `n` elements, each being an input from the user, `j` is 2, the first element of `gr` is not equal to the last element of `gr`.**

Explanation: The line `impossible = True` does not change any variable's value or affect the initial conditions. It simply reassigns the variable `impossible` to `True`. All other variables remain in their initial states.
