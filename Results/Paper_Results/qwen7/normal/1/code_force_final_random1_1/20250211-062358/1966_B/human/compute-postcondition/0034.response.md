Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `n - 1`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: Since the loop starts with `i = 0` (as is typical for Python's `range` function), `i` should be set to 0.

3. **Determine the Value of `n`**: The value of `n` is derived from `m - 1` because the loop runs `n - 1` times. Given that `j` is initially set to `m - 2`, we can infer that `n` should be `j + 1`. Therefore, `n` should be `j + 1`.

4. **Check the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `n - 1` is greater than or equal to 0. Since `n` is `j + 1`, the condition `n - 1 >= 0` simplifies to `j >= 0`. However, since `j` is derived from `m - 2` and `m` must be greater than 3, `j` will always be at least 1 (since `m` is at least 4). Thus, the loop will definitely execute.

5. **Adjust the States**: We need to adjust the states of `i` and `n` to reflect their initial values within the loop.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` should be 0.
- `n` should be `j + 1`.

Therefore, the final state is:

**State: **`j` is equal to `m - 2`, `impossible` is True, `m` must be greater than 3, `ans` is 'NO', `i` is 0, `n` is `j + 1`**.
