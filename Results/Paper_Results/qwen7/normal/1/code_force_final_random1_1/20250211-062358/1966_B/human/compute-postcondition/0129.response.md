Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for j in range(m - 1):`
   - The variables involved in this loop are `j` and `m`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of These Variables:**
   - From the given information, `j` is initially set to 2.
   - We need to determine the initial value of `m`.

3. **Determine the Condition for the Loop to Execute:**
   - The loop `for j in range(m - 1)` will execute as long as `m - 1` is greater than or equal to 0.
   - This means `m` must be greater than or equal to 1.

4. **List the States That Need Adjustment:**
   - `j` is already given as 2.
   - `m` must be greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute.

5. **Consider Other Given Information:**
   - The other variables (`i`, `n`, `ans`, `impossible`, `gr`) are not directly related to the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `m` must be greater than or equal to 1 and `j` is 2.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`j` is 2, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1**
