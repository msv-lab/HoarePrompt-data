Output State: **`tc` is 2, `i` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 'NO', `impossible` is True, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `gr` is a list containing two elements where the first element is the original input and the second element is the new input from the user.**

Explanation: The code appends a new input to the list `gr`. Initially, `gr` contains one element (the input from the user). After running the code, `gr` now contains two elements: the original input and the new input from the user. All other variables remain unchanged.
