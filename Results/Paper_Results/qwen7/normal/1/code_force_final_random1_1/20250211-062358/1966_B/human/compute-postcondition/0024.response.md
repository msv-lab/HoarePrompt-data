Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `j` and `m`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop runs as long as `j < m - 1`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**: 
   - `impossible` remains False (this variable is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted).
   - `j` is 1.

4. **Calculate the Next Value of `j`**: Since the loop increments `j` by 1 each iteration, if `j` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be 2 at the start of the next iteration.

5. **Check the Condition for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `m - 1`. Given that `j` is now 2, the condition `j < m - 1` will hold true if `m - 1 > 2`, or equivalently, `m > 3`.

6. **Adjust the States**: We need to ensure that `j` is set to 2 and `m` is greater than 3 for the loop to execute one more time.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`impossible` remains False, `j` is 2, `m` must be greater than 3**
