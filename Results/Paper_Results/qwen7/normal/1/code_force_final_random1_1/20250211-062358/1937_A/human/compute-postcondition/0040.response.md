Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n_cases` is an input integer (though its specific value is not relevant for the print statement).
- `i` is 3.
- `n` is greater than 7 (though its specific value is not relevant for the print statement).
- `power` is 8.
- The condition `power == n` is true (though this is redundant since `power` is explicitly given as 8).

The print statement is:
```python
print(2 ** power)
```

Since `power` is explicitly given as 8, the expression `2 ** power` evaluates to \(2^8\).

Calculating \(2^8\):
\[2^8 = 256\]

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be:
Output: **256**
