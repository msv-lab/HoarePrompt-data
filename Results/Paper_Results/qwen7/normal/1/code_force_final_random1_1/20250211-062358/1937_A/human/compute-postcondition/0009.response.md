Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `power < n`.

2. **Determine the variables involved in the loop condition**: The variables involved are `power` and `n`.

3. **Analyze the current state of these variables**:
   - `power` is currently 1.
   - `n` is calculated as `log2(n_cases)`.

4. **Check if the loop can execute the first time**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `power` must be less than `n`.
   - Currently, `power` is 1. So, we need to check if `1 < n`.

5. **Determine the necessary adjustment**:
   - Since `power` is fixed at 1, the only variable that can be adjusted is `n`.
   - We need `n` to be greater than 1 for the loop to execute the first time.

6. **Consider the initial value of `n_cases`**:
   - `n` is calculated as `log2(n_cases)`.
   - For `log2(n_cases)` to be greater than 1, `n_cases` must be greater than \(2^1 = 2\).

7. **Final state before the loop**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n_cases` must be greater than 2.
   - `i` is 1 (no change needed).
   - `power` is 1 (no change needed).

Therefore, the state right before the loop should be adjusted to reflect that `n_cases` must be greater than 2.

**State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n_cases` must be greater than 2, `i` is 1, `n` is log2(n_cases), `power` is 1**
