Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n_cases` must be greater than 8, `i` is 1, `n` is log2(n_cases), `power` is 4.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `power` until it is no longer less than `n`. Given that `power` starts at 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, after 3 iterations, `power` is 3. For the loop to execute a fourth time, `power` would need to reach 4, which means `n` must be at least 8 (since `power` is incremented up to but not including `n`). Therefore, after all iterations of the loop, `power` will be 4, and `n_cases` must be greater than 8.
