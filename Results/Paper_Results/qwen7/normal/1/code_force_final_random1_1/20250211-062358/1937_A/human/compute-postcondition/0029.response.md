Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` is an input integer, `i` is 2, `n` is 1 if `n` equals 1, otherwise `n_cases` must be greater than 8 and `n` is \(\log_2(n_cases)\), and `power` is 3; `power` is now 1.**

Explanation: The code `power = 1` assigns the value 1 to the variable `power`. Since the initial value of `power` was 4 if it equaled `n`, and otherwise was 3, and now `power` is explicitly set to 1, the updated value of `power` is 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
