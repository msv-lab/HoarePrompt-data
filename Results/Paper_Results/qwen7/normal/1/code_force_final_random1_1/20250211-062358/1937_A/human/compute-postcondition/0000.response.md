Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n_cases` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n_cases`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was part of the initial state and was not affected by the code execution. The variable `n_cases` now holds the value of the integer input, which is the number of test cases.
