The loop condition is `power < n`. For the loop to execute one more time, the following conditions must be met:

1. The variable `power` must be less than `n`.
2. The variable `n` must be greater than `power`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n_cases` is an input integer
- `i` is 3
- `n` must be greater than 4
- `power` is 5

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `power` must be less than `n`, and `n` must be greater than `power`. Since `power` is currently 5, `n` must be greater than 5.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `n` must be greater than 5.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` is an input integer, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 5, and `power` is 5**
