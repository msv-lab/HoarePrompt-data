Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n_cases` must be greater than 8.
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is \(\log_2(n_{cases})\).
- `power` is 3.
- `power` is not equal to `n`.

We need to determine the value of `2 ** power`.

Given that `power` is explicitly stated to be 3, we can directly calculate \(2 ** 3\).

Therefore, the expression `2 ** power` evaluates to \(2 ** 3 = 8\).

Output: **8**
