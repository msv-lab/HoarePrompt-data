State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n_cases` is an input integer, `i` must be 0**

### Explanation:
- The loop head contains three variables: `i`, `n_cases`.
- The variable `t` is not involved in the loop condition or the loop itself, so it doesn't need to be adjusted.
- The variable `n_cases` is an input integer, and it determines how many times the loop will run.
- The variable `i` is initialized to 0 at the beginning of the loop, as `range(n_cases)` generates values from 0 to `n_cases - 1`.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, we need to set `i` to 0 and ensure that `n_cases` is a valid positive integer.
