Output State: The variable `power` will be equal to `n`.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `power` by 1 until `power` is no longer less than `n`. Since `n` is initially set as `n = log2(log2(n_cases))`, and the loop increments `power` until it is no longer less than `n`, the final value of `power` will be exactly equal to `n`. All other variables (`t`, `n_cases`, `i`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial or previous states.
