You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Initially, a_i=i for each 1 \le
i \le n .

The operation \texttt{swap}(k) for an integer k \ge 2 is defined as follows:

  * Let d be the largest divisor^\dagger of k which is not equal to k itself. Then swap the elements a_d and a_k . 

Suppose you perform \texttt{swap}(i) for each i=2,3,\ldots, n in this exact
order. Find the position of 1 in the resulting array. In other words, find
such j that a_j = 1 after performing these operations.

^\dagger An integer x is a divisor of y if there exists an integer z such that
y = x \cdot z .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 10^9 ) —
the length of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output the position of 1 in the resulting array.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    4
    
    5
    
    120240229

Output

    1
    4
    4
    67108864
    
Note

In the first test case, the array is [1] and there are no operations
performed.

In the second test case, a changes as follows:

  * Initially, a is [1,2,3,4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(2) , a changes to [\underline{2},\underline{1},3,4] (the elements being swapped are underlined). 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(3) , a changes to [\underline{3},1,\underline{2},4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(4) , a changes to [3,\underline{4},2,\underline{1}] . 

Finally, the element 1 lies on index 4 (that is, a_4 = 1 ). Thus, the answer
is 4 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis
- We need to find the final position of the number `1` in the array after performing the `swap(k)` operation for each `k` from `2` to `n`.
- The `swap(k)` operation swaps the elements at positions `d` and `k`, where `d` is the largest proper divisor of `k`.

### Given Program Analysis
```python
from math import log2

def func():
    n_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(n_cases):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            power = 1
            n = log2(n)
            while power < n:
                power += 1
            if power == n:
                print(2 ** power)
            else:
                power -= 1
                print(2 ** power)
```

#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`n_cases`) and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n`.

2. **Special Case Handling**:
   - If `n == 1`, the program directly prints `1` because the array is `[1]` and no swaps are needed.

3. **General Case Handling**:
   - For `n > 1`, the program attempts to find a power of 2 using logarithms.
   - `n = log2(n)` is problematic because `log2(n)` returns a float, and comparing it directly with integers will not work as expected.
   - The loop `while power < n:` increments `power` until it exceeds `n`. This logic is flawed because `power` should be an integer representing powers of 2, but the comparison with a float `n` is incorrect.
   - The condition `if power == n:` checks if `power` equals `n`, which is not meaningful since `n` is a float and `power` is an integer.
   - The final print statement uses `2 ** power` which is also incorrect because `power` is not correctly determined.

### Correctness Check:
- The program does not correctly implement the `swap(k)` operation.
- The logic for finding the position of `1` after all swaps is flawed.
- The use of logarithms and floating-point comparisons is inappropriate for determining the power of 2.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not properly implement the required operations and logic.

**Correctness: **False**
