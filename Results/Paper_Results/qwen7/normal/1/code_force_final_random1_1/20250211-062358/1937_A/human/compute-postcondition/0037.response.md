Output State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` is an input integer, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 7, and `power` is 8.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `power` by 1 until `power` is no longer less than `n`. Given that `power` starts at 3 and increases by 1 each iteration, it will reach 8 when the loop has executed 5 times (since 3 + 5 = 8). At this point, `power` will no longer be less than `n`, and the loop will terminate. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 7 for the loop to execute 5 times, which is the maximum number of iterations based on the given conditions.
