Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` is an input integer, `i` is 1 if `n` is 1, otherwise `i` is 2, `n` is the input integer, `n` is 1 if `n_cases` must be 1, otherwise `n` is greater than 8 and `n` is \(\log_2(n_cases)\), and `power` is 4 if `n` is 1, otherwise `power` is 8. In both cases, `t`, `n_cases`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial or previous states.
