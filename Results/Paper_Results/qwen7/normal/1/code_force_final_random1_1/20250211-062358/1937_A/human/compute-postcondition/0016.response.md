Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n_cases` must be greater than 8, `i` is 1, `n` is log2(n_cases), `power` is 4.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `power` starts at 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration. Given that it takes 3 iterations to reach `power` being 3, it will take one more iteration to make `power` equal to 4. Therefore, `power` will be 4 after all iterations. For the loop to run 4 times, `power` needs to be less than `n` for 4 iterations, which means `n` (log2(n_cases)) must be greater than 8. All other variables (`t`, `n_cases`, `i`, and `n`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
