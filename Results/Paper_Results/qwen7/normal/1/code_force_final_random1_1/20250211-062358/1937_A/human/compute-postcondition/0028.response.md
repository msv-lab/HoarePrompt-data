Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State Descriptions:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This means `t` can take any integer value between 1 and 10,000 inclusive.
   - `n_cases` is an input integer. The value of `n_cases` is not explicitly given, but it is used to determine the value of `n`.
   - `i` is set to 2.
   - `n` is determined based on the value of `n_cases`:
     - If `n_cases` equals 1, then `n` is 1.
     - Otherwise, `n_cases` must be greater than 8, and `n` is \(\log_2(n_cases)\).
   - `power` is determined based on the value of `n`:
     - If `power` equals `n`, then `power` is 4.
     - Otherwise, `power` is 3.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(1)
   ```

Given the code snippet, it simply prints the integer 1 regardless of the values of other variables. Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **1**
