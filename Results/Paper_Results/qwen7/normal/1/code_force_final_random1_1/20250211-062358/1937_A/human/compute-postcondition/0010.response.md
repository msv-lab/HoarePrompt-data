Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n_cases` must be greater than 2, `i` is 1, `n` is log2(n_cases), `power` is 2**.

Explanation: The initial state includes `t` being an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n_cases` being greater than 2, `i` being 1, `n` being log2(n_cases), and `power` being 1. The code `power += 1` increments the value of `power` by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
