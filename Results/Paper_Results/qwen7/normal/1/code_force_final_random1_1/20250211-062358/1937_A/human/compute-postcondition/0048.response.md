Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head:**
   - The loop variable is `i`.
   - The loop condition is `range(n_cases)`, so `n_cases` is also relevant.

2. **Determine the current values and conditions:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n_cases` is an input integer.
   - `i` is either 2 or 3 depending on the value of `n`.
   - `n` is 1 if `n` equals 1, otherwise `n_cases` must be greater than 8 and `n` is \(\log_2(n_cases)\).
   - `power` is 4 if `power` equals `n`, otherwise `power` is 3.
   - `n` is the integer input.

3. **Adjust the states based on the loop condition:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n_cases`.
   - Since `i` starts at 0 (as per the `range(n_cases)`), the loop will execute once for each value from 0 to `n_cases-1`.

4. **Update the states:**
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1 (if it was 0 initially).

5. **Ensure the loop condition is met:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < n_cases`.

6. **Final state after the first iteration:**
   - `i` will be 1.
   - `n_cases` remains the same.

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` is an input integer, `i` is 1, `n` is 1 if `n` equals 1, otherwise `n_cases` must be greater than 8 and `n` is \(\log_2(n_cases)\), and `power` is 4 if `power` equals `n`, otherwise `power` is 3; `n` is the integer input. If `n` is 1, `i` remains 1 and `power` is 4. Otherwise, `i` becomes 2, `n` is greater than 8, and `power` is 8.**
