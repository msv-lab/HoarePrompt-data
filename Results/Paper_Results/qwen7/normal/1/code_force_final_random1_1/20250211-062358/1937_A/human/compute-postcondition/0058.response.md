Output State: **`power` is increased by 1 and is now less than `n` and `power` is equal to the original value of `power` plus 1.**

This means that the value of `power` has been incremented by 1, and it still remains less than `n`. The exact numerical value of `power` is not specified, but it is clear that it is one more than its previous value and still satisfies the condition of being less than `n`.
