Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive)
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    year = 0
    for ai in a:
        year += year % ai or ai
    print(year)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: The final value of `year` will be the sum of all elements in the list `a`. This is because in each iteration of the loop, `year` is updated to `year + (year % ai) or year + ai`, which effectively adds the value of `ai` to `year` in each iteration. Since the loop iterates over all elements in the list `a`, `year` accumulates the sum of all elements in `a`.

The list `a` remains unchanged, and the variable `t` and `n` also remain in their initial states since they are not affected by the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: The list `a` is empty, and `year` is the sum of all elements in the original list `a`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `a` will be empty because one element is processed in each iteration. The variable `year` will be the cumulative sum of all elements in the original list `a`, as each element `ai` in `a` contributes either `year % ai` or `ai` to `year` in each iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: The list `a` is empty, `year` is the sum of `year + year % ai` for each `ai` in `a`, and `n` is the original input integer.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `a` will be empty because all elements will have been processed. The variable `year` will be the cumulative result of the operation `year += year % ai or ai` applied to each element in the list `a`. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
