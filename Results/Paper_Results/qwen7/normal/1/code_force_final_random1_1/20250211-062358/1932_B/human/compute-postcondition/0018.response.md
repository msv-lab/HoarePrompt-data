Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for ai in a:`. The objects involved here are `ai` and `a`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
   - `ai` is the variable used to iterate over the elements of `a`.

3. **Check the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, the list `a` must contain at least one element. If `a` is empty, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `t` being greater than 0 and `n` being an input integer are not directly related to the loop condition, they do not need to be adjusted.
   - The year being 0 is also not relevant to the loop condition.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the list `a` to ensure it contains at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`a` must be a non-empty list of integers**
