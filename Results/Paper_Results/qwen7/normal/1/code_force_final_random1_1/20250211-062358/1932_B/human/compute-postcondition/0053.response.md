Output State: **`results` now contains the current_year, which is the smallest multiple of elements in `a` that is greater than or equal to the initial `current_year`. The loop continues to execute until `current_year` is no longer divisible by any element in `a`.**

Explanation: The line `results.append(current_year)` appends the current value of `current_year` to the list `results`. Since `current_year` is defined as the smallest multiple of elements in `a` that is greater than or equal to the initial `current_year`, and the loop continues to execute until `current_year` is no longer divisible by any element in `a`, the value of `current_year` remains unchanged in this single line of code. The loop condition and the value of `current_year` itself are still valid after this line of code is executed.
