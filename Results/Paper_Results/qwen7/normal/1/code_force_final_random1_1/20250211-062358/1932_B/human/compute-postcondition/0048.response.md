Output State: **`current_year` is equal to `next_year`, and `next_year` is equal to (`current_year // ai + 1) * ai`.**

Explanation: The code updates `next_year` to \((\text{current\_year} // \text{ai} + 1) * \text{ai}\). Since `next_year` was previously defined as either \(\text{current\_year} + \text{ai}\) or \((\text{current\_year} // \text{ai} + 1) * \text{ai}\), and the new assignment matches the second definition, `next_year` now explicitly equals \((\text{current\_year} // \text{ai} + 1) * \text{ai}\). The value of `current_year` remains unchanged.
