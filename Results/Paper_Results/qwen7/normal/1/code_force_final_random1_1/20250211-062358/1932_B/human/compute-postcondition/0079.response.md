Output State: `current_year` is equal to `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`, `a` contains at least one element, and the loop has executed until there are no further changes to `current_year` based on the given rules.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `current_year` will be equal to the result of the last calculation where it was updated according to the rule `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`. The list `a` still contains at least one element, but since no further changes can be made to `current_year` based on the elements in `a`, the loop has terminated.
