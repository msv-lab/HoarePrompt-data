Output State: **`current_year` is equal to `next_year`, `next_year` is equal to `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`.**

Explanation: The code updates `next_year` to `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`. Since `next_year` was previously defined as either `current_year + ai` if `current_year % ai == 0`, or `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai` otherwise, the new assignment overwrites the previous definition. Therefore, `next_year` is now explicitly defined as `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`. The value of `current_year` remains unchanged from its initial state.
