Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State
- The list `a` is empty.
- `year` is the sum of all elements in the original list `a`.

### Loop Head
- The loop runs for `t` iterations.
- There is no explicit initialization or modification of `a` or `year` in the loop body (as indicated by `# the loop body is omit`).

### Analysis
1. **List `a`**: Since the loop does not modify the list `a`, and it starts empty, it will remain empty after each iteration. Therefore, the state of `a` does not change.
2. **Variable `year`**: The problem states that `year` is the sum of all elements in the original list `a`. Since the list `a` is empty and remains empty throughout the loop, `year` should not change either.

### Conclusion
Since the list `a` remains empty and `year` remains unchanged, there is no need to adjust these states for the loop to execute one more time.

### Final Answer
State: **`a` is an empty list, and `year` is the sum of all elements in the original list `a`**.

However, since `a` is empty and will remain empty, and `year` is the sum of the original list, the state remains the same.

State: **`a` is an empty list, and `year` is the sum of all elements in the original list `a`**.
