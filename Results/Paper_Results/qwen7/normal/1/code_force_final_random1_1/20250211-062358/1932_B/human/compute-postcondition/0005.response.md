Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `ai`, which is iterating over the list `a`.

2. **Determine the initial state of the loop head variables**:
   - `ai` is the variable being iterated over.
   - `a` is the list of integers.

3. **Check the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as there are elements in the list `a`.
   - Before the loop starts, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop will execute as long as there are elements in the list `a`, the list `a` must contain at least one element.
   - The variable `ai` will take the value of the first element in the list `a` during the first iteration.

5. **Consider the given states**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0 (this is not related to the loop head).
   - `n` is an input integer (this is not related to the loop head).
   - `year` is 0 (this is not related to the loop head).

Given these considerations, the only states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are those related to the loop head variables `ai` and `a`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`a` must have at least one element, `ai` is the first element in the list `a`**
