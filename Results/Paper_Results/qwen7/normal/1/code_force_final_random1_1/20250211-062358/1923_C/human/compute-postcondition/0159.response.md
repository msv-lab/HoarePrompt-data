Output State: **`i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `m` must be greater than 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, `a` is updated to an input integer, `b` is updated to an input integer**

Explanation: The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes two inputs from the user and assigns them to `a` and `b` respectively. Since the original values of `a` and `b` are replaced by the new inputs, they are updated to the input integers. All other variables (`i`, `m`, `s`, `c`, and `p`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
