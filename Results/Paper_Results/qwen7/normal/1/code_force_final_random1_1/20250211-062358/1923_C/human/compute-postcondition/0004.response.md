Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is the first positive integer entered by the user, `m` is the second positive integer entered by the user, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `p` is a list containing the single integer 0, `c` is a list containing the single integer 0.**

The code initializes `c` as a list containing a single integer `0`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, or `p`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
