Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `x` and `i` (and `j`, `p`, and `c` are not part of the loop head).

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element `x` in the list `l`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `l` is a non-empty list of integers.
   - `x` is the first element of `l`.
   - `i` is `x` + the original value of `i`.
   - `j` remains unchanged if `x` is not 1, otherwise `j` is increased by 1.
   - `p` is a list containing `i`.
   - `c` is a list containing `j`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - `x` will now be the second element of `l`.
   - `i` will be updated based on the new value of `x` (i.e., `i` becomes `new_x + original_i`, where `new_x` is the second element of `l`).
   - `j` will remain unchanged if the new `x` is not 1, or it will be increased by 1 if the new `x` is 1.

Given these points, let's formulate the state for the next iteration:

- `l` remains a non-empty list of integers (but now the first element is processed).
- `x` changes to the second element of `l`.
- `i` is updated to be the sum of the second element of `l` and the original value of `i`.
- `j` remains unchanged if the second element of `l` is not 1, or it is increased by 1 if the second element of `l` is 1.
- `p` is updated to contain the new value of `i`.
- `c` remains the same as it was in the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`l` is a non-empty list of integers, `x` is the second element of `l`, `i` is the second element of `l` + the original value of `i`, `j` remains unchanged if the second element of `l` is not 1, otherwise `j` is increased by 1, `p` is a list containing the new value of `i`, `c` is a list containing `j`**.
