Based on the initial state provided:

- `m` is set to `m - 2`, which means `m` has been decremented by 2 from its original value.
- `a` and `b` are input integers.
- `i` is calculated as `c[b] - c[a - 1]`.
- `s` is calculated as `p[b] - p[a - 1]`.

However, the `print` statement simply outputs the string `'YES'` without referencing any of the variables `m`, `a`, `b`, `i`, or `s`.

Output: **YES**
