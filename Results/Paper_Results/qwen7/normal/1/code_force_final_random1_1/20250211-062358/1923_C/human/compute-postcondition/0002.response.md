Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is the first positive integer entered by the user, `m` is the second positive integer entered by the user, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input from the user, splits it into a list of strings using spaces as delimiters, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to `l`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged from their initial states.
