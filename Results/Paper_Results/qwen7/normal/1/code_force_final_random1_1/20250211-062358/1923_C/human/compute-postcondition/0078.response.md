Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list of integers, `x` is the second element of `l`, `i` is the second element of `l` + the original value of `i`, `j` is increased by 1 if the second element of `l` is 1, `p` is a list containing the new value of `i`, `c` is a list containing `j`, `p` contains the new value of `i`.**

Explanation: The code `p.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` to the list `p`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
