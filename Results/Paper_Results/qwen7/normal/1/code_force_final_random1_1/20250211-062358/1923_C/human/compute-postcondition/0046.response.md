Based on the initial state provided:

- `m` is set to `m - 1`, which means `m` is one less than its original value.
- `a` and `b` are input integers.
- `i` is defined as `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, where `c` is likely a list or array.
- `s` is defined as `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, where `p` is likely another list or array.

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
