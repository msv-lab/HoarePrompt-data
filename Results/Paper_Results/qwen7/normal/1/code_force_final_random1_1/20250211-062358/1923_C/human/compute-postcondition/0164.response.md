Postcondition: **`i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `m` must be greater than 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, `a` is updated to an input integer, `b` is updated to an input integer, `s` is updated to `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, then the conditions remain unchanged. Otherwise, the conditions also remain unchanged.**
