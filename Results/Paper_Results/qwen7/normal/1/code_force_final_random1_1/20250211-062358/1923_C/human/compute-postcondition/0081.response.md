Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list of integers, `x` is the third element of `l`, `i` is the third element of `l` + the original value of `i`, `j` is increased by 1, `p` is a list containing the new value of `i`, `c` is a list containing `j + 1` if the third element of `l` is 1, otherwise it contains `j`.**

Explanation: The code `j += 1` increments the value of `j` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the updated state includes the increment of `j` by 1.
