Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for x in l:`. This means the variable `x` is being iterated over the list `l`.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `l` is a non-empty list of integers.
   - `x` is the second element of `l`.
   - `i` is the second element of `l` + the original value of `i`.
   - `j` is increased by 1 if the second element of `l` is 1.
   - `p` is a list containing the new value of `i`.
   - `c` is a list containing `j + 1` if the second element of `l` is 1, otherwise it contains `j`.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**:
   - The loop continues as long as there are elements left in the list `l`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - `x` will now be the third element of `l` (since `x` was the second element in the previous iteration).
   - `i` will be updated based on the third element of `l` and the original value of `i`.
   - `j` will be incremented by 1 if the third element of `l` is 1.
   - `p` will contain the updated value of `i`.
   - `c` will contain `j + 1` if the third element of `l` is 1, otherwise it will contain `j`.

Given these points, let's construct the state for the next iteration:

- `l` remains a non-empty list of integers.
- `x` becomes the third element of `l`.
- `i` becomes the third element of `l` + the original value of `i`.
- `j` is incremented by 1 if the third element of `l` is 1.
- `p` contains the updated value of `i`.
- `c` contains `j + 1` if the third element of `l` is 1, otherwise it contains `j`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`l` is a non-empty list of integers, `x` is the third element of `l`, `i` is the third element of `l` + the original value of `i`, `j` is increased by 1 if the third element of `l` is 1, `p` is a list containing the new value of `i`, `c` is a list containing `j + 1` if the third element of `l` is 1, otherwise it contains `j`.**
