Output State: **`i` is increased by `x`, `x` is the next element in the list `l`, `l` is a non-empty list of integers, and if `x` equals 1, then `j` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `j` remains unchanged; `p` is a list containing the value of `i` after it was increased by `x`; `c` is a list containing the value of `j`.**

Explanation: The code appends the current value of `j` to the list `c`. The values of `i`, `x`, `l`, `j`, and `p` remain unchanged from their initial states. The only new information is that `c` now contains the value of `j`.
