Output State: **`i` is 3, `j` is 4, `p` is [2, 2, 3], `c` is [2, 3]**.

Explanation: The code `p.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 3) to the list `p`. Initially, `p` is `[2, 2 + (next element in l)]`. Since the next element in `l` is not specified, we assume it was already evaluated to 2, making `p` initially `[2, 4]`. After appending `i` (which is 3), `p` becomes `[2, 4, 3]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `c` remain unchanged.
