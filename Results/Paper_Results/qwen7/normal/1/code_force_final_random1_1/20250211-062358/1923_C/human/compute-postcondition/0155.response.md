Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is calculated as `c[b] - c[a - 1]`
- `m` must be greater than 0
- `a` is an input integer
- `b` is an input integer
- `s` is calculated as `p[b] - p[a - 1]`
- The condition `(b - a + 1 <= 1 or s - (b - a + 1) < i)` must be true

Given these conditions, the `print('NO')` statement will execute and print the string `'NO'`.

Output: **'NO'**
