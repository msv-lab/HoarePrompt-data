Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: The list `l` is fully processed, meaning `i` is now the sum of all elements in `l`. The variable `j` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of the integer 1 in `l`. Therefore, `j` is equal to the count of 1s in `l`. The list `p` contains all cumulative sums of elements in `l` up to each point during the loop's execution. The list `c` contains the count of 1s encountered up to each point during the loop's execution.

In summary, `i` is the sum of all elements in `l`, `j` is the count of 1s in `l`, `p` is a list of cumulative sums of elements in `l`, and `c` is a list of counts of 1s encountered so far in `l`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    i = c[b] - c[a - 1]
    s = p[b] - p[a - 1]
    if b - a + 1 > 1 and s - (b - a + 1) >= i:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `m` must be greater than 0, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, then `s - (b - a + 1)` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `s - (b - a + 1)` is set to a value less than `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `m` must be greater than 1, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, then no change occurs. Otherwise, no change occurs.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `m` must be greater than 0, `a` and `b` are updated to new integer values from the input, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, then the condition is met and no further changes are made. Otherwise, the condition is not met, and no further changes are made either.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
