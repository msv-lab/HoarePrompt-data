Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list of integers, `x` is the third element of `l`, `i` is the third element of `l` + the original value of `i`, `j` is increased by 1 if the third element of `l` is 1, `p` is a list containing the new value of `i`, `c` is a list containing `j + 1` if the third element of `l` is 1, otherwise it contains `j`, `i` is updated to `i + x, p.append(i)**.

This means that the list `p` now includes the updated value of `i` (which is `i + x`). All other variables retain their previous values, with `j` potentially incremented by 1 if the third element of `l` was 1.
