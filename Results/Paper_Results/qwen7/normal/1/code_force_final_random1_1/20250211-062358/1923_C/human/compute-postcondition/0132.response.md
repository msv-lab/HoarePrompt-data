Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for x in l:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `x` and `l`.

2. **Understand the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `x` is equal to the first element of `l` and is currently 1.
   - `i` is increased by 1 and is now 2.
   - `j` is increased by 1 and is now 2.
   - `p` is a list containing the value 2.
   - `c` is a list containing the value 2.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute again**: The loop will execute again if `x` is still an element of `l`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `x` was set to the first element of `l` (which is 1), and the loop is iterating over `l`, for the loop to execute again, `x` must be set to the second element of `l`.
   - `i` and `j` are incremented by 1 and are now 2, so they don't need to be adjusted as they are not part of the loop head.
   - `p` and `c` are not part of the loop head, so their values remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`x` is equal to the second element of `l`, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `p` is a list containing the value 2, `c` is a list containing the value 2**.
