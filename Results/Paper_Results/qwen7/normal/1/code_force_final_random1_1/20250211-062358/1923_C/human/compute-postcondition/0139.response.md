Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for x in l:`. The only variable that changes within this loop is `x`.

2. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is `2 + x`
   - `j` is `3`
   - `p` is `[2, 2 + x]`
   - `c` is `[2, 3]`

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in the list `l` to iterate over.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `x` is the variable that changes in the loop, it will be incremented or moved to the next element in the list `l`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `2 + x`, `j` was `3`, `p` was `[2, 2 + x]`, and `c` was `[2, 3]`.
   - For the next iteration, `x` will be set to the next element in `l`. Let's assume the next element in `l` is `y`.

5. **Update the States**:
   - `i` will now be `2 + y`
   - `j` remains `3`
   - `p` will now be `[2, 2 + y]`
   - `c` remains `[2, 3]`

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: `i` is 2 + y, `j` is 3, `p` is [2, 2 + y], `c` is [2, 3]**
