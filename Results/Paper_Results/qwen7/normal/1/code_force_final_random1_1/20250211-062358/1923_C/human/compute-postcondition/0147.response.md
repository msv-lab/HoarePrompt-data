Output State: **The list `l` has been fully iterated over. The variable `i` holds the sum of all elements in `l`. The variable `j` is the count of how many times an element in `l` equals 1. The list `p` contains the cumulative sum of elements in `l` up to each index. The list `c` contains the cumulative count of 1s encountered up to each index.**

To elaborate, after the loop completes all its iterations:
- `i` will be the sum of all integers in the list `l`.
- `j` will be the total number of 1s in the list `l`.
- `p` will be a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the list `l` up to that point.
- `c` will be a list where each element is the cumulative count of 1s up to that point.
