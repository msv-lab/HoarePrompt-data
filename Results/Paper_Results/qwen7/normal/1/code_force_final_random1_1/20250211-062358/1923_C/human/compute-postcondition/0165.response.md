Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `_` (which is just a placeholder), `m`, `a`, `b`, `s`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `m` is greater than 0.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`.
   - `m` must be greater than 1.
   - `a` is an input integer.
   - `b` is an input integer.
   - `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`.
   - `a` is updated to an input integer.
   - `b` is updated to an input integer.
   - `s` is updated to `p[b] - p[a - 1]`.
   - If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, then the conditions remain unchanged. Otherwise, the conditions also remain unchanged.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues as long as `m` is greater than 0, we need to decrement `m` by 1.
   - `a` and `b` are updated to new input integers.
   - `s` is updated to `p[b] - p[a - 1]`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `m` is decreased by 1.
- `a` is updated to a new input integer.
- `b` is updated to a new input integer.
- `s` is updated to `p[b] - p[a - 1]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `m` must be greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`**.
