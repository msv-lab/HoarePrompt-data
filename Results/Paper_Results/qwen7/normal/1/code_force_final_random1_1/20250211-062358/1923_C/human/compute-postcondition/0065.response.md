Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the following variables: `x`, `l`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `l` is a list of integers obtained from `input().split()`.
   - `x` is the variable used in the loop to iterate over each element in `l`.

3. **Check if the loop can execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `l` must contain at least one element because the loop iterates over each element in `l`.
   - The initial value of `x` is not specified directly, but it will take the first value from `l` in the first iteration.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `l` is a list obtained from `input().split()`, we need to ensure that `l` is not empty.
   - The initial value of `x` will be the first element of `l` in the first iteration.

Given this information, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `l` must contain at least one element.
- `x` will be the first element of `l`.

Therefore, the final state is:

**State: **`l` is a non-empty list of integers, `x` is the first element of `l`**.
