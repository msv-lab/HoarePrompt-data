Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `x` and `l`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**:
   - `x` is taken from the list `l` in each iteration.
   - `i` is increased by `x`.
   - If `x` equals 1, `j` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `j` remains unchanged.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is increased by `x`.
   - `x` is the next element in the list `l`.
   - `l` is a non-empty list of integers.
   - If `x` equals 1, then `j` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `j` remains unchanged.
   - `p` is a list containing the value of `i` after it was increased by `x`.
   - `c` is a list containing the value of `j`.

4. **Determine the state adjustments needed**:
   - Since the loop takes `x` from `l`, the next `x` will be the next element in `l`.
   - `i` will be increased by this next `x`.
   - If the next `x` equals 1, `j` will be increased by 1. Otherwise, `j` will remain unchanged.
   - `p` will contain the new value of `i` after it is increased by the next `x`.
   - `c` will contain the new value of `j`.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` will be increased by the next `x` from `l`.
   - `x` will be the next element in `l`.
   - If the next `x` equals 1, `j` will be increased by 1. Otherwise, `j` will remain unchanged.
   - `p` will contain the new value of `i` after it is increased by the next `x`.
   - `c` will contain the new value of `j`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is increased by the next element in `l`, `x` is the next element in `l`, `l` is a non-empty list of integers, if the next `x` equals 1, then `j` is increased by 1, otherwise `j` remains unchanged; `p` is a list containing the value of `i` after it was increased by the next `x`; `c` is a list containing the value of `j`.**
