Output State: **`i` is increased by the next element in `l` and equals the previous value of `i` plus the next element in `l`; `x` is the next element in `l`; `j` is increased by 1 if the next `x` equals 1, otherwise `j` remains unchanged; `l` is a non-empty list of integers; `p` is a list containing the value of `i` after it was increased by the next `x`; `c` is a list containing the value of `j`; `p` is updated with the new value of `i`.**

Explanation: The code `p.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` to the list `p`. The values of other variables (`x`, `j`, `l`) remain unchanged. The value of `i` is updated according to the initial state, and now `p` contains the latest value of `i`.
