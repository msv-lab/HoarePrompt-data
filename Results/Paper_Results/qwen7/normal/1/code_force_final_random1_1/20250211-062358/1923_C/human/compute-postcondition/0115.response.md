Postcondition: `m` must be greater than 0, `a` and `b` are updated to new integer values from the input, `i` is `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, `s` is `p[b] - p[a - 1]`. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, then the condition is met and no further changes are made. Otherwise, the condition is not met, and no further changes are made either.
