You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer; for each test case, n and q are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 × 10^5; c is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9; for each query, l_i and r_i are positive integers such that 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        p = [0]
        
        c = [0]
        
        i, j = 0, 0
        
        for x in l:
            if x == 1:
                j += 1
            i += x
            p.append(i)
            c.append(j)
        
        for _ in range(m):
            a, b = map(int, input().split())
            i = c[b] - c[a - 1]
            s = p[b] - p[a - 1]
            if b - a + 1 > 1 and s - (b - a + 1) >= i:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `m` will be 0 because `m` is decremented in each iteration of the inner loop until it reaches 0. The variables `a` and `b` will contain the values from the last input pair of integers provided during the loop's execution. The variable `i` will be `c[b] - c[a - 1]`, which represents the count of 1s between indices `a-1` and `b` inclusive. The variable `s` will be `p[b] - p[a - 1]`, representing the sum of elements between indices `a-1` and `b` inclusive. The condition `b - a + 1 > 1 and s - (b - a + 1) >= i` will be evaluated for the last input pair, and either 'YES' or 'NO' will be printed based on the result. The lists `p` and `c` will be fully constructed based on the input sequence `l`, with `p` containing cumulative sums and `c` containing cumulative counts of 1s. Variables `j` and the input list `l` will remain unchanged from their initial states as they are not affected by the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer `t`, followed by multiple queries involving integers `n` and `q`, a list `c` of `n` positive integers, and for each query, two integers `l_i` and `r_i`. For each query, it checks the range defined by `l_i` and `r_i` within the list `c` and returns the result based on specific conditions.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
