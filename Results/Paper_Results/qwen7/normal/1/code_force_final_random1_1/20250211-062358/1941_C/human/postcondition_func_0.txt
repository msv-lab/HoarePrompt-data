The function processes multiple test cases, counting the total occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in each input string `s`. For each test case, it reads an integer `a`, an integer `n`, and a string `s` of length `n`. It then prints the sum of the counts of 'map' and 'pie' in `s`. After processing all test cases, the function outputs the total count of 'map' and 'pie' across all input strings.
