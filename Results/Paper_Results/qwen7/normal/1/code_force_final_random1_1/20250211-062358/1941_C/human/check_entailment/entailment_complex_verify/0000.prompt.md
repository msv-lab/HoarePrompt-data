You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has a string s of length n . Rudolf considers the string s to be ugly
if it contains the substring^\dagger "pie" or the substring "map", otherwise
the string s will be considered beautiful.

For example, "ppiee", "mmap", "dfpiefghmap" are ugly strings, while "mathp",
"ppiiee" are beautiful strings.

Rudolf wants to shorten the string s by removing some characters to make it
beautiful.

The main character doesn't like to strain, so he asks you to make the string
beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters. He can remove
characters from any positions in the string (not just from the beginning or
end of the string).

^\dagger String a is a substring of b if there exists a consecutive segment of
characters in string b equal to a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^6
) — the length of the string s .

The next line of each test case contains the string s of length n . The string
s consists of lowercase Latin letters.

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of characters
that need to be deleted to make the string s beautiful. If the string is
initially beautiful, then output 0 .

Note

In the first test case, for example, you can delete the 4 th and 9 th
characters to make the string beautiful.

In the second test case, the string is already beautiful.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        s = input()
        x = s.count('map')
        y = s.count('pie')
        print(x + y)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, and s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with length n. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        
        s = input()
        
        x = s.count('map')
        
        y = s.count('pie')
        
        print(x + y)
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `a` will contain the input integer for each test case, `s` will be the input string for each test case, `x` will be the total count of occurrences of 'map' across all input strings, and `y` will be the total count of occurrences of 'pie' across all input strings. The loop processes each test case independently, so the final values of `x` and `y` are the sums of their respective counts from all the input strings provided.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, counting the total occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in each input string `s`. For each test case, it reads an integer `a`, an integer `n`, and a string `s` of length `n`. It then prints the sum of the counts of 'map' and 'pie' in `s`. After processing all test cases, the function outputs the total count of 'map' and 'pie' across all input strings.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the removal of the minimum number of characters to make the string beautiful. Instead, it simply counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" and prints their sum. This approach does not guarantee that the minimum number of deletions is performed. For example, consider the input "mappppie":

- The program would count 1 occurrence of "map" and 1 occurrence of "pie", resulting in a total of 2 deletions.
- However, the optimal solution would be to delete the first "m" and the last "e" to make the string "appppi", which is beautiful with only 2 deletions but does not remove all instances of "map" and "pie".

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
