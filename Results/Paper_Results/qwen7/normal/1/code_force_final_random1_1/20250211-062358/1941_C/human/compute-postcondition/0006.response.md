Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is defined by the expression `range(int(input()))`. This means the loop will run based on the integer value entered by the user.

2. **Determine the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
   - `a` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive.
   - `s` is a string input by the user.
   - `x` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in `s`.
   - `y` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as the user inputs an integer value. The loop variable `_` is used here, which typically indicates that the loop variable itself is not being used within the loop body (though it could be used if needed).

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, the user needs to input another integer. The current state does not need to change because the loop condition is solely dependent on the user input, which is not provided in the current state.

5. **Formulate the New State**: Since the only thing that changes is the user input, we need to reflect this in the new state. The new state should indicate that the user is about to input another integer.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`a` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive; `s` is a string input by the user; `x` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in `s`; `y` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`; the user is about to input another integer**.
