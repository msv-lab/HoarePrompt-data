Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `a` will be the input integer from the last iteration, `s` will be the string input in the last iteration, `x` will be the number of occurrences of 'map' in `s`, and `y` will be the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`. The final value of `x + y` will be printed after processing all test cases.
