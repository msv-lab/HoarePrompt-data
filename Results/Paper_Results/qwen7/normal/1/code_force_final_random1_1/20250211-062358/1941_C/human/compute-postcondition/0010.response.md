Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `s` is a new string input by the user, `x` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in `s`, `y` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`, and `y` is updated to the count of 'pie' in `s`.**

In this case, the code `y = s.count('pie')` updates the value of `y` to be the number of times the substring 'pie' appears in the string `s`. The values of `a`, `s`, `x`, and the updated `y` are now known based on the operation performed.
