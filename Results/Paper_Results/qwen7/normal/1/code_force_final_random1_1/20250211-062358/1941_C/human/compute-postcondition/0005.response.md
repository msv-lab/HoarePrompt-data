Based on the initial state provided:

- `a` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive.
- `s` is a string input by the user.
- `x` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in `s`.
- `y` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`.

The `print(x + y)` statement will print the sum of the occurrences of 'map' and 'pie' in the string `s`.

Since the exact string `s` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `x + y`. However, we know that `x` and `y` are counts of specific substrings within `s`.

Output: **x + y (where x is the number of occurrences of 'map' in s and y is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in s)**
