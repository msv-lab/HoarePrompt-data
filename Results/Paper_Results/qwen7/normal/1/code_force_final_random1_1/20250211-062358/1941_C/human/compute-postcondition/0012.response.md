Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `range(int(input()))`. This means the loop will run based on the integer input provided by the user.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` is an input integer.
   - `s` is a new string input by the user.
   - `x` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in `s`.
   - `y` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as the user inputs a positive integer. The loop body is omitted, but we know it processes some input and updates the state accordingly.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will execute again if the user inputs a positive integer.
   - Therefore, the only variable that needs to be adjusted is the integer input `a`, which controls the number of iterations.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - Since the loop will execute again if the user inputs a positive integer, `a` must be a positive integer.
   - The values of `s`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged from the previous iteration.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `a` is a positive integer, `s` is a new string input by the user, `x` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in `s`, `y` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`**
