Reasoning:
1. The problem requires moving chips to the left to form a single block without any free cells between them, minimizing the number of operations.
2. The annotated program attempts to solve this by finding the indices of the first and last '1's in the input string and then counting the '0's between these indices.
3. However, the logic in the annotated program is flawed:
   - It does not correctly handle cases where the first or last cell contains a chip.
   - It does not ensure that the chips are moved to form a contiguous block.
   - The approach of simply counting '0's between the first and last '1's does not guarantee the minimum number of operations required to achieve the goal.

Given the above reasoning, the annotated program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
