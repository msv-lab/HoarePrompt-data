Output State: `t` must be a positive integer, `n` is an input integer for each iteration, `arr` is the input string without spaces for each iteration, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` (if '1' is not found, `x` remains -1) for each iteration, `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in `arr` (if '1' is not found, `y` remains -1) for each iteration, `z` is the substring of `arr` starting from index `x` and ending at index `n - y - 1` for each iteration, and the final result is the count of '0's in `z` for each iteration.

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will be the total number of iterations, each iteration will have its own `n`, `arr`, `x`, `y`, and `z` based on user inputs, and the output will be the count of '0's in `z` for each iteration. The final output will be a series of counts of '0's from each iteration.
