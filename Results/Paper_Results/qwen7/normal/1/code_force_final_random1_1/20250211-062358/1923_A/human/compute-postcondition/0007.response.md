Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `arr` is a string obtained by joining the input string after splitting it on spaces.
   - `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`, if '1' is not found, `x` is -1.
   - `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in `arr` (considering the reversed string).
   - `z` is a substring of `arr` starting from index `x` and ending at index `n-y-1`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(z.count('0'))
   ```

To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the components of `z`:

- `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`.
- `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in `arr` (considering the reversed string), which means `y` is the same as the index of the first occurrence of '1' from the end of `arr`.
- `z` is a substring of `arr` from index `x` to `n-y-1`.

Given these definitions, `z` is a substring that starts right after the first '1' and ends just before the last '1' from the end. This means `z` contains all characters between the first and last '1' in `arr`.

Since `z` is a substring of `arr` and we need to count the number of '0's in `z`, the output will depend on the specific content of `arr` within the range `[x, n-y-1]`.

However, without the exact value of `arr`, we can only describe the process:

- `z` is derived from `arr` based on the indices `x` and `y`.
- We then count the number of '0's in this substring `z`.

Thus, the output will be the count of '0's in the substring `z`.

Output: **the count of '0's in the substring z (where z is the substring of arr from index x to n-y-1)**
