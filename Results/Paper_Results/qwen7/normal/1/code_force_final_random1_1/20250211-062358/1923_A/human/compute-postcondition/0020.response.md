Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the input string without spaces, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` (if '1' is not found, `x` remains -1), `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in `arr` when read from the end (if '1' is not found, `y` remains -1), `z` is assigned the value of `arr[x:n - y]`, `n` is updated to an input integer, the string `arr` is updated to a version without spaces, `z` is the substring of `arr` starting from index `x` and ending at index `n - y - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `z = arr[x:n - y]` slices the string `arr` from index `x` to `n - y - 1` and assigns it to `z`. The values of `t`, `n`, `arr`, `x`, `y`, and `z` are updated as described. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 0 and `n` is an input integer remains unchanged. The string `arr` is updated to remove any spaces, and `z` is set to the sliced substring.
