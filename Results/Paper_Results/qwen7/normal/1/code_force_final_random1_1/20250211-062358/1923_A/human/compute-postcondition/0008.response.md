Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(t)`. The only variable here is `t`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `t` is greater than 0.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `arr` is a string obtained by joining the input string after splitting it on spaces.
   - `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`, if '1' is not found, `x` is -1.
   - `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in `arr` (considering the reversed string).
   - `z` is a substring of `arr` starting from index `x` and ending at index `n-y-1`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues as long as `t > 0`, we need to decrement `t` by 1 for the next iteration.
   - All other variables (`n`, `arr`, `x`, `y`, `z`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a string obtained by joining the input string after splitting it on spaces, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`, if '1' is not found, `x` is -1; `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in `arr` (considering the reversed string); `z` is a substring of `arr` starting from index `x` and ending at index `n-y-1`**.
