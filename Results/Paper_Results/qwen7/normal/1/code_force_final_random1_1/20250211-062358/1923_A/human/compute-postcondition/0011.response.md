Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the input string without spaces, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` (if '1' is not found, `x` remains -1), `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in `arr` (considering the reversed string), `z` is a substring of `arr` starting from index `x` and ending at index `n-y-1`; `x` is updated to the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`.**

The code updates the variable `x` to the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the string `arr`. If '1' is not found, `x` remains -1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `arr`, `y`, `z`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
