Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the input string without spaces, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` (if '1' is not found, `x` remains -1), `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string `arr` (if '1' is not found, `y` remains -1), `z` is a substring of `arr` starting from index `x` and ending at index `n - y - 1`, `z` is assigned the value of `arr[x:n - y]`**.

This means that the variable `z` now holds a substring of `arr` starting from the index `x` and ending at the index `n - y - 1`. All other variables retain their original conditions or values.
