Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the input string without spaces, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` (if '1' is not found, `x` remains -1), `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in `arr` when read from the end (if '1' is not found, `y` remains -1), `z` is a substring of `arr` starting from index `x` and ending at index `n - y - 1`, `z` is assigned the value of `arr[x:n - y]`, `n` is updated to an input integer, the string `arr` is updated to a version without spaces.**

Explanation: The code `y = arr[::-1].find('1')` finds the index of the last occurrence of '1' in `arr` when read from the end. This index is stored in `y`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
