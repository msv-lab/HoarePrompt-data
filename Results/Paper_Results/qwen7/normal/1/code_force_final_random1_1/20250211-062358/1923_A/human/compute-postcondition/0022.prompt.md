Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, inclusive.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input(''))
    arr = ''.join(input('').split())
    x = arr.find('1')
    y = arr[::-1].find('1')
    z = arr[x:n - y]
    print(z.count('0'))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a string obtained by joining the input string after splitting it on spaces, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`, if '1' is not found, `x` is -1; `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in `arr` (considering the reversed string); `z` is a substring of `arr` starting from index `x` and ending at index `n-y-1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the input string without spaces, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` (if '1' is not found, `x` remains -1), `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string `arr` (if '1' is not found, `y` remains -1), `z` is a substring of `arr` starting from index `x` and ending at index `n - y - 1`, `z` is assigned the value of `arr[x:n - y]`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the input string without spaces, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` (if '1' is not found, `x` remains -1), `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in `arr` when read from the end (if '1' is not found, `y` remains -1), `z` is assigned the value of `arr[x:n - y]`, `n` is updated to an input integer, the string `arr` is updated to a version without spaces, `z` is the substring of `arr` starting from index `x` and ending at index `n - y - 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
