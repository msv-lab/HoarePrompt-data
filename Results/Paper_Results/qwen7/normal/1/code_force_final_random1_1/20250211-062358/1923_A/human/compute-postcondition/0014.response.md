Let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` must be greater than 1.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `arr` is a string without spaces.
   - `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`. If '1' is not found, `x` remains -1.
   - `y` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string `arr`. If '1' is not found, `y` remains -1.
   - `z` is a substring of `arr` starting from index `x` and ending at index `n - y - 1`. If `x` or `y` is -1, `z` is an empty string.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(z.count('0'))
   ```

Given this, let's analyze the value of `z`:

- If `x` is -1, then `z` is an empty string.
- If `y` is -1, then `z` is the substring from index `x` to the end of the string `arr`.

The value of `z` depends on the positions of the first '1' in `arr` and the reversed `arr`.

### Case Analysis:
1. **Case 1: `x` is -1**:
   - In this case, `z` is an empty string.
   - `z.count('0')` will return 0 because there are no characters in an empty string.
   - Output: **0**

2. **Case 2: `x` is not -1 and `y` is -1**:
   - Here, `z` is the substring from `x` to the end of `arr`.
   - `z.count('0')` will count the number of '0's in the substring from `x` to the end of `arr`.
   - Output: **Number of '0's in the substring from `x` to the end of `arr`**

3. **Case 3: Both `x` and `y` are not -1**:
   - Here, `z` is the substring from `x` to `n - y - 1`.
   - `z.count('0')` will count the number of '0's in the substring from `x` to `n - y - 1`.
   - Output: **Number of '0's in the substring from `x` to `n - y - 1`**

Since the exact values of `x` and `y` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact count of '0's in `z`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the output will depend on the specific values of `x` and `y`.

### Final Output:
Output: **Number of '0's in the substring from `x` to `n - y - 1` (if both `x` and `y` are not -1; otherwise, 0 if `x` is -1)**
