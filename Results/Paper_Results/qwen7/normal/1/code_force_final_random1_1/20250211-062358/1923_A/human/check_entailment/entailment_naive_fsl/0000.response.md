Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to move all chips into a single block. Specifically, the program fails to handle cases where chips are scattered in such a way that moving them to form a single block requires more than just moving the farthest chip to the nearest free cell to the left.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
4
1 0 1 1
```
The correct output should be `2` because we need to move the chip in the 2nd cell to the 1st cell and the chip in the 4th cell to the 3rd cell. However, the program will incorrectly output `1` because it only finds the first occurrence of '1' from the left and the last occurrence of '1' from the right, which does not account for the optimal sequence of moves.

To fix this, the program needs to consider all possible sequences of moves and find the minimum number of operations required to move all chips into a single block.
