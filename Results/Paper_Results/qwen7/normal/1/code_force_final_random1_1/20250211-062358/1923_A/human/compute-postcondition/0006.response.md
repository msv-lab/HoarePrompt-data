Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a string obtained by joining the input string after splitting it on spaces, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`, if '1' is not found, `x` is -1; `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in `arr` (considering the reversed string); `z` is a substring of `arr` starting from index `x` and ending at index `n-y-1`.**

Explanation: The code `z = arr[x:n - y]` slices the string `arr` from index `x` to `n - y - 1`. The value of `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`, and `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in `arr` when considering the reversed string. The slice operation extracts the substring between these two indices. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
