Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 4, `s` is a new input string, `count` is the total number of times the condition `s[j] != s[j + 1]` was met, `flag` is True, `j` is equal to `len(s) - 1`.**

This postcondition states that after the execution of the if-else block, `t` remains greater than 0, `i` remains 4, `s` remains a new input string, `count` represents the total number of times the condition `s[j] != s[j + 1]` was met during the loop's execution, `flag` remains True, and `j` is equal to `len(s) - 1`.
