You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 1
        flag = False
        j = 0
        while j < len(s) - 1:
            if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
                count += 1
                if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                    flag = True
            j += 1
        if flag:
            count -= 1
        print(count)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and for each test case, s is a binary string such that 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        
        count = 1
        
        flag = False
        
        j = 0
        
        while j < len(s) - 1:
            if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
                count += 1
                if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                    flag = True
            j += 1

        print(count)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `t`, `s` is the last input string processed, `count` is the total number of times the condition `s[j] != s[j + 1]` was met across all strings, `flag` is True if any string had a segment where `s[j] == '0'` and `s[j + 1] == '1'`, and `j` is equal to `len(s) - 1`.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will still be greater than 0 (since it was initialized as such and not modified within the loop), `i` will be equal to `t` (as the loop runs from 0 to `t-1`), `s` will be the last string input, `count` will hold the cumulative count of transitions from '0' to '1' across all strings, `flag` will be True if any string contained such a transition, and `j` will be equal to the length of the last string minus one.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `t` and a binary string `s`. For each test case, it counts the number of times the binary string transitions from '0' to '1'. If any string contains a transition from '0' to '1', it subtracts one from the count. Finally, it prints the adjusted count for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `s`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - `count` is initialized to 1. This variable will keep track of the number of pieces.
   - `flag` is a boolean variable initialized to `False`. It will be used to check if there is a transition from '0' to '1' in the string.
   - `j` is an index variable initialized to 0.

3. **Main Loop**:
   - The loop runs from `j = 0` to `len(s) - 1`.
   - If the current character `s[j]` is different from the next character `s[j + 1]`, it means we have encountered a boundary between two different characters.
     - `count` is incremented because a new piece is identified.
     - If the current character is '0' and the next character is '1', the `flag` is set to `True`.

4. **Final Adjustment**:
   - After the loop, if `flag` is `True`, it means there was at least one transition from '0' to '1'. In this case, we decrement `count` by 1 because the last piece can be combined with the previous piece.

5. **Output**:
   - The final value of `count` is printed, which represents the minimum number of pieces needed.

### Testing the Logic

To verify the logic, let's consider the example test cases provided:

1. **Test Case "11010"**:
   - The string has transitions at indices 2 and 3.
   - Initial `count` is 1.
   - Transition at index 2: `count` becomes 2.
   - Transition at index 3: `count` becomes 3.
   - Since there is a transition from '0' to '1', `flag` is set to `True`, and `count` is decremented by 1.
   - Final `count` is 2, but since we need to ensure all pieces are correctly counted, the correct answer should be 3 (as the last piece can be combined).

2. **Test Case "00000000"**:
   - No transitions, so `count` remains 1.
   - Final `count` is 1.

3. **Test Case "1"**:
   - No transitions, so `count` remains 1.
   - Final `count` is 1.

4. **Test Case "10"**:
   - One transition at index 0.
   - Initial `count` is 1.
   - Transition at index 0: `count` becomes 2.
   - Since there is a transition from '0' to '1', `flag` is set to `True`, and `count` is decremented by 1.
   - Final `count` is 2, but the correct answer should be 2.

5. **Test Case "0001111"**:
   - No transitions, so `count` remains 1.
   - Final `count` is 1.

6. **Test Case "0110"**:
   - Transitions at indices 0 and 3.
   - Initial `count` is 1.
   - Transition at index 0: `count` becomes 2.
   - Transition at index 3: `count` becomes 3.
   - Since there is a transition from '0' to '1', `flag` is set to `True`, and `count` is decremented by 1.
   - Final `count` is 2.

### Conclusion

Upon re-evaluation, the program does not correctly handle the cases where the string starts or ends with '1'. Specifically, the logic for counting pieces needs to be adjusted to account for these edge cases.

### Corrected Program

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 1
        flag = False
        j = 0
        while j < len(s) - 1:
            if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
                count += 1
                if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                    flag = True
            j += 1
        # Adjust count for strings starting or ending with '1'
        if s[0] == '1' or s[-1] == '1':
            count += 1
        if flag:
            count -= 1
        print(count)
```

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**

The original program does not correctly handle all edge cases, particularly those involving strings that start or end with '1'. The corrected program above addresses these issues.
