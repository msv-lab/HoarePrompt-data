Postcondition: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 4, `s` is a new input string, `count` is 1, `flag` is False, `j` is 0, and the current value of `j` is less than the length of `s` - 1, with the additional condition that the character at index `j` in `s` is not equal to the character at index `j + 1` in `s`.
