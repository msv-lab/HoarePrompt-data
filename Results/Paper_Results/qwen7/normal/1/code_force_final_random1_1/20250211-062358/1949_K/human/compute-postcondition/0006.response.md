Output State: **The function `distribute_number(num)` has been called with the argument `num`, and the value of `num` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `distribute_number(num)` calls the function `distribute_number` with the argument `num`. However, the function itself is not defined in the given context, so no changes are made to the variables outside of the function call. Therefore, the value of `num` remains the same as it was in the initial state.
