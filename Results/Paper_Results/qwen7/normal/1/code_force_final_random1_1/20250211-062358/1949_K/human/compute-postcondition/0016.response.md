Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts four parameters: `n` (an integer between 3 and 200,000), `na`, `nb`, and `nc` (integers between 1 and `n-2` such that `na + nb + nc = n`), and a list of `n` positive integers `numbers`. It sorts the `numbers` list in descending order and then distributes the numbers into three groups (`group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c`) based on the function `distribute_number(num)`. After distributing the numbers, it calculates the sums of the elements in each group (`sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c`). If the function `func_1(sum_a, sum_b, sum_c)` returns `True`, it returns `'YES'` along with the three groups; otherwise, it returns `'NO'`.**
