Output State: **The program returns 'YES', group_a, group_b, group_c**

This means the program returns a tuple containing the string `'YES'` and three lists: `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c`. These lists are subsets of the original `numbers` list, and their sums (`sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c`) satisfy the condition specified by the function `func_1(sum_a, sum_b, sum_c)`. The sizes of these groups are represented by `na`, `nb`, and `nc`, which together equal the length of the `numbers` list (`n`).
