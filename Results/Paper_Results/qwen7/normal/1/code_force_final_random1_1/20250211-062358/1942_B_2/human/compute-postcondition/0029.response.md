Output State: **`i` is `len(ar) - 1`, `mex` is `mex - ar[i]`, and `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]`.**

Explanation: The value of `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[i]`. Since `i` was initially set to `len(ar) - 1` and `res[i]` was set to `mex - ar[i]`, these values remain unchanged except for the direct assignment to `mex`.
