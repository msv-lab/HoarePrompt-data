Output State: **`i` is `len(ar) - 3`, `mex` is unchanged, `res` is a list of `None` values with length `n`, and `res[i]` is equal to `mex - ar[i]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `res[i]` to `mex - ar[i]`. Since `i` is `len(ar) - 3`, the value of `res[len(ar) - 3]` is now `mex - ar[len(ar) - 3]`. The other variables (`mex` and `res`) remain unchanged.
