Output State: **`mex` is `mex - ar[len(ar) - 3]`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `res` is a list of `n` elements, all set to `n - ar[i]`, `i` is `len(ar) - 3`, `res[i]` is `mex - ar[i]`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `mex` by subtracting `ar[i]`, where `i` is `len(ar) - 3`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
