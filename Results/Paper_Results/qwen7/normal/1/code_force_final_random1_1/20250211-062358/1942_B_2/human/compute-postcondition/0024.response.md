Output State: **`mex` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from user input, `res` is a list of `n` elements where each element is `None`, and `i` is `-1`.**

The code initializes `res` as a list of `n` elements, all set to `None`. This does not change the values of `mex`, `t`, `n`, `ar`, or `i`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states, and `res` is updated to be a list of `n` `None` values.
