Output State: **`i` is `len(ar) - 2`, `mex` is unchanged, `res` is a list of `None` values with length `n`, and `res[i]` is equal to `mex - ar[i]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the `res` list by setting the element at index `i` to the value of `mex - ar[i]`. The value of `i` remains `len(ar) - 2`, `mex` remains unchanged, and `res` is still a list of `None` values with length `n`.
