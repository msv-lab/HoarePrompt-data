Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for calculating the minimum number of coins required to travel between cities. Specifically, the program uses dynamic programming to store the minimum cost to reach each city, but it does not correctly handle the unique closest city property described in the problem statement.

For instance, consider the example provided in the problem statement with cities located at points `[0, 8, 12, 15, 20]`. According to the problem, the closest city to each city is unique. However, the program attempts to compute the minimum cost using a different approach that does not account for the unique closest city property.

Here is a counterexample to illustrate the issue:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  5
  0 8 12 15 20
  5
  1 4
  1 5
  3 4
  3 2
  5 1
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  3
  8
  1
  4
  14
  ```

- Program Output (using the provided code):
  The program will not produce the correct output because it does not correctly compute the minimum cost based on the unique closest city property.

To fix this, the program needs to correctly identify the closest city for each city and then compute the minimum cost based on the rules provided in the problem statement. The current implementation does not achieve this.
