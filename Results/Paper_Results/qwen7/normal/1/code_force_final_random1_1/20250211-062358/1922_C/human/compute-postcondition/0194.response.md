Based on the initial state provided:

- `m` must be greater than 0.
- `j` is explicitly set to 1.
- `x` and `y` are input integers.
- `x` and `y` are converted from input to integers.

The `print(d2[y] - d2[x])` statement involves the following steps:

1. `d2` is a dictionary whose keys are integers and values are also integers.
2. `d2[y]` retrieves the value associated with key `y` in the dictionary `d2`.
3. `d2[x]` retrieves the value associated with key `x` in the dictionary `d2`.
4. The difference between these two values is computed and printed.

Since the actual content of `d2` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical values of `d2[y]` and `d2[x]`. However, we know that `x` and `y` are input integers.

Therefore, the output will be the difference between the values in the dictionary `d2` corresponding to the keys `y` and `x`.

Output: **d2[y] - d2[x]**
