Output State: **`i` is `n - 4`; `d2[i]` is `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `d2[i]` to `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`. This means that regardless of the previous condition (whether `l[i] - l[i - 1] < l[i + 1] - l[i]` or not), the value of `d2[i]` is now explicitly set to `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]`. The values of `i` and `d2[i]` are updated, while the rest of the initial conditions remain unchanged.
