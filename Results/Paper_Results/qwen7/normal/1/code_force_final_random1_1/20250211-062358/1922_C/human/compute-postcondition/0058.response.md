Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `j` is 1, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `x` is converted to an integer from the input, `y` is converted to an integer from the input**.

Explanation: The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input separated by a space, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `x` and `y` respectively. The initial conditions for `m` and `j` remain unchanged.
