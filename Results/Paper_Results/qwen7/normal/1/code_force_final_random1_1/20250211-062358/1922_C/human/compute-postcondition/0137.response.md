Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `m` must be greater than 0.
   - `j` is equal to `m-1`.
   - `x` and `y` are input integers and their values remain unchanged.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(int(input())):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop runs based on the value of `int(input())`.
   - Each iteration of the loop increments `i` from 0 up to the value entered by the user minus 1.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the value of `int(input())`.
   - After each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.
   - The value of `int(input())` remains the same for each iteration as it is taken once before the loop starts.

5. **Determine the New State:**
   - Let's assume the user inputs `k` (where `k` is the number of iterations).
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` would be `k-1` because the loop runs from `0` to `k-1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be `k`.

6. **Final State:**
   - `m` must still be greater than 0.
   - `j` is now `m-1` (unchanged from the previous iteration).
   - `x` and `y` remain unchanged.
   - The value of `int(input())` is `k`, and for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be `k`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `j` is equal to `m-1`, `x` and `y` are input integers, and `i` is `k`**.
