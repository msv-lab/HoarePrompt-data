Output State: **`d1[i + 2]` is set to 1 + `d1[i + 1]`, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, and the value of `n` remains unchanged.**

Given the initial state:
- `d1[i + 2]` is set based on conditions provided.
- `i` is 2.
- `n` must be greater than 2.
- `n` remains the same.

The code snippet updates `d1[i + 2]` to be `1 + d1[i + 1]`. Since `i` is 2, `d1[i + 2]` becomes `d1[4]` and is set to `1 + d1[3]`.

The output state reflects these changes while keeping the other conditions intact.
