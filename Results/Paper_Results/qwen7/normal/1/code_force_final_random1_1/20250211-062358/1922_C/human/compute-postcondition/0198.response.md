Based on the initial state provided:

- `m` must be greater than 0 (though its value is not needed to determine the output).
- `j` is explicitly given as 2.
- `x` is an input integer.
- `y` is an input integer.

The code snippet to be executed is:

```python
print(d1[y] - d1[x])
```

Here, `d1` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it is clear that `d1` is a dictionary. The values being accessed from this dictionary are `d1[y]` and `d1[x]`, which correspond to the values associated with keys `y` and `x` respectively in the dictionary `d1`.

Therefore, the expression `d1[y] - d1[x]` computes the difference between the value at key `y` and the value at key `x` in the dictionary `d1`.

Given the information, the output will be the result of subtracting the value at key `x` from the value at key `y` in the dictionary `d1`.

Output: **d1[y] - d1[x]**
