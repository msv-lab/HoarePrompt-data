Postcondition: `d2[i]` is set to `1 + d2[i + 1]` if `(l[i] - l[i - 1]) < (l[i + 1] - l[i])` for each relevant `i` from `n-2` to `1`. Otherwise, `d2[i]` is updated to `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]` for each relevant `i` from `n-2` to `1`. `d1` remains unchanged, `n` is at least 3, and `i` starts from `n-2` and decrements to `1`.
