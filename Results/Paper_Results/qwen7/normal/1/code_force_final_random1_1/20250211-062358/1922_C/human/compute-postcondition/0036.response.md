Postcondition: `d2` and `d1` remain unchanged, `n` is at least 3, and `i` starts from `n-2` and decrements to `1`. If `(l[i] - l[i - 1])` is less than `(l[i + 1] - l[i])`, then `d2[i]` is set to `1 + d2[i + 1]`. Otherwise, `d2[i]` is updated to `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]` for each `i` from `n-2` to `1`.
