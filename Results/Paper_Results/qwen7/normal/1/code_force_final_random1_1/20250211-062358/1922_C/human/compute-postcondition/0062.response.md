Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `m` must be greater than 0.
   - `j` is 1.
   - `x` and `y` are input integers.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` in the range `range(m)`.
   - This means `j` starts from 0 and goes up to `m-1`.

3. **Current State Analysis:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be 0 (the first iteration).

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since `j` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be set to 0.
   - The value of `m` does not change as long as it remains greater than 0.
   - The values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged unless they are modified within the loop body, but since no such modification is mentioned, they stay the same.

5. **Final State:**
   - `m` must still be greater than 0.
   - `j` must be 0.
   - `x` and `y` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `j` is 0, `x` and `y` are input integers**.
