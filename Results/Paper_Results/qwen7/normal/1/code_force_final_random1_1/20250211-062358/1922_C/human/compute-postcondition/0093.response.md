Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, the variable `i` will be `n-1`, and `d1[n+1]` will be determined based on the conditions inside the loop. Specifically, `d1[n+1]` will be calculated as follows:

If for any `i` from 1 to `n-2`, the condition `l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]` holds true, then `d1[i + 2]` will incrementally build up from `d1[i + 1]` by adding 1 for each such occurrence. Otherwise, `d1[i + 2]` will be updated to `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]`.

In summary, `d1[n+1]` will be the sum of `d1[2]` (which is initially set to 1) and the number of times the condition `l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]` is true for `i` ranging from 1 to `n-2`, plus the cumulative differences `l[i + 1] - l[i]` when the condition does not hold.
