The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `m`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `m` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `m` must still be greater than 0.

State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `j` is 2**
