Postcondition: `d1[i + 2]` is set based on the conditions provided. If `l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]`, then `d1[i + 2]` is set to 1 plus the previous value of `d1[i + 1]`. Otherwise, `d1[i + 2]` is set to `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]`. Additionally, `i` is incremented by 1 and remains within the range `1` to `n-2`.
