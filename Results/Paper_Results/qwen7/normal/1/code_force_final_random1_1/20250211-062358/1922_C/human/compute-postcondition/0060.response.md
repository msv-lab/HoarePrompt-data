Given the initial state and the code snippet:

- `m` must be greater than 0.
- `j` is 1.
- `x` is an input integer.
- `y` is an input integer.
- `x` is converted to an integer from the input.
- `y` is converted to an integer from the input.

The code snippet is:
```python
print(d2[y] - d2[x])
```

Here, `d2` is a dictionary, but its contents are not specified in the initial state. Since the values of `x` and `y` are derived from user inputs, and there is no explicit value given for `d2`, we need to consider the general form of the expression.

The expression `d2[y] - d2[x]` will subtract the value of `d2[x]` from the value of `d2[y]`.

Since the exact values of `d2[x]` and `d2[y]` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these values.

Output: **d2[y] - d2[x]**
