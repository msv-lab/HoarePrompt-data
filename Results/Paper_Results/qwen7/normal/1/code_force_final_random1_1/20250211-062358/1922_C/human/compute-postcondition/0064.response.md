Based on the initial state provided:

- `m` must be greater than 0 (though its value is not needed for this specific print statement).
- `j` is 0.
- `x` is an input integer.
- `y` is an input integer.

The print statement is `print(d1[y] - d1[x])`.

However, the initial state does not provide any information about `d1`, which is a dictionary. Without knowing the contents of `d1`, we cannot determine the exact values that will be printed. We can only describe it in terms of the keys and values within `d1`.

Given the information, the output will depend on the values of `d1[x]` and `d1[y]`.

Output: **d1[y] - d1[x]**
