Based on the initial state provided:

- `m` must be greater than 0 (though this does not affect the print statement).
- `j` is explicitly defined as 2.
- `x` is an input integer.
- `y` is an input integer.

The print statement is `print(d2[y] - d2[x])`.

Here, `d2` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it is assumed to be a dictionary or a similar structure where keys map to values. Since `x` and `y` are input integers, `d2[x]` and `d2[y]` would refer to the values associated with keys `x` and `y` respectively in the dictionary `d2`.

Therefore, the expression `d2[y] - d2[x]` calculates the difference between the value at key `y` and the value at key `x` in the dictionary `d2`.

Output: **d2[y] - d2[x]** (where `d2[y]` and `d2[x]` are the values from the dictionary `d2` corresponding to keys `y` and `x` respectively).
