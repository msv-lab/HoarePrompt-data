Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `m`.

2. **Determine the initial values at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `m` must be greater than 0.
   - `j` is 0.
   - `x` is an input integer.
   - `y` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `j < m`.

4. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts at 0 and increases by 1 with each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `m` must still be greater than 0 (since `j` will now be 1 and the condition `j < m` needs to hold).

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `j` will be 1.
   - `m` must still be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

6. **Consider the loop body**: The loop body is omitted, but based on the postcondition, if `y` is less than or equal to `x`, no changes are made to `m` and `j`. Therefore, these values remain unchanged from the previous iteration.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are `j` and `m`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `j` is 1, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer**
