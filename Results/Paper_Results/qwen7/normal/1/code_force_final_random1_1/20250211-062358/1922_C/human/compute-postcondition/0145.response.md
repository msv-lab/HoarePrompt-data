Output State: **`d1[i + 2]` is set to `1 + d1[i + 1]`, the difference between `l[i + 1]` and `l[i]` is less than the difference between `l[i]` and `l[i - 1]`.**

This means that the value of `d1[i + 2]` has been updated to `1 + d1[i + 1]`, while the condition about the differences between elements in list `l` remains unchanged.
