Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `j` is equal to `m-1`, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `i` is `k`, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`**.

Explanation: The code initializes a `defaultdict` named `d1` with the default factory set to `int`. This means that `d1` is a dictionary where any key that does not exist will automatically have a default value of `0`. None of the other variables (`m`, `j`, `x`, `y`, `i`, `n`, `l`) are affected by this line of code. Therefore, their states remain unchanged.
