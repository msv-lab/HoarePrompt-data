Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `i` is `n - 3`
- `d2[i]` is either `1 + d2[i + 1]` if `l[i] - l[i - 1] < l[i + 1] - l[i]`, or `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]` if the condition is not met.

### Loop Head
The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(n - 2, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Variable `i`:**
   - The loop starts from `n - 2` and decrements by 1 until it reaches 1 (exclusive).
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n - 3`.

2. **Condition for Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` should be `n - 4` at the start of the next iteration.

3. **Other Variables:**
   - `d2[i]` is dependent on the value of `i` and the condition evaluated within the loop.
   - Since the loop body is omitted, we cannot determine the exact value of `d2[i]` without knowing the outcome of the condition check. However, the state of `d2[i]` will change based on the condition check during the loop execution.

### New State at the Start of the Next Iteration
- `i` will be `n - 4`.
- `d2[i]` will be updated based on the condition check during the next iteration, but its exact value is unknown without the loop body.

### Final Answer
State: **`i` is `n - 4`, `d2[i]` is either `1 + d2[i + 1]` if `l[i] - l[i - 1] < l[i + 1] - l[i]`, or `l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]` if the condition is not met.**
