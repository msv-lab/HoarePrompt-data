Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `m` must be greater than 0.
   - `j` will be equal to the total number of iterations `m`.
   - `x` and `y` will be the last pair of integers inputted by the user.
   - No changes are made to `d1` or `d2` throughout the loop executions.

2. **Loop Head Analysis:**
   - The loop is defined as `for i in range(int(input())):`.
   - The variable `i` is used as the loop counter, but it is not mentioned in the initial state.
   - The loop condition depends on the value of `int(input())`, which is read at the start of each iteration.

3. **Adjusting States for Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop reads a new value from `input()` at the start of each iteration, the value of `int(input())` will change.
   - The variable `m` must be decremented by 1 because it represents the total number of iterations.
   - `j` will be equal to `m` after the decrement.
   - `x` and `y` will remain the same as they were in the previous iteration since they are not modified within the loop.
   - `d1` and `d2` remain unchanged as per the given conditions.

4. **New State Calculation:**
   - `m` must be greater than 0 and will be decremented by 1.
   - `j` will be equal to the new value of `m`.
   - `x` and `y` will remain the same.
   - `d1` and `d2` remain unchanged.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`m` must be greater than 1, `j` will be equal to `m-1`, `x` and `y` will be the last pair of integers inputted by the user, and no changes are made to `d1` or `d2` throughout the loop executions.**
