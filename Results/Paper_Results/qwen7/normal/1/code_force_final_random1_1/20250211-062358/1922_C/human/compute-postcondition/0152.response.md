Output State: **`d1[i + 2]` is set to `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]`, `i` is now `i + 1`, and `i + 1` must be within the range `1` to `n-2`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `d1[i + 2]` based on the formula `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]`. It also increments `i` by 1. The condition that `i + 1` must be within the range `1` to `n-2` remains unchanged.
