Based on the initial state provided:

- `m` must be greater than 0 (though its exact value is not needed for this specific print statement).
- `j` is 0.
- `x` is an input integer.
- `y` is an input integer.
- The current value of `y` is greater than the current value of `x`.

The print statement is `print(d1[y] - d1[x])`. To determine what will be printed, we need to understand what `d1` is. Since `d1` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we can infer that `d1` is likely a dictionary or a list where the keys or indices correspond to the values of `x` and `y`.

Given that `y > x`, the expression `d1[y] - d1[x]` will subtract the value at index `x` from the value at index `y` in `d1`.

Since the exact nature of `d1` is not specified, we can only describe it in terms of its behavior with respect to `x` and `y`.

Output: **d1[y] - d1[x] (where d1 is a data structure such that d1[y] is the value at index y and d1[x] is the value at index x, and y > x)**
