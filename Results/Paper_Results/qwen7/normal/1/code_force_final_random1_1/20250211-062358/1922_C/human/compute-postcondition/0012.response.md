Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, and `d1[i + 2]` is equal to `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `d1[i + 2]` to `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]`. Given the initial conditions, `i` was 1, so now `i` is updated to 2. The condition that `n` must be greater than 1 remains unchanged. The new value of `d1[i + 2]` is calculated using the given formula, where `i` is now 2.
