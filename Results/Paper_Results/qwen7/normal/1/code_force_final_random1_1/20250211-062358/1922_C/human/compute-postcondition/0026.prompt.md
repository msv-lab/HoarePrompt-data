Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory `int` where `d1[2]` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n - 1):
    if l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]:
        d1[i + 2] = 1 + d1[i + 1]
    else:
        d1[i + 2] = l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, and the list `l` has at least three elements. If the difference between the second and first element of `l` is less than the difference between the first and the second-to-first element of `l`, then `d1[i + 2]` is 1 + `d1[i + 1]`. Otherwise, `d1[i + 2]` is equal to `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 4, and the list `l` has at least three elements; if `l[5] - l[4] < l[4] - l[3]`, then `d1[5]` is `d1[4] + 1`; otherwise, `d1[5]` is `l[4] - l[3] + d1[4]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 4, and `l` has at least three elements. If `l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]`, then `d1[i + 2]` is set to `2 + d1[i + 1]`. Otherwise, `d1[i + 2]` is set to `l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
