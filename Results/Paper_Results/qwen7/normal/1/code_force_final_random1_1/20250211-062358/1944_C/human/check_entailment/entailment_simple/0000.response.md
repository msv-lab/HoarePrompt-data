### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves two players, Alice and Bob, playing a game on an array `a` of size `n`. Alice picks an element from `a` and appends it to her array `c`, then removes it from `a`. Bob picks an element from `a` and removes it without appending. The goal is to determine the MEX of `c` when the game ends, considering both players play optimally.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - Alice can always pick the smallest available element to ensure the MEX is maximized.
   - Bob can pick any remaining element to minimize the MEX.
   - The optimal strategy for Alice is to pick elements in ascending order, ensuring that the smallest missing non-negative integer (MEX) is maximized.

3. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code provided does not match the problem description. It includes unused functions (`build_tree`, `bs`, `kadane`, `dfs`) and a placeholder function `func_1` that is never called.
   - The actual logic for solving the problem is implemented in the `func_1` function, but it is incomplete and does not correctly solve the problem.

4. **Correct Logic**:
   - Alice should pick elements in ascending order to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob should pick any remaining elements to minimize the MEX.
   - The MEX of `c` can be determined by finding the smallest non-negative integer not present in `c`.

5. **Correct Implementation**:
   - Use a counter to count the occurrences of each element in `arr`.
   - Iterate through the possible values (0 to n-1) and check if they are present in the counter.
   - The first missing value is the MEX.

6. **Given Code**:
   - The `func_1` function attempts to implement this logic but is incomplete and incorrect.
   - The logic in `func_1` does not correctly handle the optimal strategy for both players.

### Conclusion:
The given code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the provided program is **False**.

**Correctness: **False**
