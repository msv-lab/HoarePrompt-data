Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The only variable in the loop head is `nums.get(start, 0)`.
2. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `nums.get(start, 0)` is not zero. This means that `start` should point to a key in `nums` that has a non-zero value.
3. **Current state before the loop**: `start` is 0, and `vis` is an empty set. However, these states do not directly affect the condition `nums.get(start, 0)`.
4. **Determine what needs to be adjusted**: For the loop to execute the first time, `nums.get(start, 0)` must be non-zero. Since `start` is currently 0, we need to ensure that `nums[0]` (or `nums.get(0, 0)`) is non-zero.

Given this analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is related to the value at `nums[0]`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`start` is 0 and `nums[0]` must be non-zero**
