### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary to understand its behavior and compare it with the requirements of the problem.

#### Function Summary Analysis:
- The function `func_1(arr)` uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each integer in the input list `arr`.
- It then iterates through the numbers starting from `0` and checks if they are present in the `vis` set.
- If a number is found, it is marked as visited, and the iteration continues.
- The loop stops when it finds the first number that is not in the `vis` set, and it prints this number.

#### Problem Requirements:
- Alice and Bob play optimally to maximize and minimize the MEX of the array `c`.
- Alice picks elements from `a` and appends them to `c`, while Bob only deletes elements from `a`.

Given these requirements, the function summary does not align with the problem's constraints and optimal strategy. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Simulation of Turns**: The function does not simulate the turns taken by Alice and Bob. Instead, it simply checks for the presence of numbers in a sequence, which is not reflective of the game's rules.
2. **Missing Optimal Strategy**: The function does not consider the optimal moves of both players. Alice aims to maximize the MEX, and Bob aims to minimize it. The current approach does not account for these strategic considerations.
3. **Incorrect Output**: The function prints the first number that is not in the `vis` set, which does not necessarily correspond to the optimal MEX value for the given input.

#### Example Analysis:
Let's revisit the example provided in the problem statement:
- Input: `3\n0 0 1 1`
- Expected Output: `2`

The correct output is `2` because:
- Alice can pick `1` first, making `c = [1]`.
- Bob can pick `0` next, making `c = [1]`.
- Alice can pick `0` next, making `c = [1, 0]`.
- Bob can pick `1` next, making `c = [1, 0]`.

The MEX of `[1, 0]` is `2`.

However, the provided function:
- Counts the occurrences of each number.
- Iterates through numbers starting from `0` and prints the first number not in the `vis` set.

This approach does not reflect the optimal strategy and will not produce the correct output for all cases.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It fails to simulate the turns taken by Alice and Bob and does not account for the optimal strategy for both players. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
