Output State: **`start` is 1; `nums[0]` is `nums[0] - 2`; `nums[1]` is `nums[1] - 1`; `vis` contains the elements 0 and 1.**

Explanation: The code `nums[start + 1] -= 1` decrements the value of `nums[start + 1]` by 1. Given that `start` is 1, `nums[start + 1]` is `nums[2]`. However, since `nums[1]` is not zero, it remains unchanged. The value of `nums[0]` is already decreased by 1 in the initial state, so it is further decreased by 1 more, making it `nums[0] - 2`. The value of `nums[1]` is also decreased by 1. The variable `vis` and `start` remain unchanged.
