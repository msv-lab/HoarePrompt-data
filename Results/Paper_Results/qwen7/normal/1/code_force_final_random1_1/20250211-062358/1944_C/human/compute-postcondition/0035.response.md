Functionality: **The function accepts a list of non-negative integers `arr` where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \le a_i < n\) and the length of the list is \(n\) (i.e., 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5). It processes the list by counting the occurrences of each integer using a counter. Then, it iterates through the list, decrementing counts and tracking visited indices until it finds the last index where the count is still greater than zero. Finally, it prints this last index and ends without returning any value.**
