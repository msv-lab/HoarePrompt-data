### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies that the given program does not correctly simulate the game or calculate the MEX optimally. Let's break down the issues and provide a more detailed analysis:

1. **Incorrect Simulation of Player Moves**:
   - The provided code does not simulate the alternating turns between Alice and Bob. It only processes the elements in a linear manner without considering the optimal choices made by each player.
   - Alice should be able to choose any element from `a` and append it to `c`, while Bob should only delete elements from `a`.

2. **Optimal Strategy Not Implemented**:
   - The logic in `func_1` does not account for the optimal moves of both players. Alice aims to maximize the MEX, while Bob aims to minimize it.
   - The current implementation does not ensure that Alice and Bob make their optimal choices, leading to an incorrect result.

3. **MEX Calculation**:
   - The MEX is calculated incorrectly because the program does not follow the optimal strategy for both players. The MEX should be determined based on the final state of `c` after both players have played optimally.

Given these points, the original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not correctly simulate the game or compute the MEX optimally.

### Final Evaluation

**Final: False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not properly simulate the game mechanics and does not compute the MEX optimally.
