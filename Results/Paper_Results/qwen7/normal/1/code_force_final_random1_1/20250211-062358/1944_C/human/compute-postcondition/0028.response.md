Output State: **The program does not return any value as there is no return statement in the provided code.**

Given the initial state:
- `start` is 2
- `nums[0]` is `nums[0] - 2`
- `nums[1]` is `nums[1] - 1`
- `nums[2]` is `nums[2] - 1`
- `vis` contains the elements 0, 1, and 2

The code provided does not contain a return statement. Therefore, the program does not return any value.
