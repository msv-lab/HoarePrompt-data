Output State: **`start` is 1; `nums[0]` is `nums[0] - 1`; `vis` contains the elements 0 and 1; the current value of `nums[start + 1]` is decreased by 1; `nums[1]` is not zero; `nums[0]` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `nums[start] -= 1` decreases the value of `nums[start]` by 1. Given that `start` is 1, it means `nums[1]` is decreased by 1. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
