Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive.
- `i` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer from the first split.
- `m` is an input integer from the second split.
- `m` is less than or equal to `n`, but `m` is not equal to `n - 1`.
- Both `m` and `n` are odd numbers.
- Either `m` is not even or `n` is not even (which is redundant since it's already stated that both are odd).

The print statement is simply:

```python
print('Yes')
```

This statement will print the string "Yes" regardless of the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `m` as long as they meet the given conditions.

Output: **Yes**
