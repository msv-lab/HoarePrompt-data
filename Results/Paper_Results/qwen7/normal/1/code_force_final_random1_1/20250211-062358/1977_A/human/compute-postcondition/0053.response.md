Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `i` is 2, `n` is the first integer from the input split, `m` is the second integer from the input split, the values of `n` and `m` are converted to integers.**

In this step, the code splits the input into two parts and converts them into integers, assigning them to `n` and `m`. The variable `t` remains unchanged, as does `i`. The initial values of `n` and `m` are preserved but are now guaranteed to be integers.
