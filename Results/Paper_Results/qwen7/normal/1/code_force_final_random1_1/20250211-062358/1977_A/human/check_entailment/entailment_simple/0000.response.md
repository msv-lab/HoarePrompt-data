Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.
3. The program checks several conditions to determine if it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves:
   - If `n == m`, it prints "Yes" because Nikita can simply add `m` cubes without removing any.
   - If `m > n`, it prints "No" because it's impossible to have more cubes than the total number of moves.
   - If `m == n - 1`, it prints "Yes" because Nikita can add `n-1` cubes and remove 1 cube.
   - If both `n` and `m` are even, it prints "Yes" because adding and removing cubes in pairs (both even operations) can achieve the desired result.
   - If both `n` and `m` are odd, it prints "Yes" because adding and removing cubes in pairs (both odd operations) can also achieve the desired result.
   - Otherwise, it prints "No".

Given these conditions, the logic seems to cover all possible scenarios where it is or isn't possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. There are no logical errors or missing cases in the provided code.

Correctness: **True**
