Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive.
- `i` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer from the first split.
- `m` is an input integer from the second split.
- `m` is less than or equal to `n`, but `m` is not equal to `n - 1`.
- Either `m` is not even or `n` is not even.
- The condition `(m % 2 == 0 or n % 2 == 0)` holds true.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print('No')
```

This code simply prints the string `'No'`.

Output: **No**
