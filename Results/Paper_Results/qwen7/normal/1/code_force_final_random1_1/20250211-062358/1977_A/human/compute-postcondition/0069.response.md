Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by two positive integers \( n \) and \( m \). For each test case, it checks specific conditions relating \( n \) and \( m \) and prints 'Yes' or 'No' based on whether these conditions are met. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value.**
