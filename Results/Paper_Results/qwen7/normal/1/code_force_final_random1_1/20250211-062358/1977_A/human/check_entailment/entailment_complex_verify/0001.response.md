### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if it's possible to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves.
   - Each move can either add 1 cube or remove 1 cube from the tower.

2. **Analyzing the Conditions:**
   - If `n == m`, it means we can simply add 1 cube per move, so the answer is "Yes".
   - If `m > n`, it's impossible because we can't add more cubes than the total number of moves.
   - If `m == n - 1`, it means we added 1 cube `n-1` times and removed 1 cube once, which is possible.
   - The conditions `m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0` and `m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0` check if both `m` and `n` are even or both are odd. This is necessary because adding and removing cubes alternately must maintain the parity (evenness or oddness) of the number of cubes.

3. **Reviewing the Given Program:**
   - The program correctly checks all the conditions mentioned above.
   - It handles the cases where `n == m`, `m > n`, `m == n - 1`, and the parity conditions (`m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0` and `m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0`).
   - However, there is a missing condition: when `m < n - 1`. This scenario is not covered by the current logic.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program should handle all edge cases as specified in the problem statement.
   - The current logic fails to cover the case where `m < n - 1`. For example, if `n = 5` and `m = 1`, the program will incorrectly print "No" because it does not account for the possibility of removing more cubes than adding.

### Conclusion:

The given program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if it's possible to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves. Specifically, it fails to handle the case where `m < n - 1`.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
