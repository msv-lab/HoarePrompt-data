Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `i` is 2, `n` is the first integer from the input split, `m` is the second integer from the input split, the values of `n` and `m` are converted to integers. If `m` is greater than `n`, no changes are made. Otherwise, if `m` equals `n - 1`, no changes are made. If both `m` and `n` are even, no changes are made. Otherwise, no changes are made.
