Output: **No**

Explanation: 
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive.
- `i` is initialized to 1.
- `n` is the first integer from the input split.
- `m` is the second integer from the input split.

The `print('No')` statement simply prints the string 'No', regardless of the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `m`. Therefore, the output is exactly the string 'No'.
