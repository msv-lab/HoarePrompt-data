Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer from the first split, `m` is an input integer from the second split, `m` is less than or equal to `n`, and `m` is not equal to `n - 1`. Additionally, either both `m` and `n` are even, or both `m` and `n` are odd.
