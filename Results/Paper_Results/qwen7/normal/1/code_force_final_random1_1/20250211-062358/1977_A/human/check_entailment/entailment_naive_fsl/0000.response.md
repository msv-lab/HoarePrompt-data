Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program fails to consider the case where `m` is odd and `n` is even, or vice versa. According to the problem description, the only way to achieve a tower with `m` cubes after `n` moves is if `m` and `n` have the same parity (both even or both odd). However, the program incorrectly prints 'Yes' in some cases where `m` and `n` have different parities.

For example, consider the following input:
```
2
5 4
6 3
```

- For the first test case (`n=5`, `m=4`), `n` is odd and `m` is even, which should result in "No".
- For the second test case (`n=6`, `m=3`), `n` is even and `m` is odd, which should also result in "No".

However, the current implementation incorrectly prints "Yes" for both cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
