State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `i` is 0**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop `for i in range(t):` will execute as long as `t` is a positive integer.
2. The variable `t` is determined by the user input, which means its value is not known beforehand but is constrained to be an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive.
3. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 before the loop starts, as per the `range(t)` syntax, which generates values from 0 to `t-1`.
4. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, `t` must be within the specified range (1 to 100 inclusive), and `i` must be set to 0.

Thus, the required state adjustments are:
- `t` must be an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive.
- `i` is 0.
