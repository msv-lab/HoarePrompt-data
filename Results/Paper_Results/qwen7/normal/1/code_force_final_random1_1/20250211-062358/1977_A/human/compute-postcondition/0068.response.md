Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes values for t, n, and m where t is a positive integer between 1 and 100, and for each test case, n and m are positive integers between 1 and 100. The function returns information based on these values, but the specific return values are not detailed in the given information.**

This means the function is designed to handle a series of test cases defined by the variable `t`, where each test case involves two integers `n` and `m`. However, without more details on the specific logic or return values, we can only state that the function processes these parameters within the specified ranges.
