Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `n-1`
- `array2` is constructed based on specific conditions involving `arr` and some constants `a`, `b`, and `f`.

Let's break down the construction of `array2`:

1. For `i = 0`, if `arr[0] < b / a`, then `arr[0] * a` is added to `array2`.
2. For each subsequent index `i` from 1 to `n-1`, if `arr[i] - arr[i-1] < b / a`, then `(arr[i] - arr[i-1]) * a` is added to `array2`.

Given these conditions, the `array2` will contain elements based on the differences between consecutive elements of `arr` that meet the specified threshold `b / a`.

However, the print statement simply outputs the string `'No'`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **No**
