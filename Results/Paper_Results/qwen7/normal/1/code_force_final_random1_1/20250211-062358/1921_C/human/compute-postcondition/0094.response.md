Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`; `feat` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `feat` by splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it is simply referenced in the list comprehension but not modified.
