Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is `feat[1] - 1`, `n` is `feat[0]`, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`**

Explanation: The code creates a list `arr` by splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer. The values of `i`, `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial state.
