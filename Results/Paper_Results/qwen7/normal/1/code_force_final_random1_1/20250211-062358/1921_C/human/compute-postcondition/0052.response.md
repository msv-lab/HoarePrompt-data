Output State: **Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that `i` (which is `n + 1`) is within the range `1` to `n-1`, and `array2` contains elements that satisfy the condition `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` for each `i` from 1 to `n-1` where `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be `2` (since it starts from `1` and goes up to `n-1`), `n` will be an integer such that `i` (which is `n + 1`) falls within the range `1` to `n-1`. The list `array2` will contain all the values `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` for each index `i` from `1` to `n-1` where the difference between consecutive elements in `arr` is less than `b / a`. If no such differences exist, `array2` will remain empty.
