Output State: **`i` is 2, `array2` contains an element equal to `(arr[1] - arr[0]) * a`.**

Explanation: The code appends to `array2` an element calculated as `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`. Given that `i` was initially 1 and must be less than `n`, after executing the line of code, `i` is incremented by 1 (becoming 2), and `array2` now contains an element equal to `(arr[1] - arr[0]) * a`.
