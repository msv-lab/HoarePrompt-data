Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is an integer such that `i` (which is `n + 1`) is within the range `1` to `n-1`, `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]` is less than `b / a`, and `array2` contains one additional element which is `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` to the list `array2`. Since `i` is `n + 1` and `n` is an integer such that `i` is within the range `1` to `n-1`, this condition is not directly affected by the code. The value of `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]` is less than `b / a`, and this relationship remains unchanged. After executing the code, `array2` will have one more element, which is the calculated value.
