Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` is `feat[0]` must be greater than 3, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer, `array2` is a list containing one element which is `(arr[3] - arr[2]) * a`, and either `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]` is less than `b / a` or there is no else part, meaning `array2` remains unchanged.
