Let's break down the initial state and the conditions step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `i` is equal to `n-1`.
   - `array2` is constructed based on specific conditions involving `arr`, `a`, `b`, and `f`.

2. **Conditions for `array2` Construction**:
   - If `arr[0] < b / a`, then `arr[0] * a` is added to `array2`.
   - For each subsequent index `i` from 1 to `n-1`, if `arr[i] - arr[i-1] < b / a`, then `(arr[i] - arr[i-1]) * a` is appended to `array2`.
   - If neither condition is met for any index, the corresponding value will not be added to `array2`.

3. **Sum Condition**:
   - The sum of `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is less than `f`.

Given these conditions, the key point is the `print('Yes')` statement. This statement is independent of the construction of `array2` and the sum condition. It simply prints the string `'Yes'`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **Yes**
