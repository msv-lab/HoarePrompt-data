Output State: **`i` is 5, `n` is `feat[0]` and must be greater than 3, `array2` contains an element equal to `(arr[5] - arr[4]) * a`**

Explanation: The code appends to `array2` an element calculated as `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`. Given that `i` is 5, the expression becomes `(arr[5] - arr[4]) * a`, and this value is appended to `array2`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
