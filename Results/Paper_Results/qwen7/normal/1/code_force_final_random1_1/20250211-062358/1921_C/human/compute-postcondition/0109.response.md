Output State: **`i` is an integer and not equal to 0; `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]` is less than `b / a`; `array2` has an additional element which is `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`.**

This means that the value of `i` remains unchanged, and the condition `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a` still holds true. Additionally, the list `array2` now contains one more element, which is the product of `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1])` and `a`.
