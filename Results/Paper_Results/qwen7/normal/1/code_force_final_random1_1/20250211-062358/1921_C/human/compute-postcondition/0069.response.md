Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to 3.
   - `n` is set to `feat[0]`.
   - The loop condition is `range(1, n)`, meaning the loop will start from 1 and go up to `n-1`.

3. **Check if the loop can execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1 (since the loop starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`).
   - `i` should be within the range of the loop, but since `i` is set to 3 and the loop starts from 1, `i` must be less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is set to 3, it must be less than `n` for the loop to execute. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 3.
   - `n` is set to `feat[0]`, so `feat[0]` must be greater than 3.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` and `feat[0]`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 3, `n` is `feat[0]` must be greater than 3, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer, `array2` is an empty list**
