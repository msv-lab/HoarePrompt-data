Output State: **`i` is `feat[1] - 1`, `n` is `feat[0]`, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`**

The code assigns `feat[-1]` to the variable `b`. Since `feat` is an array or list, `feat[-1]` refers to the last element of `feat`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `f`, `a`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
