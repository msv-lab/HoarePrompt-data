Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` is `feat[0]` must be greater than 3, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer, `array2` is a list containing one element which is `(arr[3] - arr[2]) * a`, and the current value of `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]` is less than `b / a`.

This means that after the if-else block executes, `i` remains 3, `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, `arr`, and `array2` are as described in the respective conditions. If the condition `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a` is true, then `array2` contains `(arr[3] - arr[2]) * a`. If the condition is false, `array2` remains an empty list.
