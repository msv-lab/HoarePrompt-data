Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is `feat[0]`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the first element of the list `feat` to the variable `n`. Since `feat` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact value of `n`. However, we know that `i` remains unchanged and is still 3, and `n` is now the first element of the list `feat`.
