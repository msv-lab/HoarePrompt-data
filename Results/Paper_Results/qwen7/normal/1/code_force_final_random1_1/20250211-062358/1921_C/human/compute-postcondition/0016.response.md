Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 1, array2 contains an element which is equal to (arr[4] - arr[3]) * a**

Explanation: The code appends to `array2` an element calculated as `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`. Given that `i` is initially 3, the expression evaluates to `(arr[3] - arr[2]) * a`. After executing this line, `i` is incremented by 1 (since `i += 1` is implied), making `i` equal to 4. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it was not directly involved in the operation.
