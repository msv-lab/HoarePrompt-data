Output State: **`feat` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is `n + 1`, `test_cases` must be greater than `n + 1`, `f` is the second element of `feat`, `a` is the third element of `feat`, `b` is the last element of `feat`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from input.**

Explanation: The code creates a new list `arr` by splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer. This operation does not affect the values of `feat`, `i`, `test_cases`, `f`, `a`, or `b`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial values, and `arr` is the new list created from the input.
