Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i = n`
   - `n = feat[0]` and `n` must be greater than or equal to the maximum index present in `arr` (which is `len(arr) - 1`).
   - `f = feat[1]`
   - `a = feat[2]`
   - `b = feat[-1]`
   - `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer.
   - `array2` is a list containing elements where each element is `(arr[j] - arr[j - 1]) * a` for every `j` in the range from `3` to `n-1` inclusive, provided that `arr[j] - arr[j - 1] < b / a`.
   - The sum of `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is less than `f`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is simply `print('Yes')`.

Given this information, the print statement `print('Yes')` will directly print the string `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
