Output State: **`feat` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is `n + 1`, `test_cases` must be greater than `n + 1`**.

Explanation: The code creates a list `feat` by splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer. The values of `i` and `test_cases` remain unchanged from their initial state.
