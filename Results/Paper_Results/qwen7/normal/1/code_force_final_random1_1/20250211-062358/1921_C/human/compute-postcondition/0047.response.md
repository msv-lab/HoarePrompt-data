Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head is `for i in range(1, n):`. The variables involved in this loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Postcondition:**
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `n` is an integer such that `i` (which is `n + 1`) is within the range `1` to `n-1`.
   - `array2` now contains an additional element which is `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` if `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]` is less than `b / a`. If `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]` is not less than `b / a`, `array2` remains unchanged.

3. **Determine the Range for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be within the range `1` to `n-1`.
   - Given that `i` is `n + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be set to `1` and `n` must be set such that `1` is within the range `1` to `n-1`.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since `i` is `n + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be reset to `1`.
   - `n` must be adjusted such that `1` is within the range `1` to `n-1`. This means `n` must be at least `2`.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 1, `n` is at least 2**
