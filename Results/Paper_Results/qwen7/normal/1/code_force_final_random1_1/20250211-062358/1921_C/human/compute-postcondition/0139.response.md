Output State: The final state of `array2` will contain elements based on the conditions specified within the loop, with `i` being exactly `n` after all iterations. If the sum of elements in `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is less than `f`, the condition holds. Otherwise, the sum is greater than or equal to `f`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `array2` will have been constructed according to the rules defined inside the loop. Specifically, for each element in `arr` starting from the second one, if the difference between consecutive elements is less than `b / a`, then the difference multiplied by `a` is added to `array2`. The initial element of `arr` is considered separately. The final decision is made by comparing the sum of the elements in `array2` plus the product of the remaining elements count and `b` against `f`. If the sum is less than `f`, the output will be 'Yes'; otherwise, it will be 'No'.
