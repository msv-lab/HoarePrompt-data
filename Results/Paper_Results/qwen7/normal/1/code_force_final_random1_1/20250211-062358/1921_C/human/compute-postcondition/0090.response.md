Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `test_cases`, which is the value of `n` from the last iteration. The variable `array2` will contain elements that satisfy the condition `(arr[j] - arr[j - 1]) * a` for each `j` from 1 to `n-1` where `arr[j] - arr[j - 1] < b / a`. The final decision ('Yes' or 'No') will be based on whether the sum of the elements in `array2` plus `(n - len(array2)) * b` is less than `f`. If it is less than `f`, the output will be 'Yes'; otherwise, it will be 'No'. The values of `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b` will be the same as those from the last iteration, and `arr` will be the list of integers obtained from the last input.
