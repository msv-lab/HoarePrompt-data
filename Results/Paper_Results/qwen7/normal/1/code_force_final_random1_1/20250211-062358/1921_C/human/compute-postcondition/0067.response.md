Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is `feat[0]`, `f` is `feat[1]`, `a` is `feat[2]`, `b` is `feat[-1]`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `arr` by taking user input as a string, splitting it by spaces, and converting each element to an integer. The values of `i`, `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial state.
