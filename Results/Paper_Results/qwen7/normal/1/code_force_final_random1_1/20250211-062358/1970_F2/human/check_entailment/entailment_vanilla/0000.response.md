Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**:
   - The program correctly parses the dimensions \( n \) and \( m \) of the field.
   - It initializes dictionaries to store the positions of players and goals.
   - It correctly identifies the initial position of the Quaffle and the goals.
   - The movements dictionary maps directions to their corresponding changes in coordinates.

2. **Game Loop**:
   - The program iterates through each move in the game.
   - For each move, it checks whether the entity is a Bludger or a player.
   - If the entity is a Bludger, it updates its position and checks for collisions with players.
   - If a collision occurs, the player is eliminated, and the program handles the elimination correctly.
   - If the entity is a player, it updates the player's position based on the direction specified.
   - The program correctly handles catching and throwing the Quaffle.

3. **Scoring and Elimination**:
   - When a player throws the Quaffle into a goal, the program correctly updates the score and prints the appropriate message.
   - When a player is eliminated, the program prints the correct message and removes the player from the dictionary.
   - The program sorts the eliminated players alphabetically before printing them.

4. **Final Score Calculation**:
   - After the game ends, the program prints the final score correctly.

5. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function correctly calculates the new position of an entity based on the direction provided.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to follow the problem description accurately and handles all the necessary cases, including scoring, eliminating players, and updating the Quaffle's position.

Correctness: **True**
