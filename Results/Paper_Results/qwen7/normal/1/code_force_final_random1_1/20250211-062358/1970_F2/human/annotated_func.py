#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers representing the dimensions of the field (N and M respectively), with 3 <= N, M <= 99 and N and M are odd. The field is represented as a list of strings, where each string contains M characters. The list has N strings. The list contains pairs of characters representing players, goals, the Quaffle, and a Bludger, as described in the problem statement. Additionally, b is an integer representing the number of steps T in the game, with 0 <= T <= 10000.
def func_1(a, b):
    x, y = a
    dx, dy = b
    return x + dx, y + dy
    #The program returns x and y, both of which have the same integer value as a, and dx and dy, which are the first and second elements of b respectively.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `a` and `b`. Parameter `a` is a tuple containing two integers representing the dimensions of a field, while `b` is a tuple containing two integers representing the number of steps in a game. The function returns four values: `x` and `y`, both equal to the first element of `a`, and `dx` and `dy`, which are the first and second elements of `b` respectively.
