Output State: **`a` is split into `x` and `y`, both holding the same integer value as `a`, and `b` remains unchanged; `dx` is `b`'s first element and `dy` is `b`'s second element.**

Given the initial state where `a` is split into two variables `x` and `y`, both holding the same integer value as `a`, and `b` remains unchanged, the line `dx, dy = b` unpacks the tuple `b` into `dx` and `dy`. Since `b` is not specified, we assume it is a tuple containing two elements. Therefore, `dx` is assigned the first element of `b`, and `dy` is assigned the second element of `b`. The values of `a`, `x`, `y`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial state.
