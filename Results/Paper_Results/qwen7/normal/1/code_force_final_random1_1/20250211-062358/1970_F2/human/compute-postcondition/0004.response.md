Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `a` and `b`. Parameter `a` is a tuple containing two integers representing the dimensions of a field, while `b` is a tuple containing two integers representing the number of steps in a game. The function returns four values: `x` and `y`, both equal to the first element of `a`, and `dx` and `dy`, which are the first and second elements of `b` respectively.**
