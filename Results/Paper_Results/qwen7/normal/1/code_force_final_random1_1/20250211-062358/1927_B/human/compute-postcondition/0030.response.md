Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `j` is equal to `l`, where `l` is an input integer.
   - `ans` is a list containing all the alphabets from the string `alp` based on the count condition specified in the loop body.
   - `i` is incremented by 1 to `i+1`.
   - `array` is a list of integers input by the user.
   - `alp` is a list of alphabets starting from 'a' to 'z'.
   - `rev_array` is the reversed version of `array`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(''.join(map(str, ans)))
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `ans` list is constructed based on some condition involving `i` and `alp`. Since `i` is incremented by 1 to `i+1`, it implies that `i` starts from 0 and goes up to `l-1` (assuming `l` is the length of `alp`).
   - `alp` is a list of alphabets from 'a' to 'z', so `alp = ['a', 'b', 'c', ..., 'z']`.
   - The `ans` list will contain the alphabets from `alp` based on the count condition specified in the loop body. Given that `i` ranges from 0 to `l-1`, `ans` will contain all alphabets from `alp`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `ans` list will contain all the alphabets from 'a' to 'z'.
   - The `print` statement will join these alphabets into a single string and print it.

Therefore, the output will be the concatenation of all alphabets from 'a' to 'z'.

Output: **abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz**
