Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `j` and `l`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `j < l`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is 1
   - `l` is an input integer
   - `ans` is a list containing one element which is the alphabet at index `rev_array[j].count(rev_array[j]) - 1` in `alp`
   - `i` is incremented by 1
   - `array` is a list of integers input by the user
   - `alp` is a list of alphabets starting from 'a' to 'z'
   - `rev_array` is the reversed version of `array`

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts at 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must be less than `l`. Therefore, `j` will be incremented to 2 in the next iteration.
   - The value of `l` remains unchanged.

5. **Determine the new state**:
   - `j` will be 2.
   - `l` remains the same (unchanged).
   - `ans` will be updated based on the new value of `j`, but since we are only asked to adjust the loop head variables, we don't need to specify the exact content of `ans` for the next iteration.
   - `i` is incremented by 1, so it will be incremented again in the next iteration.
   - `array`, `alp`, and `rev_array` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`j` is 2, `l` is an input integer, `ans` is a list containing one element which is the alphabet at index `rev_array[j].count(rev_array[j]) - 1` in `alp`, `i` is incremented by 1, `array` is a list of integers input by the user, `alp` is a list of alphabets starting from 'a' to 'z', `rev_array` is the reversed version of `array`**
