Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `l` is an input integer, `array` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `alp` is a list of 26 alphabetic characters starting from 'a' to 'z'.**

The given code initializes the list `alp` with 26 alphabetic characters. This does not affect the values of `t`, `i`, `l`, or `array`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
