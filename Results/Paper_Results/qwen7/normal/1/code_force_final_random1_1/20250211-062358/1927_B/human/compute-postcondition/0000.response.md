Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(int(input())):`. The variables involved here are `i` and the result of `int(input())`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `int(input())` is a positive integer. Given that `t` is defined as a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the input should be within this range for the loop to execute.

3. **Determine the Initial State**: We know that `t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\). Therefore, the input should be a number within this range for the loop to start executing.

4. **Adjust the States**: Since the loop depends on the value of `int(input())`, we need to ensure that the input value is within the valid range for the loop to execute. Additionally, since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, the initial value of `i` should be 0.

Given these points, we need to adjust the state such that the input value is within the specified range and `i` is initialized to 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0**
