Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and the second line contains n non-negative integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n such that 0 ≤ a_i < n.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    l = int(input())
    array = list(map(int, input().split()))
    alp = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm',
        'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z']
    rev_array = array[::-1]
    ans = []
    for j in range(l):
        ans.append(alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1])
    print(''.join(map(str, ans)))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `j` is equal to `l`; `l` must be a positive integer; `ans` is a list containing `l` elements, where each element is `alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1]` for `j` ranging from `0` to `l-1`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `j` will be equal to the value of `l`. The list `ans` will contain `l` elements, with each element being determined by counting the occurrences of the current value of `j` in the reversed `array` (starting from `j` to the end of the array) and then indexing into the `alp` list with that count minus one.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `j` is equal to `l`, `l` is an input integer, `ans` is a list containing all the alphabets from the string `alp` based on the count condition specified in the loop body, `i` is incremented by 1 to `i+1`, `array` is a list of integers input by the user, `alp` is a list of alphabets starting from 'a' to 'z', `rev_array` is the reversed version of `array`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `j` is equal to `l`; `l` must be greater than 0; `ans` contains `l` elements, each of which is calculated as `alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1]` for each iteration of `j` from 0 to `l-1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
