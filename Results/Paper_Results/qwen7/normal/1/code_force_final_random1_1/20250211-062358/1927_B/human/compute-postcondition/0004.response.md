Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `l` is an input integer, `array` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `rev_array` is the reversed version of `array`.**

Explanation: The code `rev_array = array[::-1]` creates a new list `rev_array` which is the reverse of the original list `array`. The values of `t`, `i`, `l`, and `array` remain unchanged.
