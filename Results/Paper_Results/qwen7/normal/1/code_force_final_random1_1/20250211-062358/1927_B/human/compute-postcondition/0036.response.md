Output State: **`j` is equal to `l`, `l` is an input integer, `ans` is an empty list, `i` is less than `int(input())`, `array` is updated to a list of integers input by the user using `map(int, input().split())`, `alp` is a list of alphabets starting from 'a' to 'z', `rev_array` is the reversed version of the updated `array`, `l` is updated to the new integer input.**

The code initializes an empty list `ans`. This does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the values of `j`, `l`, `i`, `array`, `alp`, and `rev_array` remain unchanged from their previous states.
