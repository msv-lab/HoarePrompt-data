Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in the given for loop is `j`, and it ranges from `0` to `l-1`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is currently `0`.
   - `l` must be a positive integer.
   - `ans` contains the element `alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1]`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `j < l`.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` was `0` at the end of the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by `1`, so `j` will become `1`.
   - The value of `l` remains unchanged as it is an external condition.
   - For the loop to continue, `l` must still be a positive integer.
   - The value of `ans` will now depend on `rev_array[1:]` (since `j` is now `1`), but the exact value of `ans` cannot be determined without knowing the contents of `alp` and `rev_array`.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `j` will be `1`.
   - `l` must still be a positive integer.
   - `ans` will contain the element `alp[rev_array[1:].count(rev_array[1]) - 1]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `j` is 1, `l` must be a positive integer, `ans` contains the element `alp[rev_array[1:].count(rev_array[1]) - 1]`**
