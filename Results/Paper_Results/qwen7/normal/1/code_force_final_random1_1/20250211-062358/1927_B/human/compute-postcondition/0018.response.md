Output State: **`j` is equal to `l`, `l` is an input integer, `ans` is a list containing `l` elements, where each element is determined by counting the occurrences of the current value of `j` in the reversed `array` (starting from `j` to the end of the array) and then indexing into the `alp` list with that count minus one, `i` is incremented by 1, `array` is a list of integers input by the user.**

Explanation: The code `array = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from the user input and converts them into a list of integers. This operation does not affect the values of `j`, `l`, `ans`, or `i`. Instead, it creates a new list called `array` which contains the integers entered by the user. Therefore, the state of `j` remains equal to `l`, `ans` is still a list with `l` elements based on the original conditions, `i` is incremented by 1, and the newly created `array` is now populated with the integers provided by the user.
