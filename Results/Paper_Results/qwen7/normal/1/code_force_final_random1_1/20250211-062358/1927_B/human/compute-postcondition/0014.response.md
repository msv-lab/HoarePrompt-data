Output State: `j` is equal to `l`; `l` must be a positive integer; `ans` is a list containing `l` elements, where each element is `alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1]` for `j` ranging from `0` to `l-1`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `j` will be equal to the value of `l`. The list `ans` will contain `l` elements, with each element being determined by counting the occurrences of the current value of `j` in the reversed `array` (starting from `j` to the end of the array) and then indexing into the `alp` list with that count minus one.
