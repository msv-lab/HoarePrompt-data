Output State: **`j` is equal to `l`, `l` is an input integer, `ans` is a list containing all the alphabets from the string `alp` based on the count condition specified in the loop body, `i` is less than `int(input())`, `array` is updated to a list of integers input by the user using `map(int, input().split())`, `alp` is a list of alphabets starting from 'a' to 'z', `rev_array` is the reversed version of `array`, `l` is updated to the new integer input, `rev_array` is the reversed version of the updated `array`.**

Explanation: The code `rev_array = array[::-1]` reverses the `array` and assigns it to `rev_array`. All other variables remain unchanged. `j` is still equal to `l`, `l` is updated to the new integer input, `ans` remains unchanged as it was not affected by this line of code, `i` is still less than the integer input, `array` is updated to the list of integers input by the user, `alp` remains a list of alphabets from 'a' to 'z', and `rev_array` is now the reversed version of the updated `array`.
