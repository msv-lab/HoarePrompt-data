Based on the initial state provided:

- `visited` is a list where all elements are set to `True`.
- `coef` is a list with 1s at indices where nodes were visited.
- `tot` is initialized to `0`.
- `bipartite` is either `True` or `False` depending on the graph's bipartiteness.
- `ok` is `True` because the condition `(ok)` is met.

The `print('YES')` statement simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
