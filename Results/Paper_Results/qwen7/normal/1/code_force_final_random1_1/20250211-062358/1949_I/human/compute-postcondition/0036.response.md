Output State: **`coef[i+1]` is set to 1, `coef[i]` is 1, `tot` is 0, `bipartite` remains unchanged, and `ok` is False**.

Explanation: The code sets `tot` to 0. Given the initial conditions, `ok` is True if `bipartite` is True and `tot` is not equal to 0. Since `tot` is now 0, `ok` becomes False. All other variables remain unchanged.
