Output State: **`i` is 0; `x[0]`, `y[0]`, `r[0]` are integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `x[i], y[i], r[i] = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `x[i]`, `y[i]`, and `r[i]` respectively. Since `i` was initially 0, these assignments update `x[0]`, `y[0]`, and `r[0]` to the integers provided by the user. The value of `i` remains unchanged as the code does not modify it. The condition that `n` must be greater than 0 is still valid, but since `n` is not mentioned in the code, it is not directly affected.
