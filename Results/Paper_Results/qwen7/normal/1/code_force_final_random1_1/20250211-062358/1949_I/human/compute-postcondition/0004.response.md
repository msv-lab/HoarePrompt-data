Output State: **`n` is an input integer, 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, x is a list of length n with all elements set to None, y is a list of length n with all elements set to None, r is a list of n elements, each set to None, visited is a list of n boolean values, all set to False, and coef is a list of n floating-point numbers used to calculate the coefficients for the disks' tangency conditions.**

The code `visited = [False] * n` initializes the `visited` list with `n` boolean values, all set to `False`. The other lists (`x`, `y`, `r`, and `coef`) remain unchanged.
