Output State: **`coef[i]' is set to 1, `tot' is 0, `bipartite' is True after calling dfs(i)**.

The function `dfs(i)` is called with `i` as an argument. However, since the content of the `dfs` function is not provided, we cannot determine the exact changes it might make to the variables. But based on the initial state, the only thing we know for certain is that `dfs(i)` has been called, and the other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
