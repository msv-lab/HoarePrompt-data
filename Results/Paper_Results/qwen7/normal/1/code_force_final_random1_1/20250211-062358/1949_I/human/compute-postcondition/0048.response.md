Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (an integer between 1 and 1000), x (a list of n integers), y (a list of n integers), r (a list of n integers), visited (a list of n boolean values), and coef (a list of n floating-point numbers). It does not return any value.**

This means the function `func_1` takes in several parameters including an integer `n` specifying the number of disks, two lists `x` and `y` containing the x and y coordinates of the centers of the disks, a list `r` containing the radii of the disks, a list `visited` indicating whether each disk has been visited during a Depth-First Search (DFS), and a list `coef` used to calculate coefficients for the disks' tangency conditions. However, the function itself does not produce any output or return value.
