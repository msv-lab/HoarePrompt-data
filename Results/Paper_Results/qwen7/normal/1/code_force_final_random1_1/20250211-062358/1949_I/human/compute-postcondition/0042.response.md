Output State: **All elements in `visited` are set to True, `coef` contains 1s at indices where nodes were visited, `tot` is 0, `bipartite` remains True or False based on the graph's bipartiteness, and `ok` is True if any `bipartite` is True and `tot` is not 0 during any iteration, otherwise `ok` remains False.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, every node in the graph represented by the lists `x`, `y`, and `r` will have been visited (thus, all elements in `visited` will be `True`). The `coef` list will contain `1`s at the indices corresponding to the nodes that were part of the initial DFS calls from unvisited nodes. The value of `tot` remains `0` because it is reset to `0` at the start of each DFS call within the loop. The `bipartite` flag will retain its final value after the last DFS call, indicating whether the entire graph is bipartite. The `ok` flag will be `True` if any DFS call resulted in a bipartite graph with a non-zero `tot` value, otherwise, it will remain `False`.
