The function processes a set of disks defined by their centers' coordinates (x, y) and radii (r). It performs a depth-first search (DFS) on the disks to determine if they form a bipartite graph based on their tangency conditions. If any connected component of the graph is bipartite and contains more than one disk, the function prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value.
