Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head conditions**: The loop continues as long as `i < len(a)` and `a[i] == b[i]`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `i + 1` (which is 3 since `i` was 2 or more).
   - `a[2]` is equal to `b[2]` or the condition holds true for the next index.
   - `new[i]` is the maximum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]`.
   - `new2[i]` is the minimum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]`.

3. **Determine what needs to be adjusted**:
   - The loop condition checks two things: `i < len(a)` and `a[i] == b[i]`.
   - Since `i` is already `i + 1` (which is 3), we need to check if `3 < len(a)` and if `a[3] == b[3]`.

4. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - For the loop to continue, `3 < len(a)` must be true.
   - Additionally, `a[3]` must be equal to `b[3]` for the condition `a[i] == b[i]` to hold true.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `len(a)` must be greater than 3.
- `a[3]` must be equal to `b[3]`.

So, the final state for the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is 3, `a[3]` is equal to `b[3]`, and `len(a)` must be greater than 3**.
