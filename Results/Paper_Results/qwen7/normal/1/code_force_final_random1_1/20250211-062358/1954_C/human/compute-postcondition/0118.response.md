The value of `i` is incremented by 1, which means `i` now points to the next index in the lists `a` and `b`. The states of the other variables (`new2[i]`, `new2[i+1]`, `new[i+1]`, `new[i]`) are not directly affected by this increment operation. They remain as they were before.

Output State: **`new2[i]` is equal to `max(a[i], b[i])`, `new2[i+1]` is equal to `max(a[i+1], b[i+1])`, `new[i+1]` is equal to `min(a[i+1], b[i+1])`, `new[i]` is equal to `min(a[i], b[i])`, `i` is increased by 1 and is still less than `len(a)`**
