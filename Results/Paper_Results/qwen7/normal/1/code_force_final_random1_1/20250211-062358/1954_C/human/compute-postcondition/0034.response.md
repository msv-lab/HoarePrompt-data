Output State: **`new` is updated such that `new[i]` is equal to `min(a[i], b[i])` for the current value of `i`; `i` is less than `len(a)`; `a` and `b` remain unchanged.**

This means that the value of `new[i]` is set to the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for the current value of `i`. The condition that `i` must be less than `len(a)` still holds. Variables `a` and `b` remain in their original state.
