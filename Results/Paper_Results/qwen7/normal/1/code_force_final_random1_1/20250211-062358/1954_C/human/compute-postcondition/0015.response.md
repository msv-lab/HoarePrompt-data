Output State: **`i` is 3, `a[3]` is equal to `b[3]`, `new[3]` is equal to `max(a[3], b[3])`, and `len(new)` is greater than 3.**

Explanation: The code assigns the maximum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]` to `new[i]`. Given that `i` is 3, `a[3]` is equal to `b[3]`, and `len(a)` is greater than 3, the value of `new[3]` will be the maximum of `a[3]` and `b[3]`, which is `a[3]` (or `b[3]`). The length of `new` remains greater than 3.
