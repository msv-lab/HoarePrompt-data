Postcondition: **`i` is equal to `len(a)`, `new` is a list containing the minimum values between corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for all indices, and `new2` is a list containing the maximum values between corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for all indices.**

In natural language: After the if-else block executes, the variable `i` will be set to the length of array `a`, indicating that the loop has processed every element. The `new` list will contain the minimum values between corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for all indices, and the `new2` list will contain the maximum values between corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for all indices.
