Output State: **The final output state will be such that `new` is a list where each element is `min(a[j], b[j])` for `j` from `0` to `len(a)-1`, and `new2` is a list where each element is `max(a[j], b[j])` for `j` from `0` to `len(a)-1`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the `new` list will contain the smallest digit from each pair of corresponding elements in lists `a` and `b`, while the `new2` list will contain the largest digit from each pair of corresponding elements in lists `a` and `b`.
