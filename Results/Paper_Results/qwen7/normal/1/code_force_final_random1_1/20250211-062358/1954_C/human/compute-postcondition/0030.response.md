Output State: **`i` is less than `len(a)` and equals `i + 1`, `new` is a list where each element is the minimum value between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for indices where `a[i]` equals `b[i]` and the i-th element is updated to be the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `new2` is a list where each element is the maximum value between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for indices where `a[i]` equals `b[i]` and remains unchanged.**

This means that the i-th element of the `new` list has been updated to be the minimum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, while the `new2` list remains unchanged for the i-th index since no operation was performed on it. The condition that `i` is less than `len(a)` and equals `i + 1` is still valid.
