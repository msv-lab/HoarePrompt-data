Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `i < len(a) and a[i] == b[i]`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `a` is a list of integers from the input string
   - `b` is a list of integers entered by the user
   - `new2[0]` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `b[0]`

3. **Determine which variables affect the loop condition**:
   - The loop condition depends on two variables: `i` and `a[i] == b[i]`.

4. **Check the current values**:
   - `i` is currently 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `a[1]` must be equal to `b[1]`.

5. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - Since `i` is already 1, we need to ensure that `a[1] == b[1]` for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `a[1]` is equal to `b[1]`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1, `a[1]` must be equal to `b[1]`**
