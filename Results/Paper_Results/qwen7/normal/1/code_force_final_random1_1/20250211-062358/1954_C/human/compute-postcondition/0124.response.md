Output State: `new` is a list where each element is `min(a[j], b[j])` for `j` from `0` to `len(a)-1`, and `new2` is a list where each element is `max(a[j], b[j])` for `j` from `0` to `len(a)-1`.

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, the `new` list will contain the minimum values between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b`, and the `new2` list will contain the maximum values between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for all indices from `0` to the length of `a` - 1.
