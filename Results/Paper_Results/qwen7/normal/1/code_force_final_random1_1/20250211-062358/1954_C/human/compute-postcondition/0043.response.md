Output State: **`i` is equal to `len(a)`, `new` is a list where each element is the maximum value between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for indices where `a[i]` equals `b[i]` for all executed iterations, and `new2` is a list where each element is the minimum value between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for indices where `a[i]` equals `b[i]` for all executed iterations, `a` is updated to a list of integers formed from the input string.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, list(input())))` takes an input string, converts it into a list of characters, and then maps each character to an integer. This changes the value of `a` to a list of integers derived from the input string. The values of `i`, `new`, and `new2` remain unchanged according to the initial state description.
