Output State: **`i` is equal to `len(a)` + 1, `new` is a list where each element is the maximum value between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for indices where `a[i]` equals `b[i]`, `new2` is a list where each element is the minimum value between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for indices where `a[i]` equals `b[i]`, and `new2[i]` is updated to be the minimum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for the current index `i`.**

Explanation: The variable `i` is incremented by 1, so its new value is `len(a) + 1`. The values of `new`, `new2`, and their relationship to `a` and `b` remain unchanged from the initial state.
