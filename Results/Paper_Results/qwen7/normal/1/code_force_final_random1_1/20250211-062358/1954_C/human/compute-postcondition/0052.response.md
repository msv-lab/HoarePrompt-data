Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Identify Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `i < len(a) and a[i] == b[i]`.
   - This means the loop continues as long as `i` is less than the length of `a` and the elements at index `i` in both `a` and `b` are equal.

2. **Current State at End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `len(a)` is a fixed value (let's denote it as `L`).
   - `a[0] == b[0]` is true.
   - `new[0]` is the maximum of `a[0]` and `b[0]`.
   - `new2[0]` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `b[0]`.

3. **Determine Conditions for Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `len(a)` and `a[i]` must be equal to `b[i]`.
   - Given `i` is currently 1, the next value of `i` would be 2.
   - Therefore, `i` must be 2 for the loop to continue.
   - Additionally, `a[2]` must be equal to `b[2]`.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - The only state that needs to be adjusted is `i` to ensure it is 2.
   - We do not need to adjust `len(a)` because it is a fixed value.
   - We do not need to adjust `a[0]` and `b[0]` because they are already known to be equal.
   - We do not need to adjust `new[0]` and `new2[0]` because they are derived from `a[0]` and `b[0]` and do not change based on the loop condition.

### Final Answer
State: **`i` is 2, `len(a)` is a fixed value, `a[0] == b[0]` is true, `new[0]` is the maximum of `a[0]` and `b[0]`, `new2[0]` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `b[0]`**
