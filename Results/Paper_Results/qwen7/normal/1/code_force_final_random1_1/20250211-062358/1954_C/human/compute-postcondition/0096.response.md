Output State: **`i` is 2; `new2[1]` is equal to `min(a[1], b[1])`; `a[1]` must be equal to `b[1]`**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The values of `new2[1]`, `a[1]`, and `b[1]` remain unchanged as the code snippet does not affect them. Therefore, `new2[1]` is still equal to `min(a[1], b[1])`, and `a[1]` is still equal to `b[1]`.
