Output State: **`new2[i+1]` is assigned the maximum value between `a[i+1]` and `b[i+1]`, `new[i+1]` is assigned the minimum value between `a[i+1]` and `b[i+1]`, and `i` is now `i + 1`.**

This means that the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, and the operations to determine `new2[i+1]` and `new[i+1]` based on the values of `a[i+1]` and `b[i+1]` have been performed, while the initial conditions for `new2[i]` and `new[i]` remain unchanged for the current `i`.
