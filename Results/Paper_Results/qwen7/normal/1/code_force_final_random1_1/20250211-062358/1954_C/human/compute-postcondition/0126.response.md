Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns whether the strings x and y represent the same integer when read from left to right.**

Given the constraints, the function should compare two string inputs `x` and `y` to check if they represent the same integer value. Since both `x` and `y` are strings of the same length consisting of digits from 1 to 9, the function compares these strings directly to determine if they are identical. If they are the same, the function returns a specific value (which could be `True` or any other indicator of match); otherwise, it returns another specific value (which could be `False` or any other indicator of no match).
