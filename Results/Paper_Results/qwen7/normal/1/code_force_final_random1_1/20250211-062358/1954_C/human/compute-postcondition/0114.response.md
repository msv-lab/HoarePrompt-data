Output State: **`new2[i+1]` is equal to `max(a[i+1], b[i+1])`, `new[i+1]` is equal to `min(a[i+1], b[i+1])`, `i` is less than `len(a)`**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Since the initial state specifies that `i` is less than `len(a)`, after incrementing `i`, the new condition for `i` remains true (i.e., `i` is still less than `len(a)`). The values of `new2` and `new` arrays are updated for the next index `i+1` based on the conditions given, but the previous values for indices up to `i` remain unchanged.
