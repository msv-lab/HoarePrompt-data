Output State: **`i` is 4; `new[4]` is the maximum of `a[4]` and `b[4]`; `a[3] == b[3]` is true**

Explanation: The code assigns the maximum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]` to `new[i]`. Given that `i` is 4, `new[4]` is set to the maximum of `a[4]` and `b[4]`. The condition `a[3] == b[3]` remains true as no changes are made to `a` or `b`.
