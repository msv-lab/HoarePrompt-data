Output State: **`new2[i+1]` is equal to `max(a[i+1], b[i+1])`, `new[i+1]` is equal to `min(a[i+1], b[i+1])`, `new[i]` is equal to `min(a[i], b[i])`, `i` must be less than `len(a)`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `new[i]` to be the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
