Output State: **`new2[i]` is equal to `max(a[i], b[i])` for the current value of `i`; `i` is less than `len(a)`; `a` and `b` remain unchanged; `new` is updated such that `new[i]` is equal to `min(a[i], b[i])` for the current value of `i`.**

This means that for each index `i` where `i` is less than the length of `a` and `b`, the value of `new2[i]` is now the maximum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, while `new[i]` remains the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`. The arrays `a` and `b` retain their original values.
