The loop condition is `i < len(a)`. For the loop to execute one more time, the variable `i` must satisfy this condition. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is less than `len(a)`. To ensure that the loop can execute again, `i` must still be less than `len(a)`.

No other states need to be adjusted because they do not affect the loop condition directly.

State: **`new2[i+1]` is equal to `max(a[i+1], b[i+1])`, `new[i+1]` is equal to `min(a[i+1], b[i+1])`, `i` must be less than `len(a)`**
