Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The only variable in the loop head is `i`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i < len(a)`.

3. **Current state of `i`**: According to the given state, `i` is equal to `len(a) - 1 + 1`, which simplifies to `i = len(a)`.

4. **Condition check**: For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be less than `len(a)`. However, currently, `i` is equal to `len(a)`, which means the condition `i < len(a)` is false.

5. **Adjustment needed**: To make the loop execute at least once, `i` must be less than `len(a)`. Therefore, `i` should be set to a value less than `len(a)`.

Given this analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` must be less than `len(a)`**
