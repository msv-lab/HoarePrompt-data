State: **`x` is a string representing an integer, `y` is a string representing an integer, input must provide a valid integer**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop is controlled by the expression `int(input())`.
2. For the loop to execute, `input()` must provide a valid integer.
3. The variables `x` and `y` are not used in the loop condition, so their current states do not affect whether the loop can execute.
4. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the input that will be provided to `int(input())`.

Thus, the state must include the condition that the input must provide a valid integer for the loop to execute.
