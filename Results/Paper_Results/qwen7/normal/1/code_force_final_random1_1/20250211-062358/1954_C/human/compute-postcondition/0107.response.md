Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is `while i < len(a)`. The only variable involved here is `i`.

2. **Determine the current state of `i`**: According to the given state right before the loop, `i` is equal to the length of `a` - 1 + 1. This simplifies to `i = len(a)`.

3. **Check the loop condition**: The loop condition is `i < len(a)`. For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be less than `len(a)`.

4. **Adjust the state**: Since `i` is currently equal to `len(a)`, it does not satisfy the loop condition `i < len(a)`. To make the loop execute the first time, `i` must be less than `len(a)`. Therefore, we need to adjust `i` to be one less than `len(a)`.

Given this analysis, the state right before the loop needs to be modified as follows:

State: **`i` is equal to the length of `a` - 1, `new` is a list where each element is `max(a[j], b[j])` for `j` from `0` to `i-1` with the exception that `new[i]` is `max(a[i], b[i])`; `new2` is a list where each element is `min(a[j], b[j])` for `j` from `0` to `i-1`; `new2[i]` is `min(a[i], b[i])`; the condition `i != len(a)` holds.**
