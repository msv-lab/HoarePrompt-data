Output State: **`x` is a string representing an integer, `y` is a string representing an integer, `a` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input integer**.

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, list(input())))` takes an input from the user (which must be a valid integer), converts each character of the input into an integer, and then stores these integers in a list called `a`. The variables `x` and `y` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
