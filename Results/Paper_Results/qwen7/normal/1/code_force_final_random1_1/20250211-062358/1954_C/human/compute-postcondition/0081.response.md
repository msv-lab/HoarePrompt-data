Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `len(a)`, meaning `i` is the length of the list `a`.
- `new` is a list containing the minimum values between corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for all indices.
- `new2` is a list containing the maximum values between corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for all indices.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(''.join(str(x) for x in new))
```

This line of code will join all elements of the `new` list into a single string, where each element is converted to a string. Since `new` contains the minimum values between corresponding elements of `a` and `b`, the output will be a string composed of these minimum values concatenated together.

Output: **a string of minimum values between corresponding elements of a and b**
