Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given solution does not correctly handle all cases, especially when `k` is less than `4 * n - 2`. Let's break down why the current solution is incorrect and provide a corrected version.

#### Issues with the Given Solution:
1. **Incorrect Handling of `k < 4 * n - 2`:**
   - The formula `ceil(k / 2)` is too simplistic and does not account for the specific requirements of coloring cells to satisfy the diagonal conditions.
   
2. **Complexity and Edge Cases:**
   - The problem requires a more detailed approach to ensure that the minimum number of cells are colored while satisfying the diagonal constraints.

#### Corrected Solution:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to consider the following:
- For small values of `k`, we might need to color more cells to ensure that the required number of diagonals are covered.
- We need to calculate the minimum number of cells to color based on the value of `k`.

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
import math

def min_cells_to_color(n, k):
    # Calculate the minimum number of cells needed to color
    # The worst case scenario is when k is very close to 4*n - 2
    if k >= 2 * n:
        return math.ceil(k / 2)
    else:
        # For smaller k, we need to cover the diagonals more efficiently
        # We can use a combination of coloring the first row and some columns
        return math.ceil((2 * n - 2 + k) / 2)

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        print(min_cells_to_color(n, k))

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Solution:
1. **Base Case:**
   - If `k` is greater than or equal to `2 * n`, then we can color half of the rows (since each row covers 2 diagonals).
   - This ensures that we cover the required number of diagonals with the minimum number of cells.

2. **General Case:**
   - For smaller values of `k`, we need to cover the diagonals more efficiently. By coloring the first row and some columns, we can achieve the required coverage with fewer cells.

This approach ensures that the solution handles all edge cases and provides the correct minimum number of cells to color.
