Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `t` is decremented by 1**.

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. It does not affect the value of `t`, which is decremented by 1 at the end of each iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `t` will be `t - 1`. The values of `n` and `k` are now known integers from the user input.
