Given the initial state where `t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer input from the first split, and `k` is an integer input from the second split, we need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(ceil(k / 2))`.

- `t` is a positive integer greater than 0, but its value does not affect the print statement.
- `n` is an integer input from the first split, but it also does not affect the print statement.
- `k` is an integer input from the second split. The `ceil` function will take the value of `k / 2` and round it up to the nearest integer if `k / 2` is not already an integer.

Since the value of `k` is an integer input, let's denote it as `k_value`. The expression `k / 2` will be either an integer or a float. If `k` is even, `k / 2` will be an integer. If `k` is odd, `k / 2` will be a float, and `ceil(k / 2)` will round this float up to the next integer.

Therefore, the print statement will output the ceiling value of `k / 2`.

Output: **ceil(k_value / 2)**
