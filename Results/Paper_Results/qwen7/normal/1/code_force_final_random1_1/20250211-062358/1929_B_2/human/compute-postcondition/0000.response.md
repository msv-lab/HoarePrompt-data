Output State: **`t` is an input integer, and it is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specified that `t` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, this condition is preserved. The other variables (`n` and `k`) remain undefined as they are not mentioned or initialized in the given code snippet.
