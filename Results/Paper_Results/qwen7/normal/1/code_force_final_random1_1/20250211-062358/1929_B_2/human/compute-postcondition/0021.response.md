Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes variables t, n, and k where t is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, and for each test case, n and k are integers within the ranges 2 to 10^8 and 1 to 4n - 2 respectively. The function returns a value based on the conditions provided for n and k.**

This means the function indirectly accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `k`, with specific constraints on their values. It then processes these parameters according to certain conditions and returns a result based on those conditions.
