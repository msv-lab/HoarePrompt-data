Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `s` is the next line from the input.
   - `n` is an integer value obtained from splitting `s` and converting to int.
   - `k` is an integer value obtained from splitting `s` and converting to int.
   - The variables `n` and `k` have swapped their roles in terms of holding the split values of `s`.
   - If `k > 4 * n - 4`, then `k` is either `4 * n - 3` or `4 * n - 2`, and the roles of `n` and `k` remain swapped.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(2 * n - 1)
   ```

Given these details, let's analyze the conditions and the final expression to determine what will be printed:

- Since `n` and `k` have swapped roles, if originally `s` was split into `n` and `k`, now `n` holds the value that was originally `k` and `k` holds the value that was originally `n`.
- The condition `k > 4 * n - 4` determines the value of `k`. If this condition is true, `k` is set to either `4 * n - 3` or `4 * n - 2`.

Let's consider both cases:

### Case 1: `k > 4 * n - 4` is True
- `k` is either `4 * n - 3` or `4 * n - 2`.
- In either case, the expression `2 * n - 1` will be evaluated.

For example, if `k = 4 * n - 3`:
- `2 * n - 1` would be `2 * n - 1`.

If `k = 4 * n - 2`:
- `2 * n - 1` would also be `2 * n - 1`.

In both scenarios, the expression evaluates to `2 * n - 1`.

### Case 2: `k > 4 * n - 4` is False
- This case does not apply because the problem states that if `k > 4 * n - 4` is true, then `k` is either `4 * n - 3` or `4 * n - 2`.

Therefore, regardless of the specific values of `n` and `k`, the expression `2 * n - 1` will always be evaluated and printed.

Output: **2 * n - 1**
