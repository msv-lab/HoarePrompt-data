Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the array `A` is precomputed for numbers up to 200,000, which means it will not dynamically compute the sum for any `n` beyond this range. This leads to incorrect results for larger values of `n`.

For instance, consider the input `n = 200001`. The program will use the precomputed value `A[200000]`, which was computed for `i = 200000`, not for `i = 200001`. This will result in an incorrect sum because the sum of the digits for the number 200001 is not included in the precomputed array.

To fix this, the program should compute the sum of the digits for each number from 1 to `n` dynamically within the loop that processes each test case. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(num):
    a = 0
    while num != 0:
        a = a + num % 10
        num = int(num / 10)
    return a

for t in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    sum = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        sum += func_1(i)
    print(sum)
```

This corrected version ensures that the sum of the digits for each number from 1 to `n` is computed dynamically, making it correct for any value of `n` within the specified range.
