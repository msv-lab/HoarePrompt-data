### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary step-by-step to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Description and Requirements:
- The task is to replace each integer from 1 to \( n \) with the sum of its digits and then find the sum of these new numbers.
- The function `func_1` correctly computes the sum of the digits of a given number.

#### Provided Program:
```python
A = []
sum = 0
for i in range(1, 200001):
    a = func_1(i)
    sum = sum + a
    A.append(sum)
for t in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    print(A[n - 1])
```

#### Function Summary:
- `func_1` correctly computes the sum of the digits of a number `num`.
- The array `A` is precomputed for numbers from 1 to 200,000, storing the cumulative sum of the sums of digits up to each number.

#### Analysis:
1. **Precomputation (`A` Array):**
   - The array `A` is precomputed for numbers from 1 to 200,000. For each number `i` in this range, `func_1(i)` is called to get the sum of its digits, and this sum is added to the cumulative sum stored in `sum`.
   - The cumulative sum `sum` is then appended to `A`.

2. **Dynamic Computation for Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, the program reads `n` and prints `A[n - 1]`.
   - Since `A` is precomputed, the program retrieves the precomputed sum directly, which is correct for any `n` up to 200,000.

3. **Correctness:**
   - The program correctly uses the precomputed array `A` to get the sum of the digits for numbers from 1 to `n`.
   - The precomputation ensures that the program can handle any `n` within the specified range efficiently.
   - The function `func_1` is implemented correctly and is used as intended.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment stated that the program is incorrect because it precomputes the sums for numbers up to 200,000 and does not dynamically compute the sum for any `n` beyond this range. However, the analysis shows that the program correctly uses the precomputed array `A` to handle any `n` within the specified range.

Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
