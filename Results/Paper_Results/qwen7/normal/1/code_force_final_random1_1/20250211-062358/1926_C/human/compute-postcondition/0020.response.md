Output State: **`i` is "400002", `j` is "4", `pd['400002']` is 2**

Explanation: The code `pd[i] += int(j)` increments the value of `pd['400002']` by the integer value of `j`. Given that `j` is "4", `int(j)` evaluates to 4. Since `pd['400002']` was initially 0, after executing the code, `pd['400002']` becomes 0 + 4, which is 4. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged.
