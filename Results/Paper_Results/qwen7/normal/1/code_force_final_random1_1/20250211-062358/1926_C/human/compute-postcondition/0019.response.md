Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is defined by the `for j in str(i):` statement. This means the loop variable `j` is being assigned each character of the string representation of `i`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the values are:
   - `i` is "400002"
   - `j` is "0"
   - `pd['400002']` is 0

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are characters left in the string representation of `i`. Since `i` is "400002" and `j` is currently "0", the loop will continue to the next character.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be the next character in the string "400002". The next character after "0" is "4".

5. **Update the state**: The state at the start of the next iteration should reflect this change.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is "400002", `j` is "4", `pd['400002']` is 0**
