The only variable in the loop head is `num`, so we can only adjust that one.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num`. If `num` is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is equal to `2 * (num % 10)`, and `num` is equal to `int(num / 10)`.

For the loop to be executed one more time, `num` must be a non-zero value. Since `num` is updated to `int(num / 10)` in each iteration, it means `num` will eventually become 0 unless it is a non-zero value at the start of the loop.

Therefore, we need to ensure that `num` is not equal to 0 for the loop to continue.

State: **`a` is equal to `2 * (num % 10)`, `num` must be not equal to 0**
