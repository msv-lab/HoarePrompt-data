### Reasoning

The original assessment provided a detailed analysis of the program and concluded that it is correct. However, upon closer inspection, there are a few issues with the program that need to be addressed:

1. **Range Limitation**: The program precomputes the sum of digits for numbers up to 200,000. While this is fine for the given constraints, it might not be efficient or necessary for all test cases. Specifically, if the input `n` is less than 200,000, the precomputed values are already available, but for larger `n`, the program still needs to compute the sum of digits for numbers beyond 200,000, which is redundant.

2. **Redundant Precomputation**: The program precomputes the sum of digits for all numbers from 1 to 200,000, even though it only needs to handle the numbers up to the maximum `n` provided in the test cases. This can be optimized by computing the sum of digits only for the numbers up to the maximum `n` in each test case.

3. **Functionality**: The `func_1` function is correct and works as expected. However, the overall structure of the program can be simplified and made more efficient.

### Final Evaluation

Given the above points, the original assessment is partially correct but could be improved. The program is correct in terms of functionality, but it can be optimized to avoid unnecessary precomputation.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
