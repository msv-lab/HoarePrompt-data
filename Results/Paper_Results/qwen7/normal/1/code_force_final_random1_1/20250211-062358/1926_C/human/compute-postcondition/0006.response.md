Output State: **`a` is equal to `2 * (num % 10)`, `num` is equal to `int(num / 10)`**

Explanation: The value of `a` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet. The value of `num` is updated to `int(num / 10)`. Since `num` was initially a positive integer between 0 and 20000, after the operation, `num` becomes an integer that is `num` divided by 10 and rounded down. The value of `a` is still defined as `2 * (num % 10)`, but since `num` has changed, the exact value of `a` depends on the new value of `num`.
