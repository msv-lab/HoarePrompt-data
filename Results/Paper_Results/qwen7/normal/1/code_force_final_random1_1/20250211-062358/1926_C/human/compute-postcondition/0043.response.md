Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is set to 800002.
- `n` is an input integer.

The code snippet is:
```python
print(pd[n])
```

Here, `pd` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, and it's not clear from the context what `pd` is. Since `pd` is not defined, we cannot determine its contents or the specific element that would be accessed with `pd[n]`.

Given the lack of information about `pd`, we can only state that `pd[n]` will be accessed and printed, where `n` is an input integer.

Output: **pd[n]**
