Output State: `i` is "400003", `j` is "3", `pd['400003']` is 400012.

Explanation: The loop iterates over each character in the string representation of `i`. Initially, `i` is "400003" and `j` is the first character "4". After the first iteration, `pd['400003']` becomes 400007 (400003 + 4). In the second iteration, `j` becomes the next character "0", and `pd['400003']` becomes 400008 (400007 + 0). In the third iteration, `j` becomes "0" again, and `pd['400003']` becomes 400008 (400008 + 0). This process continues until `j` becomes the last character "3". At this point, `pd['400003']` will be 400012 (400003 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 3), and `j` will be "3".
