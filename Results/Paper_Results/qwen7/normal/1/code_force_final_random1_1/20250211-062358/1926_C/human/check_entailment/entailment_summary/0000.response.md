Reasoning:
- The provided program has a few issues that need to be addressed.
- The main logic of calculating the sum of digits for each number from 1 to \(n\) is implemented correctly in the `func_1` function.
- However, the program precomputes the sums for all numbers up to 200,000 and stores them in the list `A`, which is not necessary and inefficient for multiple test cases.
- Instead, the program should compute the required sum for each test case directly without precomputing all values.
- The current implementation will work correctly for a single test case but will fail for multiple test cases due to the way the results are stored and accessed.

Given the above points, the program is not correct for handling multiple test cases efficiently.

Correctness: **False**
