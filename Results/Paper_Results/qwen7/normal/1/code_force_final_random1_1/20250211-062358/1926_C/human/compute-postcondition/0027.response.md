Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is defined as `for j in str(i):`. This means that the variable `j` takes on each character of the string representation of `i`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is "400003"
   - `j` is "4"
   - `pd['400003']` is `int('400003') + 4`

3. **Determine the next value of `j`**:
   - Since `j` is iterating over the characters of `str(i)`, and `i` is currently "400003", the characters in `str(i)` are '4', '0', '0', '0', '0', '3'.
   - In the previous iteration, `j` was "4". Therefore, the next character in the string representation of `i` is "0".

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` remains unchanged because the loop is iterating over its characters.
   - `j` will now be "0".
   - `pd['400003']` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is "400003", `j` is "0", `pd['400003']` is `int('400003') + 4**
