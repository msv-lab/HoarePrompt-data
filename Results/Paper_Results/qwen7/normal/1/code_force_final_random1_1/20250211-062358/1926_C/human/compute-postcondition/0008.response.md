Output State: **`a` is equal to `3 * (num % 10)`, `num` must be not equal to 0**

Explanation: Initially, `a` is equal to `2 * (num % 10)`. After executing `a = a + num % 10`, `a` gets updated to `2 * (num % 10) + (num % 10)`, which simplifies to `3 * (num % 10)`. The condition that `num` must not be equal to 0 remains unchanged.
