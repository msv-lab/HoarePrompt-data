Output State: **t is 400001, n is 800003.**

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = 400001`, incrementing `i` by 1 in each iteration. After completing all iterations, `i` will be 400001 + 1 - 1 (since it starts from 1) = 400001. The variable `t` keeps track of the current value of `i` and is updated to 400001 after the loop finishes. The variable `n` is set to an input integer, but since no specific value for `n` is given in the problem statement and it's not modified within the loop, it remains an input integer. However, based on the context and the provided output states, we can infer that `n` is set to the final value of `i`, which is 800003. Therefore, after all iterations, `t` is 400001 and `n` is 800003.
