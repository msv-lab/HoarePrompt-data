Output State: `i` is "400002", `j` is "0", `pd['400002']` is 8.

Explanation: The loop continues to add each digit of `i` to `pd[i]`. After the first iteration, `j` becomes "0" and `pd['400002']` is updated to `4 + 0 = 4`. After the second iteration, `j` again becomes "0" and `pd['400002']` is updated to `4 + 0 = 4` (no change because it was already 4). After the third iteration, `j` becomes "4" and `pd['400002']` is updated to `4 + 4 = 8`. Since `i` does not change within the loop, it remains "400002". The loop will continue to add the digits of `i` until there are no more digits left, but based on the given information, we can conclude that after three iterations, `pd['400002']` is 8.
