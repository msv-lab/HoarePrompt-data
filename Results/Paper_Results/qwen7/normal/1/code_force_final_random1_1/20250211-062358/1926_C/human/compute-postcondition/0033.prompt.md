Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer, `N` is 400001, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, `pd` is a list of 400001 zeros.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, N):
    pd[i] += pd[i - 1]
    for j in str(i):
        pd[i] += int(j)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `i` is 400001, `pd[400001]` is `pd[0] + pd[-1] + 400001`.

Explanation: The loop iterates over each digit of `i`. Since `i` starts at 1 and increments with each iteration, it will eventually reach 400001. During each iteration, the value of `pd[i]` is updated by adding the integer value of the current digit of `i` to `pd[i]`. After the loop completes, `i` will be 400001, and `pd[400001]` will be equal to `pd[0] + pd[-1]` plus the sum of all digits from 1 through 400001. However, since the problem does not specify the exact initial value of `pd[0] + pd[-1]`, we can only say that `pd[400001]` is `pd[0] + pd[-1]` plus the sum of all digits from 1 to 400001.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `i` is "400002", `j` is "0", `pd['400002']` is 8.

Explanation: The loop continues to add each digit of `i` to `pd[i]`. After the first iteration, `j` becomes "0" and `pd['400002']` is updated to `4 + 0 = 4`. After the second iteration, `j` again becomes "0" and `pd['400002']` is updated to `4 + 0 = 4` (no change because it was already 4). After the third iteration, `j` becomes "4" and `pd['400002']` is updated to `4 + 4 = 8`. Since `i` does not change within the loop, it remains "400002". The loop will continue to add the digits of `i` until there are no more digits left, but based on the given information, we can conclude that after three iterations, `pd['400002']` is 8.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `i` is "400003", `j` is "3", `pd['400003']` is 400012.

Explanation: The loop iterates over each character in the string representation of `i`. Initially, `i` is "400003" and `j` is the first character "4". After the first iteration, `pd['400003']` becomes 400007 (400003 + 4). In the second iteration, `j` becomes the next character "0", and `pd['400003']` becomes 400008 (400007 + 0). In the third iteration, `j` becomes "0" again, and `pd['400003']` becomes 400008 (400008 + 0). This process continues until `j` becomes the last character "3". At this point, `pd['400003']` will be 400012 (400003 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 3), and `j` will be "3".




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
