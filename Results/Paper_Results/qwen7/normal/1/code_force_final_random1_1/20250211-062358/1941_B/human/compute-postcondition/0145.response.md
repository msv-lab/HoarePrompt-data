Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a set of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), and an array a of n integers (0 ≤ a_j ≤ 10^9). For each test case, the function determines and returns a specific value based on the given inputs.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing a test count `t`, a number of elements `n`, and an array `a` of integers. The function processes these inputs to produce a result for each test case, though the exact nature of the result is not specified in the given information.
