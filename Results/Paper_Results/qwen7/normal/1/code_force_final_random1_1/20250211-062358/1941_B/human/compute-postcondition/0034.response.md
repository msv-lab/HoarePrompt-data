Output State: **`i` is 2; `n` must be greater than 4; `opNum` is `a[2] - a[2]` (which is 0); `a[i]` is `a[2] - opNum` (which is `a[2] - 0` or simply `a[2]`).**

Explanation: The value of `opNum` is `a[2]`. After executing `a[i] -= opNum`, `a[2]` is decreased by `a[2]`, resulting in `a[2] - a[2]` which is 0. Therefore, `a[2]` becomes 0. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
