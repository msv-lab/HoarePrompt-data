Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 0.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting a string representation of integers and converting each element to an integer.
- The first element of `b` is an odd number.
- The second element of `b` is not equal to the first element plus 2.
- The last element of `b` is an odd number.
- The second last element of `b` is not equal to the last element plus 2.

The print statement is simply `print('NO')`.

Since the print statement is explicitly printing the string `'NO'`, the output will be:

Output: **NO**
