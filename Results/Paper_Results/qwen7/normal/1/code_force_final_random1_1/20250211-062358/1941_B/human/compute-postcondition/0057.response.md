Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is set to `n - 3`, where `n` is greater than or equal to 3.
- `opNum` is 0.
- `a[i]`, `a[i + 1]`, and `a[i + 2]` are `a[n - 3]`, `a[n - 2]`, and `a[n - 1]` respectively.
- Either the last two elements of the list `a` are not both zero, or they are both zero.
- `numTest` is greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of integers split from the input.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `stop` is `False`.
- The current value of `a[i]` is less than 0.

The `print('NO')` statement will simply print the string 'NO'.

Output: **NO**
