The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a`. For each test case, it checks if the first element of the list `a` is an odd number differing from the second element by 2, and if the last element of the list `a` is an odd number differing from the second last element by 2. If either condition fails for any test case, it prints 'NO' for that test case; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function does not return anything but prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case.
