Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a list of integers `a` with length `n` for each test case, where `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, and each element `a_j` in the list satisfies 0 ≤ a_j ≤ 10^9. The function also accepts a positive integer `t` such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. It returns different outputs based on the test cases and the list `a`.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each involving a list of integers and a count of those integers. The function processes each test case individually and returns results specific to each case, adhering to the given constraints.
