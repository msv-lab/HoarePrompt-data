Postcondition: `stop` is `True`, `i` is `n - 3`, `opNum` is `a[n - 3]`, `a[i]` is `-2^(n-3) * a[n - 3]`, `a[i + 1]` is `a[n - 2] - (2^n - 2) * a[n - 3]`, `a[i + 2]` is `a[n - 1] - (2^(n-2) - 1) * a[n - 3]`, `numTest` is greater than 0, and if the last element of `a` or the second last element of `a` is not equal to 0, then `stop` remains `True`. If both the last and second last elements of `a` are 0, then `stop` remains `True` and `numTest` is decremented by 1.
