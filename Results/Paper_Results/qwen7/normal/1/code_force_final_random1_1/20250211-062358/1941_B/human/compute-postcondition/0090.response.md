Postcondition: **`stop` is `True`, `i` is `n - 3`, `opNum` is `a[n - 3]`, `a[i]` is `-2^(n-3) * a[n - 3]`, `a[i + 1]` is `a[n - 2] - (2^n - 2) * a[n - 3]`, `a[i + 2]` is `a[n - 1] - (2^(n-2) - 1) * a[n - 3]`, `numTest` is greater than 0.**

This postcondition remains the same as the precondition since the if part does not change the state of the variables and there is no else part to consider. The loop has already completed its execution, and the values of the variables are as described in the precondition.
