Output State: **`stop` is `True`, `i` is `2`, `opNum` is `a[1]`, `a[0]` is `-2^(n-3) * a[n - 3]`, `a[1]` is `a[n - 2] - (2^n - 2) * a[n - 3]`, `a[2]` is `a[n - 1] - (2^(n-2) - 1) * a[n - 3] - opNum`, `numTest` is `numTest - 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The code updates `a[i]` by subtracting `opNum`. Initially, `i` is 1, so `a[1] -= opNum`. Given that `opNum` is equal to `a[1]`, `a[1]` is effectively subtracted from itself, resulting in `a[1]` being unchanged. However, since `i` was 1 and the operation updated `a[1]`, `i` is incremented to 2. The other variables remain unchanged as no operations were performed on them.
