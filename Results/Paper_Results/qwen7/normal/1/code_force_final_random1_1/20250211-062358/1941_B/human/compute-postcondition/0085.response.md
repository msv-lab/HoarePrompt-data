Output State: **`stop` is `True`, `i` is `n - 3`, `opNum` is `a[n - 3]`, `a[i]` is `-4 * a[n - 3]`, `a[i + 1]` is `a[n - 2] - 6 * a[n - 3]`, `a[i + 2]` is `a[n - 1] - 5 * a[n - 3] - opNum`, `numTest` is greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code `a[i + 2] -= opNum` subtracts `opNum` from `a[i + 2]`. Given that `a[i + 2]` was originally `a[n - 1] - 5 * a[n - 3]`, after the operation, it becomes `a[n - 1] - 5 * a[n - 3] - opNum`. All other variables remain unchanged.
