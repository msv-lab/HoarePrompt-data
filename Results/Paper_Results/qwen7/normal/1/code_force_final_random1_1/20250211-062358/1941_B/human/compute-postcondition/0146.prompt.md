You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and the array a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_j ≤ 10^9 for each element a_j in the array. The sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func():
    numTest = int(input())
    for _ in range(0, numTest):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        
        stop = False
        
        for i in range(0, n - 2):
            if a[i] < 0:
                print('NO')
                stop = True
                break
            opNum = a[i]
            a[i] -= opNum
            a[i + 1] -= 2 * opNum
            a[i + 2] -= opNum
        
        if stop == True:
            continue
        
        if a[len(a) - 1] != 0 or a[len(a) - 2] != 0:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
        
    #State: Output State: All tests specified by `numTest` have been processed. For each test, the list `a` has been modified according to the operations defined in the loop. Specifically, if the condition `a[i] < 0` was ever met for any `i` during the processing of a test, the output immediately printed was 'NO', and no further operations were performed on that test. If no such condition was met, the operations were applied until the end of the list `a`, and if the last two elements of `a` were both zero, the output printed was 'YES'. If the last two elements were not both zero, the output printed was 'NO'.
    #
    #If all tests were processed without encountering the `stop` condition (`stop == True`), the final state of `a` for each test would reflect the cumulative effect of the operations defined in the loop. If the `stop` condition was encountered for any test, that test's processing would halt prematurely, and 'NO' would be printed for that test.
    #
    #The variable `numTest` would be decremented by the number of tests processed, and once it reaches zero, the loop would terminate.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a set of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), and an array a of n integers (0 ≤ a_j ≤ 10^9). For each test case, the function determines and returns a specific value based on the given inputs.

The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
