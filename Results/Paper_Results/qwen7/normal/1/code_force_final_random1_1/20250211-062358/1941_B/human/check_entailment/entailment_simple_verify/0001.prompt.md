You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

    YES
    NO
    NO
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and the array a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_j ≤ 10^9 for each element a_j in the array. The sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.

    #State: Output State: All tests specified by `numTest` have been processed. For each test, the list `a` has been modified according to the operations defined in the loop. Specifically, if the condition `a[i] < 0` was ever met for any `i` during the processing of a test, the output immediately printed was 'NO', and no further operations were performed on that test. If no such condition was met, the operations were applied until the end of the list `a`, and if the last two elements of `a` were both zero, the output printed was 'YES'. If the last two elements were not both zero, the output printed was 'NO'.
    #
    #If all tests were processed without encountering the `stop` condition (`stop == True`), the final state of `a` for each test would reflect the cumulative effect of the operations defined in the loop. If the `stop` condition was encountered for any test, that test's processing would halt prematurely, and 'NO' would be printed for that test.
    #
    #The variable `numTest` would be decremented by the number of tests processed, and once it reaches zero, the loop would terminate.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `numTest`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Checking for Negative Elements:**
   - The program iterates through the array from index 0 to `n-3` (since the operation requires indices `i`, `i+1`, and `i+2`).
   - If any element `a[i]` is negative, it prints 'NO' and stops further processing for that test case.
   
3. **Applying Operations:**
   - For each valid index `i`, the program calculates the number of operations `opNum` required to reduce `a[i]` to zero.
   - It then applies the operations to `a[i]`, `a[i+1]`, and `a[i+2]` by subtracting `opNum`, `2*opNum`, and `opNum` respectively.
   - This part of the code seems to be incorrectly implemented because it doesn't actually ensure that the elements are reduced to zero. Instead, it just modifies them without checking if they can be made zero.

4. **Final Check:**
   - After the loop, the program checks if the last two elements `a[n-1]` and `a[n-2]` are zero.
   - If either of them is non-zero, it prints 'NO'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

### Issues with the Program

1. **Incorrect Operation Application:**
   - The logic for applying the operations is flawed. The program does not ensure that the elements can be reduced to zero. Instead, it just modifies them without a proper strategy to achieve the goal.

2. **Lack of Strategy:**
   - The program does not have a strategy to ensure that all elements can be reduced to zero. It only checks if there are any negative elements initially and then makes arbitrary modifications without ensuring the final state.

3. **Potential Infinite Loop:**
   - If the initial array configuration does not allow making all elements zero, the program may enter an infinite loop due to the incorrect application of operations.

### Correct Solution

To correctly solve the problem, we need to check if the sum of all elements in the array is even. If it is, then it is possible to make all elements zero; otherwise, it is not.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    numTest = int(input())
    for _ in range(numTest):
        n = int(input())
        a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        total_sum = sum(a)
        
        if total_sum % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

# Example usage
func()
```

### Conclusion

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic to determine if all elements can be made zero. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
