Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer. The first element of `b` is either an odd number and the second element is not equal to the first element plus 2, or the last element of `b` is an odd number and the second last element is not equal to the last element plus 2. Otherwise, the first element of `b` is an even number or the second element equals the first element plus 2, and the last element of `b` is an even number or the second last element equals the last element plus 2.
