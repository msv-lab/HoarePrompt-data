Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < n - 2`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `stop` is `True`
   - `i` is `n - 3`
   - `opNum` is `a[n - 3]`
   - `a[i]` is `-2 * a[n - 3]`
   - `a[i + 1]` is `a[n - 2] - 4 * a[n - 3]`
   - `a[i + 2]` is `a[n - 1] - 5 * a[n - 3]`
   - `numTest` is greater than 0

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will execute again if `i < n - 2`.
   - Currently, `i` is `n - 3`, so `i < n - 2` is `False` (since `n - 3` is not less than `n - 2`).
   - Therefore, the loop will not execute again based on the current value of `i`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop will not execute again, no changes are needed for `i` or `n`.
   - The other variables (`stop`, `opNum`, `a[i]`, `a[i + 1]`, `a[i + 2]`, and `numTest`) remain unchanged.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration (which won't happen) remains the same as the current state.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`stop` is `True`, `i` is `n - 3`, `opNum` is `a[n - 3]`, `a[i]` is `-2 * a[n - 3]`, `a[i + 1]` is `a[n - 2] - 4 * a[n - 3]`, `a[i + 2]` is `a[n - 1] - 5 * a[n - 3]`, `numTest` is greater than 0**
