Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `char` is not in `unique_chars`, `unique_chars` contains the character `char` at index `i`.**

Explanation: The code inserts the character `char` into the list `unique_chars` at index `i`. The initial state of `s` being a non-empty string and `char` not being in `unique_chars` remains unchanged. After executing the code, `unique_chars` now includes the character `char` at the specified index `i`.
