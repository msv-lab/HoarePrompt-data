Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `char` is not in `unique_chars`, `unique_chars` contains the character `char` at index `i+1`.**

Explanation: The variable `i` is incremented by 1. Initially, `unique_chars` contained the character `char` at index `i`. After incrementing `i` by 1, the character `char` is now at index `i+1` in `unique_chars`. The other variables remain unchanged.
