Output State: **`s` remains unchanged, `char` is the next character in `s`, `j` is adjusted (decremented if `char` is in `unique_chars`, incremented otherwise), and `unique_chars` has the new character `i` inserted, `i` is increased by 1**.

This means that the variable `i` has been incremented by 1, while the other variables (`s`, `char`, `j`, and `unique_chars`) remain in their previous states relative to the initial conditions provided.
