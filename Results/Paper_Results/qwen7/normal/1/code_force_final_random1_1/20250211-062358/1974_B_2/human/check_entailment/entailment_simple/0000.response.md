Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the decoding process. Let's analyze the steps:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It attempts to decode the string `s` by replacing each character with its corresponding character from the sorted list of unique characters (`unique_chars`).
   - However, the logic inside the loop is flawed. Specifically, it incorrectly uses the index `j` to replace characters in `s`. Instead, it should use the position of the character in `unique_chars`.

2. **Correct Decoding Process**:
   - To decode, we need to map each character in the encoded string back to its original character in the sorted list of unique characters.
   - We should create a mapping from the encoded characters to the original characters and then reconstruct the original string.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(s):
    unique_chars = sorted(set(s))
    mapping = {char: unique_chars[i] for i, char in enumerate(unique_chars)}
    
    decoded_str = ''.join(mapping[char] for char in s)
    return decoded_str
```

Explanation:
- `unique_chars` is the sorted list of unique characters from the encoded string.
- `mapping` is a dictionary that maps each character in `unique_chars` to itself.
- `decoded_str` is constructed by looking up each character in the encoded string `s` in the `mapping` dictionary.

Now, let's evaluate the provided program against the corrected logic:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        b = input()
        decoded_str = func_1(b)
        print(decoded_str)

def func_1(s):
    unique_chars = sorted(set(s))
    mapping = {char: unique_chars[i] for i, char in enumerate(unique_chars)}
    
    decoded_str = ''.join(mapping[char] for char in s)
    return decoded_str
```

Given the corrected function, the program now correctly decodes the encoded string.

Correctness: **False**
