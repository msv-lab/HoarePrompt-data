#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The string s represents the result of encoding some original string according to the specified algorithm.
def func_1(s):
    unique_chars = sorted(list({char for char in s}))
    i, j = 0, len(unique_chars) - 1
    for char in s:
        if char in unique_chars:
            s = s.replace(char, unique_chars[j])
            j -= 1
        else:
            unique_chars.insert(i, char)
            i += 1
            j += 1
        
    #State: After all iterations, `i` is equal to the number of unique characters in `s`, `j` is less than or equal to -1, and `s` is a string where each character that was originally in `unique_chars` has been replaced according to the final value of `j` for each character.
    return ''.join(unique_chars)
    #The program returns a string containing all unique characters from `unique_chars` in their respective order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a string containing all unique characters from `s` in the order they first appear. It achieves this by identifying unique characters, sorting them, and replacing each character in `s` with the corresponding character from the sorted list, then returning the updated string.
