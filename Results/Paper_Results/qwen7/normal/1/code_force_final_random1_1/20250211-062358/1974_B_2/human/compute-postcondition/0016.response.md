Output State: **`s` remains unchanged, `char` becomes the next character in `s`, `j` is adjusted (decremented if `char` is in `unique_chars`, incremented otherwise), and `unique_chars` is updated to include the character `i` + 1.**

This means that the variable `i` has been incremented by 1, while the other variables (`s`, `char`, `j`, and `unique_chars`) retain their previous states except that `unique_chars` now includes the character that `i` points to after the increment.
