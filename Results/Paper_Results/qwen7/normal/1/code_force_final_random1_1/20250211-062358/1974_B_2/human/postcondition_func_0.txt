The function accepts a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a string containing all unique characters from `s` in the order they first appear. It achieves this by identifying unique characters, sorting them, and replacing each character in `s` with the corresponding character from the sorted list, then returning the updated string.
