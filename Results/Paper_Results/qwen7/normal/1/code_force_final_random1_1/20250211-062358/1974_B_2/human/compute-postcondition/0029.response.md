Output State: **The program returns a string containing all unique characters from `unique_chars` in their respective order.**

Explanation: The code `return ''.join(unique_chars)` joins all elements of the `unique_chars` list into a single string. Since `unique_chars` contains unique characters from the string `s` (after replacements according to the final value of `j` for each character), the returned string will be composed of these unique characters in the order they appear in `unique_chars`.
