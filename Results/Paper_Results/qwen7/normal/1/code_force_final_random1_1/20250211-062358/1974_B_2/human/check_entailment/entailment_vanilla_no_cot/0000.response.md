Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the decoding logic. Specifically, the `func_1` function is attempting to decode the string, but it is actually encoding the string instead. The logic inside `func_1` replaces characters in the encoded string with characters from the sorted unique characters list, which is the opposite of what is required for decoding.

To fix this, the function should map each character in the encoded string to its corresponding character in the reversed sorted unique characters list, rather than trying to replace characters directly. Here is the corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(s):
    unique_chars = sorted(list({char for char in s}))
    # Create a mapping from each character in the encoded string to its corresponding character in the reversed sorted unique characters list
    reverse_mapping = {char: unique_chars[-i-1] for i, char in enumerate(unique_chars)}
    
    decoded_str = ''.join(reverse_mapping[char] for char in s)
    return decoded_str
```

With this correction, the program should correctly decode the encoded strings.
