Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array. The program sorts the array and prints the difference between the maximum and minimum elements, which does not necessarily maximize the beauty of the array according to the given definition. 

For example, consider the input:
```
3
100 54 80 43 90
```
The program sorts the array to `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]` and outputs `100 - 43 = 57`. However, the correct approach would be to rearrange the array such that the differences `(a_i - a_{i-1})` are maximized. For the given input, the optimal arrangement could be `[90, 43, 100, 54, 80]`, which gives a beauty of `(90 - 43) + (100 - 90) + (54 - 100) + (80 - 54) = 47 + 10 - 46 + 26 = 57`. 

Since the program does not guarantee the maximum beauty, it is incorrect.
