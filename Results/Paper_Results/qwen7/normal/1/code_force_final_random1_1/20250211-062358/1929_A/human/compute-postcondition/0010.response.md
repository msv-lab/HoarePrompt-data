Given the initial state:

- `ntest` is a positive integer.
- `itest` is 1.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(a[len(a) - 1] - a[0])`.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
2. Since `a` is sorted, the last element (`a[len(a) - 1]`) is the maximum value in the list, and the first element (`a[0]`) is the minimum value in the list.
3. The expression `a[len(a) - 1] - a[0]` calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `a`.

Therefore, the output will be the difference between the largest and smallest integers in the list `a`.

Output: **the difference between the largest and smallest integers in the list a**
