Given the initial state:
- `ntest` is a positive integer (though its specific value is not needed for this particular print statement).
- `itest` is 2.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of sorted integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.

The print statement is:
```python
print(a[len(a) - 1] - a[0])
```

This statement calculates the difference between the last element (`a[len(a) - 1]`) and the first element (`a[0]`) of the list `a`.

Since `a` is a list of sorted integers, the last element is the maximum value in the list, and the first element is the minimum value in the list. Therefore, the expression `a[len(a) - 1] - a[0]` computes the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `a`.

Output: **the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `a`**
