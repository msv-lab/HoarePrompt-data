### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program sorts the array and then calculates the difference between the largest and smallest elements. However, let's break down the logic and verify if this approach indeed maximizes the beauty of the array.

1. **Sorting the Array**: Sorting the array ensures that the largest and smallest elements are at the ends of the array. This is a crucial step because the beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. By placing the largest and smallest elements at the ends, we ensure that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized for the first and last elements.

2. **Difference Calculation**: The program calculates the difference between the largest and smallest elements in the sorted array. This difference represents the maximum possible difference between any two consecutive elements in the array when the array is sorted.

3. **Maximizing Beauty**: The beauty of the array is the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. When the array is sorted, the differences between consecutive elements are maximized for the first and last elements. For the remaining elements, the differences are minimized because they are placed in increasing order. Therefore, the sum of these differences will be the same as the difference between the largest and smallest elements.

Given this analysis, the program correctly calculates the maximum beauty of the array by sorting the array and finding the difference between the largest and smallest elements.

### Conclusion

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly calculates the maximum beauty of the array by sorting the array and finding the difference between the largest and smallest elements.

### Final Answer

Final: **True**
