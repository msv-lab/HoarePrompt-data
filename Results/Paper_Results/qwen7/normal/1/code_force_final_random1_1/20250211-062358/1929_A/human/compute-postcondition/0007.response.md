Output State: **`ntest` must be a positive integer, `itest` is 1, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The variable `ntest` remains a positive integer, and `itest` remains 1.
