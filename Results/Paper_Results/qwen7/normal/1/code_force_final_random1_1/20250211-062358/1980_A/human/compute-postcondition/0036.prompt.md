Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list with the elements from `test_cases[_][0]`, `n` is set to `test_cases[_][0]`, `m` is set to `test_cases[_][1]`, and `freq` is a list of 7 zeros.
Code of the loop:
for prob in a:
    freq[ord(prob) - ord('A')] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is a non-empty list, `n` is set to `test_cases[_][0]`, `m` is set to `test_cases[_][1]`, `freq` is a list of 7 zeros with one element incremented by 1 where the index is the ASCII value of `prob` minus the ASCII value of 'A'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a non-empty list with one less element, `n` is set to `test_cases[_][0]`, `m` is set to `test_cases[_][1]`, `freq` is a list of 7 zeros with one element incremented by 1 where the index is the ASCII value of the new `prob` minus the ASCII value of 'A', and `freq[ord(prob) - ord('A')]` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a non-empty list with one less element, `n` is set to `test_cases[_][0]`, `m` is set to `test_cases[_][1]`, `freq` is a list of 7 zeros with one element incremented by 1 where the index is the ASCII value of the new `prob` minus the ASCII value of 'A', and `freq[ord(prob) - ord('A')]` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
