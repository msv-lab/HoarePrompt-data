Output State: **`a` must have at least one element; `freq` is a list of length 26 where the index `ord(prob) - ord('A')` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code increments the count at the index `ord(prob) - ord('A')` in the `freq` list. Since `prob` is a character, `ord(prob)` gives its ASCII value, and subtracting `ord('A')` aligns it to the range of indices from 0 to 25 (for 'A' to 'Z'). The `freq` list was initially set up such that each index corresponds to a letter in the alphabet, and this code updates the count for the specific letter corresponding to `prob`. The precondition that `a` must have at least one element remains unchanged.
