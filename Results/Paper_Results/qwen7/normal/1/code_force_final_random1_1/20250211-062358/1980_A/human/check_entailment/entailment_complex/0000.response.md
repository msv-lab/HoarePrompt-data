Reasoning:
1. The program correctly defines the function `func_1` which takes the number of test cases `t` and a list of test cases `test_cases` as input.
2. It initializes an empty list `results` to store the results for each test case.
3. It iterates over each test case, extracting `n`, `m`, and the string `a` representing the problem difficulties.
4. It creates a frequency list `freq` of length 7 (corresponding to the difficulty levels 'A' to 'G') and counts the occurrences of each difficulty level in the string `a`.
5. It calculates the number of missing problems needed for each difficulty level by finding the difference between `m` and the frequency `f` of each difficulty level, ensuring that the difference is non-negative.
6. It sums these differences to get the total number of additional problems needed for the current test case.
7. It appends this sum to the `results` list.
8. After processing all test cases, it returns the `results` list.

Given the logic and the steps involved, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
