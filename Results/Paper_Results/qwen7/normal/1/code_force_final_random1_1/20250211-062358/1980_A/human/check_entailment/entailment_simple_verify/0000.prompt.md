You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vlad is planning to hold m rounds next month. Each round should contain one
problem of difficulty levels 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'.

Vlad already has a bank of n problems, where the i -th problem has a
difficulty level of a_i . There may not be enough of these problems, so he may
have to come up with a few more problems.

Vlad wants to come up with as few problems as possible, so he asks you to find
the minimum number of problems he needs to come up with in order to hold m
rounds.

For example, if m=1 , n = 10 , a= 'BGECDCBDED', then he needs to come up with
two problems: one of difficulty level 'A' and one of difficulty level 'F'.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 50
, 1 \le m \le 5 ) — the number of problems in the bank and the number of
upcoming rounds, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a string a of n characters from 'A'
to 'G' — the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of problems
that need to come up with to hold m rounds.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the minimum number of additional problems Vlad needs to create to ensure that he can hold `m` rounds with at least one problem of each difficulty level. 

Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. For each test case, the program initializes a frequency array `freq` to count the occurrences of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G').
2. It iterates through the string `a` and increments the corresponding index in the `freq` array.
3. It then calculates how many problems are missing for each difficulty level using the formula `max(0, m - f)` where `f` is the frequency of the current difficulty level. This ensures that if the frequency is less than `m`, the difference is added to the `missing` count.
4. Finally, it sums up the `missing` values for all difficulty levels to get the total number of additional problems needed.

Given the constraints and the logic used, the program handles all potential cases correctly. The examples provided in the problem statement and the given test cases also validate this conclusion. Therefore, the program is correct.
