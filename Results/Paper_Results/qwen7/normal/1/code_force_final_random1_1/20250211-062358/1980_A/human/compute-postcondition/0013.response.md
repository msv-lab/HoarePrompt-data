Output State: **`a` is an empty list or contains elements, `freq` is a list of length 26 where each index `ord(prob) - ord('A')` is incremented by the number of times its corresponding character appears in the list `a`, `missing` is the sum of the maximum of 0 and the difference between `m` and `f` for each pair of `m` in `freq` and `f` in `freq`, `results` is a list containing one element which is the value of `missing`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `missing` to the list `results`. Since `missing` is already defined and calculated before this line, appending it to `results` does not change its value. The other variables (`a`, `freq`, and `missing`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
