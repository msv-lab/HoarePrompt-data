Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to create for the given test cases. The function `func_1` processes each test case, counts the frequency of each difficulty level in the input string, and calculates the number of additional problems needed to ensure that there are at least `m` problems for each difficulty level. The solution matches the requirements and examples provided in the problem statement.
