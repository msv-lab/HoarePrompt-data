Output State: **`a` must have at least one element; `freq` is a list of length 26 where the index `ord(prob) - ord('A')` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code increments the count at the index `ord(prob) - ord('A')` in the `freq` list. Since `prob` is a character, `ord(prob)` gives its ASCII value, and subtracting `ord('A')` aligns it to the range 0-25, which corresponds to the indices in the `freq` list. The initial state of `a` having at least one element is preserved, and the `freq` list is updated to reflect the count of the character `prob`.
