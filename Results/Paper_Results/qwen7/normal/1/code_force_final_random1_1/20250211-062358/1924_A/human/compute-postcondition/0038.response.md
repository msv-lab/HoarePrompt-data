Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `i` is 2, `s` is the string input by the user, `cnt` is the total number of times the condition `cur == (1 << k) - 1` was met during the loop execution, `cur` is 0, `ans` is the concatenation of all characters from the string `s` that satisfied the condition `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` remains unchanged, `i` is 2, `s` is the original string input by the user, `cnt` is the count of substrings where all characters from 'a' to 'z' (or up to the length of the substring) were present without any duplicates, `cur` resets to 0, and `ans` contains the concatenated sequence of characters that formed complete substrings as described by `cnt`.
