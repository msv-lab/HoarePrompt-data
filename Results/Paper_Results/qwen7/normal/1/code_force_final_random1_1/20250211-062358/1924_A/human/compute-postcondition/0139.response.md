Output State: **`ss` is the first character of `s`, `s` is the input string, `cur_ss` is the difference between the ASCII value of `ss` and the ASCII value of 'a'.**

Explanation: The code calculates the position of the character `ss` in the alphabet (where 'a' is 0, 'b' is 1, etc.) and stores this value in `cur_ss`. The initial state of `ss` and `s` remains unchanged.
