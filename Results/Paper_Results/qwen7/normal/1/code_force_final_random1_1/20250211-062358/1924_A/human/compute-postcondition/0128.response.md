Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is greater than 0, `cur` is such that `(cur & 1 << 0)` and `(cur & 1 << 1)` both evaluate to 0, `tmp` is 'd', `ans` is 'aad' + 'd', and `cnt` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `ans += tmp` concatenates the value of `tmp` ('d') to the end of the string `ans`. Initially, `ans` is 'aad'. After the operation, `ans` becomes 'aad' + 'd', which is 'aad' + 'd'. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
