Output State: **`ans` is 'aaaad', `cnt` is 0, `i` is 2, `k` is an integer input, `m` is an integer input, `cur` is such that `(cur & 1 << 0)` and `(cur & 1 << 1)` both evaluate to 0, `tmp` is 'd', `cur_ss` remains unchanged, `n` is an integer input, `t` remains unchanged, `s` is the input string.**

Explanation: The line `cnt = 0` sets the value of `cnt` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
