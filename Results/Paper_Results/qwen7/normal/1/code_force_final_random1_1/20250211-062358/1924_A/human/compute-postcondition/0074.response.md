Output State: **`ss` is the first character of `s`, `s` is the updated string input by the user, `cur_ss` is the numerical value of the ASCII of `ss` minus the ASCII of 'a'**.

This means that `cur_ss` is calculated as the difference between the ASCII value of `ss` and the ASCII value of 'a'. The values of `ss` and `s` remain unchanged from their initial state.
