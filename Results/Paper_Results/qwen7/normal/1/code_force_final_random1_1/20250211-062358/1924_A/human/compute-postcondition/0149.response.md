Output State: **`ss` is the first character of `s`, `s` is the input string, `cur_ss` is the difference between the ASCII value of `ss` and the ASCII value of 'a', `ans` is `ss`, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans += ss` appends the first character of the string `s` (stored in `ss`) to the variable `ans`. All other variables (`cur_ss`, `cur`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
