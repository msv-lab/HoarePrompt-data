Output State: **`ss` is the first character of `s`, `s` is the updated string input by the user, `cur_ss` is the numerical value of the ASCII of `ss` minus the ASCII of 'a', and the current value of `cur` has the bit corresponding to `cur_ss` set to 1.**

Explanation: The code `cur += 1 << cur_ss` shifts the binary number `1` to the left by `cur_ss` positions, which sets the `cur_ss`-th bit of `cur` to `1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
