Output State: **`ans` is 'aaaad', `cnt` is 1, `i` is 2, `k` is an integer input, `m` is an integer input, `cur` is such that `(cur & 1 << 0)` and `(cur & 1 << 1)` both evaluate to 0, `tmp` is 'd', `cur_ss` remains unchanged, `n` is an integer input, `t` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `n, k, m = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `n`, `k`, and `m` respectively. The values of `ans`, `cnt`, `i`, `cur`, `tmp`, `cur_ss`, and `t` remain unchanged from their initial states. `k` and `m` are now integers based on the input, but the exact values are not specified.
