Postcondition: **The final value of `ans` is the entire input string `s`, `cnt` is the total number of characters in `s`, `cur` is 0, `cur_ss` is the last calculated value which is the difference between the ASCII value of the last character of `s` and the ASCII value of 'a', `tmp` is 'd', `t` remains unchanged, and `m` remains unchanged. If the length of the string `s` is greater than or equal to `n`, then nothing changes. Otherwise, `i` is set to 2, `k` is greater than 0, `tmp` is set to 'c', and `ans` is set to 'ca'.**
