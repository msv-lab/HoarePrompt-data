Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for ss in s`. The variables involved here are `ss` and `s`.

2. **Understand the current state**: 
   - `ss` is the second character of `s`.
   - `s` is the input string.
   - `cur_ss` is the value of `ord(ss) - ord('a')`.
   - `ans` is the second character of `s` concatenated with the previous value of `ans`.
   - `cur` is 0.
   - `cnt` is incremented by 1.

3. **Determine the next state**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `ss` should be the third character of `s` (since it was the second character in the previous iteration).
   - `s` remains the same as it is the input string.
   - `cur_ss` will be the value of `ord(ss) - ord('a')` where `ss` is now the third character of `s`.
   - `ans` will be updated to include the third character of `s` concatenated with the previous value of `ans`.
   - `cur` remains 0.
   - `cnt` will be incremented by 1.

Given these points, we can now formulate the new state:

State: **`ss` is the third character of `s`, `s` is the input string, `cur_ss` is the value of `ord(ss) - ord('a')`, `ans` is the third character of `s` concatenated with the previous value of `ans`, `cur` is 0, and `cnt` is incremented by 1**.
