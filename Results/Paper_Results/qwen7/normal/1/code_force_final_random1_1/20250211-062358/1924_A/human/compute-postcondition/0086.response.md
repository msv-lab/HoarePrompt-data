Output State: **`ss` is the second character of `s`; `s` remains the same; `cur_ss` is the numerical value of the ASCII of the second character of `s` minus the ASCII of 'a'; `cur` remains 0; `cnt` is increased by 1; `ans` remains the first character of `s`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `cur_ss` by calculating the difference between the ASCII value of the second character of `s` and the ASCII value of 'a'. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
