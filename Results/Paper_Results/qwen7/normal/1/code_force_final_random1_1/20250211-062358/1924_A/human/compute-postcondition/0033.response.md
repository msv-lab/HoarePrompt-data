`cnt` is incremented by 1. Initially, `cnt` is 1, so after the increment, `cnt` becomes 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `cur` is 1 shifted left by `cur_ss` + 1, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^5\), `i` is 2, `s` is the string input by the user, `cnt` is 2, `cur_ss` is the difference between the ASCII value of the next character in `s` and the ASCII value of 'a', `ans` is the first character of the string `s` plus the next character in `s`.
