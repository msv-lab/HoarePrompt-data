Output State: **`cur` is an integer, `tmp` is 'a' + i, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block specified, the `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `cur` or `tmp`. It only indicates that we exit the most internal loop or if statement we were inside. The value of `i` is not affected by the `break` statement as it is not within a loop or conditional block that would be exited by this statement.
