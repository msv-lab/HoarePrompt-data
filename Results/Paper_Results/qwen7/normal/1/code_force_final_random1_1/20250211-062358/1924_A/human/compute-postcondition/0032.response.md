Postcondition: **`cur` is 1 shifted left by `cur_ss` + 1, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^5\), `i` is 2, `s` is the string input by the user, `cnt` is 1, `cur_ss` is the difference between the ASCII value of the next character in `s` and the ASCII value of 'a', `ans` is the first character of the string `s` plus the next character in `s`.** 

This means that if the condition `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0` is true, `cur` will be updated to 1 shifted left by `cur_ss` + 1, and all other variables (`t`, `i`, `s`, `cnt`, `cur_ss`, `ans`) will retain their values as specified in the precondition. If the condition is false, the values of these variables do not change from their initial states as described in the precondition.
