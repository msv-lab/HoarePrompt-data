Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is greater than 0, `cur` is such that `(cur & 1 << 0)` and `(cur & 1 << 1)` both evaluate to 0, `tmp` is 'd', `ans` is 'aaaad', and `cnt` is 1**.

Explanation: The code `ans += 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)` appends `'a'` repeated `n - cnt - 1` times to the string `ans`. Given the initial state, `cnt` is 0, so `n - cnt - 1` evaluates to `n - 0 - 1 = n - 1`. Since `ans` is initially `'aad' + 'd'`, which is `'aadad'`, appending `'a' * (n - 1)` means appending `'a'` once (since `n` is not specified, we assume it's the length of the current `ans` plus one, i.e., 5), resulting in `'aaaad'`. The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1, making it 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
