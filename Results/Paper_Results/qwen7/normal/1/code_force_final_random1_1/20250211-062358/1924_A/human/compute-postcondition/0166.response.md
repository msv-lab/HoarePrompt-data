Output State: **`ss` is the third character of `s`, `s` is the input string, `cur_ss` is the value of `ord(ss) - ord('a')`, `ans` is the third character of `s` concatenated with the previous value of `ans`, `cur` is set to `1 << cur_ss`, `cnt` is incremented by 1 (new value is `cnt + 1`).**

Explanation: The line `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
