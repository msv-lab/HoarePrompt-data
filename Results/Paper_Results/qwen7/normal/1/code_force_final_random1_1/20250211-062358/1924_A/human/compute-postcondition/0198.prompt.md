Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer, and it is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n, k, m = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    cnt = 0
    cur = 0
    ans = ''
    for ss in s:
        cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
        if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
            cur += 1 << cur_ss
        if cur == (1 << k) - 1:
            cnt += 1
            cur = 0
            ans += ss
    if cnt >= n:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
        tmp = ''
        for i in range(k):
            if cur & 1 << i == 0:
                tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)
                break
        ans += tmp
        ans += 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)
        print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `i` is the total length of the string `s`, `s` is the string input by the user, `cnt` is the number of times `cur` equals \(2^k - 1\) during the loop's execution, `cur` is 0, and `ans` is a string containing every character from `s` that caused `cur` to reach \(2^k - 1\). If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, the function does not change these variables. Otherwise, `i` is equal to `k-1`, `cur` is 0, `tmp` is determined based on the unset bit in `cur` (if any), and `ans` is a string containing characters from `s` that caused `cur` to reach \(2^k - 1\) during the loop's execution, followed by 'a' repeated `(n - cnt - 1)` times.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ans` is the concatenation of all characters in the string `s`, `cnt` is the total number of times the inner condition `cur == (1 << k) - 1` was met, and all other variables (`cur`, `cur_ss`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `t`) remain as they were in the initial state. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, no changes are made to `ans` and `cnt`. Otherwise, `i` is set to 2, `k` is greater than 0, `cur` is such that `(cur & 1 << 0)` and `(cur & 1 << 1)` both evaluate to 0, `tmp` is 'd', and `ans` is 'aaaad' with `cnt` set to 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The final value of `ans` is the entire input string `s`, `cnt` is the total number of characters in `s`, `cur` is 0, `cur_ss` is the last calculated value which is the difference between the ASCII value of the last character of `s` and the ASCII value of 'a', `tmp` is 'd', `t` remains unchanged, and `m` remains unchanged. If the length of the string `s` is greater than or equal to `n`, then nothing changes. Otherwise, `i` is set to 2, `k` is greater than 0, `tmp` is set to 'c', and `ans` is set to 'ca'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
