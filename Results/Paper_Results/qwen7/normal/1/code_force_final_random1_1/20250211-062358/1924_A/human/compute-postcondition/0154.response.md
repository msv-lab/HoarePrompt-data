Output State: **`ss` is the second character of `s`, `s` is the input string, `cur_ss` is the value of `ord(ss) - ord('a')`, `ans` is the concatenation of the second character of `s` with the previous value of `ans`, `cur` is 1 shifted left by `cur_ss`, and `cnt` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `cur += 1 << cur_ss` increments `cur` by `1` left-shifted by `cur_ss`. Given that `cur_ss` is the value of `ord(ss) - ord('a')`, `cur` is updated to `cur + (1 << (ord(ss) - ord('a'))).` All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
