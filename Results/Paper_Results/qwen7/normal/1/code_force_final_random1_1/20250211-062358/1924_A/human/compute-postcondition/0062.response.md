Output State: **`i` is equal to `k-1`, `cur` is an integer where the bits from 0 to `k-1` are checked and if any of them were not set, `tmp` is the corresponding character ('a' to 'j' if `k` is 10), otherwise `tmp` is 'b', and `ans` is a string containing characters from `s` that caused `cur` to reach \(2^k - 1\) during the loop's execution.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `i` will be equal to `k-1` (since the loop runs `k` times). The variable `cur` will be an integer with bits from 0 to `k-1` checked. If any bit from 0 to `k-1` was not set in `cur`, `tmp` will be the corresponding character ('a' to 'j' if `k` is 10). If all bits were set, `tmp` will be 'b'. The variable `ans` will contain all characters from `s` that caused `cur` to reach \(2^k - 1\) during the loop's execution.
