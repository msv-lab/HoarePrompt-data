Postcondition: `ss` is the first character of `s`, `s` is the input string, `cur_ss` is the difference between the ASCII value of `ss` and the ASCII value of 'a'. After executing the if else block, `cur` is updated such that if the bit corresponding to `cur_ss` in `cur` is 0, `cur` remains unchanged. If the bit is 1, `cur` is updated to `cur & ~(1 << cur_ss)`.
