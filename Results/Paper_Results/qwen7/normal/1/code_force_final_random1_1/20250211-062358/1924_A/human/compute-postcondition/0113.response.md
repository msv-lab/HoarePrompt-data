Output State: **`i` is 0, `k` must be greater than 0, and the current value of `cur` is such that `(cur & 1 << i)` evaluates to 0; `tmp` is 'a'**.

Explanation: The code assigns the character `'a' + i` to the variable `tmp`. Given that `i` is initially 0, `tmp` is assigned the value `'a'`. The conditions on `i`, `k`, and `cur` remain unchanged.
