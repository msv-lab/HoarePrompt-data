Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^5\), `i` is the total length of the string `s` plus 1, `s` is the updated string input by the user, `cnt` is 0, `cur` is 0, `ans` is an empty string, `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers obtained from the input split, and `cur` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for ss in s:
    cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
    if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
        cur += 1 << cur_ss
    if cur == (1 << k) - 1:
        cnt += 1
        cur = 0
        ans += ss


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `ss` is the first character of `s`, `s` is the updated string input by the user, `cur_ss` is the numerical value of the ASCII of `ss` minus the ASCII of 'a', the current value of `cur` is 0, the current value of `cnt` is increased by 1, and `ans` is now equal to the first character of `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `ss` is the second character of `s`; `s` remains the same; `cur_ss` is the numerical value of the ASCII of the second character of `s` minus the ASCII of 'a'; `cur` is 0; `cnt` is 3; `ans` is the first character of `s` concatenated with `ss`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `ss` is the third character of `s`, `s` remains the same, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is 4, `ans` is the first character of `s` concatenated with the second character of `s` plus the third character of `s`, `cur_ss` is the numerical value of the ASCII of `ss` minus the ASCII of 'a'. This is because if the condition `cur == (1 << k) - 1` is true, then `cur` becomes 0 and other variables are updated accordingly. If the condition is false, the original values of `cur`, `cnt`, `ans`, and `cur_ss` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
