Output State: **`ss` is the first character of the string `s`, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `i` is 1, `s` is the string input by the user, `cnt` is 0, `cur` is `cur_ss` + 1, `ans` is an empty string, and the current value of `cur & 1 << cur_ss` is 1**.

Explanation: The line `cur += 1 << cur_ss` increments the value of `cur` by `1 << cur_ss`. Since `cur` was initially equal to `cur_ss` (as per the initial state), adding `1 << cur_ss` to it results in `cur` becoming `cur_ss + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the condition `cur & 1 << cur_ss` evaluates to 1 because `cur` now includes the bit corresponding to `cur_ss`.
