Output State: **`ss` is the second character of `s`, `s` is the input string, `cur_ss` is the value of `ord(ss) - ord('a')`, `ans` is the second character of `s` concatenated with the previous value of `ans`, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `ans += ss` appends the value of `ss` to the end of `ans`. Given the initial state, `ss` is the second character of `s`, and `ans` is initially the concatenation of the second character of `s` with the previous value of `ans`. After executing the code, `ans` will now be the second character of `s` concatenated with itself (since it was already the second character of `s` before). The other variables remain unchanged. `cnt` is incremented by 1, but since the initial state did not specify the exact value of `cnt`, we only note that it has been incremented.
