Postcondition: `ss` is the third character of `s`, `s` is the input string, `cur_ss` is the value of `ord(ss) - ord('a')`, `ans` is the third character of `s` concatenated with the previous value of `ans`, `cur` is set to `1 << cur_ss`, `cnt` is incremented by 1, and if `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cur` is updated accordingly, otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged.
