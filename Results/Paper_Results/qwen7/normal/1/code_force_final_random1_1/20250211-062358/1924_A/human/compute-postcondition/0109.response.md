Output State: **The final value of `ans` is the concatenation of all characters in the string `s`, `cnt` is the total number of times the inner condition `cur == (1 << k) - 1` was met, `cnt` is less than `n`, `tmp` is an empty string, and all other variables (`cur`, `cur_ss`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `t`) remain as they were in the initial state.**

Explanation: The line `tmp = ''` initializes an empty string to `tmp`. This does not affect the values of `ans`, `cnt`, or any other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the output state retains the values of `ans` and `cnt` as described in the initial state, and `tmp` is now an empty string.
