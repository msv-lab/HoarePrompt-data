Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 0
   - `k` must be greater than 0
   - The current value of `cur` is such that `(cur & 1 << i)` evaluates to 0
     - This means that `cur & 1 << 0` (which is `cur & 1`) evaluates to 0
   - `tmp` is set to 'a'
   - The most internal loop or if statement is exited

2. **Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` in the range from 0 to `k-1`.

3. **Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `k`.
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, the next value of `i` will be 1.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `i` will be incremented to 1.
   - `k` remains unchanged as it is an external condition.
   - The value of `cur` and `tmp` will remain the same unless the loop body changes them, but since the problem states that no changes are made to `cur` and `tmp` if `(cur & 1 << i)` does not evaluate to 0, and the condition is met for the initial iteration, these values will remain the same.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `i` will be 1
- `k` must still be greater than 0
- `cur` and `tmp` will remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `cur` is such that `(cur & 1 << 0)` evaluates to 0, `tmp` is 'a'**
