Output State: **`i` is equal to `k-1`, `cur` is an integer where the bits from 0 to `k-1` are checked and if any of them were not set, `tmp` is the corresponding character ('a' to 'j' if `k` is 10), otherwise `tmp` is 'b', and `ans` is a string containing characters from `s` that caused `cur` to reach \(2^k - 1\) during the loop's execution, and `ans` has been appended with `tmp`.**

Explanation: The line `ans += tmp` appends the value of `tmp` to the end of the string `ans`. The values of `i`, `cur`, and `tmp` remain unchanged from their initial states. The updated `ans` now includes the character `tmp` that was determined based on the conditions specified.
