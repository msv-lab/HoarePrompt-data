Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_14`**: This function correctly generates a sequence `a` of non-negative integers of size at most 25 that meets the problem's requirements. Specifically:
   - If `k == 1`, it generates a sequence that includes all powers of 2 from \(2^2\) to \(2^l\), where \(l\) is the length of the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix. This ensures that all numbers from 2 to \(n\) can be represented as a subsequence sum, but no subsequence sums to 1.
   - If `k > 1`, it generates a sequence that includes all powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{lk-2}\), where `lk` is the length of the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, plus additional values ensuring that all numbers from 1 to \(n\) except `k` can be represented as a subsequence sum, but no subsequence sums to `k`.

2. **Function `func_15`**: This function correctly calls `func_14` for each test case and writes the results to standard output. It reads the number of test cases using `func_10()` and then processes each test case by calling `func_14()` and writing the result.

3. **Overall Structure**: The program structure is consistent with the problem requirements. It reads the number of test cases, processes each test case by generating the required sequence, and outputs the results correctly.

Given the above analysis, the program logic and functions are correctly implemented to meet the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **True**
