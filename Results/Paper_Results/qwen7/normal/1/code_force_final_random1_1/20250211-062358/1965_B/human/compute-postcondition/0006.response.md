Output State: The loop will execute a total number of times equal to the return value of `func_10()`. For each iteration, `func_14()` will return an integer, which will then be written to stdout.

In natural language: After all the executions of the loop have finished, the output will consist of integers printed to the standard output, with the number of integers equal to the return value of `func_10()`. Each integer is the result of calling `func_14()` during each iteration of the loop.
