Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate a sequence `a` that satisfies the given conditions for all test cases. Specifically, the function `func_14()` does not ensure that there is no subsequence of `a` with a sum of `k`, and it also does not guarantee that for all `1 \le v \le n` where `v \ne k`, there is a subsequence of `a` with a sum of `v`.

For example, consider the test case `n = 8` and `k = 8`. The generated sequence is `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 15]`. This sequence does not meet the requirement because:

- It includes the number `8`, which means there is a subsequence with a sum of `8`.
- The sequence does not include all numbers from `1` to `7` in a way that ensures every number can be formed as a subsequence sum except `8`.

To meet the problem's requirements, the sequence needs to avoid having any subsequence sum equal to `k` while ensuring all other sums from `1` to `n` (excluding `k`) are possible. The current implementation does not guarantee this.
