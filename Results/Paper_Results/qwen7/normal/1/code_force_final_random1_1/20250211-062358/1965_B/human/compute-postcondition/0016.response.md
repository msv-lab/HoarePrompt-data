Output State: `i` is equal to `l`; `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix; `ans` is a list containing values from 4 up to \(2^l\).

To explain this in natural language: After all the iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `i` will be equal to `l`, which is the length of the binary representation of `n`. The list `ans` will contain all powers of 2 starting from \(2^2\) (which is 4) up to \(2^l\). This means `ans` will include every power of 2 from \(2^2\) to \(2^l\), inclusive.
