Output State: **`i` is `lk`, `ans` is a list containing the value `[2, 2, 2 ** lk]`**

Explanation: The code appends `2 ** i` to the list `ans`. Given that `i` is `lk`, the new element added to the list `ans` is `2 ** lk`. Therefore, the updated list `ans` contains the values `[2, 2, 2 ** lk]`. The value of `i` remains unchanged as `lk`.
