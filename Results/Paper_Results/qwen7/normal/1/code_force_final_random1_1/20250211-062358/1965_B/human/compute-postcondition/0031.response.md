Output State: **`i` is equal to `lk - 2`, `lk` must be greater than 1, `ans` is a list containing the values `[1, 2, ..., 2^(lk-2), 2 * k + 1]`, and `k + 1` is appended to `ans`.**

Explanation: The code appends `2 * k + 1` to the list `ans`. Given the initial state, `ans` initially contains the values from 1 to \(2^{lk-2}\). After appending `2 * k + 1`, the updated list `ans` will contain these values plus `2 * k + 1`. The variables `i` and `lk` remain unchanged, and `k + 1` is already appended to `ans` in the initial state.
