Output State: **`i` is 1; `lk` must be greater than 2; `ans` contains the value 2**.

Explanation: The line `ans.append(2 ** i)` appends the value of \(2^i\) to the list `ans`. Given that `i` is initially 1, `2 ** i` equals 2. Therefore, `ans` now contains the value 2. The values of `i` and `lk` remain unchanged from their initial states.
