Output State: The loop will execute a total number of times equal to the return value of `func_10()`. For each iteration, `func_14()` will return an integer, which will then be written to stdout.

In Natural Language: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the output will consist of integers printed to the standard output, with the number of integers equal to the return value of `func_10()`. Each integer is the result of calling `func_14()` once per iteration.
