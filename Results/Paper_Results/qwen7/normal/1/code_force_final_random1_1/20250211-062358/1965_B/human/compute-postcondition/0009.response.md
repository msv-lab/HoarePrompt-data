Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. Instead, it executes a loop a number of times determined by the return value of `func_10()`. During each iteration of the loop, it calls `func_14()` to generate an integer, which is then printed to the standard output. After completing all iterations, the function concludes, leaving the standard output containing a sequence of integers.**
