Output State: **`a` is a list of integers where the first three elements are equal and odd, and the first element of `a` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\); `cnt` is 1; `_` is 3.**

Explanation: The code `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. Initially, `cnt` was 0, so after executing this line, `cnt` becomes 1. The values of `a` and `_` remain unchanged from their initial states.
