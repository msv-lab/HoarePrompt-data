Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Analysis
1. **Game Rules**: 
   - Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero.
   - Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is zero.
2. **Sequence Composition**:
   - The sequence starts with `p_i` ones, twos, threes, and fours.
   - The goal is to maximize the number of times Bob wins as Eve removes numbers optimally.

### Program Analysis
The provided program is:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))
        print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)
```

#### Step-by-Step Breakdown
1. **Reading Input**:
   - `int(input())` reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a line of input and splits it into a list of integers.

2. **Processing Input**:
   - `map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split())` processes each integer in the input list.
     - `int(x) - int(x) % 2` effectively converts each integer to either 0 or 1 based on whether it is even or odd.
     - This means:
       - Ones and threes become 1 (since they are odd).
       - Twos and fours become 0 (since they are even).

3. **Calculating Result**:
   - `p[:3]` takes the first three elements of the processed list.
   - `sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3])))` counts how many of these first three elements are 1 (i.e., how many odd numbers there are among the first three).
   - `(sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3)` checks if all three of the first elements are odd.
   - `+ sum(p) // 2` adds half the total count of all processed numbers (since each even number contributes 0 and each odd number contributes 1).

### Correctness Check
- **Odd Numbers Handling**: The logic correctly identifies if the first three numbers are all odd, which would imply a potential initial win for Alice.
- **Even Numbers Contribution**: The sum of the processed list divided by 2 gives the total count of odd numbers, which is used to determine the number of wins for Bob.

However, the logic does not fully account for the optimal removal strategy by Eve. Specifically, the program does not consider the dynamic nature of the sequence and how removing specific numbers can change the XOR result.

### Conclusion
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win. It incorrectly simplifies the problem without considering the optimal removal strategy by Eve.

**Correctness: False**
