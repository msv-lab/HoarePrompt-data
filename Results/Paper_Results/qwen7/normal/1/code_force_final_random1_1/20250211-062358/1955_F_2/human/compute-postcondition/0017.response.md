Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `a` is a list of integers where the first three elements are equal and odd, and the first element of `a` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
   - `cnt` is 15.

2. **Loop Head**: 
   - The loop iterates for a number of times specified by user input (`int(input())`).

3. **Loop Body**: 
   - For each iteration, `cnt` is incremented by `math.floor(x / 2)` for each element `x` in the list `a`.

4. **Key Points**:
   - The first three elements of `a` are equal and odd.
   - Each of these three elements contributes either 0 or 1 to `cnt` depending on whether they are 1 or greater than 1.
   - The total increment to `cnt` from the first three elements is 15, meaning each of the first three elements must contribute exactly 5 times (since 3 * 5 = 15).

5. **Deduction**:
   - Since each of the first three elements contributes 5 times to `cnt`, each of these elements must be 1 (because \(\math.floor(1 / 2) = 0\) and \(\math.floor(x / 2) = 1\) for \(x > 1\)).
   - Therefore, the first three elements of `a` are all 1s.
   - The value of `cnt` remains 15 because no further increments are made to `cnt` in the loop body.

6. **Next Iteration**:
   - The loop will continue as long as there are more elements in the list `a`.
   - After the first three elements, the remaining elements in `a` do not affect `cnt` based on the given information.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop will be:

- `a` is a list of integers where the first three elements are 1s, and the rest of the elements are unknown but do not affect `cnt`.
- `cnt` remains 15.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `a` is a list of integers where the first three elements are 1s, and the rest of the elements are unknown, `cnt` is 15.**
