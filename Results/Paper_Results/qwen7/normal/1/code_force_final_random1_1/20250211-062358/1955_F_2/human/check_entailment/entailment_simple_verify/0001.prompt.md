You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))
        print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of four non-negative integers p_i (0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200), representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the initial sequence, respectively.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))
        
        print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)
        
    #State: Output State: The final state of `p` is a list of integers where each element is the largest even number less than or equal to the corresponding input integer, and the input integer has been reduced to 0 after all iterations of the loop.
    #
    #In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `p` will contain the largest even numbers possible for each of the initial counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s, with the input integer being decremented until it reaches 0. This means that each count in `p` will be the highest even number that was ever present in the sequence during any iteration of the loop, and the input integer will be 0 since it keeps decrementing by 1 in each iteration until it can no longer decrease.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Analysis
1. **Game Rules**: 
   - Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero.
   - Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is zero.
2. **Sequence Composition**:
   - The sequence starts with `p_i` ones, twos, threes, and fours.
   - The goal is to maximize the number of times Bob wins as Eve removes numbers optimally.

### Program Analysis
The provided program is:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))
        print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)
```

#### Step-by-Step Breakdown
1. **Reading Input**:
   - `int(input())` reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a line of input and splits it into a list of integers.

2. **Processing Input**:
   - `map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split())` processes each integer in the input list.
     - `int(x) - int(x) % 2` effectively converts each integer to either 0 or 1 based on whether it is even or odd.
     - This means:
       - Ones and threes become 1 (since they are odd).
       - Twos and fours become 0 (since they are even).

3. **Calculating Result**:
   - `p[:3]` takes the first three elements of the processed list.
   - `sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3])))` counts how many of these first three elements are 1 (i.e., how many odd numbers there are among the first three).
   - `(sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3)` checks if all three of the first elements are odd.
   - `+ sum(p) // 2` adds half the total count of all processed numbers (since each even number contributes 0 and each odd number contributes 1).

### Correctness Check
- **Odd Numbers Handling**: The logic correctly identifies if the first three numbers are all odd, which would imply a potential initial win for Alice.
- **Even Numbers Contribution**: The sum of the processed list divided by 2 gives the total count of odd numbers, which is used to determine the number of wins for Bob.

However, the logic does not fully account for the optimal removal strategy by Eve. Specifically, the program does not consider the dynamic nature of the sequence and how removing specific numbers can change the XOR result.

### Conclusion
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win. It incorrectly simplifies the problem without considering the optimal removal strategy by Eve.
