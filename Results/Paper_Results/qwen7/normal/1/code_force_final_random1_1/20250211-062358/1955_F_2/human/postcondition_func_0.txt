The function processes four non-negative integers representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in an initial sequence. For each input, it calculates the largest even number less than or equal to each of the counts and prints whether the sum of the counts of odd numbers (excluding the count of 4s) is 3, followed by the total sum of the processed counts divided by 2. After processing all inputs, the function outputs a series of results based on the given conditions.
