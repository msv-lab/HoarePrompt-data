Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Description:**
   - `a` is a list where all elements are equal and odd.
   - The first element of `a` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
   - `cnt` is the sum of the floor divisions of each element in `a` by 2.

2. **Understanding the Elements of List `a`:**
   - Since all elements in `a` are equal and odd, if the first element is `x`, then every element in `a` is `x`.
   - Let's denote the number of elements in `a` as `n`.

3. **Calculating `cnt`:**
   - Each element in `a` is `x`, so the floor division of each element by 2 is \(\left\lfloor \frac{x}{2} \right\rfloor\).
   - Therefore, `cnt` is the sum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{x}{2} \right\rfloor\) for each element in `a`.
   - Mathematically, \( cnt = n \times \left\lfloor \frac{x}{2} \right\rfloor \).

4. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(cnt)`, which will print the value of `cnt`.

Given the above, the output will be the sum of the floor divisions of each element in `a` by 2. Since `a` contains `n` elements, each being `x`, the output is \( n \times \left\lfloor \frac{x}{2} \right\rfloor \).

Output: **n * floor(x / 2) (where n is the number of elements in list `a` and x is the first element of the list `a`)**
