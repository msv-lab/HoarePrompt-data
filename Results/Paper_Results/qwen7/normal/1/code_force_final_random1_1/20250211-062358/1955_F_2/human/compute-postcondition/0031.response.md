Based on the initial state described:

- The list `a` contains integers where the first three elements are equal and odd, and the first element of `a` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
- The variable `x` takes on each value from the list `a` in sequence, starting with the first element.
- The variable `cnt` is incremented by the floor division of `x` by 2 for each iteration of the loop.
- After all iterations, `cnt` will be the sum of the floor divisions of each element in `a` by 2, starting from the first element.

Let's break it down:

1. Let the first three elements of `a` be `a[0] = a[1] = a[2] = k`, where `k` is an odd integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
2. For the rest of the elements in `a`, since no specific values are mentioned, we assume they are also integers but their exact values are not specified.
3. The loop iterates over each element in `a`, and for each element `x`, `cnt` is incremented by `x // 2`.

Given that the first three elements are equal and odd, let's denote them as `k`. Therefore, the initial contribution to `cnt` from these three elements is:

\[ \text{cnt} += k // 2 \]
\[ \text{cnt} += k // 2 \]
\[ \text{cnt} += k // 2 \]

Since `k` is odd, `k // 2` is the integer part of `k / 2`, which is \(\frac{k - 1}{2}\).

So, the contribution from the first three elements is:

\[ 3 \times \left(\frac{k - 1}{2}\right) = \frac{3(k - 1)}{2} \]

For the remaining elements in `a`, since their exact values are not specified, we cannot determine their individual contributions to `cnt`. However, the problem only asks us to describe the value of `cnt` based on the given information.

Thus, the output will be the sum of the floor divisions of the first three elements by 2, plus the contributions from any other elements in the list `a`.

Output: **\(\frac{3(k - 1)}{2} + \sum_{i=3}^{n-1} (a[i] // 2)\) (where \(k\) is the first element of the list `a` and \(n\) is the length of the list `a`)**
