Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `word` is 'zz'**.

Explanation: The code `word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'` appends `alphabet[n - 53]` followed by `'zz'` to the string `word`. However, the value of `alphabet[n - 53]` is not specified, so we only know that `word` now contains `'zz'` appended to whatever was previously in `word`. Since `word` was initially an empty string, the new value of `word` is simply `'zz'`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
