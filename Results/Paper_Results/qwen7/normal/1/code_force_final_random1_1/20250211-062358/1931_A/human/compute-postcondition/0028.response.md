Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `word` is determined based on the current value of `n`**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value entered by the user (which must be an integer greater than 2) to the variable `n`. The initial value of `i` remains unchanged at 2, and the determination of `word` based on the current value of `n` remains as it was before the code execution.
