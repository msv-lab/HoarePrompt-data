Output State: **`i` is 0; `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive)**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user, converts it to an integer using `int()`, and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state of `i` remains unchanged, and the value of `n` is constrained to be an integer between 1 and 100 as per the precondition.
