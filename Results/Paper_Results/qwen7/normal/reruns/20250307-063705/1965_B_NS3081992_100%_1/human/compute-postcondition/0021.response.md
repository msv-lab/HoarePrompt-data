Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `lk`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `i` is the loop counter, and it starts from 0 in a typical `range` function.
   - `lk` is the length of the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `lk - 1`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0, it will be 0 at the beginning of the loop.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `lk` must be greater than 1 (because `i` should be less than `lk - 1`).

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` (which should be 0) and `lk` (which must be greater than 1).

**State:**
- `i` is 0
- `lk` must be greater than 1

So, the final answer is:
State: **`i` is 0, `lk` must be greater than 1**
