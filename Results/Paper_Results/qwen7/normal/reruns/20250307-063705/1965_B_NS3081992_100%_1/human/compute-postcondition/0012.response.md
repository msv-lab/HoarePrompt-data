Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and `l`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 2 to `l` (exclusive). This means `i` starts from 2 and increments by 1 until it reaches `l`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ans` is `[2, 3, 2]`
   - `i` is the variable that changes in each iteration of the loop.

4. **Determine the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - Since the loop is about to start its next iteration, `i` must have been the highest value it reached in the previous iteration plus 1.
   - From the given `ans` list, the last value added was 2, which suggests that `i` was likely 3 in the previous iteration (since the loop would add the next number, which is 2).

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will now be incremented by 1 from the previous value (which was 3), so `i` will be 4.
   - The value of `l` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop body.

6. **Final state for the next iteration**:
   - `ans` remains `[2, 3, 2]` because the loop body is omitted and no modifications are made to `ans`.
   - `i` is now 4.
   - `l` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`ans` is [2, 3, 2], `i` is 4, `l` must be the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration**
