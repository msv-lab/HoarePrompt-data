Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables and conditions:**
   - The loop is defined as `for i in range(lk, l):`.
   - This means the loop will iterate over values of `i` starting from `lk` up to but not including `l`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration:**
   - `i` is `lk + 1`.
   - `ans` is a list containing the value 4.

3. **Determine the next value of `i`:**
   - Since the loop starts from `lk` and increments `i` by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` will be `lk + 2`.

4. **Check the condition for the next iteration:**
   - The loop will continue if `i < l`.
   - Given that `i` is currently `lk + 1`, the next value `lk + 2` must still be less than `l` for the loop to continue.

5. **Adjust the state:**
   - The variable `i` will be updated to `lk + 2`.
   - The variable `ans` remains unchanged since it is not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is `lk + 2`, `ans` is a list containing the value 4**
