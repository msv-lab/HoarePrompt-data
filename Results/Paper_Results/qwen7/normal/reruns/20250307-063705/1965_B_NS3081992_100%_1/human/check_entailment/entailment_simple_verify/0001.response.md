### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to construct a sequence \( a \) of non-negative integers of size at most 25 such that:
     - No subsequence of \( a \) sums to \( k \).
     - For all \( 1 \leq v \leq n \) where \( v \neq k \), there is a subsequence of \( a \) that sums to \( v \).

2. **Analyzing the Provided Solution**:
   - The function `func_14()` constructs the required sequence.
   - It reads \( n \) and \( k \) using `func_7()`, which reads space-separated integers from standard input.
   - It then converts \( n \) and \( k \) to binary representation and calculates their lengths (`l` and `lk` respectively).
   - If \( k == 1 \), it handles a special case where \( n == 2 \).
   - Otherwise, it constructs the sequence `ans` based on the binary representation of \( n \) and \( k \):
     - For \( k == 1 \), it uses powers of 2.
     - For other values of \( k \), it constructs the sequence by including specific powers of 2 and ensuring no subsequence sums to \( k \).

3. **Verification**:
   - The constructed sequence `ans` ensures that no subsequence sums to \( k \) because the elements are carefully chosen to avoid any combination that could sum to \( k \).
   - The sequence also includes all numbers from 1 to \( n \) except \( k \) as subsequences, ensuring that every number from 1 to \( n \) (except \( k \)) can be formed by some subsequence.

4. **Output**:
   - The length of the sequence `ans` is correctly printed first.
   - The elements of `ans` are then printed as space-separated integers.

5. **Detailed Analysis of `func_14()`**:
   - For \( k == 1 \):
     - If \( n == 2 \), the sequence is `[1, 2]`. This works because no subsequence sums to 1, and the subsequences are 1 and 2.
     - Otherwise, the sequence is `[2, 3, 2^2, 2^3, ..., 2^{l-1}]`. This works because no subsequence sums to 1, and the subsequences cover all numbers from 1 to \( n \) except 1.
   - For \( k > 1 \):
     - The sequence includes specific powers of 2 and ensures no subsequence sums to \( k \). For example, if \( k = 3 \) and \( n = 8 \), the sequence might be `[1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 15]`. Here, no subsequence sums to 3, and all numbers from 1 to 8 (except 3) can be formed.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution correctly constructs the required sequence according to the problem statement. The sequence ensures that no subsequence sums to \( k \) and includes all numbers from 1 to \( n \) (except \( k \)) as subsequences.
