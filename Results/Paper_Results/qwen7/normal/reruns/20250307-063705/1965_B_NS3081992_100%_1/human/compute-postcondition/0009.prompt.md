You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: There is no integer in the output that sums to k, but every integer from 1 to n (excluding k) can be represented as a subsequence sum. The output sequence has a length m such that 1 <= m <= 25.
def func_15():
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        sys.stdout.write(str(func_14()) + '\n')
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will execute `func_10()` times, and each iteration will write a positive integer returned by `func_14()` to the standard output. Since `func_10()` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact number of iterations. However, given that the loop executes 3 times and continues to execute based on `func_10()`, it will continue to write positive integers until `func_10()` iterations are completed.
    #
    #Each written integer is a positive integer, and the loop does not modify any state other than appending these integers to the output. Therefore, the final output state will be a sequence of positive integers, with the total number of integers being equal to the value returned by `func_10()`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and returns a sequence of integers whose length is between 1 and 25, where each integer from 1 to n (excluding k) can be represented as a subsequence sum, but there is no integer in the output that sums to k.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
