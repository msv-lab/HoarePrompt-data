Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the `for i in range(lk, l):` statement. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `lk`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `lk <= i < l` must hold true. Given that `i` is currently `lk` at the end of the previous iteration, the loop will execute again if `i` is incremented by 1 (i.e., `i` becomes `lk + 1`).

3. **Adjust the state**: Since `i` is `lk` at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` will be `lk + 1`. The variable `lk` remains unchanged as it is the starting point of the range.

4. **State at the start of the next iteration**: The state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated value of `i` and the unchanged value of `lk`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is `lk + 1`, `ans` contains the value `2`**
