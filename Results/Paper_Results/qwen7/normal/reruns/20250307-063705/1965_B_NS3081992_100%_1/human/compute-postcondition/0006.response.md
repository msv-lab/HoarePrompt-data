Output State: The loop will continue to execute until `func_10()` returns a value. Since `func_14()` returns a positive integer each time the loop runs, the loop will keep running as long as `func_10()` does not return a value that stops the iteration. After all iterations are completed, the output state will be a sequence of positive integers, with each integer written on a new line, where the total number of integers written is equal to the number of times `func_10()` returned a value that allowed the loop to continue.

In natural language: The output will consist of a series of positive integers, each printed on a new line, with the total number of integers being equal to the number of times the function `func_10()` returns a value that allows the loop to iterate.
