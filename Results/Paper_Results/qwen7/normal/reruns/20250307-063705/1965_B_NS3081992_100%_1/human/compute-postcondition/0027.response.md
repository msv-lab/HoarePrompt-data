Output State: `i` is equal to `lk - 2`; `ans` contains the list `[1, 2, 4, ..., 2^(lk-2)]`; `lk` is greater than or equal to the length of the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix.

To explain this in simpler terms: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be one less than the length of the binary representation of `k` (since the loop runs from `0` to `lk - 2`). The list `ans` will contain all powers of 2 from `2^0` up to `2^(lk-2)`. Additionally, `lk` will be at least as large as the length of the binary representation of `k`.
