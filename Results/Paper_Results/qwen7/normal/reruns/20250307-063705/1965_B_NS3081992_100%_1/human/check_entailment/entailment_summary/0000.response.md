Reasoning:
1. The problem requires generating a sequence of non-negative integers of size at most 25 such that no subsequence sums to \( k \), but every integer from 1 to \( n \) (excluding \( k \)) can be represented as a subsequence sum.
2. The provided function `func_14()` appears to solve this problem correctly. Here's how it works:
   - If \( k = 1 \) and \( n = 2 \), it directly returns "1\n2", which is a valid sequence.
   - For other cases, it constructs a sequence based on the binary representation of \( n \) and \( k \):
     - It includes powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of \( n \).
     - It calculates additional values to ensure that all integers from 1 to \( n \) (excluding \( k \)) can be formed as subsequence sums.
     - It ensures that no subsequence sums to \( k \).

Given the execution summary and the logic of `func_14()`, it seems to meet the requirements of the problem. The function generates a sequence that satisfies the conditions stated in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
