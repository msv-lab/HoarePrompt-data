Output State: **`i` is 2; `ans` contains the value [1, 4]; `lk` must be greater than 3**

Explanation: The code appends `2 ** i` to the list `ans`. Given that `i` is 2, `2 ** i` equals 4. So, `ans` changes from containing the value `[1, 2]` to `[1, 4]`. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and the condition for `lk` (it must be greater than 3) is still valid.
