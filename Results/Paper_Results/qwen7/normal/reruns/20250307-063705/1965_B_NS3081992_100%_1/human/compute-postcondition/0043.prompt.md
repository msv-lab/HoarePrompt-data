You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: (n, k) are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n.
def func_14():
    n, k = func_7()
    b = bin(n)[2:]
    l = len(b)
    if (k == 1) :
        if (n == 2) :
            return '1\n2'
            #The program returns the string '1\n2'
        #State: Postcondition: `b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `k` is 1, `l` is the length of `b`, and `n` is not equal to 2
        ans = [2, 3]
        for i in range(2, l):
            ans.append(2 ** i)
            
        #State: The list `ans` will contain the elements [2, 3, 2, 16, 32, 128]. The variable `i` will be 6, and `l` will be the length of the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix.
    else :
        bk = bin(k)[2:]
        ans = []
        lk = len(bk)
        for i in range(lk - 1):
            ans.append(2 ** i)
            
        #State: Output State: `i` is equal to `lk - 2`; `ans` contains the list `[1, 2, 4, ..., 2^(lk-2)]`; `lk` is greater than or equal to `lk`.
        #
        #Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = lk - 2`. This means that if `lk` is the length of the binary representation of `k`, then `i` will take on all integer values from `0` to `lk - 2`. Therefore, `i` will be equal to `lk - 2` after the last iteration. Each iteration appends `2^i` to the list `ans`, so `ans` will contain the list `[1, 2, 4, ..., 2^(lk-2)]`. The condition `lk` must be greater than or equal to `lk` is redundant since `lk` cannot be less than itself.
        ans.append(k - 1 - sum(ans))
        ans.append(k + 1)
        ans.append(2 * k + 1)
        for i in range(lk, l):
            ans.append(2 ** i)
            
        #State: Output State: `i` is `lk + (lk - 2)`, `ans` contains the list `[1, 2, 4, ..., 2^(lk-2), k + 1, 2 * k + 1, 2^lk, 2^(lk+1), ..., 2^(2*(lk-2)+lk)]`.
        #
        #In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `lk + (lk - 2)`. The list `ans` will contain the initial elements `[1, 2, 4, ..., 2^(lk-2), k + 1, 2 * k + 1]` followed by additional elements generated by the loop, specifically `2^lk, 2^(lk+1), ..., 2^(2*(lk-2)+lk)`.
    #State: `b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `k` is the return value of `func_7()`, `l` is the length of `b`, `i` is `lk + (lk - 2)`, and `ans` contains the list `[1, 2, 4, ..., 2^(lk-2), k + 1, 2 * k + 1]` followed by additional elements generated by the loop, specifically `2^lk, 2^(lk+1), ..., 2^(2*(lk-2)+lk)` if `k == 1`. If `k != 1`, `i` remains 6 and `l` remains the length of the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix.
    return str(len(ans)) + '\n' + ' '.join(map(str, ans))
    #The program returns the length of the list `ans` as a string, followed by the elements of `ans` joined by spaces.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function does not accept any parameters and returns either the string '1\n2' or the length of the list `ans` as a string followed by the elements of `ans` joined by spaces.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the string '1\n2'

Case_2: The program returns the length of the list `ans` as a string, followed by the elements of `ans` joined by spaces.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
