Output State: **`i` is equal to `lk - 2`; `ans` contains the list `[1, 2, 4, ..., 2^(lk-2), k + 1]`.**

Explanation: Initially, `i` is equal to `lk - 2`, and `ans` contains the list `[1, 2, 4, ..., 2^(lk-2)]`. After executing `ans.append(k + 1)`, the list `ans` is updated to include the new element `k + 1`. Therefore, the updated list is `[1, 2, 4, ..., 2^(lk-2), k + 1]`. The value of `i` remains unchanged.
