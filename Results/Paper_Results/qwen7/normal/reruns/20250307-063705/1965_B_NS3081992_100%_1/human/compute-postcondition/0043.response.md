Functionality: **The function takes no explicit parameters and returns either the string '1\n2' or a sequence of numbers formatted as a space-separated string. If \( k = 1 \) and \( n = 2 \), it returns '1\n2'. Otherwise, it constructs a list `ans` based on the binary representations of \( n \) and \( k \), and returns the length of this list followed by its elements.**
