Output State: The loop will execute `func_10()` times, and each iteration will write a positive integer returned by `func_14()` to the standard output. Since `func_10()` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact number of iterations. However, given that the loop executes 3 times and continues to execute based on `func_10()`, it will continue to write positive integers until `func_10()` iterations are completed.

Each written integer is a positive integer, and the loop does not modify any state other than appending these integers to the output. Therefore, the final output state will be a sequence of positive integers, with the total number of integers being equal to the value returned by `func_10()`.
