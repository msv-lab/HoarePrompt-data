Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program seems to correctly solve the given problem. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Function Definitions**: The program defines various utility functions, but only `func_14` is relevant to solving the problem. The rest of the functions are either redundant or not used in the solution.

2. **Relevant Function (`func_14`)**:
   - This function takes the inputs `n` and `k`.
   - It converts `n` and `k` to their binary representations.
   - If `k` is 1, it handles a special case where `n` is 2.
   - Otherwise, it constructs a sequence `ans` that meets the required conditions:
     - It includes powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `n`.
     - It ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` while including subsequences that sum to all values from 1 to `n` except `k`.

3. **Binary Representation Handling**:
   - The binary representation helps in constructing the sequence in a way that avoids the sum `k` while ensuring all other sums are possible.
   - The construction logic is sound and adheres to the problem constraints.

4. **Output Formatting**:
   - The function outputs the length of the sequence followed by the sequence itself in the required format.

Given these points, the program appears to be correct and meets the requirements of the problem.
