Output State: **`bk` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `k` is the return value of `func_7()`, `l` is the length of `bk`, `ans` is an empty list, `lk` is the length of `bk`.**

Explanation: The code `lk = len(bk)` calculates the length of the binary representation of `k` (stored in `bk`) and assigns it to `lk`. The other variables remain unchanged.
