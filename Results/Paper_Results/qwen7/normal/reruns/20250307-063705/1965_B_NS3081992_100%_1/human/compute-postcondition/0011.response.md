Output State: **`ans` is [2, 3, 2 ** i], `b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `k` is 1, `l` is at least 3, and `n` is not equal to 2.**

Explanation: The code appends `2 ** i` to the list `ans`. Since `i` is not specified, it remains as `2 ** i`. All other variables (`b`, `k`, `l`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
