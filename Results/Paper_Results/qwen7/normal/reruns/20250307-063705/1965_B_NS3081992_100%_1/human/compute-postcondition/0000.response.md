Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` and the function call `func_10()`. However, since `_` is typically used as a throwaway variable in Python, it doesn't affect the loop condition directly. The key variable here is the return value of `func_10()`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `func_10()` returns a non-zero value. Therefore, we need to ensure that `func_10()` returns a positive integer.

3. **Initial State**: The initial state given is that there is no integer in the output that sums to `k`, but every integer from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) can be represented as a subsequence sum. The output sequence has a length `m` such that `1 <= m <= 25`.

4. **Adjusting the State**: Since the loop depends on the return value of `func_10()`, we need to ensure that `func_10()` returns a positive integer. Given the context, we don't have specific information about the exact return value of `func_10()`, but we know it must be a positive integer for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the return value of `func_10()`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`func_10()` must return a positive integer**
