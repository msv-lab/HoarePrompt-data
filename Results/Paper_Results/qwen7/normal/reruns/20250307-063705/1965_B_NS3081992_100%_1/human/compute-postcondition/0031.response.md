Output State: **`i` is equal to `lk - 2`; `ans` contains the list `[1, 2, 4, ..., 2^(lk-2), k + 1, 2 * k + 1]`**

Explanation: The code appends the value `2 * k + 1` to the list `ans`. Initially, `ans` contains the list `[1, 2, 4, ..., 2^(lk-2), k + 1]`. After appending `2 * k + 1`, the updated list is `[1, 2, 4, ..., 2^(lk-2), k + 1, 2 * k + 1]`. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
