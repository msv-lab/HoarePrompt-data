Output State: **`i` is 0; `ans` contains the value 1**

Explanation: The line `ans.append(2 ** i)` appends \(2^i\) to the list `ans`. Given that `i` is initially 0, \(2^0 = 1\). Since `lk` being greater than 1 is a precondition and does not affect the value of `i`, it remains unchanged. Therefore, `i` is 0 and `ans` now contains the value 1.
