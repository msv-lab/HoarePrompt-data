Output State: **The program returns the length of the list `ans` as a string, followed by the elements of `ans` joined by spaces.**

To break it down:

1. The initial state includes `b`, which is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix.
2. `k` is the return value of `func_7()`.
3. `l` is the length of `b`.
4. `i` is calculated as `lk + (lk - 2)`.
5. `ans` is a list that starts with `[1, 2, 4, ..., 2^(lk-2), k + 1, 2 * k + 1]` followed by additional elements generated by the loop, specifically `2^lk, 2^(lk+1), ..., 2^(2*(lk-2)+lk)` if `k == 1`. If `k != 1`, `i` remains 6 and `l` remains the length of the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix.

The code then returns a string that concatenates the length of `ans` as a string and the elements of `ans` joined by spaces.
