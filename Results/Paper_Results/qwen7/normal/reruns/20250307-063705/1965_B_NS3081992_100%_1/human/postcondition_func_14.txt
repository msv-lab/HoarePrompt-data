The function accepts no parameters and returns a sequence of positive integers. The length of the sequence is determined by the value returned by `func_10()`, which is between 1 and 25. Each integer in the sequence is a positive integer, and the sequence contains no integer that sums to `k`. The function writes each integer in the sequence to the standard output.
