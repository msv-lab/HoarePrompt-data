Output State: **`i` is equal to `lk - 2`; `ans` contains the list `[1, 2, 4, ..., 2^(lk-2)]`; `ans.append(k - 1 - sum(ans))` has been executed.**

Explanation: After the loop completes, `i` is equal to `lk - 2`. The list `ans` contains the elements `[1, 2, 4, ..., 2^(lk-2)]`, which are the powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{(lk-2)}\). The code then appends the value of `k - 1 - sum(ans)` to the list `ans`. Since `sum(ans)` is the sum of the elements in the list `[1, 2, 4, ..., 2^(lk-2)]`, which is \(2^{lk-1} - 1\), the value appended to `ans` is `k - 1 - (2^{lk-1} - 1) = k - 2^{lk-1}`. However, without knowing the exact value of `k`, we can only express the final state of `ans` as it was before the last append operation.
