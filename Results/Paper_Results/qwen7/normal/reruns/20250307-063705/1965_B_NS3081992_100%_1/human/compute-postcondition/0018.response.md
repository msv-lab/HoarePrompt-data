Output State: **`bk` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `k` is the return value of `func_7()`, and `l` is the length of `b`.**

Explanation: The code `bk = bin(k)[2:]` converts the integer `k` to its binary representation using `bin(k)`, which includes the '0b' prefix. By slicing `[2:]`, we remove the '0b' prefix, resulting in `bk` being the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix. The value of `k` remains unchanged, and `l` (which is the length of `b`) also remains unchanged.
