Output State: **`i` is 1, `ans` contains the value [1, 2], `lk` must be greater than 1**

Explanation: The code `ans.append(2 ** i)` appends the value of \(2^i\) to the list `ans`. Given that `i` is initially 1, `2 ** i` equals 2. Therefore, `ans` changes from containing just the value 1 to containing `[1, 2]`. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and the condition that `lk` must be greater than 1 is still valid.
