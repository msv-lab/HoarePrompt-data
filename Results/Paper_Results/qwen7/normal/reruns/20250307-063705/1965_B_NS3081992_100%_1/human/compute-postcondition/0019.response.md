Output State: **`bk` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `k` is the return value of `func_7()`, and `l` is the length of `b`, `ans` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The line `ans = []` initializes an empty list named `ans`. This operation does not affect the values of `bk`, `k`, or `l`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states, and a new empty list `ans` is created.
