Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the range parameters `lk` and `l`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: According to the given state, `i` is equal to `lk - 2`.

3. **Understand the range condition**: The loop runs from `lk` to `l` (exclusive). This means the loop will start when `i` equals `lk` and continue until `i` is less than `l`.

4. **Adjust the state of `i`**: For the loop to start executing, `i` must be equal to `lk`. Since `i` is initially `lk - 2`, we need to adjust `i` to be `lk`.

5. **Determine the relationship between `lk` and `l`**: For the loop to execute, `lk` must be less than `l`.

6. **Consider other variables**: The variables `ans` and its contents are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Based on the above steps, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

- `i` should be set to `lk`.
- `lk` must be less than `l`.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is `lk`, `lk` must be less than `l`**.
