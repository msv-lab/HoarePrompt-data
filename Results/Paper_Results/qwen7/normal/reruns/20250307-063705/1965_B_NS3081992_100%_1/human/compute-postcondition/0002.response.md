Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the expression `range(func_10())`. This means the loop will iterate based on the value returned by the function `func_10()`. The loop variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable when the loop variable is not needed) and the function call `func_10()` are the key elements here.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as the value returned by `func_10()` is greater than 0. Since `func_10()` returns a positive integer at the end of the previous iteration, let's denote this positive integer as `k`.

3. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `func_10()` must still return a positive integer. After the first iteration, `func_10()` has already returned a positive integer `k`. For the loop to continue, `func_10()` must return a positive integer again.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is the value returned by `func_10()`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`func_10()` returns a positive integer**
