Postcondition: **`b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `k` is the return value of `func_7()`, `l` is the length of `b`, `i` is `lk + (lk - 2)`, and `ans` contains the list `[1, 2, 4, ..., 2^(lk-2), k + 1, 2 * k + 1]` followed by additional elements generated by the loop, specifically `2^lk, 2^(lk+1), ..., 2^(2*(lk-2)+lk)` if `k == 1`. If `k != 1`, `i` remains 6 and `l` remains the length of the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix.**
