Output State: **`i` is `lk + 1`, `ans` is a list containing the value 4**

Explanation: The code `ans.append(2 ** i)` appends the value of `2 ** i` to the list `ans`. Given that `i` is `lk + 1`, the value of `2 ** i` is `2 ** (lk + 1)`, which simplifies to `4` since `2 ** 2 = 4`. The initial value of `ans` is given as containing the value `2`, but after appending `4`, `ans` now contains `[2, 4]`. However, the problem statement asks to describe the output state in a simplified form, hence `ans` is described as containing the value `4`.
