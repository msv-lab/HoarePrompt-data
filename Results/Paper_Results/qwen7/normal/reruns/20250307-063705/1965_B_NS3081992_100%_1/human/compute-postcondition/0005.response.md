Output State: **`func_14()` returns a positive integer**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.write(str(func_14()) + '\n')` writes the return value of `func_14()` (which is a positive integer) to the standard output. The function `func_14()` is called and its return value is converted to a string and printed. The initial state that `func_10()` must return a positive integer is not directly affected by this code snippet, so it remains unchanged. The only new information is that `func_14()` returns a positive integer.
