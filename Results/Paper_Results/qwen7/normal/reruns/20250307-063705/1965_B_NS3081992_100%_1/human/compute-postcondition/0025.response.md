Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and `lk`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < lk - 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `ans` contains the value [1, 2]
   - `lk` must be greater than 1

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2.
   - The condition `i < lk - 1` must still hold true. Since `i` is now 2, `lk - 1` must be greater than 2, meaning `lk` must be greater than 3.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be updated to 2.
   - `lk` must be greater than 3.

6. **Final state**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `ans` contains the value [1, 2] (unchanged)
   - `lk` must be greater than 3

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`i` is 2, `ans` contains the value [1, 2], `lk` must be greater than 3**
