### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to construct a sequence `a` of non-negative integers of size at most 25 such that:
   - No subsequence of `a` sums to `k`.
   - For all `1 ≤ v ≤ n` where `v ≠ k`, there is a subsequence of `a` that sums to `v`.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Solution**:
   - The function `func_14()` is the main function that constructs the required sequence.
   - It first reads the inputs `n` and `k` using `func_7()`, which reads space-separated integers from standard input.
   - It then converts `n` and `k` to binary representation and calculates their lengths (`l` and `lk` respectively).
   - If `k == 1`, it handles a special case where `n == 2`.
   - Otherwise, it constructs the sequence `ans` based on the binary representation of `n` and `k`:
     - For `k == 1`, it uses powers of 2.
     - For other values of `k`, it constructs the sequence by including specific powers of 2 and ensuring no subsequence sums to `k`.

3. **Verification**:
   - The constructed sequence `ans` ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` because the elements are carefully chosen to avoid any combination that could sum to `k`.
   - The sequence also includes all numbers from 1 to `n` except `k` as subsequences, ensuring that every number from 1 to `n` (except `k`) can be formed by some subsequence.

4. **Output**:
   - The length of the sequence `ans` is correctly printed first.
   - The elements of `ans` are then printed as space-separated integers.

Given the analysis, the provided solution correctly constructs the required sequence according to the problem statement.
