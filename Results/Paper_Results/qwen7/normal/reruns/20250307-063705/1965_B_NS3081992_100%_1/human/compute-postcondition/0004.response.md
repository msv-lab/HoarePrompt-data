Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is defined by `for _ in range(func_10()):`. This means the loop will iterate based on the return value of `func_10()`. The variables involved here are the result of `func_10()` and the loop counter (which is `_` but doesn't affect the state directly).

2. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `func_10()` returns a positive integer. Since the loop has just started or continued from the previous iteration, `func_10()` must still return a positive integer for the loop to execute again.

3. **Determine the state adjustments**: 
   - The function `func_10()` must still return a positive integer for the loop to execute again.
   - The loop counter `_` is incremented each time the loop body runs, but it does not affect the state directly since it is an internal variable.

Given that the loop has just started or continued, the state at the end of the previous iteration is that `func_10()` returned a positive integer. For the loop to execute one more time, `func_10()` must still return a positive integer.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`func_10()` must return a positive integer**
