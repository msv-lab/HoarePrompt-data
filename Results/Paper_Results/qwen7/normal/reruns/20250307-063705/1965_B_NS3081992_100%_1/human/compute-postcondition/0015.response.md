Output State: **`ans` is [2, 3, 2, 16, 32], `i` is 5, `l` must be the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration**

Explanation: The code appends `2 ** i` to the list `ans`. Given that `i` is 5, `2 ** i` equals `2 ** 5`, which is 32. So, the list `ans` now includes the value 32 at the end. The variable `i` remains unchanged at 5, and `l` retains its value from the previous iteration.
