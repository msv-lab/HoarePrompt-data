The function accepts a dictionary `d` where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, an integer `da` representing a key in the dictionary `d`, a list `processing` of integers initialized to 0s, and a list `rank` of integers initialized to 0s. It returns either 1 or a value that is `tmp + 1`, where `tmp` is the minimum value between its current value and the result of recursively calling itself for each element `di` in `d[da]` if `processing[di - 1]` is 0. The function updates the `rank` list based on the computed `tmp` value.
