Output State: **`ans` is [2, 3, 2, 16], `i` is 4, `l` must be the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration**

Explanation: The code appends `2 ** i` to the list `ans`. Given that `i` is 4, `2 ** i` equals `2 ** 4`, which is 16. Therefore, `ans` becomes `[2, 3, 2, 16]`. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 4, and `l` retains its value from the previous iteration.
