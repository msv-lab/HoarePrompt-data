Output State: `i` is `lk + (lk - 2)`, `ans` is a list containing the values \(2, 4, 2^{lk-1}\).

Explanation: The loop runs from `lk` to `l-1`. Given that the loop executed 3 times, we can deduce that `lk + 2` is the last value `i` took before exiting the loop. Therefore, the total number of iterations is `lk - 2 + 3 = lk + 1`. So, `i` will be `lk + (lk - 2)` after all iterations. The list `ans` will contain all the powers of 2 starting from \(2^{lk-2}\) up to \(2^{lk+1-2} = 2^{lk-1}\). Hence, `ans` will be `[2, 4, 2^{lk-1}]`.
