### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires constructing a sequence `a` of non-negative integers of size at most 25 such that:
   - No subsequence of `a` sums to `k`.
   - For all `1 ≤ v ≤ n` where `v ≠ k`, there is a subsequence of `a` that sums to `v`.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Solution**:
   - The function `func_14()` is the main function that constructs the required sequence.
   - It reads the inputs `n` and `k` using `func_7()`, which reads space-separated integers from standard input.
   - It then converts `n` and `k` to binary representation and calculates their lengths (`l` and `lk` respectively).
   - If `k == 1`, it handles a special case where `n == 2`.
   - Otherwise, it constructs the sequence `ans` based on the binary representation of `n` and `k`:
     - For `k == 1`, it uses powers of 2.
     - For other values of `k`, it constructs the sequence by including specific powers of 2 and ensuring no subsequence sums to `k`.

3. **Verification**:
   - The provided solution constructs the sequence `ans` in a way that avoids any subsequence summing to `k` by using a combination of powers of 2 and specific values.
   - However, the construction of the sequence for `k > 1` seems flawed. Specifically, the sequence includes `k - 1 - sum(ans)` and `k + 1`, which may introduce subsequences that sum to `k`.
   - Additionally, the sequence length is bounded by 25, but the construction logic does not ensure that every number from 1 to `n` (except `k`) can be formed by some subsequence, especially when `n` is large.

4. **Output**:
   - The length of the sequence `ans` is correctly printed first.
   - The elements of `ans` are then printed as space-separated integers.

### Detailed Analysis:
- **For `k == 1`**:
  - The sequence `[2, 3, 4, ..., 2^l]` is constructed, where `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n`.
  - This sequence ensures that no subsequence sums to 1, and every number from 2 to `n` can be formed by some subsequence.

- **For `k > 1`**:
  - The sequence includes `[2^0, 2^1, ..., 2^{lk-1}, k-1 - sum(ans), k+1, 2*k+1, 2^l, ..., 2^{l-1}]`.
  - The inclusion of `k - 1 - sum(ans)` and `k + 1` might introduce subsequences that sum to `k`, violating the condition.
  - The sequence length is bounded by 25, but the construction logic does not guarantee that every number from 1 to `n` (except `k`) can be formed by some subsequence.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution has issues with the construction of the sequence for `k > 1`, and the logic does not guarantee that every number from 1 to `n` (except `k`) can be formed by some subsequence. Therefore, the solution is not correct.
