Output State: **`i` is equal to `bets` - 1; `sumo` is less than `prod`; `a[i]` is updated to `prod // a[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `bets` - 1; `ans` is an empty string.**

Explanation: The code initializes `ans` as an empty string. No other operations are performed on the existing variables, so their values remain unchanged. Therefore, the values of `i`, `sumo`, `prod`, and the updated `a[i]` values are retained from the initial state.
