Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(bets)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `bets`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `ans` is the original value plus the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space.
   - `i` is increased by 1.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `bets`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is increased by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value.
   - The variable `bets` remains unchanged unless modified within the loop body, but since no such modification is mentioned, `bets` stays the same.
   - The variable `ans` is not directly affected by the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted here.

5. **Formulate the new state**: The only variables that need adjustment are `i` and `bets`. Given that `i` is increased by 1, and `bets` remains the same, the new state should reflect this.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`ans` is the original value plus the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space, `i` is increased by 1, `bets` must be greater than or equal to the new value of `i`**.

Since `i` was increased by 1 in the previous iteration, let's denote the new value of `i` as `i_new = i + 1`.

Thus, the final state is:
State: **`ans` is the original value plus the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space, `i` is `i + 1`, `bets` must be greater than or equal to `i + 1`**.
