Based on the initial state provided:

- `bets` must be greater than or equal to 5.
- `i` is 5.
- `sumo` is the total sum of `prod // a[i]` for each index `i` from `0` to `bets-1`.
- `ans` is 'a[0]' followed by 'a[1]', 'a[4]' and spaces.

Let's break down the `print(ans)` statement:

- `ans` is constructed by concatenating the strings 'a[0]', 'a[1]', and 'a[4]' with spaces in between. This means `ans` will be a string like `'a[0] a[1] a[4]'`.

Since the exact values of `a[0]`, `a[1]`, and `a[4]` are not provided, we can only describe `ans` in terms of these indices.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **a[0] a[1] a[4]**
