Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `l`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `g` is `g * l[0] // gcd(g, l[0])`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for each index in the list `l`. Therefore, the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than the length of `l`.

4. **Calculate the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and the loop increments `i` by 1 each time it runs, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - The value of `g` remains unchanged unless modified within the loop body, but since no modifications are mentioned, `g` stays the same.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` will be 1.
   - `g` remains `g * l[0] // gcd(g, l[0])`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 1, `g` is `g * l[0] // gcd(g, l[0])`**
