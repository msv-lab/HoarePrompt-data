Output State: **`i` is 1; `bets` must be greater than 1; `sumo` is `sumo` + `a[i]`; `a[i]` is equal to `prod // a[i]`**

Explanation: The code snippet `sumo += int(a[i])` updates the value of `sumo` by adding the integer value of `a[i]` to it. Since `a[i]` is equal to `prod // a[i]`, this relationship remains unchanged. The values of `i` and `bets` remain the same as they were not affected by the code.
