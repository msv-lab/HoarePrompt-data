Output State: **`ans` is the original value plus the string representation of `a[i+2]` followed by a space, `i` is `i + 2`**

Explanation: The code `ans += str(a[i]) + ' '` appends the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space to `ans`. Given the initial state where `ans` is the original value plus the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space, and `i` is `i + 2`, after executing the code, `ans` will now include the string representation of `a[i+2]` followed by a space. The value of `i` remains unchanged as the code does not modify `i`.
