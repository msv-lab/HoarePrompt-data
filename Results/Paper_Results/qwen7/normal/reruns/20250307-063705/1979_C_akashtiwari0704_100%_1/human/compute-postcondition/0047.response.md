Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given for loop is `i` and the range of the loop is `range(len(l))`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(l)`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `g` is updated to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`
   - `i` is `bets - 1` and must be less than `len(l)`
   - `T` must be less than `t`

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently `bets - 1`, for the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `bets`.
   - We need to check if `bets` is still less than `len(l)`. If it is, the loop will continue.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `g` remains unchanged because the update happens inside the loop body, not in the loop head.
   - `i` changes from `bets - 1` to `bets`.
   - `T` and `t` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `g` is updated to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`, `i` is `bets`, and must be less than `len(l)`, `T` must be less than `t`**.
