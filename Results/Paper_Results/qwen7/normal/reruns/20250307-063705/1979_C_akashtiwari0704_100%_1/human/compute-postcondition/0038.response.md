Output State: **`i` is 3, `ans` is equal to `str(a[1]) + ' ' + str(a[3]) + ' '`, `bets` must be greater than 3**

Explanation: The code `ans += str(a[i]) + ' '` appends `str(a[i]) + ' '` to the existing value of `ans`. Given that `i` is 3, `ans` is updated to include `str(a[3]) + ' '`. Since `ans` initially was `str(a[1]) + ' '`, the updated value of `ans` is `str(a[1]) + ' ' + str(a[3]) + ' '`. The values of `i` and `bets` remain unchanged from their initial states.
