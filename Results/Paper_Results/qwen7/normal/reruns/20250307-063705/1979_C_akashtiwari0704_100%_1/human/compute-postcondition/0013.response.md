Functionality: **The function `lcm` accepts a list `l` of integers and returns the product of all unique prime factors present in the list. It achieves this by initializing a variable `g` to 1, then iterating through each element in the list, updating `g` to be the product of `g` and the current element, divided by their greatest common divisor (GCD). After processing all elements, `g` contains the product of all unique prime factors in the list.**
