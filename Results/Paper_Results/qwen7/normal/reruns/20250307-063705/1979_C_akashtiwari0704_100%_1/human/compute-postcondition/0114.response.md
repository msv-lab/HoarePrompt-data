Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `bets - 1`
- `sumo` is the sum of LCM(`prod`, `a[i]`) for all `i` from 0 to `bets - 1`
- `a[i]` is updated to `prod // a[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `bets - 1`
- The current value of `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(-1)
```

This `print` statement simply outputs the integer `-1`. The values of `i`, `sumo`, and `a` do not affect this particular print statement since it is not dependent on their values but rather just outputs a fixed value.

Output: **-1**
