Functionality: **The function `lcm` takes a list `l` as input and returns the product of all elements in the list after reducing each element by its greatest common divisor (gcd) with the accumulating product `g`. Additionally, it sets the variable `i` to the length of the list `l`. All other variables (`sumo`, `prod`, `ans`, `T`, and `bets`) remain unchanged, and the condition `T < t` is preserved.**
