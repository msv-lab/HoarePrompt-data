Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(bets)`. The only variable here is `i`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `bets`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ans` is the original value plus the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space.
   - `i` is `i + 1`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is `i + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1 again.
   - Therefore, `i` will be `i + 2` at the start of the next iteration.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - The value of `ans` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration because the loop body is omitted and no changes are made to `ans` within the loop.
   - The value of `i` is now `i + 2`.

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`ans` is the original value plus the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space, `i` is `i + 2`**.
