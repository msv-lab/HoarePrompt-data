Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `l`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = len(l) - 1`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `i + 1`
   - `g` is the result of `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`

4. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - The value of `g` will be updated based on the current value of `i` (which is `i + 1` at the start of the next iteration).

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - The value of `g` will be updated based on the current value of `i` (which is `i + 1` at the start of the next iteration).

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is `i + 1`
- `g` is the result of `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])` where `i` is now `i + 1`

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `g` is the result of `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])` where `i` is `i + 1`**
