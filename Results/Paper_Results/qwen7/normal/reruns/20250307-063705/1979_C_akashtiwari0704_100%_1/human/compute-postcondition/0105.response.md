Output State: **`i` is 0; `sumo` is increased by the integer value of `a[0]`; `a[0]` is assigned the value of `prod` // `a[0]`; `bets` must be a positive integer**

Explanation: The code `sumo += int(a[i])` increments `sumo` by the integer value of `a[i]`. Given that `i` is initially 0, `a[i]` is `a[0]`. The value of `a[0]` is updated to `prod // a[0]` (integer division), and `sumo` is increased by the integer value of `a[0]` after the division. The variables `bets` and `a[i]` for `i` other than 0 remain unchanged according to the initial state.
