Output State: **i is equal to bets - 1; sumo is the sum of LCM(prod, a[i]) for all i from 0 to bets - 1; a[i] is updated to prod // a[i] for all i from 0 to bets - 1.**

In this final output state, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be set to `bets - 1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `sumo` will hold the cumulative sum of the values of `a[i]` after each iteration, where each `a[i]` is updated to the least common multiple (LCM) of `prod` and `a[i]`. The list `a` will have been updated such that each element `a[i]` is now `prod // a[i]` for all valid indices `i` within the range of the loop.
