Output State: **`i` is 2; `a[i]` is assigned the value of `prod // a[i]`; `bets` must be greater than 1.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `a[i]` to be the integer division of `prod` by `a[i]`. Since `i` is 2, `a[2]` is updated. However, the exact value of `a[2]` and `prod` is not given, so we express it in terms of these variables. The value of `bets` remains unchanged and must still be greater than 1.
