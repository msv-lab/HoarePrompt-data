Output State: **`bets` must be greater than 0, `i` is 3, `sumo` is the total sum of `prod // a[i]` for each index `i` from `0` to `bets-1`, `ans` is 'a[0]' followed by 'a[1]' and a space.**

Explanation: 
- Initially, `i` is 2.
- After executing `ans += str(a[i]) + ' '`, `i` is incremented by 1 (becoming 3), and `ans` is updated to include the string representation of `a[2]` followed by a space.
- Since `i` was incremented, the next iteration would start with `i` being 3.
- The conditions and values of `bets`, `sumo`, and the original value of `ans` ('a[0]' followed by a space) remain unchanged.
