Output State: **`g` is updated to the value of `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`.**

This means that the value of `g` has been updated to the result of multiplying `g` by `l[i]` and then performing integer division by the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `g` and `l[i]`. The values of other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
