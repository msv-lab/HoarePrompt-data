Output State: **`bets` is an input integer, `i` is `bets - 1`, `sumo` is 0, `prod` is the least common multiple of all integers in `a`, `ans` is unchanged, `T` is `T + 1` and must be less than `t`, `g` is 1, and `a` is a list of integers obtained from input.**

Explanation: The line `sumo = 0` initializes `sumo` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
