Postcondition: **`bets` must be greater than 0, `i` is -1 indicating the loop has finished, `sumo` is the total sum of `prod // a[i]` for each index `i` from 0 to `bets-1`, and the values of `prod`, `ans`, `T`, `g`, and `a` will remain as they were initialized or updated within the loop body. Additionally, `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod` if the if condition is true, otherwise `bets` is at least 5, `i` is 5, `sumo` is the total sum of `prod // a[i]` for each index `i` from 0 to `bets-1`, and `ans` contains the concatenated strings of 'a[0]', 'a[1]', and 'a[4]' separated by spaces.**
