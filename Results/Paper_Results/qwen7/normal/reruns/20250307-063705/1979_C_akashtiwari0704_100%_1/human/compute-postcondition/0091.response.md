Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`; `g` is the result of `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`**

Explanation: The variable `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now `i + 1`. The variable `g` is updated to the value of `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`, where `l[i]` refers to the element in the list `l` at index `i`. The `gcd` function calculates the greatest common divisor of `g` and `l[i]`, and the result of the division operation is assigned back to `g`.
