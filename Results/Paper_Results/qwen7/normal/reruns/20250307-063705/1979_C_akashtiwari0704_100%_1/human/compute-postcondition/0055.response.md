Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `l`, which is a list. It returns the product of all elements in the list `l` after reducing each element with the gcd of the current accumulated product `g` and the current element, and sets `i` to the length of the list `l`. All other variables (`sumo`, `prod`, `ans`, `T`, and `bets`) remain unchanged, and `T` is still less than `t`.**
