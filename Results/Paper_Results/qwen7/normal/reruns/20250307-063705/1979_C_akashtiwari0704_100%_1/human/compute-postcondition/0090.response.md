Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `g` is updated to the value of `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`.

### Loop Head
- The loop iterates over the range of the length of the list `l`: `for i in range(len(l))`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**: The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `len(l)`.
2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**: The loop continues as long as `i < len(l)`.
3. **Adjust the State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have been incremented by 1 (if it was less than `len(l)`). Therefore, for the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

### Updated State
- Since `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, if `i` was previously `k`, then after the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`.
- The value of `g` is updated based on the current value of `i`, but since the loop condition and the increment of `i` are the key factors here, we only need to update `i`.

### Final Answer
State: **`g` is updated to the value of `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`, `i` is `i + 1`**.

However, since the exact value of `g` is not provided and we are only asked to adjust the state of the loop variables, the final state can be generalized as:

State: **`i` is `i + 1`**.

Given that `i` is the only variable directly controlled by the loop head, the final state is:

State: **`i` is `i + 1`**.
