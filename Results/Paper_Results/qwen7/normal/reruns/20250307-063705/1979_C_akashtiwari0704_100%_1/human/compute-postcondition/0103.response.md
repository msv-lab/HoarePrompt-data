Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `bets`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The variable `i` is initialized to -1, indicating that the loop has finished.
   - For the loop to start executing, `i` needs to be updated to 0 and `bets` needs to be a positive integer.

3. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since the loop is controlled by `i` and `bets`, we need to ensure that `i` is set to 0 and `bets` is a positive integer.
   - The values of `sumo`, `prod`, `ans`, `T`, and `a` are not directly involved in the loop condition and can remain as they are unless specified otherwise.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `bets`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `bets` must be a positive integer**
