Output State: **`i` is 0; `ans` is equal to 'a[0] '**

Explanation: The code `ans += str(a[i]) + ' '` appends the string representation of `a[i]` to `ans`. Given that `i` is initially 0, `a[i]` refers to `a[0]`. Since `a` is not defined in the initial state, we can only say that `ans` is updated to include the string representation of `a[0]`. The value of `i` remains unchanged as the code does not modify it.
