Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `bets - 1`, meaning the loop has completed all its iterations.
- `ans` is the concatenation of `str(a[j]) + ' '` for all `j` in the range of `bets`, which means `ans` is a space-separated string of all elements in the list `a`.

Given this, the `print(ans)` statement will print the concatenated string of all elements in the list `a`, separated by spaces.

Output: **ans (where ans is a space-separated string of all elements in the list a)**
