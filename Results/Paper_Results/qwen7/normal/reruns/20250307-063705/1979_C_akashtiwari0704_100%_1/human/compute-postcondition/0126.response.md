Output State: **The loop has executed all iterations, and the final state of the variables is as follows:**

- `T` is set to `t-1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
- `bets` is the number of iterations the loop ran, which is `t`.
- `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the list `a` after all iterations.
- `sumo` is the sum of the integer values of `a` after all iterations, where each element `a[j]` (for `j` in range `bets`) is updated to `prod // a[j]`.
- `ans` is a space-separated string containing the final values of all elements in the list `a` after all iterations, unless `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, in which case `ans` remains unchanged.

If `sumo` is less than `prod` after all iterations, `ans` will contain the concatenated string of all elements in the list `a`, separated by spaces. Otherwise, `ans` will be `-1`.
