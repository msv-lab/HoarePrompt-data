Output State: **`bets` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, `T` is less than `t`, `i` is equal to `len(l) - 1`, `g` is the product of all elements in list `l` divided by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `g` and each element in `l` for every iteration.**

Explanation: The code `bets = int(input())` assigns the value of the input integer to the variable `bets`. The initial state of `t` and `T` remains unchanged. After this assignment, the loop and the function `lcm` remain to be executed with the updated state.
