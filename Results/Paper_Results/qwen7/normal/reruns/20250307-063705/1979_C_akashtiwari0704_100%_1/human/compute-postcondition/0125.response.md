Postcondition: **i is equal to bets - 1, sumo is the sum of LCM(prod, a[i]) for all i from 0 to bets - 1, a[i] is updated to prod // a[i] for all i from 0 to bets - 1, and either sumo is greater than or equal to prod, in which case the postcondition holds as described above, or the final value of ans will be the concatenation of the string representations of all elements in the list a, separated by spaces.**
