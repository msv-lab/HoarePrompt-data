Postcondition: **`i` is equal to `bets - 1`, `sumo` is the sum of the integer values of `a` after all iterations, where each element `a[j]` (for `j` in range `bets`) is updated to `prod // a[j]`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, the function does not change `ans`. Otherwise, `ans` is a space-separated string of all elements in the list `a`**.
