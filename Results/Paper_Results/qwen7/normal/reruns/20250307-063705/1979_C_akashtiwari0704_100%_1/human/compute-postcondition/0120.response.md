Output State: **`ans` is the original value plus the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space, `i` is `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += str(a[i]) + ' '` appends the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space to the existing value of `ans`. It also increments the value of `i` by 1. The condition that `bets` must be greater than or equal to `i + 1` remains unchanged and is still valid.
