Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive.**

The code `t = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, the output state reflects that `t` now holds the value of this input integer within the specified range. All other variables (`n` and `k`) remain undefined as they were not affected by this line of code.
