Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is defined by the variable `i` and the condition `range(bets)`. Therefore, the only variables that can be adjusted are `i` and `bets`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i` and `bets`**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `len(a) + 1`.
   - The value of `bets` is an input integer.

3. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `bets`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `i` starts at `len(a) + 1`, it needs to be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.
   - `bets` remains unchanged as it is an input integer.

5. **Final state**:
   - After incrementing `i` by 1, `i` becomes `len(a) + 2`.
   - `bets` remains the same input integer.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`bets` is an input integer, `i` is `len(a) + 2`**
