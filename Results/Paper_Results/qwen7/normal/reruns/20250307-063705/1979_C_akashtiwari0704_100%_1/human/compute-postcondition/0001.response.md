Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `T` which is assigned the value of `t` in each iteration.

2. **Determine the initial state of `T`**: Since `t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, the loop will start with `T` being set to this value.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop `for T in range(t)` will execute as long as `T` is less than `t`. When `T` equals `t`, the loop will terminate.

4. **Initial state of `T`**: Initially, `T` is set to the value of `t`.

5. **Adjust the state**: For the loop to execute at least once, `T` must be less than `t` initially. However, since `T` is set to `t` at the start of the loop, the loop will not execute at all if `T` is exactly equal to `t`.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `T` is less than `t` for the loop to execute at least once. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `T` is less than `t`.

**Final State Adjustment**:
- `t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive.
- For the loop to execute at least once, `T` must be less than `t`.

So, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, `T` is less than `t`**
