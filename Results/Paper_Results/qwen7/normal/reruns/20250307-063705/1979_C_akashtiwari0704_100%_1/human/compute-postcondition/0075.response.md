Output State: **`bets` must be greater than 0, `i` is `-1`, `sumo` is the total sum of `prod // a[i]` for each index `i` from `0` to `bets-1`, `ans` is an empty string.**

Explanation: The line `ans = ''` assigns an empty string to the variable `ans`. The values of `bets`, `i`, `sumo`, `prod`, `ans`, `T`, `g`, and `a` remain unchanged from their previous states.
