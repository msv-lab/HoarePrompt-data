Output State: **`bets` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `sumo` is the total sum of `prod // a[i]` for each index `i` from `0` to `bets-1`, `ans` is 'a[0]' followed by a space.**

Explanation: The code `ans += str(a[i]) + ' '` appends the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space to the string `ans`. Initially, `i` is 0, so `a[0]` is appended to `ans`. After this operation, `i` is incremented (though not shown in the code snippet, it is implied that `i` would be incremented in the next iteration of a loop), making `i` equal to 1. The other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state.
