Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies `i` in the range of `len(l)`. Therefore, the only variable that can be adjusted is `i`.

2. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(l)`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `g` is updated to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`
   - `i` is unchanged from the previous iteration
   - `bets` must be less than `len(l)`
   - `T` must be less than `t`

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - The other variables (`g`, `bets`, and `T`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head and their values are not directly modified within the loop body based on the given information.

5. **Ensure the loop condition is met**: For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `len(l)`. 

Given the current state:
- `g` is updated to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`
- `i` is `i` (unchanged)
- `bets` must be less than `len(l)`
- `T` must be less than `t`

For the next iteration:
- `i` will be `i + 1`
- The loop will continue as long as `i < len(l)`

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`g` is updated to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`, `i` is `i + 1`, `bets` must be less than `len(l)`, `T` must be less than `t`**
