Output State: **`i` is equal to `bets - 1`, `sumo` is the sum of the integer values of `a` after all iterations, `prod` is unchanged, `ans` is unchanged, `T` is `T + 1` and must be less than `t`, `g` is 1.**

This means that the variable `g` has been initialized to 1, while all other variables remain in their previous states.
