Output State: **`g` is updated to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`, `i` is `bets - 1` and must be less than `len(l)`, `T` must be less than `t`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `g` by multiplying it with `l[i]` and then performing integer division by the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `g` and `l[i]`. The value of `i` remains `bets - 1` and must still be less than `len(l)`, and `T` must still be less than `t`.
