Output State: **`i` is 2; `sumo` is increased by the integer value of `a[2]`; `a[i]` is assigned the value of `prod // a[i]`; `bets` must be greater than 1.**

Explanation: The code `sumo += int(a[i])` increments the value of `sumo` by the integer value of `a[i]`, where `i` is 2. So, `sumo` is increased by the integer value of `a[2]`. The value of `a[i]` (which is `a[2]`) is reassigned to `prod // a[2]`. The other variables (`bets` and `a[i]` before the reassignment) remain unchanged, and `bets` must still be greater than 1.
