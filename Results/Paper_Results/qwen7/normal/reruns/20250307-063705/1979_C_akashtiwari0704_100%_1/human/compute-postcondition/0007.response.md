Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State
- `i` is 1
- `g` is `g * l[0] * l[1] // gcd(g, l[0]) // gcd(g * l[0] // gcd(g, l[0]), l[1])`

### Loop Head
The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(len(l)):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
- The loop variable `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
- The loop will continue as long as `i < len(l)`.

### Current Iteration
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
- Therefore, for the next iteration, `i` should be incremented to 2.

### Conditions for Next Iteration
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(l)`.
- Since `i` is currently 1, the next value of `i` will be 2.
- The expression for `g` does not change based on the loop iteration directly, but it will be updated if the loop body contains any operations that affect `g`.

### Updated State
- `i` will be 2.
- `g` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration because the loop body is omitted and no changes are made to `g` in this context.

### Final State
State: **`i` is 2, `g` is `g * l[0] * l[1] // gcd(g, l[0]) // gcd(g * l[0] // gcd(g, l[0]), l[1])`**
