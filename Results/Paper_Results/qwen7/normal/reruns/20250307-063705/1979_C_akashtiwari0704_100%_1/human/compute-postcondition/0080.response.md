Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variables `i` and `bets`.

2. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i < bets`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `bets` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `sumo` is the total sum of `prod // a[i]` for each index `i` from `0` to `bets-1`.
   - `ans` is 'a[0]' followed by 'a[1]' and a space.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 3, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 4.
   - For the loop to continue, `bets` must still be greater than 4 (since `i` needs to be less than `bets`).

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 4.
   - `bets` must remain greater than 4.

6. **Sumo and ans**: These values are computed within the loop body and do not change based on the loop head variables. Therefore, they remain unchanged.

Based on this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`bets` must be greater than 4, `i` is 4, `sumo` is the total sum of `prod // a[i]` for each index `i` from `0` to `bets-1`, `ans` is 'a[0]' followed by 'a[1]' and a space**.
