Based on the initial state provided:

- `bets` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is -1, indicating the loop has finished.
- `sumo` is the total sum of `prod // a[i]` for each index `i` from 0 to `bets-1`.
- `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`.

The print statement simply outputs `-1`.

Output: **-1**
