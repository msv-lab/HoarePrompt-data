Output State: **`bets` is an input integer, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `sumo` is increased by the integer value of `a[i]`, `a[i]` is updated to `prod // a[i]`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `a[i]` to `prod // a[i]`, where `i` is the last index of list `a`. It then adds the integer value of `a[i]` to `sumo`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
