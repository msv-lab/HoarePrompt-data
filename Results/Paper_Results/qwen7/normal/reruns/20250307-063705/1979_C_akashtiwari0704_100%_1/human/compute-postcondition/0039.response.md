Output State: `i` is equal to `bets - 1`; `ans` is equal to the concatenation of `str(a[j]) + ' '` for all `j` in the range `bets`.

In simpler terms, after the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `bets - 1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `ans` will contain a string that consists of the string representation of each element in the list `a`, separated by spaces, starting from `a[0]` up to `a[bets-1]`.
