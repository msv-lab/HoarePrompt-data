Output State: **`g` is updated to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`, `i` is `i + 1`, `bets` must be less than `len(l)`, `T` must be less than `t`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `g` to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`. It also increments `i` by 1. The conditions for `bets` and `T` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects these changes and retains the original conditions.
