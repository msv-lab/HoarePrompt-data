Output State: **`bets` is an input integer, `i` is `bets - 1`, `sumo` is the sum of the integer values of `a` after all iterations, `prod` is unchanged, `ans` is unchanged, `T` is `T + 1` and must be less than `t`, `g` is 1, and `a` is a list of integers obtained from input.**

Explanation: The code `a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, splits the line into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `a`. The values of `bets`, `i`, `sumo`, `prod`, `ans`, `T`, and `g` remain unchanged from their previous states. The variable `a` is now a list containing the integers entered by the user.
