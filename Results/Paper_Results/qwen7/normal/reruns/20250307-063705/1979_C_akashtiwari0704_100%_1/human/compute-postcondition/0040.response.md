Output State: `i` is equal to `bets - 1`; `ans` is equal to the concatenation of `str(a[j]) + ' '` for all `j` in the range of `bets`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `bets - 1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `ans` will contain a string that is the concatenation of `str(a[j]) + ' '` for every index `j` from `0` to `bets - 1`. In other words, `ans` will be a space-separated string of all elements in the list `a`.
