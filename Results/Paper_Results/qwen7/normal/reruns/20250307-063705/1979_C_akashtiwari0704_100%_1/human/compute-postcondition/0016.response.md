Output State: **`bets` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, `T` is less than `t`, `i` is equal to `len(a) - 1`, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of all elements in list `a`, `g` is the product of all elements in list `a` divided by the GCD of `g` and each element in `a` for every iteration, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `prod` as the least common multiple (LCM) of all elements in the list `a`. This calculation does not affect the values of the other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the output state includes the new variable `prod` along with the unchanged values of the other variables.
