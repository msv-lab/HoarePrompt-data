Output State: **`ans` is the original value plus the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space, `i` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `ans += str(a[i]) + ' '` appends the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space to the variable `ans`. It also implies that `i` has been incremented by 1, although the exact value of `i` is not specified in the initial state. The output state reflects these changes while keeping the unchanged variables in their initial state context.
