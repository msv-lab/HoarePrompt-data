Output State: **`bets` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, `T` is less than `t`, `i` is equal to `len(a) - 1`, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of all elements in list `a`, `g` is the product of all elements in list `a` divided by the GCD of `g` and each element in `a` for every iteration, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `sumo` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `sumo` to 0. This does not affect any of the other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the only change is the introduction of `sumo` with a value of 0.
