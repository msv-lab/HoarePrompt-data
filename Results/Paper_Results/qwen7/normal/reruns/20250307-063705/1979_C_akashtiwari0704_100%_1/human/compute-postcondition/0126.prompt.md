Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive.
Code of the loop:
for T in range(t):

    def lcm(l):
        g = 1
        for i in range(len(l)):
            g = g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])
        return g
    bets = int(input())
    a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    prod = lcm(a)
    sumo = 0
    for i in range(bets):
        a[i] = prod // a[i]
        sumo += int(a[i])
    if sumo >= prod:
        print(-1)
    else:
        ans = ''
        for i in range(bets):
            ans += str(a[i]) + ' '
        print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is equal to `bets - 1`, `sumo` is the sum of the integer values of `a` after all iterations, where each element `a[j]` (for `j` in range `bets`) is updated to `prod // a[j]`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, the function does not change `ans`. Otherwise, `ans` is a space-separated string of all elements in the list `a`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `bets` must be greater than 0, `i` is -1 indicating the loop has finished, `sumo` is the total sum of `prod // a[i]` for each index `i` from 0 to `bets-1`, and the values of `prod`, `ans`, `T`, `g`, and `a` will remain as they were initialized or updated within the loop body. Additionally, `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod` if the if condition is true, otherwise `bets` is at least 5, `i` is 5, `sumo` is the total sum of `prod // a[i]` for each index `i` from 0 to `bets-1`, and `ans` contains the concatenated strings of 'a[0]', 'a[1]', and 'a[4]' separated by spaces.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: i is equal to bets - 1, sumo is the sum of LCM(prod, a[i]) for all i from 0 to bets - 1, a[i] is updated to prod // a[i] for all i from 0 to bets - 1, and either sumo is greater than or equal to prod, in which case the postcondition holds as described above, or the final value of ans will be the concatenation of the string representations of all elements in the list a, separated by spaces.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
