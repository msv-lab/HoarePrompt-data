Output State: **`i` is 2, `ans` is equal to `str(a[1]) + ' '`**

Explanation: The code `ans += str(a[i]) + ' '` updates the variable `ans` by concatenating the string representation of `a[i]` (where `i` is currently 1) to `ans`. Since `i` starts at 1 and this operation does not change its value, `i` remains 1 after the operation. However, since `i` is typically incremented after such operations in loops, we assume `i` is incremented to 2 for the next iteration. The value of `ans` is updated to include the string representation of `a[1]` followed by a space.
