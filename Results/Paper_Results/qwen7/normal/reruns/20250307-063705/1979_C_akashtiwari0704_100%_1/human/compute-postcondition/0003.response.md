Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `l`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `i` is the loop variable, and it starts from 0 (as per the `range(len(l))`).
   - `l` is a list whose length is determined by `len(l)`.

3. **Understand the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `len(l)`.
   - Therefore, the loop will execute if `len(l)` is at least 1.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0, no adjustment is needed for `i`.
   - We need to ensure that `l` is a non-empty list, meaning its length should be at least 1.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive.
- `T` is less than `t`.
- `g` is 1.

The only objects in the loop head that need adjustment are `i` and `l`. Specifically, `l` must be a non-empty list.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`i` is 0, `l` is a non-empty list**
