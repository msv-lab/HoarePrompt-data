The function `lcm` accepts a parameter `l`, which is a list of integers. Each integer in the list `l` is between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, and `T` (which is not explicitly mentioned but implied to be related to `t`) is less than `t`. The function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of all unique prime factors present in the list `l`. It does this by first computing the product of all elements in the list `l`, then dividing this product by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the product and each element in the list for every iteration. The final result is the product of all unique prime factors present in the list `l`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `l` of integers, and returns the product of all unique prime factors present in the list. This is calculated by first finding the product of all elements in the list, then dividing this product by the GCD of the product and each element in the list for every iteration.**
