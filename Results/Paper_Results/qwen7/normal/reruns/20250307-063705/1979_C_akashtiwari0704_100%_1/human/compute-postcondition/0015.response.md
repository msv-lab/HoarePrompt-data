Output State: **`bets` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, `T` is less than `t`, `i` is equal to `len(a) - 1`, `g` is the product of all elements in list `a` divided by the GCD of `g` and each element in `a` for every iteration, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `a` by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer. This operation does not affect the values of `bets`, `t`, `T`, or `i`. It also initializes `g` to be the product of all elements in `a` divided by the GCD of `g` and each element in `a` for every iteration, but since `g` is not yet defined, it remains undefined until the first iteration of any loop that might follow. Therefore, the output state includes the new list `a` along with the unchanged variables `bets`, `t`, `T`, and `i`.
