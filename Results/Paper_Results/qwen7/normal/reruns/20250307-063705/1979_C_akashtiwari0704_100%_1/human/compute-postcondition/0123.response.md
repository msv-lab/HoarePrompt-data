Output State: **The final value of `ans` will be the concatenation of the string representations of all elements in the list `a`, separated by spaces.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `ans` will contain a single string. This string is formed by taking each element of the list `a` (from index 0 to `bets-1`), converting it to its string representation, and then concatenating these strings together with a space between each element. The loop iterates over the entire list `a` exactly once, updating `ans` in each iteration to include the current element's string representation followed by a space.
