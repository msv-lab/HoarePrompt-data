Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state is given as follows:
   - `t` is explicitly defined as 1.
   - `i` is the next odd number after `t`, so since `t` is 1, `i` would be 3 (as it is the next odd number).
   - `n` must be at least 2, but its exact value is not specified.

2. The code snippet to be executed is:
   ```python
   print('No')
   ```

3. The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'No'`.

Given the above steps, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **No**
