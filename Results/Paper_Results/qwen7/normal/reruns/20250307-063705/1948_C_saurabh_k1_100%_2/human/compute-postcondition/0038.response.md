Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable is `i`.
   - The loop condition involves `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for values of `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1` with a step of 2 (i.e., `i = 1, 3, 5, ...`).

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is 2.
   - `i` is 6.
   - `a` is a string input by the user.
   - `b` is a string input by the user.
   - The loop condition `i + 1 < n` and `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` determines whether the loop continues.

4. **Analyze the Loop Condition:**
   - For the loop to continue, `i + 1 < n` must be true.
   - Given `i` is 6, `i + 1` is 7.
   - Therefore, `7 < n` must be true for the loop to continue.

5. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration:**
   - `i` will be incremented by 2, so `i` will become 8.
   - `n` must remain as it was at the end of the previous iteration because the loop condition does not change `n`.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `i` should be 8.
- `n` must be greater than 7.

The final state is:

State: **`t` is 2, `i` is 8, `a` is a string input by the user, `b` is a string input by the user, `n` must be greater than 7**
