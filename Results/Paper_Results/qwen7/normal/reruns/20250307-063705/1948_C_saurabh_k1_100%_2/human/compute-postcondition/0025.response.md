Output State: **`t` is 2, `i` is 4, `a` is a string input by the user, `b` is a list of characters, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `a = input()` assigns the value entered by the user (as a string) to the variable `a`. The values of `t`, `i`, `b`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
