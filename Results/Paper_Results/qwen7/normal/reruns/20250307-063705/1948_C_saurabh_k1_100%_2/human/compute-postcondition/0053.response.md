Output State: **Postcondition: `t` is 1, `i` is an odd number less than or equal to `n-1`, `n` must be at least 2, and either `(i + 1 < n and a[i] == '<' and b[i + 1] == '<')` or `(a[i] == '<' and b[i - 1] == '<')`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. Since the `break` statement does not modify any variable values, the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. The conditions specified in the postcondition also remain valid.
