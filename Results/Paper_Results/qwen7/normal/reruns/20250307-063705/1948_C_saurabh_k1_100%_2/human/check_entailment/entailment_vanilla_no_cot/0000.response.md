Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Movement**: The logic in the loop does not correctly simulate the robot's movement. The robot should move according to the direction of the arrow in the current cell, but the current implementation only checks if certain patterns exist in the grid.

2. **Break Statement Misuse**: The `break` statement is used to prematurely exit the loop when a condition is met, but this condition is not correctly defined for the problem's requirements. Specifically, the condition `i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` is not relevant to the problem's logic.

3. **Missing Handling of Even Columns**: Since `n` is always even, the robot must end up in an even column to reach `(2, n)`. The current logic does not account for this requirement.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        
        # Check if the last column can be reached
        if a[n-1] == '>' or (a[n-2] == '>' and b[n-1] == '>'):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

```

This corrected function checks if the robot can move to the last column `(2, n)` by ensuring that the last column has an arrow pointing right (`>`), or if the second-to-last column has an arrow pointing right and the last column also has an arrow pointing right. If these conditions are met, the robot can reach the target cell `(2, n)`.
