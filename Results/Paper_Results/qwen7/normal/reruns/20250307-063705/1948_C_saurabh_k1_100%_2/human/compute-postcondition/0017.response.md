Output State: **`i` is `i_prev + 4`, `n` is `n_prev`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `i` and `n`. It only breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such block is specified in the given code, we assume it breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
