Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is explicitly given as 1.
- `i` is an odd number less than or equal to `n-1`.
- `n` must be at least 2.
- Either `(i + 1 < n and a[i] == '<' and b[i + 1] == '<')` or `(a[i] == '<' and b[i - 1] == '<')`.

The `print('No')` statement does not depend on the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `a`, or `b`. It simply prints the string 'No'.

Output: **No**
