Output State: **`t` is 1, `i` is the next odd number (i.e., `i + 2`), `n` must be at least 2, and either `(i + 1 < n and a[i] == '<' and b[i + 1] == '<')` or `(a[i] == '<' and b[i - 1] == '<')` must be true. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it does not change the values of the variables `t`, `i`, `n`, `a`, or `b`. It only indicates that the execution exits the current loop or conditional structure. Therefore, the conditions and values of the variables remain unchanged.
