Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n). Specifically, the program checks only certain conditions for odd indices and does not account for the full range of movements and arrow directions. Here's an example where the program fails:

Consider the following input:
```
4
>>><
><>>
```

The correct path would be:
1. Start at (1, 1).
2. Move right to (1, 2).
3. Move right to (1, 3).
4. Move left to (1, 2).
5. Move up to (2, 2).
6. Move right to (2, 3).

This path successfully reaches (2, 3), but the program incorrectly prints 'No' because it only checks specific conditions for odd indices and does not consider the full sequence of moves and arrow directions.

Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly and is thus incorrect.
