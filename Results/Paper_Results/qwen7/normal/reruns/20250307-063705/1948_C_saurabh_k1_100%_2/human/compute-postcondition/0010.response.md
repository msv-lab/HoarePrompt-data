Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variables in the given code are `i` and `n`.
2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1` with a step of 2. This means `i` starts at 1 and increments by 2 each time until it reaches a value where `i + 1` is no longer less than `n`.
3. **Check the conditions for breaking the loop**: The loop breaks if either of the following conditions are met:
   - `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'`
   - `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is an integer
- `n` is an integer
- `a` is a list of characters
- `b` is a list of characters

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 2 (since the step size is 2), and `i + 1` must still be less than `n`.

Since the loop does not change the values of `a` or `b` directly, and the conditions for breaking the loop do not affect the loop continuation (they only cause the loop to exit), we only need to adjust the states of `i` and `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is some integer value (let's call it `i_prev`)
- `n` is some integer value (let's call it `n_prev`)

For the loop to continue:
- `i` must be `i_prev + 2`
- `i + 1` must be less than `n_prev`, so `i_prev + 2 + 1 < n_prev` simplifies to `i_prev + 3 < n_prev`, which implies `i_prev < n_prev - 3`

Therefore, the new state should reflect that `i` is increased by 2 and `n` must still satisfy the condition `i + 1 < n`.

State: **`i` is `i_prev + 2`, `n` is `n_prev`**
