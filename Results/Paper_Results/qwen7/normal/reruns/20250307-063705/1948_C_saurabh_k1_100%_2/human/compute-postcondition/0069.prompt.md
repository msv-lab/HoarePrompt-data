You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5 and n is even; each test case consists of two strings of length n, where each character in the strings is either '<' or '>', representing the direction of the arrow in each cell of the respective row of the grid.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
                print('No')
                break
        else:
            print('yes')
        
    #State: Output State: The loop completes all its iterations without breaking, and prints 'yes'. This means that for all odd indices `i` (where `1 ≤ i < n`) in the list `a`, the condition `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` was never met. The final value of `i` will be `n - 1` (since the loop increments `i` by 2 each time, starting from 1), and the output will be 'yes'. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain as they were after the last iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and returns a value based on the analysis of a grid consisting of two rows, each of length n (where n is an even integer between 2 and 200,000). Each cell in the grid contains either '<' or '>'. The function evaluates the directions in the grid and returns a result based on the analysis.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
