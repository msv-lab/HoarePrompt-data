State: **`t` must be greater than 0**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop `for _ in range(t):` will execute `t` times.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0.
3. The initial state of `t` being an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) already ensures that `t` is within the valid range, but to guarantee the loop can start, `t` must be strictly greater than 0.
4. No other variables or states need adjustment as they are not involved in the loop head.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute is that `t` must be greater than 0.
