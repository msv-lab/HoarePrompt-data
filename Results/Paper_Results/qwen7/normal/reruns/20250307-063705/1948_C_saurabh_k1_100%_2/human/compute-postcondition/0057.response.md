Output: **No**

Explanation:
- The initial state tells us that `t` is 1.
- `i` is defined as the next odd number after `t`, so `i` would be 3 because `t` is 1 and the next odd number is 3.
- `n` must be at least 2.
- There are two conditions that must be true:
  1. `(i + 1 < n and a[i] == '<' and b[i + 1] == '<')`
  2. `(a[i] == '<' and b[i - 1] == '<')`

However, the actual values of `a` and `b` are not provided in the initial state. Since the print statement is simply printing "No", it does not depend on the values of `a` and `b`. Therefore, regardless of the truth values of the conditions involving `a` and `b`, the print statement will always output "No".
