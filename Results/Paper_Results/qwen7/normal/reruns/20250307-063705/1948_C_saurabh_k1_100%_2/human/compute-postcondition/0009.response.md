Postcondition: **`i` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of characters, `b` is a list of characters. If `i + 1 < n` and either `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If none of these conditions are met, no change is made to the variables.**
