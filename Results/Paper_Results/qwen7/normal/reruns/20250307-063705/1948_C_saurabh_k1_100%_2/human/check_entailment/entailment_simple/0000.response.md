### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves determining if a robot starting at (1,1) can reach (2,n) by moving according to the directions specified in the grid. The grid has arrows pointing either left ('<') or right ('>'). The robot must follow these arrows while moving within the grid boundaries.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`).
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions `n` and the two rows of the grid (`a` and `b`).
   - It then iterates over every other column index (`i`) starting from 1 to `n-1` with a step of 2.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if the robot can move from the current column to the next or previous column based on the arrow directions. Specifically, it checks if the arrow in the current column of the first row (`a[i]`) and the arrow in the corresponding column of the second row (`b[i+1]` or `b[i-1]`) both point left ('<').
   - If such a condition is found, the robot cannot reach (2,n), and the program immediately prints 'No' and breaks out of the loop.
   - If no such condition is found, the loop completes, and the program prints 'Yes'.

3. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The constraints ensure that `n` is even, which simplifies the logic since we only need to check every other column.
   - The additional constraints on the input ensure that the arrows do not point outside the grid, so the logic does not need to handle boundary conditions explicitly.

4. **Correctness**:
   - The logic correctly identifies scenarios where the robot cannot reach (2,n) by checking the arrow directions.
   - The loop structure ensures that the program only prints 'No' when a direct path blockage is identified.
   - The final 'Yes' is correctly printed if no such blockage is found.

### Conclusion:
The given code correctly implements the logic to determine if the robot can reach (2,n) based on the arrow directions provided in the grid. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
