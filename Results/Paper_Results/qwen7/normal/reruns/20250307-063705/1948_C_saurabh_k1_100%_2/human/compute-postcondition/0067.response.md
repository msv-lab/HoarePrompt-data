Output State: The loop completes all its iterations without breaking, and prints 'yes'. This means that for all odd indices `i` (where `1 â‰¤ i < n`) in the list `a`, the condition `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` was never met. The final value of `i` will be `n - 1` (since the loop increments `i` by 2 each time, starting from 1), and the output will be 'yes'. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain as they were after the last iteration of the loop.
