Postcondition: **`i` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of characters, `b` is a list of characters. The current value of `i + 1` is less than `n` and either the current value of `a[i]` is '<' and the current value of `b[i + 1]` is '<', or the current value of `a[i]` is '<' and the current value of `b[i - 1]` is '<'.**
