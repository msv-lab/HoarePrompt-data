You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
                print('No')
                break
        else:
            print('yes')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5 and n is even; each test case consists of two strings of length n, where each character in the strings is either '<' or '>', representing the direction of the arrow in each cell of the respective row of the grid.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
                print('No')
                break
        else:
            print('yes')
        
    #State: Output State: The loop completes all its iterations without breaking, and prints 'yes'. This means that for all odd indices `i` (where `1 ≤ i < n`) in the list `a`, the condition `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` was never met. The final value of `i` will be `n - 1` (since the loop increments `i` by 2 each time, starting from 1), and the output will be 'yes'. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain as they were after the last iteration of the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
1. The given program attempts to solve the problem by checking if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) under certain conditions.
2. The program iterates through every second column (i.e., columns with indices 1, 3, 5, etc.) and checks if the robot can be blocked from reaching the last column (n) due to the arrows' directions.
3. Specifically, the program checks if:
   - In the current column `i`, the arrow points left (`<`).
   - In the next column `i+1`, the arrow also points left (`<`), which would prevent the robot from moving right.
   - Or if in the previous column `i-1`, the arrow points left (`<`), which would prevent the robot from moving right.
4. If such a condition is found, the program immediately prints 'No' and breaks out of the loop, indicating that the robot cannot reach the last column.
5. If no such blocking condition is found, the program prints 'yes', indicating that the robot can potentially reach the last column.
6. However, this approach is flawed because it only checks a subset of conditions and does not fully account for all possible paths the robot can take.
7. The program fails to consider other scenarios where the robot might navigate through the grid correctly, especially when arrows point in a way that allows the robot to move around obstacles.
8. The program does not handle cases where the robot can navigate through the grid by moving up and down between rows, which is a critical part of the problem.

Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) based on the problem description. It only partially checks for certain blocking conditions and misses other valid paths the robot can take.
