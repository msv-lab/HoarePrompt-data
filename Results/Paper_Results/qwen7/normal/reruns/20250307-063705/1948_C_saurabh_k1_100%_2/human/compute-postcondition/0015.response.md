Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State Analysis
- The loop starts with `i` being `i_prev + 2`.
- `n` remains the same as `n_prev`.
- The condition for breaking out of the loop is `if i + 1 < n` and either `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`.

### Loop Head Variables
- The loop variable `i` is incremented by 2 each time, starting from `i_prev + 2`.
- The loop runs as long as `i + 1 < n`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Initial Values**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `i_prev + 2`, `n` is `n_prev`.
2. **Loop Condition**: For the loop to continue, `i + 1 < n` must be true.
3. **Increment**: The loop increments `i` by 2, so the new value of `i` will be `(i_prev + 2) + 2 = i_prev + 4`.
4. **Check for Break Condition**: The break condition checks if `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`. This condition does not affect the loop counter but affects whether the loop breaks.

### Adjusting States
- The only variable that changes within the loop head is `i`.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- The break condition does not change the state of `i` or `n`.

### New State
- `i` will be `i_prev + 4`.
- `n` remains `n_prev`.

### Final Answer
State: **`i` is `i_prev + 4`, `n` is `n_prev`**
