Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two strings of length n (where n is an even integer between 2 and 200,000), containing characters '<' or '>'. For each test case, it checks if for any odd index i (1 â‰¤ i < n), the conditions a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<' are met. If such a condition is found, it immediately prints 'No' and stops processing further. If no such condition is found after checking all possible indices, it prints 'Yes'. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.**
