Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    for i in range(1, n, 2):
        if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
            print('No')
            break
    else:
        print('yes')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: The loop will continue to iterate as long as `i + 1 < n` and the condition `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` is not met for any `i` in the range specified by the loop. Since the loop increments `i` by 2 each iteration, it will check every odd index in the list `a` up to `n-1`.

If the loop completes all its iterations without finding any index `i` that satisfies the condition, it will print 'yes'. Otherwise, if the condition is met at any point during the loop, it will print 'No' and break out of the loop.

Given that the loop has executed 3 times, the final value of `i` will be `i_prev + 4`. The variable `n` remains unchanged, and the lists `a` and `b` also remain unchanged unless the loop breaks due to the condition being met.

If the loop does not break, the final output state will be:
Output State: `i` is `i_prev + 4`, `n` is `n_prev`, `a` is a list of characters, `b` is a list of characters, and the output will be 'yes'.

If the loop breaks because the condition is met at some point, the final output state will be:
Output State: `i` is `i_prev + 4`, `n` is `n_prev`, `a` is a list of characters, `b` is a list of characters, and the output will be 'No'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is 2, i is 2*n-1, a is a string input by the user, b is a string input by the user.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The loop completes all its iterations without breaking, and prints 'yes'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
