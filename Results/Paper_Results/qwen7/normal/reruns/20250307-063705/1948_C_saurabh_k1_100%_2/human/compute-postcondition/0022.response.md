Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is controlled by the variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable in Python when the loop is just iterating a certain number of times). However, the loop itself depends on the variable `t`, which represents the number of iterations.

2. **Determine the current state**: The loop will continue to iterate as long as `t > 0`. Given that the loop has already executed 3 times, `t` must have been decremented by 3.

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0. Since the loop has already executed 3 times, `t` is now `t_prev - 3`.

4. **State modification**: We need to adjust the state to reflect that the loop will execute one more time if `t_prev - 3 > 0`.

Given the above reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `t` is `t_prev - 3`**

Since the loop body is omitted, no other variables (`i`, `n`, `a`, `b`) need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time. The loop will continue to decrement `t` until it reaches 0, at which point the loop will terminate.

So, the final answer is:

**State: `t` is `t_prev - 3`**
