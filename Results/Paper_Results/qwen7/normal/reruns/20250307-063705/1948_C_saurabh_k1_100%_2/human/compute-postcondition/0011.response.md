Output: **No**

Explanation:
- `i` is defined as `i_prev + 2`. This means that `i` is the value of `i_prev` plus 2.
- `n` is defined as `n_prev`. This means that `n` retains the value of `n_prev`.

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'No'`. Since no variables or objects are referenced within the `print` statement itself, only the string `'No'` is printed.
