Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is an integer.
- `n` is an integer.
- `a` is a list of characters.
- `b` is a list of characters.
- The condition `i + 1 < n` is true.
- Either of the following conditions is true:
  - `a[i] == '<'` and `b[i + 1] == '<'`
  - `a[i] == '<'` and `b[i - 1] == '<'`

The code snippet to execute is:
```python
print('No')
```

Given the conditions, regardless of the values of `a[i]`, `b[i + 1]`, and `b[i - 1]`, the print statement will simply output the string `'No'`.

Output: **No**
