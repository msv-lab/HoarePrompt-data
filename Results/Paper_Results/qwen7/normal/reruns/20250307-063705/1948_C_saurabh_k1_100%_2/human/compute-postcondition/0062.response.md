Output State: **`t` is 1, `i` is the next odd number (i.e., `i + 2`), `n` must be at least 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `t`, `i`, and `n`. It only indicates that we exit the innermost loop or conditional block we are currently inside. Since no other operations are performed on these variables within the given code snippet, their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
