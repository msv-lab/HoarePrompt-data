Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- **State at the end of the previous iteration:**
  - `t` is 2
  - `i` is \(2 \times n - 1\)
  - `a` is a string input by the user
  - `b` is a string input by the user

- **For Loop Statement:**
  ```python
  for _ in range(t):
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable `_` is used, but it does not affect the state of any other variables.
   - The loop itself depends on the value of `t`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs for `t` iterations.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is 2.

3. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `t` is 2, the loop will run for 2 iterations.
   - After the first iteration, `t` will be decremented by 1.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `t` should be 1.

### Updated State:
- `t` is now 1 (decremented from 2).
- `i` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- `a` and `b` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.

### Final Answer:
State: **`t` is 1, `i` is \(2 \times n - 1\), `a` is a string input by the user, `b` is a string input by the user**
