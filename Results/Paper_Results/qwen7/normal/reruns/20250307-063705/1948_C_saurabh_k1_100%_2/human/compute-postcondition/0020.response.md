Output State: The loop will continue to iterate as long as `i` (which starts from 1 and increments by 2 each iteration) is less than `n`. After all iterations, if the loop completes without breaking (i.e., no condition `a[i] == '<' and (b[i + 1] == '<' or b[i - 1] == '<')` is met for any `i`), the final output will be 'yes'. If any such condition is met at any point during the loop, the loop will break and 'No' will be printed immediately, ending the loop early.

In summary, the final output state will be:
- `i` will be the largest odd number less than `n`.
- `n` will remain unchanged.
- `a` will remain unchanged.
- `b` will remain unchanged.
- The final output will be 'yes' unless the loop breaks due to the specified condition, in which case the output will be 'No'.

If the loop completes without breaking, the output state will be: **Output State: The final value of `i` is the largest odd number less than `n`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged, and the output is 'yes'.**
