Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, after executing the code, `t` retains this property and is now an input integer within the specified range. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this line of code.
