Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by checking a specific condition for each odd-indexed column (1-based indexing) in the grid. However, this approach is flawed because it only checks for a few specific scenarios where the robot might get stuck and does not consider the full path the robot can take through the grid.

The program's logic is as follows:
- It iterates through every other column (i.e., columns at odd positions).
- For each such column, it checks if moving down and then left (a[i] == b[i+1] == '<') or moving down and then right (a[i] == b[i-1] == '<') would lead to a situation where the robot cannot proceed.
- If such a condition is found, it immediately prints 'No' and breaks out of the loop.
- If no such condition is found, it prints 'Yes'.

This logic is incomplete because:
- It only considers certain specific sequences of movements.
- It does not account for all possible paths the robot can take through the grid.
- It does not ensure that the robot can reach the target cell (2, n).

Given the problem's complexity and the need to check all possible paths, the provided solution is insufficient and incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
