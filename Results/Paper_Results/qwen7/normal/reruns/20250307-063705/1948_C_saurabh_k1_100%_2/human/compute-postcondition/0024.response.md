Output State: **`t` is 2, `i` is 4, `a` is a list of characters, `b` is a list of characters, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. This updates the value of `n` to the integer input provided by the user. The values of `t`, `i`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their previous state, as they are not affected by this line of code.
