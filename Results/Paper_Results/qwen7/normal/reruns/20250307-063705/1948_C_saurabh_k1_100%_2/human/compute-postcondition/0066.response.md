Output State: The loop completes all its iterations without breaking, and prints 'yes'. This means that for all odd indices `i` (where `1 â‰¤ i < n`) in the list `a`, the condition `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` was never met. Therefore, the final output will be 'yes', indicating that no such index `i` was found where the given condition holds true across the entire range of the loop.
