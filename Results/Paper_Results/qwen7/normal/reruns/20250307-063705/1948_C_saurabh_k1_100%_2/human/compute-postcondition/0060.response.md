Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over `i` starting from 1 up to `n-1` with a step of 2. This means `i` takes on odd values.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is 1.
   - `i` is the next odd number after the previous value of `i`.
   - `n` must be at least 2.
   - There is a condition that if `(i + 1 < n and a[i] == '<' and b[i + 1] == '<')` or `(a[i] == '<' and b[i - 1] == '<')` is true, the loop breaks.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 2, the next value of `i` would be the next odd number after the previous value.
   - `n` must remain at least 2 for the loop to continue.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `i` becomes the next odd number after the previous value.
   - `n` remains at least 2.

Given the previous state where `i` was the next odd number after the previous value and considering the loop increments `i` by 2, the next value of `i` would be `i + 2`.

Therefore, the updated state for the next iteration is:

**State: **`t` is 1, `i` is the next odd number (i.e., `i + 2`), `n` must be at least 2**.
