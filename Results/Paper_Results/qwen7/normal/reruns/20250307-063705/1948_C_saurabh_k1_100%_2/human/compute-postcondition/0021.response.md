Output State: The loop will continue to iterate as long as `i + 1 < n` and the condition `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` is not met for any `i` in the range specified by the loop. Since the loop increments `i` by 2 each iteration, it will check every odd index in the list `a` up to `n-1`.

If the loop completes all its iterations without finding any index `i` that satisfies the condition, it will print 'yes'. Otherwise, if the condition is met at any point during the loop, it will print 'No' and break out of the loop.

Given that the loop has executed 3 times, the final value of `i` will be `i_prev + 4`. The variable `n` remains unchanged, and the lists `a` and `b` also remain unchanged unless the loop breaks due to the condition being met.

If the loop does not break, the final output state will be:
Output State: `i` is `i_prev + 4`, `n` is `n_prev`, `a` is a list of characters, `b` is a list of characters, and the output will be 'yes'.

If the loop breaks because the condition is met at some point, the final output state will be:
Output State: `i` is `i_prev + 4`, `n` is `n_prev`, `a` is a list of characters, `b` is a list of characters, and the output will be 'No'.
