Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1` with a step of 2. This means `i` takes on odd values starting from 1 up to `n-1`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `t` is 1 (this variable is not directly involved in the loop condition).
   - `i` is an odd number less than or equal to `n-1`.
   - `n` must be at least 2.
   - Either `(i + 1 < n and a[i] == '<' and b[i + 1] == '<')` or `(a[i] == '<' and b[i - 1] == '<')` must be true.

4. **Determine the Next Value of `i`**:
   - Since `i` is an odd number and the loop increments by 2, the next value of `i` would be the next odd number after the current `i`.

5. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - `i` must be the next odd number after the current `i`.
   - `n` must still be at least 2.
   - The condition involving `a` and `b` must still hold for the new value of `i`.

Given these points, let's adjust the state:

- If the current `i` is `k` (an odd number), the next `i` will be `k + 2` (the next odd number).
- `n` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
- The condition involving `a` and `b` must still hold for the new value of `i`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` is 1, `i` is the next odd number (i.e., `i + 2`), `n` must be at least 2, and either `(i + 1 < n and a[i] == '<' and b[i + 1] == '<')` or `(a[i] == '<' and b[i - 1] == '<')` must be true.**
