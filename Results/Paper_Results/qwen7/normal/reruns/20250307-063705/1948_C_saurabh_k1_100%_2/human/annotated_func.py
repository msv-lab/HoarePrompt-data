#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5 and n is even; each test case consists of two strings of length n, where each character in the strings is either '<' or '>', representing the direction of the arrow in each cell of the respective row of the grid.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
                print('No')
                break
        else:
            print('yes')
        
    #State: Output State: The loop completes all its iterations without breaking, and prints 'yes'. This means that for all odd indices `i` (where `1 ≤ i < n`) in the list `a`, the condition `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` was never met. The final value of `i` will be `n - 1` (since the loop increments `i` by 2 each time, starting from 1), and the output will be 'yes'. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain as they were after the last iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two strings of length n (where n is an even integer between 2 and 200,000), containing characters '<' or '>'. For each test case, it checks if for any odd index i (1 ≤ i < n), the conditions a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<' are met. If such a condition is found, it immediately prints 'No' and stops processing further. If no such condition is found after checking all possible indices, it prints 'Yes'. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.
