Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(1, n, 2):`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to 4.
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i < n`. Given that `i` starts at 4, `n` must be greater than 4 for the loop to execute.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `i` is already set to 4, no adjustment is needed for `i`.
   - `n` must be greater than 4 for the loop to start executing.

5. **Consider the other variables**:
   - `t` (which is 2) and `a` (which is a string input by the user) and `b` (which is another string input by the user) are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` must be greater than 4.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is 2, `i` is 4, `a` is a string input by the user, `b` is a string input by the user, `n` must be greater than 4**
