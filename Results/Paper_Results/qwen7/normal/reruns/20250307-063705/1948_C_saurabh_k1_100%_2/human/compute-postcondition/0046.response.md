Output State: **`t` is 1, `i` is \(2 \times n - 1\), `a` is a string input by the user, `b` is a string input by the user, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. The values of `t`, `i`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial states.
