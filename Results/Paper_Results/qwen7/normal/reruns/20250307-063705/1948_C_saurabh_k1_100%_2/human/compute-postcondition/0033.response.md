Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the condition `range(1, n, 2)`. This means `i` starts from 1 and increments by 2 until it is no longer less than `n`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `t` is 2
   - `i` is 4
   - `a` is a string input by the user
   - `b` is a string input by the user

3. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop continues as long as `i + 1 < n` and either `a[i]` is `<` and `b[i + 1]` is `<`, or `a[i]` is `<` and `b[i - 1]` is `<`.

4. **Determine the Next Value of `i`**:
   - Since `i` is currently 4, the next value of `i` would be 6 (if `n` allows it).

5. **Check the Condition for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i + 1` should be less than `n`.
   - Given `i` is 4, `i + 1` is 5. Therefore, `5 < n` must hold true.

6. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` needs to be set to 6.
   - `n` must be greater than 5 to allow the loop to continue.

7. **Maintain Other States**:
   - `t` remains 2.
   - `a` and `b` remain unchanged as they are not involved in the loop condition.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is 2, `i` is 6, `a` is a string input by the user, `b` is a string input by the user, `n` must be greater than 5**
