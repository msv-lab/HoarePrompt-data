Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is 2
- `i` is 4
- `a` is a string input by the user
- `b` is a string input by the user
- The value of `n` is greater than 4
- Either `(i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<')` or `(a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<')` is true

The `print('No')` statement will simply print the string 'No'.

Output: **No**
