Output State: **The loop completes all its iterations without breaking, and prints 'yes'.**

Explanation: The loop runs for as many times as there are odd numbers in the range from 1 to `n-1` with a step of 2. After executing the loop for all these iterations, none of the conditions inside the loop (`a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`) were met to cause a break. Therefore, the `else` block executes, printing 'yes'. The variables `t`, `i`, and `n` retain their final values from the last iteration, but the key point is that the loop completed successfully without any breaks, leading to the 'yes' output.
