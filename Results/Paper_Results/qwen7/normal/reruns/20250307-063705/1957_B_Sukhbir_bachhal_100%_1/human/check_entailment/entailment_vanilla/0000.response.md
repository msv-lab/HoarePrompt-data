Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires constructing a sequence of `n` non-negative integers such that their sum equals `k`, and the bitwise OR of these integers has the maximum number of 1s in its binary representation.

2. **Edge Case Handling**: The program correctly handles the edge case when `n = 1`. In this case, it simply prints `k` because there's only one number in the sequence, and it must equal `k`.

3. **General Case Handling**: For `n > 1`, the program aims to maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of the sequence. Hereâ€™s how it works:
   - It calls `func_1(k)` to find the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`.
   - It appends `2 ** counter - 1` to the array `arr`. This value has all bits set to 1 up to the `counter`-th bit.
   - It then appends `k - (2 ** counter - 1)` to ensure the sum of the sequence equals `k`.
   - Finally, it appends `n - 2` zeros to complete the sequence of length `n`.

4. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly finds the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `k` by right-shifting `k` until it becomes zero and counting the shifts.

5. **Test Cases**:
   - For `n = 1` and `k = 5`, the output should be `5`, which is correct.
   - For `n = 2` and `k = 3`, the output should be `1 2`, which is correct because `1 | 2 = 3` and both numbers sum to 3.
   - For `n = 2` and `k = 5`, the output should be `5 0`, which is correct because `5 | 0 = 5` and both numbers sum to 5.
   - For `n = 6` and `k = 51`, the output should be `3 1 1 32 2 12`, which is correct because `3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = 37` and the sum is 51. The binary representation of `37` is `100101`, which has five 1s, maximizing the number of 1s in the bitwise OR.

6. **Correctness Verification**: The logic in the program matches the problem requirements and handles all given examples correctly.

Correctness: **True**
