### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires constructing a sequence of \( n \) non-negative integers such that their sum equals \( k \), and the bitwise OR of these integers has the maximum number of 1s in its binary representation.

2. **Edge Case Handling**: The program correctly handles the edge case when \( n = 1 \). In this case, it simply prints \( k \) because there's only one number in the sequence, and it must equal \( k \).

3. **General Case Handling**: For \( n > 1 \), the program aims to maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of the sequence. Hereâ€™s how it works:
   - It calls `func_1(k)` to find the highest power of 2 less than or equal to \( k \).
   - It appends \( 2^{counter} - 1 \) to the array `arr`. This value has all bits set to 1 up to the \( counter \)-th bit.
   - It then appends \( k - (2^{counter} - 1) \) to ensure the sum of the sequence equals \( k \).
   - Finally, it appends \( n - 2 \) zeros to complete the sequence of length \( n \).

4. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly finds the highest power of 2 less than or equal to \( k \) by right-shifting \( k \) until it becomes zero and counting the shifts. However, there is a small issue with the function. The function should return the position of the highest set bit minus one, but it incorrectly returns \( position - 1 \) instead of \( position \).

5. **Test Cases**:
   - For \( n = 1 \) and \( k = 5 \), the output should be `5`, which is correct.
   - For \( n = 2 \) and \( k = 3 \), the output should be `1 2`, which is correct because `1 | 2 = 3` and both numbers sum to 3.
   - For \( n = 2 \) and \( k = 5 \), the output should be `5 0`, which is correct because `5 | 0 = 5` and both numbers sum to 5.
   - For \( n = 6 \) and \( k = 51 \), the output should be `3 1 1 32 2 12`, which is incorrect. The correct sequence should be `3 1 1 32 2 12` but the program outputs `3 1 1 32 2 12` which is correct in terms of sum and bitwise OR, but the function `func_1` returns `-1` for `k = 51`, leading to an incorrect sequence.

6. **Correctness Verification**: The logic in the program matches the problem requirements and handles all given examples correctly except for the function `func_1`. The function `func_1` should return the correct position of the highest set bit, not `-1`.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is **inaccurate** because the function `func_1` returns `-1` for some values of \( k \), leading to incorrect sequences. The correct function should return the position of the highest set bit.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
