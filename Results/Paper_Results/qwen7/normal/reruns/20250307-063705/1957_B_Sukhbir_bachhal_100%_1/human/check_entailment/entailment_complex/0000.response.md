Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires constructing a sequence of \( n \) non-negative integers such that their sum equals \( k \) and the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR is maximized.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program correctly handles the input by reading the number of test cases \( t \) and processing each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( k \).
   - If \( n > 1 \), it calls the function `func_1(k)` to determine the highest power of 2 less than \( k \).
   - It then constructs the array `arr` with the following elements:
     - The first element is \( 2^{\text{counter}} - 1 \), which is a number with all bits set to 1 up to the \( \text{counter} \)-th bit.
     - The second element is \( k - (2^{\text{counter}} - 1) \).
     - The remaining elements are zeros.
   - If \( n = 1 \), it simply prints \( k \).

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly calculates the position of the highest bit set to 1 in the binary representation of \( k \).
   - It uses a loop to right-shift \( k \) until it becomes 0, counting the number of shifts.
   - If \( k \) is 0 initially, it returns -1.
   - Otherwise, it returns \( 31 \) because it takes 32 iterations to reduce any non-zero 32-bit integer to 0, and thus the highest bit position is 31.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program logic is sound and follows the requirements of the problem.
   - The function `func_1` correctly identifies the highest bit position.
   - The constructed array `arr` ensures the sum is \( k \) and maximizes the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of the elements.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
