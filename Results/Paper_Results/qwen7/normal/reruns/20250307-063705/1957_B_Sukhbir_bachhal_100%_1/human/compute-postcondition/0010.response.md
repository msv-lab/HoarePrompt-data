Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `n != 0`.
2. **Determine the current state**: 
   - `position` is 2.
   - `n` is the value of `n` right-shifted by 1.
3. **Understand the loop head variables**: The only variable in the loop head is `n`.
4. **Check the current value of `n`**: Since `n` is the value of `n` right-shifted by 1, this means `n` has been divided by 2 (if `n` was an integer). For the loop to continue, `n` must still be non-zero.

Given that `n` is right-shifted by 1, the new value of `n` is effectively `n / 2`. To ensure the loop continues, `n / 2` must be non-zero. This implies that `n` itself must have been non-zero before the right shift.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `n` must be non-zero before the right shift.

**State**: **`position` is 2; `n` must be non-zero**
