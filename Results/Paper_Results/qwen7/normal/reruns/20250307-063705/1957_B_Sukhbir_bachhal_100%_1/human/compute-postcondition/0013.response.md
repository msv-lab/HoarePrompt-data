Output State: **`position` is 3, `n` is `n` right-shifted by 1 bit.**

Explanation: The initial state is `position` is 2, and `n` is `n` right-shifted by 1 bit. The code `position += 1` increments the value of `position` by 1. Therefore, `position` becomes 3. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. Thus, `n` is still `n` right-shifted by 1 bit.
