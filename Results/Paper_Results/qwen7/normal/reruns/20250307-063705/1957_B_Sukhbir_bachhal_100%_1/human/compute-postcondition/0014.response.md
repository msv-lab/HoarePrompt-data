Output State: The final value of `position` will be equal to the number of bits in the binary representation of `n`, and `n` will be 0.

Explanation: The loop continues to right-shift `n` by 1 bit and increment `position` until `n` becomes 0. Therefore, `position` will count the number of bits in the binary representation of `n`. Once all bits have been shifted out, `n` will be 0 and the loop will terminate.
