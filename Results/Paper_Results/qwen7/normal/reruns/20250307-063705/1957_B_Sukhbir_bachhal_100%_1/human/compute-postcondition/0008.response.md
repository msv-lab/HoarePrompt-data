Output State: **`position` is 1; `n` is the value of `n` right-shifted by 1.**

The code `n >>= 1` performs a bitwise right shift operation on `n` by 1 bit. This means that all bits in the binary representation of `n` are shifted one position to the right, and the least significant bit is discarded. The value of `position` remains unchanged as it was initially set to 1 and no operation was performed on it. The precondition that `n` must be non-zero after the right shift is satisfied as long as `n` was non-zero before the operation.
