### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n` and `k`.

2. **Single Element Case**:
   - If `n > 1`, the program proceeds to calculate the required sequence.
   - If `n == 1`, the program directly prints `k`.

3. **Sequence Construction**:
   - For `n > 1`, the program calls `func_1(k)` to find the highest power of 2 less than `k` (which is `2^counter - 1`).
   - It then appends this value to `arr` and subtracts it from `k`.
   - The remaining elements in `arr` are set to 0 to ensure the sum equals `k`.

4. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly determines the highest power of 2 less than `k` by counting the number of bits needed to represent `k-1` in binary.
   - It returns `position - 1`, which is the highest power of 2 less than `k`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The solution handles the edge case when `n == 1` by simply printing `k`.
   - The solution also handles the case where `k` itself is a power of 2, ensuring the bitwise OR condition is met.

6. **Binary Representation**:
   - By using the highest power of 2 less than `k` and setting the rest to 0, the program ensures the bitwise OR of the sequence is maximized.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the logic to generate a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum to `k` and maximize the number of 1s in their bitwise OR. The function `func_1` correctly identifies the highest power of 2 less than `k`, and the main program constructs the sequence accordingly.

### Correctness:
**True**
