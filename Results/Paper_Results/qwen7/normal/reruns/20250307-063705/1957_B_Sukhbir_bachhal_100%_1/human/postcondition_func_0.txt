The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5. It performs a series of right shifts on `n` until it becomes zero, counting the number of shifts. If `n` is zero initially, the function returns -1. Otherwise, it returns 31, indicating that it took 32 iterations to reduce `n` to zero, which is the maximum number of bits in a 32-bit integer.
