### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step to determine if it correctly handles all cases according to the problem description.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - It then reads `n` and `k` for each test case.

2. **Case Analysis:**
   - If `n > 1`, the program calculates the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `k` using `func_1(k)`.
   - It appends `2 ** counter - 1` (a number with all bits set to 1 up to the highest power of 2) and `k - (2 ** counter - 1)` to the array `arr`.
   - It then fills the rest of the array with zeros to make it of length `n`.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function correctly calculates the position of the highest set bit in `k` by right-shifting `k` until it becomes zero.
   - It returns `position - 1`, which is the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - When `n == 1`, the program simply prints `k`, which is correct because the bitwise OR of a single number is the number itself.
   - However, the original assessment claims that the program does not handle the case where `k < n`. Let's verify this claim.

#### Verification of Edge Case Handling:

- **Case where `k < n`:**
  - Consider the input:
    ```
    2 3
    ```
  - The program will execute the following logic:
    - `counter = func_1(3) = 1` (since `3` in binary is `11`, the highest power of 2 is `2^1 = 2`).
    - `arr` will be `[2 - 1, 3 - (2 - 1)] = [1, 2]`.
    - The output is `1 2`, which is correct because `1 | 2 = 3` (binary `11`), and there are no other ways to distribute `3` among `2` numbers to get more 1s in the bitwise OR result.

- **General Case:**
  - For any `k` and `n` where `k >= n`, the program will still work correctly. The strategy of using `(2 ** counter - 1)` and distributing the remaining value ensures that the bitwise OR result is maximized.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly handles all edge cases and general cases as per the problem description. The original assessment was incorrect in stating that the program does not handle the case where `k < n`. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**
