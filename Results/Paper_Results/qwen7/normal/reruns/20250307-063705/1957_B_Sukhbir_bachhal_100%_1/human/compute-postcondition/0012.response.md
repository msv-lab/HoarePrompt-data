Output State: **`position` is 2, `n` is `n` right-shifted by 1 bit.**

Explanation: The bitwise right shift operator (`>>=`) shifts the bits of `n` to the right by 1 position. This operation does not affect the value of `position`. The exact value of `n` after the shift depends on its original binary representation, but the general form is that `n` is shifted right by one bit.
