You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    arr = []
    if n > 1:
        counter = func_1(k)
        arr.append(2 ** counter - 1)
        arr.append(k - arr[-1])
        for _ in range(n - 2):
            arr.append(0)
        print(*arr)
    else:
        print(k)

def func_1(n):
    if n == 0:
        return -1
    position = 0
    while n != 0:
        n >>= 1
        position += 1
    return position - 1



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    arr = []
    if n > 1:
        counter = func_1(k)
        arr.append(2 ** counter - 1)
        arr.append(k - arr[-1])
        for _ in range(n - 2):
            arr.append(0)
        print(*arr)
    else:
        print(k)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n and k are integers satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. The sum of all n values across test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
def func_1(n):
    if (n == 0) :
        return -1
        #The program returns -1
    #State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n and k are integers satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. The sum of all n values across test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5. Additionally, n is not equal to 0.
    position = 0
    while n != 0:
        n >>= 1
        
        position += 1
        
    #State: Output State: The final position is 32, and n is 0.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop continues to right-shift `n` by 1 bit and increment `position` until `n` becomes 0. Since each iteration halves the value of `n` (in terms of its binary representation), it takes 32 iterations for a 32-bit integer starting from `2^32 - 1` (or any non-zero value) to become 0. After 32 iterations, `position` will be 32, and `n` will be 0.
    return position - 1
    #The program returns 31



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires constructing a sequence of `n` non-negative integers such that their sum equals `k`, and the bitwise OR of these integers has the maximum number of 1s in its binary representation.

2. **Edge Case Handling**: The program correctly handles the edge case when `n = 1`. In this case, it simply prints `k` because there's only one number in the sequence, and it must equal `k`.

3. **General Case Handling**: For `n > 1`, the program aims to maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of the sequence. Here’s how it works:
   - It calls `func_1(k)` to find the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`.
   - It appends `2 ** counter - 1` to the array `arr`. This value has all bits set to 1 up to the `counter`-th bit.
   - It then appends `k - (2 ** counter - 1)` to ensure the sum of the sequence equals `k`.
   - Finally, it appends `n - 2` zeros to complete the sequence of length `n`.

4. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly finds the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `k` by right-shifting `k` until it becomes zero and counting the shifts.

5. **Test Cases**:
   - For `n = 1` and `k = 5`, the output should be `5`, which is correct.
   - For `n = 2` and `k = 3`, the output should be `1 2`, which is correct because `1 | 2 = 3` and both numbers sum to 3.
   - For `n = 2` and `k = 5`, the output should be `5 0`, which is correct because `5 | 0 = 5` and both numbers sum to 5.
   - For `n = 6` and `k = 51`, the output should be `3 1 1 32 2 12`, which is correct because `3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = 37` and the sum is 51. The binary representation of `37` is `100101`, which has five 1s, maximizing the number of 1s in the bitwise OR.

6. **Correctness Verification**: The logic in the program matches the problem requirements and handles all given examples correctly.
