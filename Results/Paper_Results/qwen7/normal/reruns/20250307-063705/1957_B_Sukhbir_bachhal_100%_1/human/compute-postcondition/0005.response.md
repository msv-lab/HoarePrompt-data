Output State: **`position` is 0, `n` is `n` right-shifted by 1.**

The code `n >>= 1` performs a bitwise right shift operation on `n` by 1 bit. This means that all bits in the binary representation of `n` are shifted one position to the right, and the least significant bit is discarded. The value of `position` remains unchanged at 0. Since the exact value of `n` is not specified, it is represented as `n` right-shifted by 1.
