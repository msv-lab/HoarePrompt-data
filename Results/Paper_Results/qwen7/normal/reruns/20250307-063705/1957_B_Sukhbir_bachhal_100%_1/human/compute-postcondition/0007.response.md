The loop condition is `n != 0`. This means the loop will continue to execute as long as `n` is not zero. At the end of the previous iteration, `position` is 1, and `n` is `n` right-shifted by 1.

To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to consider the current state of `n`. Since `n` is right-shifted by 1, it means `n` has lost its least significant bit. For the loop to continue, `n` must still be non-zero.

Given that `n` is right-shifted by 1, the new value of `n` is effectively `n // 2` (integer division by 2). For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must still be non-zero after this operation.

Since the loop head only involves `n`, we need to ensure that `n` is non-zero after the right shift. The previous state shows that `n` was right-shifted, but we don't know its exact initial value. However, since the loop continues as long as `n` is non-zero, we need to ensure that the right-shifted value of `n` is still non-zero.

Therefore, the state of `n` must be such that after the right shift, `n` is still non-zero.

State: **`position` is 1, `n` must be non-zero after right-shifting by 1**
