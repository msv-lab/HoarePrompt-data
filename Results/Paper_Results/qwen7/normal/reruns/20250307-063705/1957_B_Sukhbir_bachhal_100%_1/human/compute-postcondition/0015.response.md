Output State: The final position is 32, and n is 0.

Explanation: The loop continues to right-shift `n` by 1 bit and increment `position` until `n` becomes 0. Since each iteration halves the value of `n` (in terms of its binary representation), it takes 32 iterations for a 32-bit integer starting from `2^32 - 1` (or any non-zero value) to become 0. After 32 iterations, `position` will be 32, and `n` will be 0.
