Output State: **`good_subarrays` is 0, `a` is a list of integers with length n, `b` is a list of integers with length m, `b_freq` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each element in `b`, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m, `window_freq` is a Counter object containing the frequency of elements in the first m elements of list `a`, `matches` is the sum of the minimum values between the frequencies of elements in `window_freq` and `b_freq` for all elements that exist in both counters.**

Explanation: The code calculates the number of matches (`matches`) by summing the minimum frequencies of elements that exist in both `window_freq` and `b_freq`. This value is stored in the variable `matches`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
