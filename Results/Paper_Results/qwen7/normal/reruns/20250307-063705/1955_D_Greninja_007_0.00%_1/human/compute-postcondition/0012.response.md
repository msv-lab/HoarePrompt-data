Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than `m`, and if the current value of `matches` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `good_subarrays` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `good_subarrays` remains unchanged. If `a[i]` is in `b_freq`, then `matches` is decreased by `min(window_freq[a[i]], b_freq[a[i]])`.
