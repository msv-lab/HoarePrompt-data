Output State: **`good_subarrays` is 0, `a` is a list of integers with length n, `b` is a list of integers with length m, `b_freq` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each element in `b`, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m, `window_freq` is a Counter object containing the frequency of elements in the first m elements of list `a`.**

Explanation: The code creates a new Counter object named `window_freq` which contains the frequency of each element in the first `m` elements of list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
