Output State: **`i` is 0; `n` must be greater than `m`; `matches` is decreased by `min(window_freq[a[i]], b_freq[a[i]])`; if the current value of `matches` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `good_subarrays` is incremented by 1; the current value of `a[i]` is in `b_freq`.**

This means that the value of `i` remains unchanged at 0, `n` must still be greater than `m`, `matches` is reduced by the minimum of `window_freq[a[i]]` and `b_freq[a[i]]`, and if `matches` is still greater than or equal to `k`, `good_subarrays` is incremented. The condition that the current value of `a[i]` is present in `b_freq` also remains true.
