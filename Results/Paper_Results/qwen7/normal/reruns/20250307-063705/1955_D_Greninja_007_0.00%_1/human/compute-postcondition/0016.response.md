Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than `m`, `good_subarrays` is incremented by 1 if the current value of `matches` is greater than or equal to `k` and `a[i]` is in `b_freq`, otherwise `good_subarrays` remains unchanged, `matches` is decreased by `min(window_freq[a[i]], b_freq[a[i]])`, `window_freq[a[i]]` is decremented by 1, and the current value of `window_freq[a[i]]` is 0.
