Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than `m`, the current value of `matches` is greater than or equal to `k`, `good_subarrays` is incremented by 1.**

The code `good_subarrays += 1` increments the value of `good_subarrays` by 1. Since no specific value was provided for `good_subarrays`, it is simply incremented without a specific starting value mentioned. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `m`, `matches`, and `k`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
