Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, sys.recursionlimit` is set to 10 ** 6**.

The code `sys.setrecursionlimit(10 ** 6)` sets the recursion limit to \(10^6\). This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `u`, `v`, or `w`. Therefore, the only change is to the recursion limit, which is now set to \(10^6\). All other variables remain in their initial state.
