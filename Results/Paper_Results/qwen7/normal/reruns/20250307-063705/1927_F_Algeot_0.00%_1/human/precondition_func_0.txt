t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ min(⌊n⋅(n-1)/2⌋, 2⋅10^5), and there are m lines describing the edges of the graph, each containing three integers u, v, and w representing an edge between vertices u and v with weight w (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v, 1 ≤ w ≤ 10^6).
