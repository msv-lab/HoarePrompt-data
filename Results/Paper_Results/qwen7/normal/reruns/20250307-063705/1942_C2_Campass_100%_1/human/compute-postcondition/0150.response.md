Output State: `t` is `False`, `y` is `-2`, `sx` is `-10`, `cons` is `1`.

Explanation: The loop continues to decrement `t` until it reaches `False`. After the loop executes all its iterations, `t` will no longer be truthy, so `t` becomes `False`. The variable `y` decreases by the integer division of each element in `val` by 2 for every iteration, and based on the given outputs, it ends up being `-2`. The variable `sx` accumulates the sum of all elements in `val` plus twice the minimum of `y` and `c` for each element minus `c`, resulting in `-10`. Finally, `cons` is calculated as `x + sx - 2`, which is given as `1` after the third iteration and remains the same for subsequent iterations since `t` is `False` and the loop does not execute further.
