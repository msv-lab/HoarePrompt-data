Output State: **`i` is the second element of the list `val`, `c` is `i` // 2, `sx` is updated by adding `i` to its current value, and `y` is decreased by `i // 2`.**

Explanation: The code `sx += i` adds the value of `i` to `sx`. The value of `i` is the second element of the list `val`, so `sx` is updated by adding `i` to its current value. The values of `c` and `y` remain unchanged from their previous states. The condition `if y < c` is not directly affected by this line of code, but it is mentioned in the initial state, so it remains part of the precondition.
