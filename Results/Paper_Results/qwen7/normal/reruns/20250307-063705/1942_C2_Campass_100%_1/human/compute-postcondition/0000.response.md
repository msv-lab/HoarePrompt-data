Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `R` is a lambda function that returns a tuple of integers obtained from splitting the input and mapping them to integers.**

The code defines a lambda function `R` which takes input from the user, splits it into multiple parts, and converts those parts into integers. This function does not assign values to any variables but prepares to read input data in the subsequent lines of the code. Therefore, the only updated information is the definition of the lambda function `R`. The precondition regarding `t`, `n`, `x`, and `y` remains unchanged.
