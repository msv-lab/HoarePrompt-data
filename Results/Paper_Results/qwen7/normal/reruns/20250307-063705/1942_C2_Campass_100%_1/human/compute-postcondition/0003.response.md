Output State: **`t` is a specific integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1 (inclusive)**

Explanation: The initial state of `t` is a specific integer between 1 and \(10^4\) (inclusive). After executing `t -= 1`, `t` is decremented by 1. Therefore, `t` now becomes a specific integer between 0 and \(10^4 - 1\) (inclusive).
