Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each containing integers n, x, and y, followed by x distinct integers from 1 to n. It calculates and prints a value `cons` based on the given inputs and the sorted differences between consecutive elements in the list of x distinct integers. The final output is determined by the sum of certain elements and the value of y, adjusted according to specific conditions.**
