Output State: **`val` is empty, `c` is the final value of `i // 2` from the last iteration, `sx` is 0, `y` is the final value after being decreased by the sum of all `c` values from each iteration, `cons` is equal to `x + sx - 2`, and `t` is `False`.**

Explanation: The code `sx = 0` initializes the variable `sx` to 0. This does not affect the values of `val`, `c`, `y`, `cons`, `t`, or the values assigned by the `R()` function. Therefore, the only change is that `sx` is now explicitly set to 0.
