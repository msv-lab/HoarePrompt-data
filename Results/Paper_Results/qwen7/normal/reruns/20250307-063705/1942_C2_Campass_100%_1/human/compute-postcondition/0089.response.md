Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in val`. This means the loop iterates over each element in the list `val`.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is the second element of the list `val`.
   - `c` is `i // 2`.
   - `sx` is updated by adding `i` to its current value.
   - `y` is decreased by `i // 2`.

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is the second element of `val`, the next element in the list `val` will be used in the next iteration.
   - Therefore, `i` will be the third element of `val`.
   - `c` will be the third element of `val` divided by 2.
   - `sx` will be updated by adding the third element of `val` to its current value.
   - `y` will be decreased by the third element of `val` divided by 2.

4. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` will be the third element of `val`.
   - `c` will be `i // 2`, where `i` is now the third element of `val`.
   - `sx` will be updated by adding the third element of `val` to its current value.
   - `y` will be decreased by the third element of `val` divided by 2.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is the third element of the list `val`, `c` is the third element of `val` // 2, `sx` is updated by adding the third element of `val` to its current value, `y` is decreased by the third element of `val` // 2**
