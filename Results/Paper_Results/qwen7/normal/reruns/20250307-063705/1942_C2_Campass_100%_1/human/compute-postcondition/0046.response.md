Output State: **`val` must contain at least one element, `i` is the next element in `val`, `c` is `i // 2`, `sx` is increased by `i`, `y` is decreased by `i // 2` and then by `c`, `c` is updated to `i // 2`, and `y` is decreased by `i // 2` and then by `c` (which is `i // 2`).**

In this output state, the value of `y` has been updated twice. First, it was decreased by `i // 2`, and then it was further decreased by `c`, which is also `i // 2`. All other variables remain in their respective states as described in the initial state.
