Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, x + 1)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `x`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `i` is 1
   - `c` is -1
   - `val` is a list containing `-1`

3. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `x + 1`.
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` would be 2 if the condition is met.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - The variable `i` needs to be adjusted to 2 for the next iteration.
   - The variable `x` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop body.
   - The variables `c` and `val` are not part of the loop head and therefore do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute again.

Based on the above reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 2, `c` is -1, `val` is a list containing `-1`**
