Output State: **`i` is the second element of the list `val`, `c` is `i` // 2, `sx` is updated by adding `y * 2` to its current value, `y` is decreased by `i // 2`**.

Explanation: The code `sx += y * 2` updates the value of `sx` by adding `y * 2` to its current value. Similarly, `y -= i // 2` decreases the value of `y` by `i // 2`. The values of `i` and `c` remain unchanged from their initial state.
