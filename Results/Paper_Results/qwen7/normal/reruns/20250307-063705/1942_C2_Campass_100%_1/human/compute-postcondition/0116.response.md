Output State: **`i` is 3, `c` is -2, `val` is a list containing `-1, -2`, `c` is -2**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `c` to `l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1`. Given the initial state, `i` is 3, so `l[i]` refers to the fourth element of the list `val`, which is `-2`, and `l[i - 1]` refers to the third element of the list `val`, which is `-1`. Therefore, `c` is updated to `-2 - (-1) - 1 = -2`. The other variables remain unchanged.
