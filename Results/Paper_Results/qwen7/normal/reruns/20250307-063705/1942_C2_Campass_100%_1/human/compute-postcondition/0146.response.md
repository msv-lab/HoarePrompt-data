Output State: `i` is 0, `c` is 0, `y` is -2, `sx` is -10.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will have gone through each value in the list `val`, which initially contains `-2` repeated `x` times. Given that `x` is the initial value of `i`, and based on the provided output states, it can be inferred that `x` is 3. Therefore, `val` is `[-2, -2, -2]`.

- In the first iteration, `i` is `-2`, `c` is `-1`, and `sx` is calculated as `y * 2 + (-2) - (-1)`, which simplifies to `y * 2 - 1`. Then `y` is updated to `y - (-1)`.
- In the second iteration, `i` is `-1`, `c` is `-1`, and `sx` is updated based on whether `y < c`. Since `y` was updated from the previous iteration, we need to consider the new value of `y`. If `y` was greater than or equal to `-1` after the first iteration, `sx` remains `y * 2 - 1`. Otherwise, `sx` becomes `(y * 2 - 1) + (y * 2)`. Finally, `y` is updated to `y - (-1)`.
- In the third iteration, `i` is `0`, `c` is `0`, and `y` is `-2`. The loop does not break because `y` is now `-2` and `c` is `0`, so `y >= c`. Therefore, `sx` is updated to `-10`.

Thus, after all iterations, `i` is `0`, `c` is `0`, `y` is `-2`, and `sx` is `-10`.
