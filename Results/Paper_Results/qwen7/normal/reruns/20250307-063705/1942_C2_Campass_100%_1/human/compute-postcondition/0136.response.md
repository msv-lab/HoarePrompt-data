Output State: **`i` is -1, `c` is -1, `sx` is either `(y * 2 + (-2) - (-1)) + (y * 2)` if `y < c`, or `y * 2 + (-2) - (-1)` if `y >= c`, `sx` is `sx` + `-1`**

Explanation: The value of `i` is -1, and the value of `c` is -1. The expression for `sx` remains unchanged, but `sx` itself is incremented by `i`, which is -1. Therefore, `sx` is updated to its previous value plus -1. The condition for `sx` based on `y` and `c` remains the same.
