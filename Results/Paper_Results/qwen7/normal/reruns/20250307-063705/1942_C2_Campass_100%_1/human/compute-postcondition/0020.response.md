Output State: `i` is `x`; `c` is `l[x] - l[x - 1] - 1`; `val` contains a list of `x-1` elements, each being `l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1` for `i` ranging from `1` to `x`.

In this final state, the variable `i` will be equal to `x` because the loop runs from `1` to `x`. The variable `c` will be the value of `l[x] - l[x - 1] - 1`. The list `val` will contain `x-1` elements, where each element is the difference between consecutive elements in the list `l`, minus one, starting from the second element of `l` up to the last element.
