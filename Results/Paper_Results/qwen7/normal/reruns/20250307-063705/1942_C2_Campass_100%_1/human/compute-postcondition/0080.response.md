Output State: **`i` is the first element of the list `val`; `c` is `i // 2`; `sx` is `sx + i + (2 * min(y, c)) - c`; `y` is decreased by `c`.**

Explanation: The value of `y` is decreased by `c`, which is `i // 2`. The value of `sx` is updated by adding `i` and `2 * y` if `y` is less than `c`, otherwise it just adds `i`. Since `y` is now decreased by `c`, the final update to `sx` includes subtracting `c` from the previous value of `sx`.
