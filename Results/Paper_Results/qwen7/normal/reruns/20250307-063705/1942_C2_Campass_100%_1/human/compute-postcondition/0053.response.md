Output State: **`val` is empty, `c` is the final value of `i // 2` from the last iteration, `sx` is the sum of all `i` values from the `val` list as they were processed in each iteration, `y` is the final value after being decreased by the sum of all `c` values from each iteration, `cons` is equal to `x + sx - 2`, and `t` is `False`, with `n`, `x`, and `y` being assigned new values from `R()` function.**

This means that the variables `n`, `x`, and `y` have been assigned new values from the `R()` function, while the other variables (`val`, `c`, `sx`, `y`, `cons`, and `t`) retain their previous states or expressions.
