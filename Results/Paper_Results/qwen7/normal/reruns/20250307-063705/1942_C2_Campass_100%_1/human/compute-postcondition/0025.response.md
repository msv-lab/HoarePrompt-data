Output State: **`val` contains at least one element; `c` is the integer division of `i` by 2; the current value of `y` is less than `c`; `sx` is increased by `y * 2`.**

Explanation: The code `sx += y * 2` increments `sx` by the value of `y * 2`. Since `y` is less than `c` and `c` is the integer division of `i` by 2, `y * 2` is a value that is less than `2 * c`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
