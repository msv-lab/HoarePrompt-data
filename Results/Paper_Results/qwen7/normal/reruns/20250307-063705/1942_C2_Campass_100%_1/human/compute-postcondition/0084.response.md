Output State: **`i` is the second element of the list `val`, `c` is `i` // 2, `sx` is updated by adding `y * 2` to its current value, `y` is decreased by `i // 2', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the loop or if statement. Therefore, the values of `i`, `c`, `sx`, and `y` remain unchanged from their previous states.
