Output State: **`i` is the third element of the list `val`, `c` is `i` // 2, `sx` is updated by adding `i` to its current value, and `y` is decreased by `i` // 2.**

Explanation: The code `y -= c` subtracts the value of `c` from `y`. Since `c` is defined as `i // 2`, the value of `y` is decreased by `i // 2`. The other variables (`i`, `c`, and `sx`) remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
