Output State: **`val` must contain at least one element, `i` is the next element in `val`, `c` is `i // 2`, `sx` is increased by `i` plus `y * 2` and then by `y * 2`, `y` is decreased by `i // 2` and then by `c`, `c` is updated to `i // 2**.

Explanation: The code snippet `sx += y * 2` adds `y * 2` to the current value of `sx`. Since `y` was already decreased by `i // 2` and then by `c` (which is `i // 2`), the final value of `y` is effectively decreased by `i // 2 + i // 2 = i`. Therefore, the updated state includes the addition of `y * 2` to `sx` and the decrease of `y` by `i`.
