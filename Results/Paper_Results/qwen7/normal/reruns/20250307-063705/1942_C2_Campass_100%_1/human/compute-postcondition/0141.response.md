Output State: **`i` is 0; `c` is 0; `y` is -2; `sx` is -10 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no loop or conditional block was specified, we assume it breaks out of an implicit one from the context. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged.
