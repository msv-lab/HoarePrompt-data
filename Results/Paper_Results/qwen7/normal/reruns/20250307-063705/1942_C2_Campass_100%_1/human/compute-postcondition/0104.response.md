Output State: **`cons` is `x + sx - 2`, `t` is `False`, `y` is decreased by the integer division of each element in `val` by 2 for every iteration, `sx` is 0, `n`, `x`, and `y` have been assigned new values from `R()`**.

Explanation: The line `sx = 0` sets the variable `sx` to 0. All other variables (`cons`, `t`, `y`, `n`, `x`) retain their previous values as no operations were performed on them within this line of code. The value of `y` continues to be updated by the integer division of each element in `val` by 2 for every iteration, and `sx` is recalculated based on the new value of `y` and the elements in `val`.
