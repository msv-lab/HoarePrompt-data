Output State: **`i` is -1, `c` is -1, `y` is `c - 1`, `sx` is either `(y * 2 + (-2) - (-1)) + (y * 2)` if `y < c`, or `y * 2 + (-2) - (-1)` if `y >= c`, `sx` is `sx` - 1**

Explanation: The value of `y` is decremented by `c`. Given that `c` is -1, `y` becomes `c - 1`, which is `-1 - 1` or `-2`. The value of `sx` remains unchanged except for the additional `-1` added to it from the initial state. The conditions for `sx` remain the same as they were not affected by the code.
