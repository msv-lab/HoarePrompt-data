Output State: **`t` is a specific integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1 (inclusive); `n`, `x`, and `y` are assigned values from `R()`.**

Explanation: The code `n, x, y = R()` assigns values from the function `R()` to the variables `n`, `x`, and `y`. Since the exact values returned by `R()` are not specified, they are left as placeholders. The initial value of `t` remains unchanged.
