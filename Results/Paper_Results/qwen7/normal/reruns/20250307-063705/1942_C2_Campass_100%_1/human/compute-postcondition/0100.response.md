Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `cons` is defined as `x + sx - 2`.
   - `t` remains as `False`.
   - `y` is decreased by the integer division of each element in `val` by 2 for every iteration.
   - `sx` is the sum of all elements in `val` plus twice the minimum of `y` and `c` for each element minus `c`.
   - `val` has been iterated over.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `cons` is directly dependent on `x` and `sx`.
   - `t` is not used in the print statement, so it remains `False`.
   - `y` and `sx` are modified during the iteration over `val`, but their exact values depend on the contents of `val` and the value of `c`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement only includes `cons`, which is `x + sx - 2`.

Given the initial state, we know that `cons` is defined as `x + sx - 2`. Since `x` and `sx` are not explicitly defined with specific values in the initial state, we cannot determine their exact values. Therefore, the output will be expressed in terms of these variables.

Output: **x + sx - 2**
