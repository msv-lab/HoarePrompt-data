Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `x`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `x + 1`. This means the loop will continue as long as `i < x + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `c` is -1
   - `val` is a list containing `-1`

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `i` starts from `1` and increments by `1` each iteration, after the first iteration, `i` will be `2`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `x + 1`. Therefore, `x` must be greater than `1`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented to `2`.
   - `x` must still be greater than `1` for the loop to continue.

Given this analysis, the updated states are:

- `i` is 2
- `x` must be greater than 1

So, the final state is:

**State: **`i` is 2, `x` must be greater than 1**
