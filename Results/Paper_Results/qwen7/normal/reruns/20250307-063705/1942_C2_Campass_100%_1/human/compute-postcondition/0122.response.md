Output State: **`i` is -2; `c` is -1**

Explanation: The code `c = i // 2` divides `i` by 2 using integer division. Given that `i` is -2, the integer division of -2 by 2 results in -1. Therefore, `c` is assigned the value -1. The initial value of `i` remains unchanged, and the condition that `x` must be at least 1 is still valid but does not affect the values of `i` or `c`.
