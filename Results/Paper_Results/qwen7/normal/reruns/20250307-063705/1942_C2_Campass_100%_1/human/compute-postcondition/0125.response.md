Output State: **`i` is -2, `c` is -1, `sx` is `y` * 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `i`, `c`, and `sx`. It only breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since no such loop or if statement is provided in the code snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged.
