Output State: **`i` is `x`; `c` is `l[x] - l[x - 1] - 1`; `val` is a sorted list of `x-1` elements, each being `l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1` for `i` ranging from `1` to `x`, sorted by the key `(1 - x & 1, x)`**.

Explanation: The code sorts the list `val` using a custom key. The key is a tuple `(1 - x & 1, x)`, which means the sorting will first compare the parity of `1 - x` (i.e., whether `1 - x` is even or odd), and if two elements have the same parity, they will be compared by their actual value `x`. Since `x` is a constant for all elements in `val`, the sorting primarily depends on the parity of `1 - x`. Therefore, the list `val` remains unchanged in terms of its elements but is now sorted based on the specified key.
