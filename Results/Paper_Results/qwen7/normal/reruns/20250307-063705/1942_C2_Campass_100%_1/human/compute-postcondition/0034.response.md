Output State: **`val` must contain at least two elements, `i` is `i // 2`, `c` is `i // 2`, `sx` is increased by `i` plus `y * 2`, `y` is decreased by `i // 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the loop or if statement. Therefore, the values of `val`, `i`, `c`, `sx`, and `y` remain as they were before the `break` statement, with the additional information that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
