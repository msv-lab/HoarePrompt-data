Output State: **`i` is -2, `c` is -1, `sx` is `y` * 2**.

The code updates the variable `sx` by adding `y * 2` to its current value. Since `y` is a value less than -1, `y * 2` will be a value less than -2. However, the exact value of `sx` cannot be determined without knowing the initial value of `sx`. Therefore, `sx` is updated to its current value plus `y * 2`. The values of `i` and `c` remain unchanged.
