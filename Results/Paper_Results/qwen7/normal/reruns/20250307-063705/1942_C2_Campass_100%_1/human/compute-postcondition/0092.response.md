Output State: **`i` is the third element of the list `val`, `c` is now `i` // 2, `sx` is updated by adding `y` * 2 to its current value, `y` is decreased by the third element of `val` // 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. All the previous conditions and values remain unchanged.
