Output State: **`val` must contain at least one element, `i` is the next element in `val`, `c` is `i // 2`, `sx` is increased by `i` plus `y * 2`, `y` is decreased by `i // 2`, and `y` is decreased by `c`, `c` is updated to `i // 2**.

Explanation: The code `c = i // 2` updates the value of `c` to be the integer division of `i` by 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
