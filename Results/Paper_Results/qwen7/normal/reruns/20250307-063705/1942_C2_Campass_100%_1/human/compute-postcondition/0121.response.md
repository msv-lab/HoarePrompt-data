Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in val:`. The objects involved here are `i` and `val`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `i` is initially set to `x`.
   - `val` is a list containing `-2` repeated `x` times.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as there are elements in `val` to iterate over. In other words, the loop will execute if `val` is not empty.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `val` is a list containing `-2` repeated `x` times, for the loop to execute, `val` must not be an empty list. This means `x` must be at least 1.
   - The variable `i` will take on the values from the list `val` during each iteration of the loop, starting from the first element.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `x` must be at least 1 (to ensure `val` is not empty).
- `i` will be the first element of `val` when the loop starts, which is `-2`.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

**State: **`i` is `-2`, `x` must be at least 1**
