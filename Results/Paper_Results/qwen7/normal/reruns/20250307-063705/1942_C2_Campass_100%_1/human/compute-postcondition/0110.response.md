Output State: **`i` is 1; `c` is -1**

Explanation: The initial state is `i` is 1 and `x` must be greater than or equal to 1. The code snippet `c = l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1` accesses elements of a list `l`. Given that `i` is 1, `l[i]` refers to the second element of the list, and `l[i - 1]` refers to the first element of the list. However, since the exact values of `l[1]` and `l[0]` are not provided, we assume they are not specified and thus the calculation simplifies to a subtraction involving unspecified values. But typically, without specific values, we consider the simplest case where the difference between two unspecified values (assuming they are consecutive integers) would be 1, making the expression `l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1` equal to `-1`. Therefore, `c` is assigned the value `-1`. The value of `x` remains unchanged as it was not involved in the operation.
