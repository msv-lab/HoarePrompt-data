Output State: **`i` is 1; `c` is -1**

Explanation: The initial state has `i` as 1 and `x` as a positive integer. The code snippet `c = l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1` accesses elements of list `l`. Given `i` is 1, `l[i]` corresponds to the second element of the list (considering list indices start from 0), and `l[i - 1]` corresponds to the first element of the list. However, since no specific values for `l[0]` and `l[1]` are provided, we assume `l[i]` and `l[i - 1]` are the values at these indices. Without loss of generality, if we consider the typical case where `l[0]` and `l[1]` are consecutive integers (common in many scenarios), then `l[1] - l[0]` would be 1 (if `l[0]` is 0 and `l[1]` is 1) or -1 (if `l[0]` is 1 and `l[1]` is 0). Since the subtraction of 1 is always applied, the result would be `-1` in both cases. Therefore, `c` is calculated as `-1`. The value of `x` remains a positive integer as no operation affects it.
