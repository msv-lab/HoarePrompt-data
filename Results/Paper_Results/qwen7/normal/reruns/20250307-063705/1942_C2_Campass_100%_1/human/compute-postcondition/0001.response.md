Output State: **`t` is a specific integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), and `R` is a lambda function that returns a tuple of integers obtained from splitting the input and mapping them to integers. However, after executing `t, = R()`, `t` now holds the first element of the tuple returned by `R()`**.

This means that `t` has been assigned the first element of the tuple returned by the lambda function `R()`. The lambda function `R()` takes input, splits it into a tuple of integers, and `t` is set to be the first element of that tuple. The other elements of the tuple remain unchanged, and `R` itself remains as a lambda function.
