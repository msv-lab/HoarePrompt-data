You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version 0 \leq y \leq n - x . You
can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , 0 \leq y \leq n - x )
— the number of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen,
and the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 2
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    7 3 1
    
    6 4 3
    
    4 2 2
    
    1 3

Output

    6
    5
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 6 , 5 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that Bessie chose, the yellow dots represent
vertices that you chose, the blue lines represent diagonals that are drawn,
and the red numbers represent triangles that are counted.

- Program:
def func():
    R = lambda : map(int, input().split())
    (t,) = R()
    while t:
        t -= 1
        (n, x, y) = R()
        sx = 0
        l = list(R())
        l.sort()
        l.append(n + l[0])
        val = []
        for i in range(1, x + 1):
            c = l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1
            val.append(c)
        val.sort(key=lambda x: (1 - x & 1, x))
        for i in val:
            c = i // 2
            if y < c:
                sx += y * 2
                break
            sx += i
            y -= c
        cons = x + sx - 2
        print(cons)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each containing integers n, x, and y, followed by x distinct integers from 1 to n. It calculates and prints a value `cons` based on the given inputs and the sorted differences between consecutive elements in the list of x distinct integers. The final output is determined by the sum of certain elements and the value of y, adjusted according to specific conditions.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Specifically, the logic for calculating the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake is flawed. 

Let's analyze the issue with the given program:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the inputs `n`, `x`, and `y` along with the list of chosen vertices `l`.

2. **Sorting and Calculation**: The program sorts the list `l` and appends `n + l[0]` to handle the circular nature of the polygon. It then calculates the differences between consecutive elements in `l` and stores these differences in `val`. This step is correct.

3. **Triangular Piece Calculation**: The program attempts to maximize the number of triangular pieces by iterating through `val` and adding values to `sx` based on certain conditions. However, the logic for determining how many triangles can be formed from each segment is incorrect. The current implementation does not account for the fact that each segment can contribute to forming multiple triangles, and the logic for distributing `y` additional vertices among segments is flawed.

To illustrate the flaw, consider the following test case:

- **Input**:
  ```
  3
  8 4 2
  1 6 2 5
  ```

- **Expected Output**: 6 (as shown in the example)

- **Actual Output**: The program outputs 4 instead of 6.

The issue arises because the program incorrectly handles the distribution of additional vertices (`y`) and the calculation of the number of triangles that can be formed. Specifically, the program does not correctly account for the fact that each segment can contribute to forming multiple triangles, and the logic for distributing `y` additional vertices among segments is flawed.

A correct solution would involve a more detailed approach to calculate the maximum number of triangles that can be formed, considering the constraints and the properties of the polygon.
