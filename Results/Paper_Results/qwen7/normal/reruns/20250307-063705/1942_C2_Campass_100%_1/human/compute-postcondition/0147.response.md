Output State: `i` is 0, `c` is 0, `y` is -2, `sx` is -10.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will have taken on each value in the list `val` once. The list `val` initially contains `-2` repeated `x` times. Given that the loop has executed 3 times, it implies that `x` is at least 3. The final value of `i` is 0, which means the last element of `val` was processed. The variable `c` is set to `i // 2`, so when `i` is 0, `c` is also 0. The variable `y` decreases by the value of `c` each iteration until it reaches -2, as seen from the given states. The sum `sx` accumulates the values of `i` and adjusts based on the condition in the loop, resulting in a final value of -10.
