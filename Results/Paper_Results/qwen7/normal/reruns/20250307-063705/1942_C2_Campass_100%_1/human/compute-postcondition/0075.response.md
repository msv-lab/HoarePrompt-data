Output State: **`i` is the first element of the list `val`; `c` is `i // 2`; `y` is less than `c`; `sx` is increased by `2 * y`**.

Explanation: The code `sx += y * 2` updates the value of `sx` by adding `2 * y` to its current value. Since the initial state specifies that `y` is less than `c` and `c` is `i // 2`, the value of `sx` is increased by twice the value of `y`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
