Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input data consisting of multiple test cases. Each test case includes three integers n, x, and y, followed by x distinct integers from 1 to n. The function returns a value based on the conditions specified for n, x, and y, and the set of x distinct integers provided for each test case.**

This means the function reads input data which includes multiple test cases. Each test case starts with three integers (n, x, y) and then a list of x distinct integers. The function processes these inputs according to the given constraints and returns a value based on the conditions provided.
