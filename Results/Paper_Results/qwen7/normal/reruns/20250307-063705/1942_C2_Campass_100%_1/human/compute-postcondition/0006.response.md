Output State: **`t` is a specific integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1 (inclusive); `n`, `x`, and `y` are assigned values from `R()`, `sx` is 0; `l` is a list containing values from `R()`**.

This means that the list `l` has been created and filled with values from the function `R()`. The values of `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `sx` remain unchanged from their initial states.
