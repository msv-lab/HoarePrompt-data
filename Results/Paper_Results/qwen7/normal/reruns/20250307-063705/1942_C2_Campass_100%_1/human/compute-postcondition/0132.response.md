Output State: **`i` is -1, `c` is -1, `sx` is (y * 2 + (-2) - (-1)) + (y * 2)**

Explanation: The variable `sx` is updated by adding `y * 2` to its current value. Initially, `sx` is set to `y * 2 + (-2) - (-1)`, which simplifies to `y * 2 - 1`. After executing `sx += y * 2`, `sx` becomes `(y * 2 - 1) + (y * 2)`, which further simplifies to `y * 4 - 1`. The values of `i` and `c` remain unchanged.
