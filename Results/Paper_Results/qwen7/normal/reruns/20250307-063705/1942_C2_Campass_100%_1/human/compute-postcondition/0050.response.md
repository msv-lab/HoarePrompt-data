Based on the initial state provided:

- `val` is empty, meaning it contains no elements.
- `c` is the final value of `i // 2` from the last iteration. Since `val` is empty, there are no iterations, so `c` is undefined but for the purpose of the calculation, we can consider it as 0 because there are no values to divide.
- `sx` is the sum of all `i` values from the `val` list as they were processed in each iteration. Since `val` is empty, `sx` is 0.
- `y` is the final value after being decreased by the sum of all `c` values from each iteration. Again, since there are no iterations, `y` is also undefined but for the calculation, we can consider it as 0.
- `cons` is equal to `x + sx - 2`. Since `sx` is 0 and `x` is undefined (but considering the context, if `x` is meant to be a specific value, it would need to be defined), let's assume `x` is also 0 for simplicity unless otherwise specified.

Given these considerations, the expression for `cons` simplifies to:

\[ cons = x + sx - 2 = 0 + 0 - 2 = -2 \]

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be:

Output: **-2**
