Output State: **`i` is 0; `c` is 0; `y` is -2; `sx` is -10**

Explanation: The code `sx += y * 2` updates the value of `sx` by adding `y * 2` to its current value. Given that `y` is -2, `y * 2` equals -4. Therefore, `sx` changes from -6 to -6 + (-4) = -10. The values of `i`, `c`, and `y` remain unchanged.
