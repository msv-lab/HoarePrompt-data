Output State: **`val` is empty, `c` is the final value of `i // 2` from the last iteration, `sx` is 0, `y` is the final value after being decreased by the sum of all `c` values from each iteration, `cons` is equal to `x + sx - 2`, and `t` is `False`; list `l` is sorted.**

Explanation: The code `l.sort()` sorts the list `l` in ascending order. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the values of `val`, `c`, `sx`, `y`, `cons`, `t`, and `l` remain unchanged except that `l` is now sorted.
