Output State: **`t` is a specific integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1 (inclusive); `n`, `x`, and `y` are assigned values from `R()`, `sx` is 0; `l` is a sorted list containing values from `R()`**.

The code `l.sort()` sorts the list `l` in ascending order. The values of `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `sx`, and the original list `l` (before sorting) remain unchanged. The only change is that the list `l` is now sorted.
