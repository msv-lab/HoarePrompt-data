Output State: **`i` is -2, `c` is -1, `sx` is `y` * 2 + (-2) - (-1), `y` is `y` - (-1)**

Explanation: The value of `y` is decremented by `c`, which is `-1`. So, `y` becomes `y - (-1)` or `y + 1`. The values of `i` and `c` remain unchanged. The expression for `sx` remains the same, but now it is updated to reflect the new value of `y`.
