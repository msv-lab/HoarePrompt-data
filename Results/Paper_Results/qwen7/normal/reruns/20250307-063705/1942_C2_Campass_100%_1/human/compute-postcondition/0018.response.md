Output State: **`i` is 3, `c` is `l[3] - l[2] - 1`, `val` contains `[c, c]`**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `c` to the list `val`. Initially, `val` contains `[c]`. After executing `val.append(c)`, `val` will contain both the original value of `c` and the new appended value of `c`, making it `[c, c]`. The values of `i` and `c` remain unchanged.
