Output State: **`i` is the first element of the list `val`; `c` is `i // 2`; `y` is less than `c`; `sx` is increased by `2 * y`; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block specified, the `break` statement does not change the values of the variables. Therefore, the values of `i`, `c`, `y`, and `sx` remain unchanged, and the program simply exits the hypothetical loop or condition.
