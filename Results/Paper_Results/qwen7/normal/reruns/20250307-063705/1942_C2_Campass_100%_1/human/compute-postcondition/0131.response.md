Output State: **`i` is -1, `c` is -1, `sx` is `y` * 2 + (-2) - (-1), `c` is -1**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The initial state is given as `i` is -1, `c` is -1, `sx` is `y` * 2 + (-2) - (-1), `y` is `y` - (-1).
2. The code snippet is `c = i // 2`.
3. The value of `i` is -1. Performing integer division `-1 // 2` results in `-1` (since -1 divided by 2 is -0.5, and the integer division rounds towards negative infinity).
4. The value of `c` is updated to `-1`.
5. The values of `sx` and `y` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.

Therefore, the output state is: `i` is -1, `c` is -1, `sx` is `y` * 2 + (-2) - (-1), `c` is -1.
