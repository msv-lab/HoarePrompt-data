Output State: **`i` is -1, `c` is -1, `sx` is (y * 2 + (-2) - (-1)) + (y * 2)**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not modify any variable values or expressions. It only breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or switch statement. Since there is no loop or switch statement in the given code snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged values of `i`, `c`, and `sx`.
