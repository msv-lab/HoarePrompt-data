Output State: **`i` is 2; `c` is `l[2] - l[1] - 1`; `val` contains `[c]`**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `c` to the list `val`. Given that `c` is already defined as `l[2] - l[1] - 1`, appending `c` to `val` means `val` now contains the single element `[c]`. The values of `i` and the expression defining `c` remain unchanged.
