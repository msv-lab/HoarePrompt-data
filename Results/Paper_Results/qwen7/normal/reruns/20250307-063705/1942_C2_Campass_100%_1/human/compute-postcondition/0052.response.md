Output State: **`val` is empty, `c` is the final value of `i // 2` from the last iteration, `sx` is the sum of all `i` values from the `val` list as they were processed in each iteration, `y` is the final value after being decreased by the sum of all `c` values from each iteration, `cons` is equal to `x + sx - 2`, and `t` is `False`.**

Explanation: The code `t -= 1` decrements the value of `t` by 1. Given the initial state where `t` must be `True`, decrementing `t` by 1 changes its value to `False`. All other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.
