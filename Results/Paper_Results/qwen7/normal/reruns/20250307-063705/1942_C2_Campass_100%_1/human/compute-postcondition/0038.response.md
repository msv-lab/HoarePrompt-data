Output State: **`val` must contain at least two elements, `i` is `i // 2`, `c` is `i // 2`, `sx` is increased by `i` plus `y * 2`, `y` is decreased by `i // 2`, and `y` is decreased by `c`.**

Explanation: The code `y -= c` decreases the value of `y` by the value of `c`. Since `c` is `i // 2`, `y` is further decreased by `i // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
