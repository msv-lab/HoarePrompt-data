Output State: **`val` is now `[c]`, `c` is `l[1] - l[0] - 1`, `sx` is 0, `y` is the final value after being decreased by the sum of all `c` values from each iteration, `cons` is equal to `x + sx - 2`, and `t` is `False`.**

Explanation: The code `val.append(c)` appends the value of `c` to the list `val`. Initially, `val` is an empty list, so after appending `c`, `val` becomes `[c]`. The values of `c`, `sx`, `y`, `cons`, and `t` remain unchanged as no operations are performed on them within the given code snippet.
