Output State: **`cons` is `x + sx - 2`, `t` is `False`, `y` is decreased by the integer division of each element in `val` by 2 for every iteration, `sx` is 0, `n`, `x`, and `y` have been assigned new values from `R()`, `l` is a list of values generated by `R()`**.

Explanation: The code `l = list(R())` generates a list of values using the function `R()` and assigns it to the variable `l`. The values of `cons`, `t`, `y`, `sx`, `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged from their previous states.
