Output State: **`val` contains at least one element; `c` is the integer division of `i` by 2**.

Explanation: The code `c = i // 2` assigns the integer division of `i` by 2 to the variable `c`. Since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `i`, `c` is expressed as the integer division of `i` by 2. The precondition that `val` must contain at least one element remains unchanged.
