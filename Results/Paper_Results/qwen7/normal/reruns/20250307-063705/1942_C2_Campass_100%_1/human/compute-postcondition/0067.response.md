Output State: **`val` is `[c, c, c]`, `c` is `l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1`, `sx` is 0, `y` is the final value after being decreased by the sum of all `c` values from each iteration, `cons` is equal to `x + sx - 2`, `t` is `False`, `i` is `2`, `x` is the same as before.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `c` to the list `val`. Initially, `val` is `[c, c]`. After appending `c`, `val` becomes `[c, c, c]`. The other variables (`c`, `sx`, `y`, `cons`, `t`, `i`, and `x`) remain unchanged.
