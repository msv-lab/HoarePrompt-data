Output State: `t` is `False`, `y` is `-2`, `sx` is `-10`, `cons` is `1`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` becomes `False` because it was decremented until it reached `0`. The variable `y` is reduced by the integer division of each element in `val` by 2 for every iteration, which, based on the given information, results in `y` being `-2`. The variable `sx` accumulates the sum of all elements in `val` plus twice the minimum of `y` and `c` for each element minus `c`, leading to `sx` being `-10`. Finally, `cons` is calculated as `x + sx - 2`, which, given the previous values, results in `cons` being `1`.
