Postcondition: `val` must contain at least one element, `i` is the next element in `val`, `c` is `i // 2`, `sx` is increased by `i` plus `y * 2` and then by `y * 2`, `y` is decreased by `i // 2` and then by `c`, and `c` is updated to `i // 2`. If `y` is less than `c`, `y` is further decreased by `c` and `c` is updated to `i // 2`.
