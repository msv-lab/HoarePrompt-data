Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `i` is -2
- `c` is -1
- `sx` is `y` * 2 + (-2) - (-1)
- `y` is `y` - (-1)

### Loop Head:
```
for i in val:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variable in the loop head is `i`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range defined by `val`.

### Current Values:
- `i` is -2
- Since `i` is -2, it needs to be incremented to check if it falls within the range of `val` for the next iteration.

### Adjusting the State:
- `i` will be incremented by 1 (assuming `val` starts from -2 and increments by 1).
- `c` remains unchanged.
- `sx` and `y` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

### New State:
- `i` will be -2 + 1 = -1.
- `c` remains -1.
- `sx` remains `y` * 2 + (-2) - (-1).
- `y` remains `y` - (-1).

### Final State:
State: **`i` is -1, `c` is -1, `sx` is `y` * 2 + (-2) - (-1), `y` is `y` - (-1)**
