#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the number of test cases, n is an integer representing the number of mushrooms, v is a list of integers representing the magic powers of the mushrooms, and p is a permutation of integers from 1 to n.
def func_1(fillvalue):
    """Decorator to make a repr function return fillvalue for a recursive call."""
    return decorating_function
    #The program returns the decorating_function
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `fillvalue` and returns a decorator function named `decorating_function`. This decorator function is designed to modify the behavior of another function by returning `fillvalue` when a specific recursive call is made.
