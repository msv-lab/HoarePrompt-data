Output State: **t is an integer representing the number of test cases, n is an integer representing the number of mushrooms, v is a list of integers representing the magic powers of the mushrooms, and p is a permutation of integers from 1 to n.**

The provided code is a docstring comment for a decorator function and does not actually modify the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `v`, or `p`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
