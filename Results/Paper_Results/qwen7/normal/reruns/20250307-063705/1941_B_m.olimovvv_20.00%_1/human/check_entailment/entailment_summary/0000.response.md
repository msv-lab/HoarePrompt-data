Reasoning:
The provided program checks only two specific conditions for determining whether it's possible to make all elements of the array zero using the given operations. However, these conditions do not fully cover the problem's requirements. Specifically, the program only checks the parity and relative values of the first and last elements of the array, which is insufficient to determine the overall possibility of making all elements zero.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the total sum of the array elements and the distribution of values. Here's why the current implementation is incorrect:

1. **Sum Check**: The sum of all elements in the array must be even for it to be possible to reduce all elements to zero using the given operations. This is because each operation reduces the sum of the array by 4.
2. **Distribution Check**: We need to ensure that the array can be reduced to zeros through the specified operations. The current implementation only checks the first and last elements, which is not sufficient.

Given the execution summary, the program only checks the first and last elements, which is not enough to determine the overall possibility. Therefore, the provided solution is incomplete and incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
