Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the `range(int(input()))` part. This means that the loop will run for as many times as the user inputs an integer.

2. **Understand the Condition**: The condition for the loop to continue is not explicitly stated within the loop itself but is given before the loop. The condition is based on the initial state of `a` and `b`.

3. **Determine the Next State**: Since the loop is controlled by the input integer, the loop will run one more time if the user inputs a non-zero integer. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the input integer that controls the loop.

Given the initial condition and the loop control mechanism, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is the input integer.

**State:**
State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces**
