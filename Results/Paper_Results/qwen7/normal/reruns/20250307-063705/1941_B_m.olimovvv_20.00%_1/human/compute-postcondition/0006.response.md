Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer. The first element of `b` is even or `b[1]` equals `b[0] + 2`, and the last element of `b` is even or `b[-2]` equals `b[-1] + 2`.
