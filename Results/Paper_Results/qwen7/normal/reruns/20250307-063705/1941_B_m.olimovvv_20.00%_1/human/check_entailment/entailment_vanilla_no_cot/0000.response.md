Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution checks only the first and last elements of the array with specific conditions but does not account for the entire array. The logic needs to ensure that every element in the array can be reduced to zero through the specified operations. Here's why the current implementation is incorrect:

1. **Incomplete Check**: The solution only checks the first and last elements (`b[0]` and `b[-1]`) with specific parity conditions. This is insufficient because the problem requires checking all elements in the array.
   
2. **Operation Constraints**: The operations specified involve reducing three consecutive elements in a specific manner. Simply checking the first and last elements without considering the intermediate elements and their reductions is not sufficient.

To correctly solve the problem, you need to ensure that:
- Each element can be reduced to zero through the allowed operations.
- The sum of all elements must be even, as each operation reduces the total sum by 3 (since \(1 + 2 + 1 = 4\), and the net reduction is 3).

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Check if the sum of the array is divisible by 3
        if sum(b) % 3 != 0:
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        # Check if the first and last elements meet the criteria
        if b[0] % 2 == 1 and b[1] != b[0] + 2 or (b[-1] % 2 == 1 and b[-2] != b[-1] + 2):
            print('NO')
        else:
            # Check if all elements can be reduced to zero
            for i in range(1, n - 1):
                if b[i] % 2 == 1 and b[i - 1] != b[i] + 2 and b[i + 1] != b[i] + 2:
                    print('NO')
                    break
            else:
                print('YES')

func()
```

This version ensures that the sum of the array is divisible by 3 and checks all elements to ensure they can be reduced to zero through the specified operations.
