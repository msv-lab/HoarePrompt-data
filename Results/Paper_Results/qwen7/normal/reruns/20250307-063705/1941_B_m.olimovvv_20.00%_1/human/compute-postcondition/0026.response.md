Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `t`, an integer `n`, and an array `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it checks if the first element of the array `a` is odd and the second element is not two more than the first, or if the last element of the array `a` is odd and the second-to-last element is not two less than the last. If either condition is met, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.**
