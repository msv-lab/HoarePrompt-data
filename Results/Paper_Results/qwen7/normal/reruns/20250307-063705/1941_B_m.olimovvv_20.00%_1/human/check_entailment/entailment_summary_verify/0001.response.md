### Reasoning

The original assessment is incorrect. Let's break down why:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires checking if it's possible to make all elements of the array zero using the specified operations. The operations allow reducing three consecutive elements in a specific pattern.

2. **Function Summary Analysis:**
   - The provided function summary states that the program checks if the first and last elements have certain properties (odd/even and relative values). However, this is insufficient to determine the overall feasibility of reducing the entire array to zeros.

3. **Key Issues:**
   - The program only checks the first and last elements, which is not sufficient to cover all possible scenarios. The operations can affect multiple elements simultaneously, and the program fails to account for these interactions.
   - The program does not consider the cumulative effect of the operations on the entire array. It only checks isolated elements without ensuring the overall reduction is possible.

4. **Counterexample:**
   - As mentioned in the original assessment, the array `[1, 3, 5, 5, 2]` is a counterexample. The program incorrectly prints 'NO' because it checks the first and last elements, but it is possible to reduce this array to `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` using the allowed operations.

5. **Correct Approach:**
   - To solve this problem correctly, we need to ensure that the sum of the array elements is even (since each operation reduces the sum by 4). Additionally, we need to check if the array can be reduced to all zeros through a series of valid operations, which involves more complex logic than just checking the first and last elements.

### Final Evaluation

Given the issues identified, the original program does not correctly solve the problem. Therefore, the final evaluation should be:

**Final: False**
