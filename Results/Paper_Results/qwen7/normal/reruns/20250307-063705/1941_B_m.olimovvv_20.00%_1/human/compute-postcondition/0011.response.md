Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the expression `range(int(input()))`. This means the loop variable `_` is being incremented by 1 in each iteration.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**: The condition for the loop to continue is simply that the loop counter `_` should be less than the value returned by `int(input())`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**: The postconditions given are:
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `a` is an input integer.
   - `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
   - The first element of `b` is either an odd number and the second element is not equal to the first element plus 2, or the last element of `b` is an odd number and the second last element is not equal to the last element plus 2.
   - In the else case, the first element of `b` is even or the second element equals the first element plus 2, and the last element of `b` is even or the second last element equals the last element plus 2.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - The loop counter `_` will be incremented by 1.
   - Since the loop continues as long as `_` is less than `int(input())`, the value of `int(input())` remains unchanged.
   - The variables `t`, `a`, and `b` remain the same unless explicitly modified within the loop body, but since the problem states that no modifications are made within the loop body, these variables stay the same.

Given the above points, the state at the start of the next iteration will be the same as the current state, except for the loop counter `_` which will be incremented by 1.

**State:**
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
- The first element of `b` is either an odd number and the second element is not equal to the first element plus 2, or the last element of `b` is an odd number and the second last element is not equal to the last element plus 2.
- In the else case, the first element of `b` is even or the second element equals the first element plus 2, and the last element of `b` is even or the second last element equals the last element plus 2.
- `_` is incremented by 1.

Since the problem does not specify the exact value of `int(input())`, we cannot provide a specific numerical value for `_`. However, we know it will be incremented by 1.

**Final State:**
State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, the first element of `b` is either an odd number and the second element is not equal to the first element plus 2, or the last element of `b` is an odd number and the second last element is not equal to the last element plus 2, in the else case, the first element of `b` is even or the second element equals the first element plus 2, and the last element of `b` is even or the second last element equals the last element plus 2, `_` is incremented by 1**.
