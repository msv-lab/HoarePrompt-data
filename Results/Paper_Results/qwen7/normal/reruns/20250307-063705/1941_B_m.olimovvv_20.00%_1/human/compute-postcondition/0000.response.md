Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `_`: This is a placeholder variable used in Python to indicate that the value is not needed. It is often used when iterating over a sequence but not using the actual elements.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as the expression `int(input())` evaluates to a non-zero value. Since `int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input, the loop will continue as long as this integer is not zero.

3. **Initial State Before the Loop**: According to the given state, we have:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - For each test case, `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
   - The array `a` consists of `n` integers where \(0 \leq a_j \leq 10^9\) for each element \(a_j\).
   - The sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\).

4. **Adjusting the State**: To ensure the loop can execute, we need to make sure that the input to `int(input())` is a non-zero integer. Given that `t` is the number of test cases, `t` should be a positive integer. Therefore, the loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.

5. **Final State After Adjustment**: The only variable that affects the loop's execution is `t`, so we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
