Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to check if the entire array can be reduced to zeros using the allowed operations. Here's a counterexample:

Consider the input:
```
5
2 4 4 5 1
```
According to the problem description, we need to check if it's possible to make all elements zero using the specified operations. However, the current implementation only checks the first and last elements for specific conditions and prints "NO" or "YES" based on those conditions alone. This is insufficient to determine if the entire array can be made zero.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to ensure that the sum of the array elements is even and that no element is greater than twice the value of the next element plus one. The given implementation does not cover these necessary checks comprehensively. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
