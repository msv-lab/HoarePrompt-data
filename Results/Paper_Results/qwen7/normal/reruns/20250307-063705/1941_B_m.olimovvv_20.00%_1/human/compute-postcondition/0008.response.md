Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0, but `t` is not used in the print statement.
- `a` is an input integer, but it is not used in the print statement.
- `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting an input string and converting each element to an integer. The conditions for `b` are:
  - `b[0] % 2 == 0` or `b[1] == b[0] + 2`
  - `b[-1] % 2 == 0` or `b[-2] == b[-1] + 2`

The print statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **YES**
