Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `b = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, splits the input string into individual strings, converts each string to an integer using `map(int, ...)` and then creates a list from these integers. The original values of `t` and `a` remain unchanged.
