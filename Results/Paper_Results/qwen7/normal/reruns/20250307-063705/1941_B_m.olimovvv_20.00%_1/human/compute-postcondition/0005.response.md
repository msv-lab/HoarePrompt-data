Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting a string representation of integers and converting each element to an integer.
- The first element of `b` is an odd number.
- The second element of `b` is not equal to the first element plus 2.
- The last element of `b` is an odd number.
- The second last element of `b` is not equal to the last element plus 2.

The print statement is:
```python
print('NO')
```

This print statement directly outputs the string `'NO'` without any dependency on the values of `t`, `a`, or `b`.

Output: **NO**
