Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `b = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual elements based on spaces, and converts each element into an integer. The resulting list of integers is assigned to `b`. The value of `a` remains unchanged as it was initially an input integer.
