Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `b = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input, splits it into individual strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `b`. The value of `a` remains unchanged as it was initially an input integer.
