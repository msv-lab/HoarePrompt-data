Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are integers such that 1 ≤ `na`, `nb`, `nc` ≤ `n-2` and `na + nb + nc = n`, `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers such that 1 ≤ `numbers[i]` ≤ 10^9 for all 0 ≤ i < `n`; `numbers` list is sorted in descending order.**

Explanation: The code sorts the `numbers` list in reverse (descending) order. The values of `n`, `na`, `nb`, `nc`, and the `numbers` list itself remain unchanged except for the fact that the `numbers` list is now sorted in descending order.
