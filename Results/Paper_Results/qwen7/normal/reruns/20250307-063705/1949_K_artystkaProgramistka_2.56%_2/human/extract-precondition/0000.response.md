Precondition: **num is an integer, and sum_a, sum_b, sum_c are integers representing the current sums of the three groups (group_a, group_b, group_c), and na, nb, nc are integers representing the desired sizes of the three groups. Additionally, group_a, group_b, and group_c are lists that store the integers of the respective groups.**
