Output State: **`sum_a` is 0, `sum_b` is 0, `sum_c` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are integers such that 1 ≤ `na`, `nb`, `nc` ≤ `n-2` and `na + nb + nc = n`, `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers such that 1 ≤ `numbers[i]` ≤ 10^9 for all 0 ≤ i < `n` and is sorted in descending order, `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` are non-empty lists containing the first element of `numbers`, `num` is the first element in the `numbers` list, and `distribute_number(num)` has been called.**

Explanation: The function `distribute_number(num)` is called with the first element of the `numbers` list as its argument. This function will distribute the number into one of the groups (`group_a`, `group_b`, or `group_c`). However, since the exact implementation of `distribute_number` is not provided, we can only say that the first element of `numbers` (which is `num`) has been added to one of the groups, and the sum of each group remains unchanged because no numbers have been added to `sum_a`, `sum_b`, or `sum_c`. The other variables remain as they were before the function call.
