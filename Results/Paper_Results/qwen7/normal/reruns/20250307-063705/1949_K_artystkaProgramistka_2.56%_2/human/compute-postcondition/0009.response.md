Output State: **`sum_a` is 0, `sum_b` is 0, `sum_c` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are integers such that 1 ≤ `na`, `nb`, `nc` ≤ `n-2` and `na + nb + nc = n`, `numbers` is a list of `n-2` positive integers such that 1 ≤ `numbers[i]` ≤ 10^9 for all 0 ≤ i < `n-2` and is sorted in descending order, `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` are non-empty lists containing the first three elements of `numbers`, and `distribute_number(num)` has been called for each of the first three elements in the `numbers` list.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the `numbers` list will have been reduced to a list of `n-2` elements since we process one element per iteration starting from the first element. The `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` lists will contain the first three elements of the original `numbers` list because the loop processes the first three elements in the first three iterations. The sums (`sum_a`, `sum_b`, `sum_c`) remain 0 as no additions or subtractions are mentioned in the provided information about the loop body.
