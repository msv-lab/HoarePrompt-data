Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: n (an integer between 3 and 200,000), na, nb, and nc (integers between 1 and n-2 such that na + nb + nc = n), and a list of n positive integers named numbers. It returns either 'YES' followed by three non-empty lists containing the first three elements of the sorted 'numbers' list in descending order, or 'NO' if it's not possible to divide the list into three groups as specified.**
