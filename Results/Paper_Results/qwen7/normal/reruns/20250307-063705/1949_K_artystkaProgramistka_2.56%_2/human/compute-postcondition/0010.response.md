Postcondition: **`sum_a` is 0, `sum_b` is 0, `sum_c` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are integers such that 1 ≤ `na`, `nb`, `nc` ≤ `n-2` and `na + nb + nc = n`, `numbers` is a list of `n-2` positive integers such that 1 ≤ `numbers[i]` ≤ 10^9 for all 0 ≤ i < `n-2` and is sorted in descending order, `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` are non-empty lists containing the first three elements of `numbers`, and `func_1(sum_a, sum_b, sum_c)` returns True.**
