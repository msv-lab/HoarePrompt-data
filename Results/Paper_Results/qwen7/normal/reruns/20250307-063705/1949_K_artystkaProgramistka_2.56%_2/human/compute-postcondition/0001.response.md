Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are integers such that 1 ≤ `na`, `nb`, `nc` ≤ `n-2` and `na + nb + nc = n`, `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers such that 1 ≤ `numbers[i]` ≤ 10^9 for all 0 ≤ i < `n`; `numbers` list is sorted in descending order; `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` are empty lists.**

This output state reflects that the code initializes three empty lists (`group_a`, `group_b`, `group_c`) without altering the values of `n`, `na`, `nb`, `nc`, or the `numbers` list.
