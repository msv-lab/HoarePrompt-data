The function accepts four parameters: n (an integer between 3 and 200,000), na, nb, and nc (integers between 1 and n-2 such that na + nb + nc = n), and a list of n positive integers named numbers. It sorts the numbers in descending order, then checks if it can divide the first three elements of the sorted list into three non-empty groups. If it can, it returns 'YES' along with these three groups; otherwise, it returns 'NO'.
