Output State: **`sum_a` is 0, `sum_b` is 0, `sum_c` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are integers such that 1 ≤ `na`, `nb`, `nc` ≤ `n-2` and `na + nb + nc = n`, `numbers` is a list of `n-1` positive integers such that 1 ≤ `numbers[i]` ≤ 10^9 for all 0 ≤ i < `n-1` and is sorted in descending order, `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` are non-empty lists containing the first element of `numbers`, `num` is the third element in the `numbers` list, and `distribute_number(num)` has been called.**

The function `distribute_number(num)` has been called with `num` being the third element in the `numbers` list, but the exact values of the variables within the function have not been specified, so we cannot determine the exact changes to `sum_a`, `sum_b`, `sum_c`, `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c`. However, we know that `num` is now part of one of the groups (`group_a`, `group_b`, or `group_c`).
