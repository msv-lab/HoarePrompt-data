Output State: **`times` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `data` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `_` is 0, `dic` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is equal to `n`, `s` is `i ^ 2147483647`**

Explanation: The code `s = i ^ check` assigns the value of `i` bitwise XORed with `check` (which is 2147483647) to `s`. Since `i` is not defined in the initial state, it remains as `i` in the output state. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
