Output State: **`times` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `_` is now 0**

Explanation: The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means it takes an integer input from the user. The variable `_` remains unchanged and is still 0. The condition that `times` must be greater than 0 is still valid.
