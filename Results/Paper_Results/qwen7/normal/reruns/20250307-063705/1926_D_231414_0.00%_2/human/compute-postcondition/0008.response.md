Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in data:`. The objects involved here are `i` and `data`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `i`: This variable will take on the values from the list `data` one by one during each iteration of the loop.
   - `data`: This is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.

3. **Check the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `data` is not empty. Therefore, `data` must contain at least one element for the loop to start executing.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `data` is a list of integers, we need to ensure that `data` has at least one element.
   - The value of `i` will change during each iteration, but we don't need to specify its initial value since it will be set to the first element of `data` when the loop starts.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `data` must have at least one element.

The final state before the loop starts should be:

**State: **`times` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `data` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `_` is 0, `dic` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is equal to `n`, `check` is 2147483647**
