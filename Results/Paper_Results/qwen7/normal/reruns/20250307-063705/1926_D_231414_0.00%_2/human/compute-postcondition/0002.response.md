State: **`times` must be greater than 0, `_` is now 0** 

Explanation:
- The loop uses `range(times)` to determine how many iterations it will perform.
- For the loop to execute, `times` must be a positive integer (greater than 0).
- The variable `_` is used as a placeholder in the loop and is automatically incremented with each iteration. Initially, it is set to 0 before the loop starts.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is ensuring that `times` is greater than 0, and the initial value of `_` is 0.
