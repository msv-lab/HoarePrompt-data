Output State: **`times` is an input integer, and all other variables from the initial state remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `times = int(input())` reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `times`. The initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). Since `times` is now assigned the value of the input integer, the precondition for `t` is now applied to `times`. All other variables (`n`, `a`) remain in their initial state as no operations affecting them were performed.
