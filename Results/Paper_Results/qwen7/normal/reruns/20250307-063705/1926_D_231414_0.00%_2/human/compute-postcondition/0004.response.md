Output State: **`times` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `data` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `_` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `data = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores the resulting list in the variable `data`. The variables `times` and `n` remain unchanged, and `_` remains 0.
