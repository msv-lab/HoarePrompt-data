Output State: **`times` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `data` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `_` is 0, `dic` is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is `i ^ 2147483647` and the value is -1, `ans` is equal to `n`, and `s` is `i ^ 2147483647`**.

Explanation: The code `dic[s] -= 1` decrements the value associated with the key `s` in the dictionary `dic` by 1. Initially, `s` is `i ^ 2147483647` and its value in the dictionary is 0 (since `dic` was an empty dictionary and then `s` was added with a value of 0). After the operation, the value of `s` in the dictionary becomes -1. All other variables remain unchanged.
