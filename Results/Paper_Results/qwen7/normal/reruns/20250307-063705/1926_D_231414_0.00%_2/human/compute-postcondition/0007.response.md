Output State: **`times` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `data` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `_` is 0, `dic` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is equal to `n`, `check` is 2147483647.**

The code initializes `check` to the value `2 ** 31 - 1`, which is 2147483647. This value does not affect any other variables, so the initial conditions for `times`, `n`, `data`, `_`, `dic`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
