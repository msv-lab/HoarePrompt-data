The function processes multiple sets of input data, each containing an integer `t`, followed by pairs of integers `n` and `k`, and then edges represented by pairs of integers `v` and `u`. For each set, it calls the `solve()` function `t` times. After processing all sets, it ensures that `t` is reduced by one for each call to `solve()` and eventually becomes zero. The function does not return any value but modifies the state by processing the input data and calling `solve()` repeatedly.
