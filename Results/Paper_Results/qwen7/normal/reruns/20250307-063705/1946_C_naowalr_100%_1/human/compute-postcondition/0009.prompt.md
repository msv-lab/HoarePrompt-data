You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, each set of input data contains two integers n and k such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5, and each subsequent line of input contains two integers v and u such that 1 ≤ v, u ≤ n representing an edge in the tree. Additionally, the sum of the values of n across all sets of input data does not exceed 10^5.
def func_1():
    for _ in range(int(sys.stdin.readline())):
        solve()
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t < 10^4\), `solve()` has been called the total number of times equal to the initial value of `t`, and the loop counter has decreased to 0.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will be less than its initial value and will be non-negative (since it starts from a positive integer and decreases by 1 each iteration). The function `solve()` will have been executed exactly `t` times, which is the initial value of `t` before any iterations began. The loop counter, which started at `t` and was decremented by 1 in each iteration, will now be 0.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input data consisting of integers t, n, k, v, and u. It verifies that t is within the range 1 to 10^4, and for each set of input data, n and k are within the ranges 1 to 10^5 and 1 to n-1 respectively. The function also processes edges represented by pairs of integers v and u, where both v and u are within the range 1 to n. The function returns information based on the processed data, which could include validation results or other derived outputs depending on the specific logic implemented.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
