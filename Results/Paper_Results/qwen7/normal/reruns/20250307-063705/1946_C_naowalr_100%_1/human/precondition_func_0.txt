t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, each set of input data contains two integers n and k such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5, and each subsequent line of input contains two integers v and u such that 1 ≤ v, u ≤ n representing an edge in the tree. Additionally, the sum of the values of n across all sets of input data does not exceed 10^5.
