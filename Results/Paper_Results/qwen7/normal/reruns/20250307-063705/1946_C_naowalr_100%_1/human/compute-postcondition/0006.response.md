Output State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t < 10^4\), `solve()` has been called `t` times.

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `t` will be reduced to less than \(10^4\) (since it starts at \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and decreases by 1 with each iteration). The `solve()` function will have been called exactly `t` times, as the loop runs `int(sys.stdin.readline())` times, and `t` is initialized to this value before the loop starts.
