Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `solve()` has been called, and the loop counter has decreased by 1**.

Explanation: The function `solve()` has been called, but since no specific changes to variables are returned or directly modified within the given snippet, the values of `t` and the loop counter (implied by the context) remain unchanged. The precondition that `t` is an integer within the specified range and that `solve()` has been called, along with the loop counter decreasing by 1, are still valid.
