Output State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t < 10^4\), `solve()` has been called the total number of times equal to the initial value of `t`, and the loop counter has decreased to 0.

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will be less than its initial value and will be non-negative (since it starts from a positive integer and decreases by 1 each iteration). The function `solve()` will have been executed exactly `t` times, which is the initial value of `t` before any iterations began. The loop counter, which started at `t` and was decremented by 1 in each iteration, will now be 0.
