Output State: **`minn` is `maxx` + 1, `mex` is a list containing `minn - 1`, `maxx` is either 0 if `arr[2]` > 0 and `minn == maxx`, or equal to the maximum of the absolute differences between `abs(arr[2])` and `minn`, `i` is 3.**

Explanation:
- The code `minn = maxx + 1` updates the value of `minn` to `maxx + 1`. This is done regardless of the conditions specified in the initial state.
- The other variables (`mex`, `maxx`, `i`, and the condition involving `arr[2]`) remain unchanged because they are not directly affected by this line of code.
