Output State: `minn` is `maxx + 2` if `arr[i]` > 0 and `minn == maxx` for all `i` in the range of `n`, otherwise `minn` is the final value it reached during the loop execution. `mex` is a list containing all the values of `minn - 1` or `abs(arr[i] - minn)` for each iteration where `arr[i] > 0` and `minn == maxx`, otherwise it contains the appropriate value based on the conditions. `maxx` is the maximum of the absolute differences between `abs(arr[i])` and `minn` for each iteration. `i` is `n`. The variable `n` is the total number of elements in the list `arr`, and `arr` is the list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces.
