Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. It then calculates and prints a list `mex` which contains specific values based on the conditions provided in the code. Specifically, if `arr[i]` is greater than 0, `mex` includes `minn - 1`; otherwise, it includes `abs(arr[i] - minn)`. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.**
