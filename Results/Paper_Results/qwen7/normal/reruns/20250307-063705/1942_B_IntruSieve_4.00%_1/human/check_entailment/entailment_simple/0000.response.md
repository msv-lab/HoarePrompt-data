Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**: The function `func_1()` correctly reads the number of elements `n` and the array `arr` for each test case. This part is handled correctly.

2. **MEX Calculation Logic**:
   - The logic for calculating MEX (`mex`) is flawed. The code attempts to maintain a running minimum (`minn`) and maximum (`maxx`) but does not correctly compute the MEX for each position in the array.
   - Specifically, the logic inside the loop where `arr[i] > 0` and `arr[i] <= minn` should set `mex[i]` to `minn`, and when `arr[i] > minn`, it should set `mex[i]` to `minn - 1`. However, the current implementation does not handle these cases correctly.
   - The logic for updating `minn` and `maxx` is also incorrect because it does not reflect the actual MEX calculation.

3. **Output Logic**:
   - The output logic prints the `mex` values, which are supposed to represent the MEX values for the permutation `p`. However, since the MEX calculation is incorrect, the output will not match the required conditions.

Given the above points, the provided code does not correctly implement the MEX calculation and thus cannot generate a valid permutation `p` that satisfies the given array `a`.

Correctness: **False**
