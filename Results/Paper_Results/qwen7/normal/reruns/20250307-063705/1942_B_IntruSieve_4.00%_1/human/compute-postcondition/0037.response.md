Postcondition: **`minn` is either increased by 1 to `maxx + 2` if `arr[2] > 0` and `minn == maxx`, or remains 1; `mex` is a list containing `minn - 1` or the absolute difference between `abs(arr[2])` and `minn`; `maxx` is updated to the maximum of the absolute differences between `abs(arr[2])` and `minn` if `arr[2] > 0` and `minn == maxx`, otherwise `maxx` remains unchanged; `i` is 5; `n` must be at least 4; if `minn == maxx`, then `minn` is 1, `mex` is 0, and `maxx` is unchanged.**
