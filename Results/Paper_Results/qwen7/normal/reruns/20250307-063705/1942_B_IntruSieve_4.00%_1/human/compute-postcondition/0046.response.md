Based on the initial state, `mex` must contain at least one element. However, the specific value or type of the element in `mex` is not provided. Since the print statement simply prints the first element of `mex` followed by a space without any additional context or formatting, we need to describe the printed output in terms of the available information.

Given that `mex` contains at least one element, let's denote this element as `itm`. The print statement will output this element followed by a space.

Output: **itm**
