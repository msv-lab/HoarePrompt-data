Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `minn` is `maxx + 2` if `arr[i]` > 0 and `minn == maxx` for all `i` in the range of `n`, otherwise `minn` is the final value it reached during the loop execution. `mex` is a list containing all the values of `minn - 1` or `abs(arr[i] - minn)` for each iteration where `arr[i] > 0` and `minn == maxx`, otherwise it contains the appropriate value based on the conditions. `maxx` is the maximum of the absolute differences between `abs(arr[i])` and `minn` for each iteration. `i` is `n`. The variable `n` is the total number of elements in the list `arr`, and `arr` is the list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces.
Code of the loop:
for itm in mex:
    print(itm, end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `mex` must contain at least one element

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `mex` must contain at least one element

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `mex` must contain at least one element




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
