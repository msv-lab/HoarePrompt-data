Output State: **`minn` is either increased by 1 to `maxx` + 2 if `arr[2]` > 0 and `minn == maxx`, or remains 0, `mex` is a list containing the value of `minn - 1`, `maxx` is either 0 if `arr[2]` > 0 and `minn == maxx`, or equal to the maximum of the absolute differences between `abs(arr[2])` and `minn`, `i` is 3, `mex` is a list containing `minn - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `minn += 1` increments the value of `minn` by 1. Since the initial state of `minn` is either increased by 1 to `maxx` + 2 if `arr[i]` > 0 and `minn == maxx`, or remains 0, and `i` was 2, after the increment, `minn` is now either increased by 1 to `maxx` + 2 if `arr[2]` > 0 and `minn == maxx`, or remains 0. The value of `i` is updated to 3 because `i` is incremented by 1 in the process. The value of `mex` remains unchanged as it was a list containing `minn - 1` before the increment.
