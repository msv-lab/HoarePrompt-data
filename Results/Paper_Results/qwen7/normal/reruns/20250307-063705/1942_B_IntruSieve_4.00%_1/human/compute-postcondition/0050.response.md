Based on the initial state provided, `mex` must contain at least one element. However, the specific value or type of this element is not explicitly stated. Since the `print` statement simply outputs the value of `itm` followed by a space, and `itm` is presumably the first element of `mex` (as it's the only element mentioned), we can infer that `itm` is the first element of `mex`.

Given that `mex` contains at least one element, let's denote the element as `itm`. The output will be the value of `itm` followed by a space.

Output: **itm (where itm is the element in the list mex)**
