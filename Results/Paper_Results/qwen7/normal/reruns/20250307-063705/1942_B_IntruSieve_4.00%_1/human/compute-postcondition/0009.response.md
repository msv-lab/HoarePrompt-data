Output State: **`minn` is increased by 1, `mex` is a list containing the value of `minn` - 1, `maxx` is 0, `i` is 0, the current value of `arr[i]` is greater than 0.**

Explanation: The value of `minn` is incremented by 1. Since `mex` initially contained the value of `minn`, it now contains the value of `minn - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
