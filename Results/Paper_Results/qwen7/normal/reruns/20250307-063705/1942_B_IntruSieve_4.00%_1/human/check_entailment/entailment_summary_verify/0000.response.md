### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and its logic step-by-step to determine if it correctly constructs the permutation \( p \) based on the given array \( a \).

#### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to construct a permutation \( p \) such that:
\[ a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \]

#### Provided Program:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    mex = []
    minn = 0
    maxx = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] > 0:
            mex.append(minn)
            minn += 1
            if minn == maxx:
                minn = maxx + 1
        else:
            mex.append(abs(arr[i] - minn))
            if abs(arr[i] - minn) > maxx:
                maxx = abs(arr[i] - minn)
    for itm in mex:
        print(itm, end=' ')
    print()
```

#### Function Summary:
The function `func_1` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer \( n \) and a list of \( n \) integers \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \). It then calculates and prints a list `mex` which contains specific values based on the conditions provided in the code. Specifically, if `arr[i]` is greater than 0, `mex` includes `minn - 1`; otherwise, it includes `abs(arr[i] - minn)`. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.

#### Detailed Analysis:
1. **Initialization**: The variables `minn` and `maxx` are initialized to 0. `minn` keeps track of the smallest unused index, and `maxx` keeps track of the largest used index.
2. **Loop through array `arr`**:
   - If `arr[i]` is positive, `mex.append(minn)` and `minn` is incremented.
   - If `arr[i]` is negative, `mex.append(abs(arr[i] - minn))`, and `maxx` is updated if necessary.
3. **Output**: The list `mex` is printed.

#### Issues with the Program:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of MEX**: The program does not correctly calculate the MEX value. The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array. The current logic does not ensure that the MEX is correctly determined.
2. **Permutation Construction**: The program constructs a list `mex` instead of the permutation \( p \). The list `mex` is not directly related to the permutation \( p \) and does not satisfy the condition \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \).

#### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
1
5
1 1 -2 1 2
```

Expected output (permutation \( p \)):
```
0 1 4 2 3
```

However, the program outputs:
```
0 1 4 2 3
```

This is the same as the expected output, but let's verify if it satisfies the conditions:
- \( a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 \) (correct)
- \( a_2 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 \) (correct)
- \( a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 \) (incorrect, should be 0)
- \( a_4 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 \) (correct)
- \( a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 \) (correct)

The program fails to correctly compute the MEX for the third element, indicating that the logic is flawed.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly generate a permutation \( p \) based on the given array \( a \).

**Final: False**
