Output State: **`minn` is increased by 1 to `maxx` + 2, `mex` is a list containing the value of `minn` - 1, `maxx` is 0, `i` is 0, the current value of `arr[i]` is greater than 0, and `minn` is equal to `maxx`.**

Explanation: The code sets `minn` to `maxx + 1`. Given that `maxx` was initially 0, `minn` is now increased by 1 to 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
