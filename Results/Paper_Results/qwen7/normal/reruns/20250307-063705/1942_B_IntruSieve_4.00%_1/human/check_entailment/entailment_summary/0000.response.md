Reasoning:

1. The program is designed to solve the problem of constructing a permutation \( p \) based on the given array \( a \).
2. The program iterates through each test case and constructs the permutation \( p \) using the provided formula.
3. The logic in the program attempts to calculate the MEX (Minimum EXcluded) value for each position in the array \( a \), which is then used to determine the corresponding value in the permutation \( p \).

Let's analyze the key parts of the program:

- The program correctly initializes variables to keep track of the minimum and maximum values encountered.
- For each element in the array \( a \):
  - If \( a[i] \) is positive, it appends `minn - 1` to the `mex` list and increments `minn`.
  - If \( a[i] \) is negative, it appends `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to the `mex` list and updates `maxx` if necessary.
- The program then prints the `mex` list, which should represent the permutation \( p \).

However, there is a critical flaw in the logic:
- The program does not ensure that the values in the `mex` list are unique and cover all integers from 0 to \( n-1 \). This is essential because \( p \) must be a permutation of integers from 0 to \( n-1 \).
- Additionally, the program does not explicitly construct the permutation \( p \) but instead constructs a list `mex` that might not be a valid permutation.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
