Postcondition: **`minn` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces; `mex` is a list containing the absolute difference between `abs(arr[i])` and `minn`; `maxx` is equal to the maximum of the absolute differences between `abs(arr[i])` and `minn`, and `i` is 0.**
