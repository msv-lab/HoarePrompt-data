Postcondition: `minn` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces; `mex` is a list containing the absolute difference between `abs(arr[i])` and `minn`; `maxx` is equal to `abs(arr[i] - minn)`, `i` is 0, and the condition `abs(arr[i] - minn) > maxx` is true.
