### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires constructing a permutation \( p \) based on the given array \( a \). The value of \( a_i \) is defined as the MEX (Minimum EXcluded) of the prefix \( p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i \) minus \( p_i \).

2. **Analyzing the Provided Code**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case separately.
   - For each test case, it reads the size \( n \) and the array \( a \).
   - It initializes `minn` and `maxx` to keep track of the smallest and largest values seen so far.
   - It iterates through the array \( a \) and constructs the MEX values for each position.
     - If \( a_i > 0 \), it appends `minn` to the `mex` list and increments `minn`.
     - If \( a_i \leq 0 \), it appends the absolute difference between `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to the `mex` list.
     - It updates `maxx` if necessary.
   - Finally, it prints the constructed `mex` list.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic for constructing the MEX values seems to follow the problem statement correctly.
   - The code ensures that each value in the `mex` list is derived from the MEX of the prefix up to the current index.
   - The code handles both positive and negative values of \( a_i \) appropriately.
   - However, there is a critical flaw in the logic. The `mex` values should represent the positions in the permutation \( p \), but the current implementation does not ensure that each integer from 0 to \( n-1 \) appears exactly once in the permutation \( p \).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not guarantee that each integer from 0 to \( n-1 \) appears exactly once in the permutation \( p \). The `mex` values do not necessarily form a valid permutation.
   - For example, consider the input:
     ```
     1
     3
     1 -1 1
     ```
     The code will produce the output:
     ```
     0 2 1
     ```
     This is not a valid permutation because 2 is missing.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. While it follows the logic for constructing the MEX values, it fails to ensure that the resulting list forms a valid permutation \( p \).

### Final:
**False**
