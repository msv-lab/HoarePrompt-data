Output State: **`minn` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces; `mex` is a list containing the absolute difference between `abs(arr[i])` and `minn`; `maxx` is 0, `i` is 0.**

Explanation: The code appends the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` to the list `mex`. Since `arr[i]` is less than or equal to 0, `abs(arr[i] - minn)` simplifies to `abs(arr[i] - 0)`, which is just the absolute value of `arr[i]`. Therefore, `mex` now contains one element, which is the absolute value of `arr[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
