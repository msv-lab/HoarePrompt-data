Output State: **`minn` is either increased by 1 to `maxx` + 2 if `arr[i]` > 0 and `minn == maxx`, or remains 0, `mex` is a list containing the absolute difference between `abs(arr[i])` and `minn`, `maxx` is either 0 if `arr[i]` > 0 and `minn == maxx`, or equal to the maximum of the absolute differences between `abs(arr[i])` and `minn`, `i` is 2**

Explanation: The code appends the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` to the list `mex`. Since `i` was initially 1, after executing the line `mex.append(abs(arr[i] - minn))`, `i` is now 2. The values of `minn`, `mex`, and `maxx` might have changed based on the conditions given, but without the actual values of `arr[i]` and the initial values of `minn` and `maxx`, we can only say that `i` is now 2.
