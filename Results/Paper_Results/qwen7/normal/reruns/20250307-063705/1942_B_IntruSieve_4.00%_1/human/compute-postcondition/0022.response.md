Output State: **`minn` is either increased by 1 to `maxx` + 2 if `arr[i]` > 0 and `minn == maxx`, or remains 0, `mex` is a list containing the value of `minn` - 1 if `arr[i]` > 0 and `minn == maxx`, or a list containing the absolute difference between `abs(arr[i])` and `minn`, `maxx` is either 0 if `arr[i]` > 0 and `minn == maxx`, or equal to the maximum of the absolute differences between `abs(arr[i])` and `minn`, `i` is 2, `mex` is a list containing `minn - 1`.**

Explanation: 
- The line `mex.append(minn)` appends the current value of `minn` to the list `mex`.
- Since `i` was initially 1, it is now incremented to 2.
- The values of `minn`, `mex`, `maxx`, and the condition checks remain as per the initial state, except for the fact that `mex` now contains `minn - 1` as its first element.
