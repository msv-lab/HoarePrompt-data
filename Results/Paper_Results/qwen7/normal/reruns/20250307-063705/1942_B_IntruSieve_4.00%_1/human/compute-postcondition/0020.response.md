Postcondition: **`minn` is either increased by 1 to `maxx` + 2 if `arr[i]` > 0 and `minn == maxx`, or remains 0. `mex` is either a list containing the value of `minn` - 1 if `arr[i]` > 0 and `minn == maxx`, or a list containing the absolute difference between `abs(arr[i])` and `minn`. `maxx` is either 0 if `arr[i]` > 0 and `minn == maxx`, or equal to the maximum of the absolute differences between `abs(arr[i])` and `minn`. `i` is 0.**
