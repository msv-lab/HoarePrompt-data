Output State: **`minn` is either increased by 1 to `maxx + 2` if `arr[2] > 0` and `minn == maxx`, or remains 0; `mex` is a list containing `abs(arr[4] - minn)`; `maxx` is updated to the maximum of the absolute differences between `abs(arr[2])` and `minn` if `arr[2] > 0` and `minn == maxx`, otherwise `maxx` remains unchanged; `i` is 5; `n` is at least 5; `maxx` is now `abs(arr[i] - minn)`**.

Explanation: The code updates `maxx` to the absolute difference between `arr[i]` (where `i` is 5) and `minn`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
