Based on the initial state provided, the precondition tells us that the loop will continue to execute as long as `mex` contains at least one element. Once `mex` becomes empty, the loop will terminate. However, the `print()` statement does not take any arguments and simply prints a newline character.

Since no specific values or conditions are given for `mex`, and the `print()` function itself does not depend on any variables, the output will be:

Output: **\n**
