Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for itm in mex:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `itm` and `mex`.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `mex` must contain at least one element.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `mex` contains at least one element. Once `mex` is empty, the loop will terminate.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `itm` is used in the loop body but not mentioned in the loop head, its value does not directly affect the loop continuation condition.
   - The key variable here is `mex`. For the loop to execute one more time, `mex` must still contain at least one element.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `mex` still contains at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`mex` must contain at least one element**
