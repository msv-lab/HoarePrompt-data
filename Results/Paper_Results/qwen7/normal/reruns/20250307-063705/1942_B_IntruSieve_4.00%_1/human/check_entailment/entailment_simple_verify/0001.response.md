### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires constructing a permutation \( p \) based on the given array \( a \). The value of \( a_i \) is defined as the MEX (Minimum EXcluded) of the prefix \( p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i \) minus \( p_i \).

2. **Analyzing the Provided Code**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case separately.
   - For each test case, it reads the size \( n \) and the array \( a \).
   - It initializes `minn` and `maxx` to keep track of the smallest and largest values seen so far.
   - It iterates through the array \( a \) and constructs the MEX values for each position.
     - If \( a_i > 0 \), it appends `minn` to the `mex` list and increments `minn`.
     - If \( a_i \leq 0 \), it appends the absolute difference between `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to the `mex` list.
     - It updates `maxx` if necessary.
   - Finally, it prints the constructed `mex` list.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic for constructing the MEX values seems to follow the problem statement correctly.
   - However, there are issues with how the `mex` values are being constructed and used to form the permutation \( p \).
   - Specifically, the code does not ensure that the constructed `mex` values directly correspond to the positions in the permutation \( p \). Instead, it constructs a list of `mex` values which do not necessarily represent the permutation itself.
   - The code does not properly map the `mex` values back to the indices to form the permutation \( p \).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the edge case where \( a_i \) can be negative by adjusting the MEX calculation accordingly.
   - However, it fails to correctly map these `mex` values to form the permutation \( p \).

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Initialization and Iteration**:
  - The code initializes `minn` and `maxx` but does not use them effectively to form the permutation \( p \).
  - The `mex` list is constructed based on the conditions given, but this list does not directly give the permutation \( p \).

- **Constructing the Permutation**:
  - The code should iterate through the `mex` list and assign the values to form the permutation \( p \).
  - For each `mex` value, it should check if the value has been used before and assign the next available unused value.

### Correct Implementation:

To correctly implement the solution, the code should:
1. Initialize an array `p` of size \( n \) with all values set to -1 (indicating unassigned).
2. Iterate through the `mex` list and assign the values to the corresponding positions in `p`.

### Example Fix:

```python
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    mex = []
    minn = 0
    maxx = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] > 0:
            mex.append(minn)
            minn += 1
            if minn == maxx:
                minn = maxx + 1
        else:
            mex.append(abs(arr[i] - minn))
            if abs(arr[i] - minn) > maxx:
                maxx = abs(arr[i] - minn)
    
    p = [-1] * n
    used = set()
    for val in mex:
        if val not in used:
            for j in range(n):
                if p[j] == -1:
                    p[j] = val
                    used.add(val)
                    break
    
    for val in p:
        print(val, end=' ')
    print()
```

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment was inaccurate because the code does not correctly map the `mex` values to form the permutation \( p \). Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
