Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces; `mex` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list `mex`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged from their initial state.
