Output State: **`minn` is either increased by 1 to `maxx + 2` if `arr[2] > 0` and `minn == maxx`, or remains 0; `mex` is a list containing `abs(arr[4] - minn)`; `maxx` is updated to the maximum of the absolute differences between `abs(arr[2])` and `minn` if `arr[2] > 0` and `minn == maxx`, otherwise `maxx` remains unchanged; `i` is 5; `n` must be at least 5.**

Explanation:
- The code appends `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to the list `mex`. Since `i` was initially 4, it is now 5.
- The values of `minn`, `maxx`, and `mex` are updated based on the conditions given, but the exact values depend on the values of `arr[2]` and `arr[4]`.
- The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing from 4 to 5.
- The condition for updating `minn` and `maxx` is not directly applied here since the code only appends a value to `mex` and does not explicitly update `minn` or `maxx` unless the conditions are met. However, the conditions remain valid for future operations.
