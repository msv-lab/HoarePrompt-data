Output State: **The loop will continue to execute as long as `mex` contains at least one element. Once `mex` becomes empty, the loop will terminate.**

In natural language, this means that the loop will keep printing the elements of `mex` until `mex` no longer has any elements left. Since the condition for the loop to continue is that `mex` must contain at least one element, the loop will stop executing once `mex` is empty. Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop will be that the loop has finished, and `mex` is now an empty list.
