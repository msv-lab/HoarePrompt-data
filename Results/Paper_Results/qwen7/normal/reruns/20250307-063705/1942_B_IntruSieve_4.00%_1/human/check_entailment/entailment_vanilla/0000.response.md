### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires constructing a permutation \( p \) based on the given array \( a \). The value of \( a_i \) is defined as the MEX (Minimum EXcluded) of the prefix \( p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i \) minus \( p_i \).

2. **Analyzing the Provided Code**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case separately.
   - For each test case, it reads the size \( n \) and the array \( a \).
   - It initializes `minn` and `maxx` to keep track of the smallest and largest values seen so far.
   - It iterates through the array \( a \) and constructs the MEX values for each position.
     - If \( a_i > 0 \), it appends `minn` to the `mex` list and increments `minn`.
     - If \( a_i \leq 0 \), it appends the absolute difference between `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to the `mex` list.
     - It updates `maxx` if necessary.
   - Finally, it prints the constructed `mex` list.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic for constructing the MEX values seems to follow the problem statement correctly.
   - The code ensures that each value in the `mex` list is derived from the MEX of the prefix up to the current index.
   - The code handles both positive and negative values of \( a_i \) appropriately.
   - The final output matches the requirement of printing the constructed permutation \( p \).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the edge case where \( a_i \) can be negative by adjusting the MEX calculation accordingly.
   - The code guarantees that each integer from 0 to \( n-1 \) appears exactly once in the permutation \( p \).

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem.
