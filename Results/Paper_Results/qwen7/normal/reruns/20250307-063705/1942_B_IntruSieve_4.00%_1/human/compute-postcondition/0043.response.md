Output State: `minn` will be `maxx + 2` if `arr[i]` > 0 and `minn == maxx` for all `i` in the range of `n`, otherwise it will be the final value it reaches during the loop. `mex` will be a list containing all the values of `minn - 1` or the absolute difference between `abs(arr[i])` and `minn` for each iteration where `arr[i] > 0` and `minn == maxx`, otherwise it will contain the appropriate values based on the conditions. `maxx` will be the maximum of the absolute differences between `abs(arr[i])` and `minn` for all `i` in the range of `n`. `i` will be `n`, `n` will be the total number of elements in `arr`, and `arr` will remain unchanged.
