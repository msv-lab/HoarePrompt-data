Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head includes the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values**:
   - `i` is 0 (at the end of the previous iteration).
   - `n` is not explicitly given, but it is the upper bound of the `range` function in the loop.

3. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, the new value of `i` will be `0 + 1 = 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.

Given this information, we need to update the state such that `i` is set to 1 and ensure that the loop condition `i < n` still holds true.

**State at the Start of the Next Iteration**:
- `minn` is either increased by 1 to `maxx` + 2 if `arr[i]` > 0 and `minn == maxx`, or remains 0.
- `mex` is either a list containing the value of `minn` - 1 if `arr[i]` > 0 and `minn == maxx`, or a list containing the absolute difference between `abs(arr[i])` and `minn`.
- `maxx` is either 0 if `arr[i]` > 0 and `minn == maxx`, or equal to the maximum of the absolute differences between `abs(arr[i])` and `minn`.
- `i` is now 1.

Therefore, the updated state is:
State: **`minn` is either increased by 1 to `maxx` + 2 if `arr[i]` > 0 and `minn == maxx`, or remains 0, `mex` is either a list containing the value of `minn` - 1 if `arr[i]` > 0 and `minn == maxx`, or a list containing the absolute difference between `abs(arr[i])` and `minn`, `maxx` is either 0 if `arr[i]` > 0 and `minn == maxx`, or equal to the maximum of the absolute differences between `abs(arr[i])` and `minn`, `i` is 1**.
