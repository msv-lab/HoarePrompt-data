Postcondition: `minn` is either increased by 1 to `maxx` + 2 if `arr[2]` > 0 and `minn == maxx`, or remains 0. `mex` is a list containing `minn - 1`. `maxx` is either 0 if `arr[2]` > 0 and `minn == maxx`, or equal to the maximum of the absolute differences between `abs(arr[2])` and `minn`. `i` is 3.
