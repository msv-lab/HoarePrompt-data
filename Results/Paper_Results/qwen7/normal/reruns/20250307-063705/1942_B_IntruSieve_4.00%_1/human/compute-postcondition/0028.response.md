Output State: **`minn` is either increased by 1 to `maxx` + 2 if `arr[2]` > 0 and `minn == maxx`, or remains 0, `mex` is a list containing the absolute difference between `abs(arr[2])` and `minn`, `maxx` is either 0 if `arr[2]` > 0 and `minn == maxx`, or equal to the maximum of the absolute differences between `abs(arr[2])` and `minn`, `i` is 3, `maxx` is updated to `abs(arr[2] - minn)`**.

This means that the value of `i` is incremented by 1 to 3. The variable `maxx` is updated to the value of `abs(arr[2] - minn)`. All other variables retain their previous conditions or values unless specified otherwise.
