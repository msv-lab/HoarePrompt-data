Given the initial state that `mex` must contain at least one element, and the print statement `print(itm, end=' ')`, we need to determine what `itm` is.

However, the initial state does not explicitly define what `itm` is or how it relates to `mex`. Since `itm` is not defined in the initial state and there's no additional context provided, we can infer that `itm` is likely an element from the `mex` list. Given that `mex` contains at least one element, `itm` could be any of those elements. 

Since the problem asks for the most precise description possible based on the precondition and we don't have more specific information about `itm`, we can only say that `itm` is an element from the `mex` list.

Output: **itm (an element from the mex list)**
