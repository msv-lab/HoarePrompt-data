Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for itm in mex:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `itm` and `mex`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements in `mex` (i.e., `mex` is not empty).

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `mex` must contain at least one element.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues as long as `mex` contains at least one element, after each iteration, `mex` will lose one element (`itm` will be removed from `mex`).
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `mex` must still contain at least one element.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `mex` must contain at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`mex` must contain at least one element**
