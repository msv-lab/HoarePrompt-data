### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires constructing a permutation \( p \) based on the given array \( a \). The value of \( a_i \) is defined as the MEX (Minimum EXcluded) of the prefix \( p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i \) minus \( p_i \).

2. **Analyzing the Provided Code**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case separately.
   - For each test case, it reads the size \( n \) and the array \( a \).
   - It initializes `minn` and `maxx` to keep track of the smallest and largest values seen so far.
   - It iterates through the array \( a \) and constructs the MEX values for each position.
     - If \( a_i > 0 \), it appends `minn` to the `mex` list and increments `minn`.
     - If \( a_i \leq 0 \), it appends the absolute difference between `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to the `mex` list.
     - It updates `maxx` if necessary.
   - Finally, it prints the constructed `mex` list.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic for constructing the MEX values seems to follow the problem statement correctly.
   - However, the code does not actually construct the permutation \( p \). Instead, it constructs a list `mex` which is not directly related to the required permutation \( p \).
   - The code does not ensure that the values in the `mex` list correspond to the MEX of the prefix \( p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i \) minus \( p_i \) in a way that would allow us to reconstruct the permutation \( p \).
   - The code simply prints the `mex` list, which is not the required output.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the edge case where \( a_i \) can be negative by adjusting the MEX calculation accordingly.
   - However, the handling of the MEX values does not guarantee that the resulting `mex` list can be used to reconstruct the permutation \( p \).

Given the analysis, the provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. It constructs a list `mex` instead of the required permutation \( p \).

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
