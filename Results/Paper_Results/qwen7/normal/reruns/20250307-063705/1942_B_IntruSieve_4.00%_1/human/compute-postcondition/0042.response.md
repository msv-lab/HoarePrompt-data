Postcondition: `minn` is either increased by 1 to `maxx + 2` if `arr[2] > 0` and `minn == maxx`, or remains 0; `mex` is a list containing either `minn - 1` or the absolute difference between `abs(arr[2])` and `minn`; `maxx` is updated to the maximum of the absolute differences between `abs(arr[2])` and `minn` if `arr[2] > 0` and `minn == maxx`, otherwise `maxx` remains unchanged; `i` is 5; `n` is at least 4; `mex` contains the appropriate value based on the conditions, and `maxx` reflects the maximum absolute difference as specified.
