Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was not involved in any operation. Therefore, `t` retains its initial state as a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, and `n` is updated to the value of the integer input.
