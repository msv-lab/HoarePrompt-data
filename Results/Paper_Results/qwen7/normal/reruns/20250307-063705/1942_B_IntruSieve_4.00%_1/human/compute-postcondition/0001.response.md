Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `arr` by converting each element of the input string (split by spaces) into integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
