You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

Farmer John has a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n , where every integer from
0 to n-1 occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array a of length n and
challenges her to construct p based on a .

The array a is constructed so that a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) -
p_i , where the \texttt{MEX} of an array is the minimum non-negative integer
that does not appear in that array. For example, \texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0 and
\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2 .

Help Bessie construct any valid permutation p that satisfies a . The input is
given in such a way that at least one valid p exists. If there are multiple
possible p , it is enough to print one of them.

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the lengths of p and a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-n \leq a_i \leq n ) — the elements of array a .

It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid p for the given data.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers on a new line, the elements of p .

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    1 1 -2 1 2
    
    5
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    3
    
    -2 1 2

Output

    0 1 4 2 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 
    2 0 1 
    
Note

In the first case, p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is one possible output.

a will then be calculated as a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 , a_2 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 , a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 , a_4 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 , a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 .

So, as required, a will be [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] .

- Program:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    mex = []
    minn = 0
    maxx = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] > 0:
            mex.append(minn)
            minn += 1
            if minn == maxx:
                minn = maxx + 1
        else:
            mex.append(abs(arr[i] - minn))
            if abs(arr[i] - minn) > maxx:
                maxx = abs(arr[i] - minn)
    for itm in mex:
        print(itm, end=' ')
    print()



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. It then calculates and prints a list `mex` which contains specific values based on the conditions provided in the code. Specifically, if `arr[i]` is greater than 0, `mex` includes `minn - 1`; otherwise, it includes `abs(arr[i] - minn)`. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires constructing a permutation \( p \) based on the given array \( a \). The value of \( a_i \) is defined as the MEX (Minimum EXcluded) of the prefix \( p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i \) minus \( p_i \).

2. **Analyzing the Provided Code**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case separately.
   - For each test case, it reads the size \( n \) and the array \( a \).
   - It initializes `minn` and `maxx` to keep track of the smallest and largest values seen so far.
   - It iterates through the array \( a \) and constructs the MEX values for each position.
     - If \( a_i > 0 \), it appends `minn` to the `mex` list and increments `minn`.
     - If \( a_i \leq 0 \), it appends the absolute difference between `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to the `mex` list.
     - It updates `maxx` if necessary.
   - Finally, it prints the constructed `mex` list.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic for constructing the MEX values seems to follow the problem statement correctly.
   - The code ensures that each value in the `mex` list is derived from the MEX of the prefix up to the current index.
   - The code handles both positive and negative values of \( a_i \) appropriately.
   - The final output matches the requirement of printing the constructed permutation \( p \).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the edge case where \( a_i \) can be negative by adjusting the MEX calculation accordingly.
   - The code guarantees that each integer from 0 to \( n-1 \) appears exactly once in the permutation \( p \).

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem.
