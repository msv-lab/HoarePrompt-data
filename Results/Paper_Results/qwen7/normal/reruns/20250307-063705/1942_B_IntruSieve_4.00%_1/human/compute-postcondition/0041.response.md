Postcondition: `minn`, `mex`, and `maxx` are updated based on the value of `arr[2]`. If `arr[2] > 0` and `minn == maxx`, then `minn` is set to 1, `mex` is set to 0, and `maxx` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `minn` is increased by 1 to `maxx + 2` or remains 0, `mex` is set to either `minn - 1` or `abs(arr[2] - minn)`, and `maxx` is updated to the maximum of `abs(arr[2] - minn)` if `arr[2] > 0` and `minn == maxx`, otherwise `maxx` remains unchanged. `i` is set to 5, and `n` is at least 4.
