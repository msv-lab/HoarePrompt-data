Reasoning:
1. The problem requires constructing a permutation \( p \) based on the given array \( a \), where \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \).
2. The annotated program does not correctly implement the logic to generate the permutation \( p \). Instead, it generates a list `mex` based on certain conditions but does not use this list to construct the permutation \( p \).
3. The function `func_1()` only prints the `mex` list, which does not satisfy the requirements of the problem.
4. The program should generate a permutation \( p \) such that the condition \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \) holds for all \( i \).

Given the above points, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
