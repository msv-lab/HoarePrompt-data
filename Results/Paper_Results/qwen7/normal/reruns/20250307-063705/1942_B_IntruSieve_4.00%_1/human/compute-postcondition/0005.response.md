Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is not explicitly initialized in the given state, but it will start from 0 (the default value for `range(n)`).
   - `n` is already given as a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\).

3. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.
   - Initially, `i` is set to 0.

Given this information, we need to ensure that the loop can start executing. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `i` and `n` such that the loop condition `i < n` is satisfied.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:

- **Initial value of `i`**: Since `i` is set to 0 by default when using `range(n)`, no adjustment is needed for `i`.
- **Value of `n`**: We need to ensure that `n` is a positive integer within the specified range, and since the problem states that `1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5`, we don't need to change its value.

### Final State:

Since `i` starts at 0 and `n` is a positive integer within the specified range, the loop can start executing without any further adjustments to the initial state.

### Final Answer:

State: **`minn` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), and `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces; `mex` is an empty list; `maxx` is 0, `i` is 0**
