Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head mentions `itm` as the variable being iterated over in the list `mex`.

2. **Understand the Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop will iterate over each item in the list `mex`. For the loop to execute, `mex` must contain at least one element.

3. **Determine the Initial State of `mex`**: The state of `mex` is defined based on certain conditions involving `minn`, `maxx`, and `arr[i]`. Specifically, `mex` is constructed based on the conditions provided:
   - `minn` is either `maxx + 2` if `arr[i] > 0` and `minn == maxx` for all `i` in the range of `n`, otherwise `minn` is the final value it reached during the loop execution.
   - `mex` contains values based on `minn - 1` or `abs(arr[i] - minn)` for each iteration where `arr[i] > 0` and `minn == maxx`, otherwise it contains the appropriate value based on the conditions.
   - `maxx` is the maximum of the absolute differences between `abs(arr[i])` and `minn` for each iteration.

4. **Adjust the State for the Loop to Execute**: Since the loop will iterate over `mex`, `mex` must contain at least one element. Therefore, we need to ensure that `mex` is not empty.

5. **Consider the Initial Values**: Given that `i` is `n`, and `n` is the total number of elements in the list `arr`, we need to ensure that `arr` is properly initialized and that the conditions for constructing `mex` are met.

Based on these steps, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is that `mex` must contain at least one element.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`mex` must contain at least one element**
