Output State: **`minn` is either increased by 1 to `maxx + 2` if `arr[2] > 0` and `minn == maxx`, or remains 0; `mex` is a list containing `minn - 1` or the absolute difference between `abs(arr[2])` and `minn`; `maxx` is updated to the maximum of the absolute differences between `abs(arr[2])` and `minn` if `arr[2] > 0` and `minn == maxx`, otherwise `maxx` remains unchanged; `i` is 4; `n` must be at least 4; `mex` now contains `minn - 1`**.

Explanation: The code appends `minn` to the list `mex`. Since `minn` was previously either increased by 1 to `maxx + 2` if `arr[2] > 0` and `minn == maxx`, or remained 0, and `mex` initially contained either `minn - 1` or the absolute difference between `abs(arr[2])` and `minn`, appending `minn` to `mex` means `mex` now contains `minn - 1` (assuming the initial value was `minn - 1`). The other variables remain unchanged.
