Output State: **`minn` is 1, `mex` is 0, `maxx` is unchanged, `i` is 5, `n` must be at least 4.**

Explanation:
- Initially, `minn` is either increased by 1 to `maxx + 2` if `arr[2] > 0` and `minn == maxx`, or remains 1. Given the code `minn = maxx + 1`, it implies that `minn` is set to `maxx + 1`. Since `minn` was previously either increased by 1 to `maxx + 2` or remained 1, and given the new assignment, `minn` must be `maxx + 1`. However, since `minn` cannot be both `maxx + 1` and `maxx + 2` simultaneously, and the code directly sets `minn` to `maxx + 1`, we conclude `minn` is 1 (as it was initially 1 before the condition was met).
- `mex` is a list containing `minn - 1` or the absolute difference between `abs(arr[2])` and `minn`. Given `minn` is now 1, `mex` becomes `[0]` because `minn - 1` is 0.
- `maxx` is updated to the maximum of the absolute differences between `abs(arr[2])` and `minn` if `arr[2] > 0` and `minn == maxx`, otherwise `maxx` remains unchanged. Since `minn` is now 1, and without knowing the exact value of `arr[2]`, we cannot determine if `maxx` changes. However, since the problem does not specify any change in `maxx`, we assume `maxx` remains unchanged.
- `i` is 5, which is unchanged.
- `n` must be at least 4, which is also unchanged.
