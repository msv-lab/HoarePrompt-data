Output State: **`minn` is appended to `mex`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces; `mex` is a list containing the value of `minn`; `maxx` is 0; `i` is 0; the current value of `arr[i]` is greater than 0.**

This means that the value of `minn` has been appended to the list `mex`. All other variables retain their original conditions and values as described in the initial state.
