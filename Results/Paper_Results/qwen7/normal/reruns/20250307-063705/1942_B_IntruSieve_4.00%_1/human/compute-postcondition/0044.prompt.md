Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `minn` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces; `mex` is an empty list; `maxx` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if arr[i] > 0:
        mex.append(minn)
        minn += 1
        if minn == maxx:
            minn = maxx + 1
    else:
        mex.append(abs(arr[i] - minn))
        if abs(arr[i] - minn) > maxx:
            maxx = abs(arr[i] - minn)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `minn` is either increased by 1 to `maxx` + 2 if `arr[i]` > 0 and `minn == maxx`, or remains 0. `mex` is either a list containing the value of `minn` - 1 if `arr[i]` > 0 and `minn == maxx`, or a list containing the absolute difference between `abs(arr[i])` and `minn`. `maxx` is either 0 if `arr[i]` > 0 and `minn == maxx`, or equal to the maximum of the absolute differences between `abs(arr[i])` and `minn`. `i` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `minn` is either increased by 1 to `maxx` + 2 if `arr[2]` > 0 and `minn == maxx`, or remains 0. `mex` is a list containing either `minn - 1` or the absolute difference between `abs(arr[2])` and `minn`. `maxx` is updated to the maximum of the absolute differences between `abs(arr[2])` and `minn` if `arr[2] > 0` and `minn == maxx`, otherwise `maxx` remains unchanged. `i` is 3.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `minn` is either increased by 1 to `maxx + 2` if `arr[2] > 0` and `minn == maxx`, or remains 0; `mex` is a list containing either `minn - 1` or the absolute difference between `abs(arr[2])` and `minn`; `maxx` is updated to the maximum of the absolute differences between `abs(arr[2])` and `minn` if `arr[2] > 0` and `minn == maxx`, otherwise `maxx` remains unchanged; `i` is 5; `n` is at least 4; `mex` contains the appropriate value based on the conditions, and `maxx` reflects the maximum absolute difference as specified.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
