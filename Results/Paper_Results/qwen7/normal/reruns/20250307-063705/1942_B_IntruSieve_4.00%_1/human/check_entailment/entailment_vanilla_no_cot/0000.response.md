Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic to generate a valid permutation `p` based on the given array `a`. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of MEX**: The code attempts to calculate the MEX value but does not correctly handle the logic for determining the MEX value for each position in the permutation `p`.

2. **Logic Flaws**: The code tries to maintain a `mex` array and update `minn` and `maxx`, but this approach is not aligned with the problem's requirements. Specifically, the MEX calculation should be done dynamically for each position in the permutation, not precomputed.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to construct the permutation `p` step-by-step while ensuring that the MEX condition holds for each position. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Initialize the permutation array
    p = [-1] * n
    
    # Create a set to keep track of used numbers
    used = set()
    
    for i in range(n):
        mex = 0
        while mex in used:
            mex += 1
        
        # Assign the current MEX value to the current position
        p[i] = mex
        used.add(mex)
        
        # Adjust the MEX value in the array based on the current assignment
        arr[i] = mex - p[i]
    
    # Print the permutation
    print(' '.join(map(str, p)))

for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Code:
1. **Initialization**: We initialize the permutation array `p` with `-1` and a set `used` to keep track of which numbers have been used.
2. **Dynamic MEX Calculation**: For each position `i` in the permutation, we find the smallest non-negative integer `mex` that is not in the `used` set.
3. **Assigning Values**: We assign `mex` to `p[i]` and add `mex` to the `used` set.
4. **Adjusting Array**: We adjust the value in the array `arr` to ensure it matches the MEX condition.
5. **Output**: Finally, we print the permutation `p`.

This approach ensures that the permutation `p` is constructed correctly according to the given conditions.
