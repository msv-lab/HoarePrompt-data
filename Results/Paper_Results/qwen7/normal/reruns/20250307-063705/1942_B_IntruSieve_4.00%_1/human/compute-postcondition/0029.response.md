Postcondition: `minn` is either increased by 1 to `maxx` + 2 if `arr[2]` > 0 and `minn == maxx`, or remains 0, `mex` is a list containing the absolute difference between `abs(arr[2])` and `minn`, `maxx` is updated to `abs(arr[2] - minn)` if the condition `abs(arr[2] - minn) > maxx` is true, otherwise `maxx` remains unchanged.
