You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and the input consists of n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n where -n ≤ a_i ≤ n. It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid permutation p for the given data, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    mex = []
    minn = 0
    maxx = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] > 0:
            mex.append(minn)
            minn += 1
            if minn == maxx:
                minn = maxx + 1
        else:
            mex.append(abs(arr[i] - minn))
            if abs(arr[i] - minn) > maxx:
                maxx = abs(arr[i] - minn)
        
    #State: Output State: `minn` is `maxx + 2` if `arr[i]` > 0 and `minn == maxx` for all `i` in the range of `n`, otherwise `minn` is the final value it reached during the loop execution. `mex` is a list containing all the values of `minn - 1` or `abs(arr[i] - minn)` for each iteration where `arr[i] > 0` and `minn == maxx`, otherwise it contains the appropriate value based on the conditions. `maxx` is the maximum of the absolute differences between `abs(arr[i])` and `minn` for each iteration. `i` is `n`. The variable `n` is the total number of elements in the list `arr`, and `arr` is the list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces.
    for itm in mex:
        print(itm, end=' ')
        
    #State: The loop will continue to execute as long as `mex` contains at least one element. Once `mex` becomes empty, the loop will terminate.
    print()
    #This is printed: \n
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases internally. For each test case, it accepts a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, followed by `t` groups of inputs. Each group contains a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5) and `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (-n ≤ a_i ≤ n). The function returns a result for each group indicating whether a valid permutation `p` exists for the given data.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
