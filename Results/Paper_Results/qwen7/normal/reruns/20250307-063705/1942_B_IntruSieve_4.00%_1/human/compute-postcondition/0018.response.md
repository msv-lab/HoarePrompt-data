Output State: **`minn` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces; `mex` is a list containing the absolute difference between `abs(arr[i])` and `minn`; `maxx` is equal to `abs(arr[i] - minn)`, `i` is 0; `maxx` is equal to `abs(arr[i] - minn)` and is greater than the previous value of `maxx`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `maxx` to be the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn`. Since `minn` is 0, `maxx` is now set to `abs(arr[i])`. Given that the current value of `maxx` was previously greater than the previous value of `maxx`, and since `arr[i]` is an element of `arr`, the new value of `maxx` is `abs(arr[i])`, which is greater than the previous value of `maxx`. All other variables remain unchanged.
