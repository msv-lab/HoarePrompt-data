Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `minn`: Either increased by 1 to `maxx + 2` if `arr[2] > 0` and `minn == maxx`, or remains 0.
   - `mex`: A list containing either `minn - 1` or the absolute difference between `abs(arr[2])` and `minn`.
   - `maxx`: Updated to the maximum of the absolute differences between `abs(arr[2])` and `minn` if `arr[2] > 0` and `minn == maxx`, otherwise `maxx` remains unchanged.
   - `i`: 3.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `range(n)`, where `n` is some value that needs to be determined based on the current state.

3. **Adjusting the States for the Next Iteration:**
   - The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.
   - Since `i` is 3 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

4. **Determining `n`:**
   - To ensure the loop can execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1 (from 3 to 4).
   - Therefore, `n` must be at least 4.

5. **Final State Adjustment:**
   - `total` is not mentioned in the loop head, so it remains unchanged.
   - `i` is increased by 1 to 4.
   - `n` must be at least 4 to allow the loop to execute again.

Given this analysis, the final state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`minn` is either increased by 1 to `maxx + 2` if `arr[2] > 0` and `minn == maxx`, or remains 0. `mex` is a list containing either `minn - 1` or the absolute difference between `abs(arr[2])` and `minn`. `maxx` is updated to the maximum of the absolute differences between `abs(arr[2])` and `minn` if `arr[2] > 0` and `minn == maxx`, otherwise `maxx` remains unchanged. `i` is 4, `n` must be at least 4.**
