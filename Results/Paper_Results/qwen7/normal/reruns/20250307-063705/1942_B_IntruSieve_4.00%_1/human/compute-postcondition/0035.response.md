Output State: **`minn` is either increased by 1 to `maxx + 2` if `arr[2] > 0` and `minn == maxx`, or remains 1; `mex` is a list containing `minn - 1` or the absolute difference between `abs(arr[2])` and `minn`; `maxx` is updated to the maximum of the absolute differences between `abs(arr[2])` and `minn` if `arr[2] > 0` and `minn == maxx`, otherwise `maxx` remains unchanged; `i` is 5; `n` must be at least 4; `mex` now contains `minn - 1`.**

Explanation:
- `minn` is incremented by 1, so it is now 1 (assuming it was 0 initially).
- `mex` remains a list containing `minn - 1`, which is now 0.
- The conditions for updating `maxx` and the behavior of `minn` are not triggered because no new information about `arr[2]` is provided, and `minn` is now 1, which does not necessarily mean `minn == maxx`.
- `i` is incremented by 1, so it is now 5.
- `n` must still be at least 4.
- The condition for `mex` remains unchanged.
