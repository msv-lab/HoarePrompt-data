Output State: **`i` is `n-3`, `el` is `s1[n-3]`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is the list obtained by removing the last element from the original `preOne` list, and `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`**.

Explanation: The code calculates `zeroInd` using the function calls `func_1(suffZero, ol + 1)` and `func_1(suffZero, 1)`. However, the actual values of these function calls are not provided, so `zeroInd` is expressed as a mathematical expression involving these function calls. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
