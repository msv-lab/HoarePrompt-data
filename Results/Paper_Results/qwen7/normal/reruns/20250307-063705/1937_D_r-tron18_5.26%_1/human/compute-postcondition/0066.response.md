Postcondition: `i` is `n-3`, `el` is `s1[n-3]`, `ol` is `totalOne - 1` or `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is the list obtained by removing the last element from the original `preOne` list, and `ans[i]` is either `zeroInd - oneInd` or `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`, depending on whether `el == '>'` and the conditions specified in the if and else parts.
