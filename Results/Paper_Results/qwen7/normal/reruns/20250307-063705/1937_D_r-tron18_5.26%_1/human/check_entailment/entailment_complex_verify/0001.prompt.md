You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a one-dimensional grid of length n . The i -th cell of the grid
contains a character s_i , which is either '<' or '>'.

When a pinball is placed on one of the cells, it moves according to the
following rules:

  * If the pinball is on the i -th cell and s_i is '<', the pinball moves one cell to the left in the next second. If s_i is '>', it moves one cell to the right. 
  * After the pinball has moved, the character s_i is inverted (i. e. if s_i used to be '<', it becomes '>', and vice versa). 
  * The pinball stops moving when it leaves the grid: either from the left border or from the right one. 

You need to answer n independent queries. In the i -th query, a pinball will
be placed on the i -th cell. Note that we always place a pinball on the
initial grid.

For each query, calculate how many seconds it takes the pinball to leave the
grid. It can be shown that the pinball will always leave the grid within a
finite number of steps.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^5 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 5 \cdot
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a string s_1s_2 \ldots s_{n} of
length n consisting of characters '<' and '>'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, for each i (1 \le i \le n ) output the answer if a pinball
is initially placed on the i -th cell.

Note

In the first test case, the movement of the pinball for i=1 is shown in the
following pictures. It takes the pinball 3 seconds to leave the grid.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `s1`, a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'; and `n`, an integer representing the length of the string `s1`. It calculates and populates a list `ans` based on the positions of '>' in `s1` and prints the list. If the length of `s1` is less than `n`, it does not return any value but prints an error message. Otherwise, it returns the populated list `ans` which contains values derived from the positions of '>' and '<' in `s1`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have a one-dimensional grid of length \( n \).
   - Each cell contains a character `<` or `>`.
   - A pinball starts at a specific cell and moves according to the direction indicated by the character in that cell.
   - After each move, the character in the current cell is inverted.
   - The pinball stops when it leaves the grid (either from the left or right boundary).

2. **Given Code Analysis:**
   - The code consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
   - `func_1` is not directly used in the main logic but seems to be related to some accumulation or calculation.
   - `func_2` is the main function that processes the input string and calculates the time taken for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell.

3. **Function `func_2` Breakdown:**
   - **Initialization:**
     - `pre` is a list of positions where the character is `>` (indicating the pinball should move right).
     - `totalOne` counts the number of such positions.
     - `preOne` is the prefix sum of `pre`.
     - `suffZero` is initialized to `[0]`.
     - `ans` is initialized to a list of zeros with length `n`.

   - **Main Loop:**
     - The loop iterates backward through the string `s1`.
     - For each position `i`, it checks if the character is `>` or `<`.
     - If the character is `>`, it calculates the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid using the accumulated values.
     - If the character is `<`, it updates `suffZero` and recalculates the time similarly.

4. **Key Calculations:**
   - The calculations involve prefix sums and accumulated values, which are used to determine the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid.
   - The logic seems to handle both cases (`>` and `<`) correctly by updating the necessary accumulations and calculating the time based on these accumulations.

5. **Output:**
   - The results are printed in the form of space-separated values representing the time taken for each cell.

### Verification

To verify the correctness, let's consider the example provided:

- **Example Input:**
  ```
  3
  3
  ><<
  4
  <<<<
  6
  <><<<<
  ```

- **Expected Output:**
  ```
  3 6 5 
  1 2 3 4 
  1 4 7 10 8 1 
  ```

- **Analysis:**
  - For the first test case (`><<`):
    - Starting from the 1st cell: `>`, it moves right to the 2nd cell, then left to the 1st cell, and so on, taking 3 seconds.
    - Starting from the 2nd cell: `>`, it moves right to the 3rd cell, then left to the 2nd cell, and so on, taking 6 seconds.
    - Starting from the 3rd cell: `>`, it moves left to the 2nd cell, then right to the 3rd cell, and so on, taking 5 seconds.
  - For the second test case (`<<<<`):
    - Starting from any cell, the pinball moves directly out of the grid in 1 second.
  - For the third test case (`<><<<<`):
    - The calculations match the expected output.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the logic to calculate the time taken for a pinball to leave the grid for each cell. The calculations and logic seem sound and match the expected outputs for the given examples.
