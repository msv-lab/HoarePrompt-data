Output State: **`i` is `n-3`, `el` is `s1[n-3]`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is the list obtained by removing the last element from the original `preOne` list, `suffZero` is updated to append `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`, `zeroInd` is `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]`, `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)` to `oneInd`. Since `func_1` is not defined, we cannot determine its exact value. However, we know that `oneInd` is now equal to twice the result of `func_1(preOne, zr)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
