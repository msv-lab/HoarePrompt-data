Output State: **`i` is `n-3`, `el` is `s1[n-3]`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is the list obtained by removing the last element from the original `preOne` list, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `2 * preOne[-1]` to the variable `oneInd`. The value of `preOne[-1]` is the last element of the list `preOne`, which was obtained by removing the last element from the original `preOne` list. Therefore, `oneInd` is twice the value of the second-to-last element of the original `preOne` list. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
