Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves simulating the movement of a pinball on a one-dimensional grid where each cell has a direction ('<' or '>'), and the pinball's direction is reversed after each move until it leaves the grid.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: This function calculates the position of the pinball after a certain number of seconds. However, the logic in this function seems flawed because it uses `max(-n, -1 - times)` which does not correctly simulate the pinball's movement. Instead, it should use the actual position of the pinball based on its current direction and the accumulated movements.
   - **func_2**: This function calculates the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell. It uses prefix sums and suffix sums to efficiently compute the required times. The logic here appears to be more aligned with the problem requirements, but let's verify the correctness of the implementation.

3. **Verification**:
   - The function `func_2` correctly initializes the necessary lists (`pre`, `totalOne`, `preOne`, `suffZero`, and `ans`).
   - It iterates backward through the grid, updating the answers based on the current cell's direction and the accumulated movements.
   - The calculations for `zeroInd` and `oneInd` seem to be correctly implemented to account for the pinball's movement and the reversal of directions.

Given the detailed analysis, the main issue lies with `func_1`, which is incorrectly calculating the position of the pinball. The rest of the logic in `func_2` appears to be correctly implementing the solution.

However, since the problem requires the pinball to move based on its current direction and reverse it after each move, and `func_1` is not correctly simulating this, the overall program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
