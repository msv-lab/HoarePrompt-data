Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`.

2. **Determine the Range of the Loop**: The loop iterates over `range(n - 1, -1, -1)`. This means `i` will take values from `n-1` down to `0`.

3. **Initial State of `i`**: Since the loop starts with `i` being `n-1` and decrements by 1 until it reaches `-1`, the initial value of `i` should be `n-1`.

4. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`totalOne`, `n`, `preOne`, `suffZero`, `ans`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted based on the loop head.

5. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0. Therefore, `i` must be initialized to `n-1` to ensure the loop starts and continues executing correctly.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` should be `n-1` to start the loop.
- The other variables (`totalOne`, `n`, `preOne`, `suffZero`, `ans`) remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is `n-1`**
