Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `el` is `'>'.`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * suffZero[-1]`, `oneInd` is `func_1(preOne, len(suffZero) - 1) + func_1(preOne, len(suffZero)) - func_1(preOne, 1)`, `fi` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)`**.

Explanation: The code defines a new variable `fi` which is assigned the value of `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)`. Since the function `func_1` is not defined, we cannot compute its exact numerical value, but we know that `fi` is now holding this difference. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
