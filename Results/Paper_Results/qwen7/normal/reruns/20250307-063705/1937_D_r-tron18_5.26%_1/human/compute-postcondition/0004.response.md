Output State: **`totalOne` is equal to the length of the list `pre`, `n` is the length of the string `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that index, starting from 0, `suffZero` is a list containing `[0]`, `ans` is a list of length `n` where each element is `0`.**

Explanation: The code initializes `ans` as a list of zeros with a length equal to `n`. The values of `totalOne`, `n`, `preOne`, and `suffZero` remain unchanged from their initial states.
