Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `el` is `s1[n-2]`, and `el` is not '>'; `suffZero` is a list with its last element updated to `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`; `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]`, `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, len(suffZero) - 1)`**

Explanation: The code updates `oneInd` by calling `func_1` with `preOne` and `zr` (which is `len(suffZero) - 1`). However, the function `func_1` is not defined, so we cannot determine the exact value of `oneInd`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
