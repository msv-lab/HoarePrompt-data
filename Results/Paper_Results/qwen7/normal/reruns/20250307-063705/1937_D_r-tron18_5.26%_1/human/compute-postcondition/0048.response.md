Output State: **`i` is `n-3`, `el` is `s1[n-3]`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is the list obtained by removing the last element from the original `preOne` list, `zeroInd` is `2 * suffZero[-1]`, `oneInd` is the sum of `func_1(preOne, zr)` and `func_1(preOne, zr + 1)`**.

Explanation: The code updates the variable `oneInd` by adding the results of two function calls `func_1(preOne, zr)` and `func_1(preOne, zr + 1)`. The values of the other variables (`i`, `el`, `ol`, `zr`, `preOne`, and `zeroInd`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
