Output State: **`i` is `n - 4`, `el` is `s1[i]`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is the list obtained by removing the last element from the original `preOne` list, `ans[i]` is either `zeroInd - oneInd` or `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`, `suffZero` is updated to append `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`**

Explanation: The code assigns `oneInd` the value of `2 * preOne[-1]`. This means that `oneInd` now holds twice the value of the last element in the `preOne` list. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
