Output State: **`i` is `n - 4`, `el` is `s1[i]`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is the list obtained by removing the last element from the original `preOne` list, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, totalOne)`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `oneInd` based on the values of `preOne` and the result of `func_1(preOne, 1)`. Specifically, `oneInd` is calculated as `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`. The values of the other variables (`i`, `el`, `ol`, `zr`, and `preOne`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `zeroInd` is updated to `2 * func_1(suffZero, totalOne)` due to the change in the function call.
