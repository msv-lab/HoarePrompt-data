Output State: **`i` is `n-3`, `el` is `s1[n-3]`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is the list obtained by removing the last element from the original `preOne` list, and `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, totalOne)**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)` to the variable `zeroInd`. No other variables are affected. The value of `zeroInd` depends on the function `func_1` applied to `suffZero` and `totalOne`. The other variables retain their initial states.
