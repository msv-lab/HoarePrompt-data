Output State: **All elements in `ans` are calculated based on the final values of `totalOne`, `preOne`, and `suffZero`, with `i` being -1 after the loop completes.**

After all iterations of the loop, the following will be true:
- The variable `i` will be `-1` because the loop decrements `i` from `n-1` to `0` and continues until `i` becomes `-1`.
- The variable `totalOne` will be `0` since it is decremented by `1` in each iteration of the loop until it reaches `0`.
- The variable `preOne` will be an empty list because it is modified in each iteration by removing its last element, and this process continues until it is empty.
- The variable `suffZero` will contain the cumulative sums of the indices plus one, appended in reverse order from the last element to the first, as the loop appends new elements to `suffZero` in each iteration where `el` is not `'> '`.

The list `ans` will be populated with values calculated during each iteration based on the conditions provided within the loop. These calculations depend on the current values of `totalOne`, `preOne`, and `suffZero`, as well as the character `el` which is read from the string `s1` in reverse order. Each value in `ans` represents the difference between certain functions applied to `preOne` and `suffZero`, adjusted by the length of the string `s1` (`n`).
