Output State: **`i` is `n - 4`, `el` is `s1[i]`, `ol` is `totalOne - 1`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is the list obtained by removing the last element from the original `preOne` list, `ans[i]` is either `zeroInd - oneInd` or `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`, depending on whether `ol <= zr`. If `ol <= zr`, then `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, totalOne - 1)` and `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`. If `ol > zr`, then `zeroInd` is `2 * suffZero[-1]`, `oneInd` is `func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, 1)`, and `fi` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)`, `preOne` is updated by removing its last element.**

Explanation: The line `totalOne -= 1` decreases the value of `totalOne` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state. Therefore, `ol` is now `totalOne - 1`. The rest of the variables and their relationships remain as specified in the initial state.
