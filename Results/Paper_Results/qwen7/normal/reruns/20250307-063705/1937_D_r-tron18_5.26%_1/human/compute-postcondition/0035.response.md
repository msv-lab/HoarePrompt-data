Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `el` is `s1[n-2]`, and `el` is not '>'; `suffZero` is a list with its last element updated to `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`; `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`**.

Explanation: The code updates the variable `oneInd` to be twice the value of `preOne[-1]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
