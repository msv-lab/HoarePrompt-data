Output State: **`i` is `n - 4`, `el` is `s1[i]`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is the list obtained by removing the last element from the original `preOne` list, `ans[i]` is either `zeroInd - oneInd` or `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`, `suffZero` is updated to append `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`, `zeroInd` is `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]`, `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `oneInd` to `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`. All other variables remain unchanged. The function `func_1` is called with `preOne` and `zr` as arguments, and its return value is multiplied by 2 to assign to `oneInd`.
