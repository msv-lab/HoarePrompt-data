Output State: **`i` is `n-3`, `el` is `s1[n-3]`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is the list obtained by removing the last element from the original `preOne` list, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, totalOne)`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)**.

Explanation: The code updates the variable `oneInd` by calculating `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `i`, `el`, `ol`, `zr`, `preOne`, and `zeroInd` are kept as they were in the initial state.
