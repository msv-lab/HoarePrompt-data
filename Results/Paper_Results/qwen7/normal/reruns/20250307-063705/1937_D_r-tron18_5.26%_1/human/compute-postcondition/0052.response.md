Postcondition: `i` is `n-3`, `el` is `s1[n-3]`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is the list obtained by removing the last element from the original `preOne` list, `ans[i]` is either `zeroInd - oneInd` if `ol <= zr`, or `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi` if `ol > zr`. Here, `zeroInd` is calculated as `2 * suffZero[-1]` in the else part and as `2 * func_1(suffZero, totalOne)` in the if part. `oneInd` is calculated as `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)` in the if part and as `func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, 1)` in the else part. `fi` is defined as `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)` in the else part.
