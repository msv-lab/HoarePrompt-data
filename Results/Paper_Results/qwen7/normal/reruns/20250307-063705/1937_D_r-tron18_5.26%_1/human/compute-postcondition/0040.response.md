Postcondition: `i` is `n-2`, `el` is `s1[n-2]`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is the list obtained by removing the last element from the original `preOne` list, and `totalOne` is `totalOne - 1`. If `el` is `'> '`, then `suffZero` is unchanged, and `ans[i]` is calculated as `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1` if `zr <= ol`, otherwise `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`. If `el` is not `'> '`, then `suffZero` is updated such that its last element is `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`, and `ans[i]` is calculated based on the values of `zeroInd` and `oneInd` as described.
