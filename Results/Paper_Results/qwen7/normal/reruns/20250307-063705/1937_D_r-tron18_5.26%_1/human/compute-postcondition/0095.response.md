Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `s1`, a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'; and `n`, an integer representing the length of the string `s1`. The function returns a specific value based on the length of the string `s1`. If the length of `s1` is less than `n`, it returns an error message indicating that the length of `s1` is shorter than expected; otherwise, it returns a value indicating that the length of `s1` meets the requirement.**
