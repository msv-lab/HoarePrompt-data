Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `el` is `'> '`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`**.

This means that the variable `zeroInd` has been assigned the value of twice the result of `func_1(suffZero, ol)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
