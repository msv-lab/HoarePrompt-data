Output State: **`i` is `n-3`, `el` is `s1[n-3]`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is the list obtained by removing the last element from the original `preOne` list, `zeroInd` is `2 * suffZero[-1]`, `oneInd` is the value of `func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, 1)`**.

Explanation: The code subtracts the result of `func_1(preOne, 1)` from `oneInd`. Since `oneInd` was initially defined as `func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1)`, after the subtraction, `oneInd` becomes `func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, 1)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
