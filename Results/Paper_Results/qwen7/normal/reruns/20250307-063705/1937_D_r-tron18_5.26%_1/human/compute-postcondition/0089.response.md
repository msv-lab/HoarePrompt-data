Output State: **`i` is `n - 4`, `el` is `s1[i]`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is the list obtained by removing the last element from the original `preOne` list, `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`, `suffZero` is updated to append `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans[i]` to `zeroInd - oneInd`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Specifically, `i`, `el`, `ol`, `zr`, `preOne`, `suffZero`, and `oneInd` retain their initial values. The updated value of `ans[i]` is now explicitly defined as `zeroInd - oneInd`.
