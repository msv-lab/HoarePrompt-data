Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `el` is `s1[n-2]`, `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`, `suffZero` is a list with its last element updated to `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`**

Explanation: The line `ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd` updates the value of `ans[i]` to the result of `zeroInd - oneInd`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
