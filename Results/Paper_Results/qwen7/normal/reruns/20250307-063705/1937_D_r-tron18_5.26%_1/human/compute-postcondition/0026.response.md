Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `el` is `s1[n-2]`, and `el` is not '>'; `suffZero` is a list with its last element updated to `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`; `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `totalOne` to `ol` and the value of `len(suffZero) - 1` to `zr`. No other variables are affected, so their previous states remain unchanged.
