Output State: **`i` is `n - 4`, `el` is `s1[i]`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is the list obtained by removing the last element from the original `preOne` list, `ans[i]` is either `zeroInd - oneInd` or `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`, `suffZero` is updated to append `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`.**

Explanation:
- The line `ol, zr = totalOne, len(suffZero) - 1` updates the values of `ol` and `zr`.
  - `ol` is now assigned the value of `totalOne`.
  - `zr` is now assigned the value of `len(suffZero) - 1`.

All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
