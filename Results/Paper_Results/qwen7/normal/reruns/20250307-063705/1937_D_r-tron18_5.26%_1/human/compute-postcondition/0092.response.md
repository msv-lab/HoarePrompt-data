Postcondition: **`i` is `n - 4`, `el` is `s1[i]`, `ol` is `totalOne - 1` or `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is the list obtained by removing the last element from the original `preOne` list. Depending on the condition, `ans[i]` is either `zeroInd - oneInd` or `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`, and `suffZero` is updated accordingly. If `ol <= zr`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, totalOne - 1)` and `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`, and `preOne` is updated by removing its last element. If `ol > zr`, `zeroInd` is `2 * suffZero[-1]`, `oneInd` is `func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, 1)`, and `fi` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)`, and `preOne` is updated by removing its last element. If `ol > zr` does not hold, `zeroInd` is `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]` and `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)` when `zr <= ol`, otherwise `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`, and `suffZero` is updated to append `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`.**
