### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to simulate the movement of a pinball on a one-dimensional grid where each cell contains either '<' or '>'.
   - The pinball moves according to the direction indicated by the character in the current cell and changes the direction of the character after each move.
   - The pinball stops when it leaves the grid.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the position of the pinball after a certain number of seconds.
   - It uses the list `arr` which stores the positions of the pinball after each second.
   - The formula `arr[-1] - arr[max(-n, -1 - times)]` calculates the position of the pinball after `times` seconds.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function calculates the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell.
   - It uses several lists:
     - `pre`: Stores the indices where the character is '>'.
     - `totalOne`: Counts the number of '>' characters.
     - `preOne`: Accumulated sum of `pre`.
     - `suffZero`: Stores the accumulated sum of positions where the character is '<'.
   - The function iterates backward through the string `s1` and calculates the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each cell.
   - The calculations involve comparing the counts of '>' and '<' characters and using the accumulated sums to determine the positions.

4. **Overall Logic:**
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly handles the movement of the pinball and the inversion of directions.
   - The calculations for the time taken to leave the grid are accurate and follow the problem's requirements.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles the edge case where the length of `s1` is less than `n` by printing an error message.
   - The use of `accumulate` and list operations ensures that the calculations are efficient.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the given program correctly implements the logic to calculate the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` work together to achieve the desired result.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
