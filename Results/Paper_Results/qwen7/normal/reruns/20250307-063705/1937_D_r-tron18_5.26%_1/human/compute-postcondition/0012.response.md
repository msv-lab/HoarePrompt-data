Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `el` is `'> '`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`**

Explanation: The code assigns a new value to `oneInd` based on the existing values of `preOne` and the result of `func_1`. Specifically, `oneInd` is calculated as `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`. The values of the other variables (`i`, `el`, `ol`, `zr`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
