The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `s1`, a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'; and `n`, an integer representing the length of the string `s1`. It calculates and populates a list `ans` based on the positions of '>' in `s1` and prints the list. If the length of `s1` is less than `n`, it does not return any value but prints an error message. Otherwise, it returns the populated list `ans` which contains values derived from the positions of '>' and '<' in `s1`.
