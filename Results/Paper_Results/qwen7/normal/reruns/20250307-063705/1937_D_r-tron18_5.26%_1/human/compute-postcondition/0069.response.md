Output State: **`i` is `n - 4`, `el` is `s1[i]`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is the list obtained by removing the last element from the original `preOne` list, and `ans[i]` is either `zeroInd - oneInd` or `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`, depending on whether `el == '>'` and the conditions specified in the if and else parts.**

Explanation: The code updates the values of `ol` and `zr`. `ol` is now set to `totalOne`, and `zr` is set to `len(suffZero) - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
