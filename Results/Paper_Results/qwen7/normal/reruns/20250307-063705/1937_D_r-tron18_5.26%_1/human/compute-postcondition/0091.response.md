Postcondition: `i` is `n - 4`, `el` is `s1[i]`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is the list obtained by removing the last element from the original `preOne` list, `ans[i]` is either `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1` or `zeroInd - oneInd`, `suffZero` is updated to append `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`. Here, `zeroInd` is `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]` when `zr <= ol`, and `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)` when `zr <= ol`; otherwise, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`.
