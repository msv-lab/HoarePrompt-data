Output State: **`i` is `n-2`; `el` is `s1[n-2]`**

Explanation: The code `el = s1[i]` assigns the value of `s1[i]` to the variable `el`. Given that `i` is initially `n-1`, after executing the line, `i` is decremented by 1, making it `n-2`. The value of `el` is now set to the element at index `n-2` in the list `s1`.
