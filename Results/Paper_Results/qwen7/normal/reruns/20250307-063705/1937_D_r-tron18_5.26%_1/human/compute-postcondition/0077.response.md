Output State: **`i` is `n - 4`, `el` is `s1[i]`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is the list obtained by removing the last element from the original `preOne` list, `zeroInd` is `2 * suffZero[-1]`, `oneInd` is `func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, 1)`, `fi` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)`, and `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`.**

Explanation: The given code updates the value of `ans[i]` to `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`. This means that the value of `ans[i]` is now specifically calculated as `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
