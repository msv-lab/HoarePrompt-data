Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the movement of the pinball according to the given rules. Specifically, the function `func_2` does not accurately calculate the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each query.

To illustrate, let's consider the example given in the problem statement:

- For the input `3 ><<`, the expected output is `3 6 5`.

However, the program does not produce these results. Instead, it seems to be calculating something related to the positions and counts of '>' and '<' characters but not the actual time taken for the pinball to leave the grid.

For instance, in the first query (pinball placed at index 1), the pinball starts at position 1 and moves right to position 2, then left to position 1, and so on, until it leaves the grid. This should take 3 seconds, but the program does not account for the alternating movement and the inversion of the characters correctly.

The program uses complex calculations involving `accumulate` and indices that do not reflect the simple back-and-forth movement of the pinball as described in the problem. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for all potential cases and thus is incorrect.
