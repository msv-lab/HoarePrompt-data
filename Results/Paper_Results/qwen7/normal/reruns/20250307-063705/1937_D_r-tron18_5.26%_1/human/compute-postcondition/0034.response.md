Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `el` is `s1[n-2]`, and `el` is not '>'; `suffZero` is a list with its last element updated to `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`; `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`; `zr` is greater than `ol`**.

Explanation: The code calculates `zeroInd` using the function `func_1` applied to the list `suffZero` with two different arguments. The values of `i`, `el`, `suffZero`, `ol`, and `zr` remain unchanged from the initial state, except that `zeroInd` is now set to the result of the expression `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`. The condition that `zr` is greater than `ol` also remains true.
