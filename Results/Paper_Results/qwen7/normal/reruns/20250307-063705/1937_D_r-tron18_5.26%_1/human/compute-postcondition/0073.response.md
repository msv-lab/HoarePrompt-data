Output State: **`i` is `n - 4`, `el` is `s1[i]`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is the list obtained by removing the last element from the original `preOne` list, `zeroInd` is `2 * suffZero[-1]`, and `ans[i]` is either `zeroInd - oneInd` or `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`, depending on whether `el == '>'` and the conditions specified in the if and else parts.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `zeroInd` to `2 * suffZero[-1]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
