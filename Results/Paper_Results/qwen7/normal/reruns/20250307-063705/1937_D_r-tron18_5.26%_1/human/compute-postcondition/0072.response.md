Output State: **`i` is `n - 4`, `el` is `s1[i]`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is the list obtained by removing the last element from the original `preOne` list, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, totalOne)`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`, `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`**.

Explanation: The line `ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd` calculates the difference between `zeroInd` and `oneInd` and assigns it to `ans[i]`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `i`, `el`, `ol`, `zr`, `preOne`, `zeroInd`, and `oneInd` remain unchanged, and the new value of `ans[i]` is the result of `zeroInd - oneInd`.
