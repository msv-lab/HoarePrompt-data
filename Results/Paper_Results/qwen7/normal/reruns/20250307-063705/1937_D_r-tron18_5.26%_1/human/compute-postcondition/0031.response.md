Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `el` is `s1[n-2]`, `suffZero` is a list with its last element updated to `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]`, `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, len(suffZero) - 1)`, `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`.**

Explanation: The code updates `ans[i]` with the value of `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`. Since `i` is `n-2`, `el` is `s1[n-2]`, and `el` is not '>', `suffZero` is a list with its last element updated to `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]`, and `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, len(suffZero) - 1)`, these values remain unchanged except for `ans[i]` which is now set to `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`.
