Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `el` is `s1[n-2]`, and `el` is not '>'; `suffZero` is a list with its last element updated to `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`.**

Explanation: The code appends a new value to the list `suffZero`. The new value is the last element of `suffZero` plus `i` (which is `n-2`) plus 1. Since the initial state does not specify the exact content of `suffZero`, we only know that the last element of `suffZero` is being updated. The values of `i`, `el`, and the condition `el is not '>'` remain unchanged.
