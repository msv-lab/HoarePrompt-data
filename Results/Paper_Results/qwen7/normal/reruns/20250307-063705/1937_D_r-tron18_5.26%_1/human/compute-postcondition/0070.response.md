Output State: **`i` is `n - 4`, `el` is `s1[i]`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is the list obtained by removing the last element from the original `preOne` list, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`**, and `ans[i]` is either `zeroInd - oneInd` or `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`, depending on whether `el == '>'` and the conditions specified in the if and else parts.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)` to the variable `zeroInd`. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the updated state includes the new value of `zeroInd` while keeping the other variables unchanged.
