To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `ans` is a list where its elements are calculated based on the final values of `totalOne`, `preOne`, and `suffZero`.
   - After the loop completes, `i` is set to -1.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(*ans)
   ```

Given that `i` is -1 after the loop completes, it implies that the loop has finished executing, and the values of `totalOne`, `preOne`, and `suffZero` have been used to populate the `ans` list.

Since the exact values of `totalOne`, `preOne`, and `suffZero` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact contents of `ans`. However, we know that `ans` is populated based on these values.

Therefore, the output will be the elements of the `ans` list, printed as a space-separated sequence.

Output: **[values of ans] (where ans is a list populated based on the final values of totalOne, preOne, and suffZero)**
