Output State: **`i` is `n - 4`, `el` is `s1[i]`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is the list obtained by removing the last element from the original `preOne` list, `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`, `suffZero` is updated to append `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`, `zeroInd` is `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]`, `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans[i]` to `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`. Since `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are defined as `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]` and `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)` respectively, and no other variables are affected, the output state remains as described above.
