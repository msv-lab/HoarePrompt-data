Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `totalOne` is equal to the length of the list `pre`, `n` is the length of the string `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that index, starting from 0, `suffZero` is a list containing `[0]`, `ans` is a list of length `n` where each element is `0`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    el = s1[i]
    if el == '>':
        ol, zr = totalOne, len(suffZero) - 1
        if ol <= zr:
            zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)
            oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)
            ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd
        else:
            zeroInd = 2 * suffZero[-1]
            oneInd = func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1)
            oneInd -= func_1(preOne, 1)
            fi = func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)
            ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi
        preOne.pop()
        totalOne -= 1
    else:
        suffZero.append(suffZero[-1] + i + 1)
        ol, zr = totalOne, len(suffZero) - 1
        if zr <= ol:
            zeroInd = suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]
            oneInd = 2 * func_1(preOne, zr)
            ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1
        else:
            zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)
            oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1]
            ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is `n-2`, `el` is `s1[n-2]`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is the list obtained by removing the last element from the original `preOne` list, and `totalOne` is `totalOne - 1`. If `el` is `'> '`, then `suffZero` is unchanged, and `ans[i]` is calculated as `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1` if `zr <= ol`, otherwise `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`. If `el` is not `'> '`, then `suffZero` is updated such that its last element is `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`, and `ans[i]` is calculated based on the values of `zeroInd` and `oneInd` as described.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is `n-3`, `el` is `s1[n-3]`, `ol` is `totalOne - 1` or `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is the list obtained by removing the last element from the original `preOne` list, and `ans[i]` is either `zeroInd - oneInd` or `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`, depending on whether `el == '>'` and the conditions specified in the if and else parts.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `n - 4`, `el` is `s1[i]`, `ol` is `totalOne - 1` or `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is the list obtained by removing the last element from the original `preOne` list. Depending on the condition, `ans[i]` is either `zeroInd - oneInd` or `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`, and `suffZero` is updated accordingly. If `ol <= zr`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, totalOne - 1)` and `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`, and `preOne` is updated by removing its last element. If `ol > zr`, `zeroInd` is `2 * suffZero[-1]`, `oneInd` is `func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, 1)`, and `fi` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)`, and `preOne` is updated by removing its last element. If `ol > zr` does not hold, `zeroInd` is `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]` and `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)` when `zr <= ol`, otherwise `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`, and `suffZero` is updated to append `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
