Output State: **`i` is `n-3`, `el` is `s1[n-3]`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is the list obtained by removing the last element from the original `preOne` list, and `zeroInd` is `2 * suffZero[-1]`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `2 * suffZero[-1]` to the variable `zeroInd`. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the values of `i`, `el`, `ol`, `zr`, `preOne`, and `s1[n-3]` remain unchanged.
