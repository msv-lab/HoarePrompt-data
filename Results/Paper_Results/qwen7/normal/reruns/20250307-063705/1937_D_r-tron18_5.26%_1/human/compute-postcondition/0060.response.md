Output State: **`i` is `n-3`, `el` is `s1[n-3]`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is the list obtained by removing the last element from the original `preOne` list, `suffZero` is updated to append `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`, `zeroInd` is `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]`, `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`, `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans[i]` based on the expressions for `zeroInd` and `oneInd`. The values of `i`, `el`, `ol`, `zr`, `preOne`, and `suffZero` remain unchanged. The new value of `ans[i]` is calculated as `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`.
