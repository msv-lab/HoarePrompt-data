Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `el` is `s1[n-2]`, and `el` is not '>'; `suffZero` is a list with its last element updated to `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`; `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]**.

Explanation: The code `zeroInd = suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]` calculates the value of `zeroInd` by adding the last two elements of the list `suffZero`. The last element of `suffZero` is `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`, and the second last element is `suffZero[-2]`. Therefore, `zeroInd` is set to the sum of these two values. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
