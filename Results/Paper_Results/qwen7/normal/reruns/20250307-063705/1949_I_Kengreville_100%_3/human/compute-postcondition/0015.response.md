Output State: **`bipartite` is True, `i` will be equal to `n`, and `tot` will be 0.**

Explanation: The variable `bipartite` is assigned the value `True`. This assignment does not affect the values of `i` and `tot`, which remain as they were after the loop completed. Therefore, `i` is still equal to `n`, and `tot` remains 0.
