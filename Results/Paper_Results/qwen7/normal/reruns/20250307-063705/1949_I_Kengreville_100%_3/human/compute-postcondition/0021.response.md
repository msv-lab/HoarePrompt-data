Output State: **`bipartite` is True, `i` is equal to `n`, `ok` is False, `tot` is 0, `coef[i]` is 1, the current value of `i` has not been visited.**

The code `bipartite = True` only updates the value of `bipartite` to `True`. All other variables (`i`, `ok`, `tot`, `coef[i]`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
