Output State: **`i` is 1, `x[0]`, `y[0]`, and `r[0]` are integers input from the user.**

Explanation: The code `x[i], y[i], r[i] = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the user input and assigns them to `x[i]`, `y[i]`, and `r[i]` respectively. Since `i` was initially set to 0, after executing the code, `i` is incremented to 1. The values of `x[0]`, `y[0]`, and `r[0]` are now the integers input by the user. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
