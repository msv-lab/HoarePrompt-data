Postcondition: `bipartite` is True, `i` is equal to `n`, `ok` is True, `tot` is 0, `coef[i]` is 1, and a DFS has been initiated from node `i`, assuming that the node `i` has not been visited. If the node `i` has been visited, the conditions remain as initially stated (i.e., `bipartite` is True, `i` is equal to `n`, `ok` is False, `tot` is 0).
