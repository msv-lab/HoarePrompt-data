Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `bipartite` is True
   - `i` is equal to `n`
   - `ok` is True
   - `tot` is 0
   - `coef[i]` is 1
   - If the node `i` has not been visited, a DFS has been initiated from node `i`.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` is currently equal to `n`, the loop condition `i < n` will be false, meaning the loop will not execute again unless `i` is incremented or `n` is changed.
   - However, the problem specifies that we need to think about the state for the next iteration of the loop. Given that the loop condition is `i < n`, the only way to enter the loop again would be to increment `i` or change `n` such that `i < n` becomes true.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 (since it was equal to `n` at the end of the previous iteration), making `i` equal to `n + 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged because the problem does not suggest changing `n` explicitly.

6. **Update the State**:
   - `bipartite` remains True.
   - `i` is now `n + 1`.
   - `ok` remains True.
   - `tot` remains 0.
   - `coef[i]` is undefined since `i` is out of the range of the original `range(n)`.

Therefore, the updated state for the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`bipartite` is True, `i` is `n + 1`, `ok` is True, `tot` is 0**.
