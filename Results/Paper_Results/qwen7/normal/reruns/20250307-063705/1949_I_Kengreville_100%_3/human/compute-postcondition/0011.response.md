Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `x[i]`, `y[i]`, `r[i]` are integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `x[i], y[i], r[i] = map(int, input().split())` takes three integers as input from the user and assigns them to `x[i]`, `y[i]`, and `r[i]` respectively. Since `i` is initially 3, these assignments update the values of `x[3]`, `y[3]`, and `r[3]`. The conditions and values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
