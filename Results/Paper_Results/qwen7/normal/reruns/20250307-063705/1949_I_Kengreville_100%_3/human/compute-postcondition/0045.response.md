Based on the initial state provided:

- `bipartite` is `True`
- `i` is `n`
- `ok` is `True`
- `tot` is `0`
- All nodes have been visited (`visited[i]` is `True` for all `i`)
- The last node visited has a coefficient of `1`
- The if condition `(ok)` is satisfied

The print statement is:
```python
print('YES')
```

This statement will directly print the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
