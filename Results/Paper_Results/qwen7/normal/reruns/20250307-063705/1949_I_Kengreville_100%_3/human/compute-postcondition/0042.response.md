Output State: `bipartite` is True, `i` is `n`, `ok` is True, `tot` is 0, all nodes have been visited (i.e., `visited[i]` is True for all `i`), and `coef[i]` is 1 for the last node visited.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the value of `i` will be `n` since the loop increments `i` from 0 to `n-1`. The variable `bipartite` remains True as no operation within the loop changes it to False. The variable `ok` remains True because the loop condition does not break unless `bipartite` becomes False or `tot` is 0, which did not happen based on the given states. The variable `tot` remains 0 as there is no operation that modifies it within the loop. All nodes have been visited by the end of the loop, indicated by `visited[i]` being True for all `i`. Additionally, `coef[i]` is set to 1 for the last node visited (`i == n-1`), but since the loop ends when `i` reaches `n`, `coef[i]` is not defined for any `i` in the range `[0, n)`.
