Output State: **`bipartite` is True, `i` is `n + 1`, `ok` is True, `tot` is 0**

Explanation: The line `bipartite = True` does not change the value of `bipartite` since it is already `True`. The values of `i`, `ok`, and `tot` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
