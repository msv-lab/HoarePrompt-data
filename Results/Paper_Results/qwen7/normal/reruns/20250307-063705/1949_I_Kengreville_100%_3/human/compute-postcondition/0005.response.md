Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000; x, r are lists of length n where for each i (0 ≤ i < n), x[i] and r[i] are integers representing the x-coordinate and radius of the i-th disk respectively; visited is a list of boolean values of length n where all elements are False; coef is a list of length n where all elements are None; tot is an integer used to keep track of the total number of disks visited during the current DFS call; bipartite is a boolean variable used to check if the graph formed by the tangency relationships between disks is bipartite; `y` is now a list of length `n` where all elements are `None`.**

The code initializes the `coef` list to contain `None` values for each index from 0 to n-1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
