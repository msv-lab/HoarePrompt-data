Output State: **`bipartite` is True, `i` is `n`, `ok` is True, `tot` is 0, `coef[i]` is 1, and `visited[i]` is False.**

Explanation: The line `bipartite = True` does not change the value of `bipartite` since it is already `True`. All other variables (`i`, `ok`, `tot`, `coef[i]`, and `visited[i]`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
