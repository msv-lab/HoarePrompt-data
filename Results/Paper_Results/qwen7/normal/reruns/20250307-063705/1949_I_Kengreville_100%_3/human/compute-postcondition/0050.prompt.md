You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000. x, y, and r are lists of length n where for each i (0 ≤ i < n), x[i], y[i], and r[i] are integers representing the x-coordinate, y-coordinate, and radius of the i-th disk respectively. visited is a list of boolean values of length n indicating whether the i-th disk has been visited during the DFS process. coef is a list of length n initially set to None, used to store coefficients during the DFS process. tot is an integer used to keep track of the total number of disks visited during the current DFS call. bipartite is a boolean variable used to check if the graph formed by the tangency relationships between disks is bipartite.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    x = [None] * n
    y = [None] * n
    r = [None] * n
    visited = [False] * n
    coef = [None] * n
    for i in range(n):
        x[i], y[i], r[i] = map(int, input().split())
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, `x[i]`, `y[i]`, and `r[i]` will be the last set of integers input by the user for the `n`-th disk, with all values of `x[i]`, `y[i]`, and `r[i]` for `0 ≤ i < n` being the integers input from the user during the loop's execution.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop has completed all its iterations, the index `i` will have reached the value of `n`, meaning the loop has processed all `n` disks. The coordinates (`x[i]`, `y[i]`) and radius (`r[i]`) for the last disk (the `n`-th disk) will be the most recent inputs provided by the user, while the coordinates and radii for the previous disks (from the 0-th to the `(n-1)`-th) will be the inputs given during the corresponding iterations of the loop.
    tot = 0
    bipartite = True
    ok = False
    for i in range(n):
        if not visited[i]:
            coef[i] = 1
            tot = 0
            bipartite = True
            dfs(i)
            ok = ok or bipartite and tot != 0
        
    #State: Output State: `bipartite` is True, `i` is `n`, `ok` is True, `tot` is 0, all nodes have been visited (`visited[i]` is True for all `i`), and `coef[i]` is 1 for the last node visited.
    #
    #This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has processed all nodes up to `n-1`. The variable `bipartite` remains True, suggesting that the graph was determined to be bipartite throughout the process. The variable `ok` is True, indicating that the conditions for the loop to continue were met in each iteration. The variable `tot` remains 0, which might indicate that no cycles were found during the depth-first search (DFS) in any component of the graph. All nodes have been marked as visited, and the `coef` array has been updated such that the last node visited has a coefficient of 1.
    if ok :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
    else :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    #State: `bipartite` is True, `i` is `n`, `ok` is either True or False, `tot` is 0, all nodes have been visited (`visited[i]` is True for all `i`), and the last node visited has a coefficient of 1.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters n, x, y, r, visited, coef, tot, and bipartite. n is an integer within the range of 1 to 1000, and x, y, and r are lists of length n containing integers representing the coordinates and radius of disks respectively. visited is a list of boolean values indicating if a disk has been visited during a DFS process. coef is a list of length n initially set to None, used to store coefficients during the DFS process. tot is an integer tracking the total number of disks visited during the current DFS call. bipartite is a boolean variable checking if the graph formed by tangency relationships between disks is bipartite. The function does not return anything.

The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
