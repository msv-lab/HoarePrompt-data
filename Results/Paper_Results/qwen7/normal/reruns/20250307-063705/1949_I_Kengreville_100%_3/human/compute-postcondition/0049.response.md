Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, x, y, r, visited, coef, tot, and bipartite. n is an integer within the range of 1 to 1000, and x, y, and r are lists of length n containing integers representing the coordinates and radius of disks respectively. visited is a list of boolean values indicating if a disk has been visited during a DFS process. coef is a list of length n initially set to None, used to store coefficients during the DFS process. tot is an integer tracking the total number of disks visited during the current DFS call. bipartite is a boolean variable checking if the graph formed by tangency relationships between disks is bipartite. The function does not return anything.**
