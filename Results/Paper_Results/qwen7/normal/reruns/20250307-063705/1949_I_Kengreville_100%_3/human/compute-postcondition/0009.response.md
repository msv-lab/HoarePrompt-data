Output State: **`i` is 2, `x[0]` is an input integer, `y[0]` is an input integer, `r[0]` is an input integer, `x[i]` is an input integer, `y[i]` is an input integer, `r[i]` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `x[i], y[i], r[i] = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `x[i]`, `y[i]`, and `r[i]` respectively. Since `i` is initially 2, these assignments update the values of `x[2]`, `y[2]`, and `r[2]`. The initial values of `x[0]`, `y[0]`, and `r[0]` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 2 remains valid as no code directly modifies `n`.
