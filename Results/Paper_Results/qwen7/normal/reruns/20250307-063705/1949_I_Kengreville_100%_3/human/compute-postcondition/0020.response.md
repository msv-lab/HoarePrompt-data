Output State: **`bipartite` is True, `i` is equal to `n`, `ok` is False, `tot` is 0, `coef[i]` is 1, the current value of `i` has not been visited, `tot` is 0.**

The code `tot = 0` simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `tot`. Since the initial value of `tot` was also 0, the value of `tot` remains unchanged. All other variables (`bipartite`, `i`, `ok`, `coef[i]`, and the status of `i` being unvisited) remain in their initial states.
