Output State: **`bipartite` is True, `i` is equal to `n`, `ok` is False, `tot` is 0, `coef[i]` is 1, the current value of `i` has not been visited**

The code `coef[i] = 1` assigns the value 1 to `coef[i]`. Since `i` is equal to `n`, `coef[n]` is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `i` must be greater than 0 and `n` must be at least 1 still holds, and the value of `i` has not been visited.
