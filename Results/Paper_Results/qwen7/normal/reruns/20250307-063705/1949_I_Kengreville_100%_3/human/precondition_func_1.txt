`i` is an integer such that `0 <= i < n`, where `n` is the number of disks. `x` and `y` are lists of length `n` containing the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of the centers of the disks respectively. `r` is a list of length `n` containing the radii of the disks respectively. `visited` is a boolean list of length `n` initialized to `False`. `coef` is a list of length `n` initialized to `1` for disks that are initially tangent to at least one other disk and `0` otherwise. `bipartite` is a boolean variable initialized to `True`. `tot` is an integer variable initialized to `0`.
