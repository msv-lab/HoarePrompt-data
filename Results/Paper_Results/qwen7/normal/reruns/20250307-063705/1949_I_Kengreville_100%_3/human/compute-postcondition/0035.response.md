Output State: **`bipartite` is True, `i` is `n`, `ok` is True, `tot` is 0, `coef[i]` is 1, and if `visited[i]` is False, then `dfs(i)` has been called.**

Explanation: The line `coef[i] = 1` assigns the value 1 to the variable `coef[i]`. All other variables retain their previous values. The condition regarding `visited[i]` remains unchanged, meaning if `visited[i]` is False, `dfs(i)` has been called.
