Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` is equal to `n`, `x[i]`, `y[i]`, and `r[i]` are integers input from the user for each `i` from `0` to `n-1`.

This means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the index `i` will have reached the value of `n`, indicating that the loop has processed every disk up to the `n-1`th disk. For each disk `i` (from `0` to `n-1`), the coordinates `x[i]` and `y[i]`, as well as the radius `r[i]`, have been updated with the values input by the user.
