Output State: **`bipartite` is True, `i` is equal to `n`, `ok` is False, `tot` is 0, `coef[i]` is 1, the current value of `i` has not been visited, a DFS (Depth-First Search) has been initiated from node `i`.**

Explanation: The `dfs(i)` function call initiates a depth-first search starting from node `i`. However, since the `dfs` function itself is not provided, we cannot determine the exact changes it might make to the variables. But we know that the `dfs` function starts from node `i`, and the other variables remain unchanged based on the given initial state.
