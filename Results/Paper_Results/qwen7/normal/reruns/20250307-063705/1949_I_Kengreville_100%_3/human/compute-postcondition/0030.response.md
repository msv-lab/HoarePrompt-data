Output State: **`bipartite` is True, `i` is `n + 1`, `ok` is True, `tot` is 0, `dfs(i)` has been called.**

Explanation: The function `dfs(i)` is called with `i` as an argument. However, since no specific changes to variables are returned or directly modified within the given snippet, the values of `bipartite`, `i`, `ok`, and `tot` remain unchanged. The only action taken is the call to `dfs(i)`.
