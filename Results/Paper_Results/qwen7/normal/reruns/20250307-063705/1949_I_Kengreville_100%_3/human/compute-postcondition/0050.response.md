Functionality: **The function processes a set of disks represented by their coordinates and radii. It performs a depth-first search (DFS) on the graph formed by the tangency relationships between these disks to determine if the graph is bipartite. If the graph is bipartite and at least one disk is visited during the DFS, the function prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value but modifies the `visited` and `coef` lists and sets the `bipartite` and `ok` flags based on the DFS results.**
