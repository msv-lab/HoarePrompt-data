Output State: **`bipartite` is True, `i` is `n + 1`, `ok` is True or `bipartite` is True and `tot` is not 0, `tot` is 0, `dfs(i)` has been called.**

Explanation: The variable `ok` is updated to `ok or bipartite and tot != 0`. Given the initial state where `bipartite` is True and `tot` is 0, the condition `bipartite and tot != 0` evaluates to `True and False`, which is `False`. However, since `ok` is initially `True`, the expression `ok or False` remains `True`. Therefore, `ok` remains `True`. The values of `bipartite`, `i`, `tot`, and the fact that `dfs(i)` has been called are unchanged.
