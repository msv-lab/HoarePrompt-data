Output State: `bipartite` is True, `i` is `n`, `ok` is True, `tot` is 0, all nodes have been visited (`visited[i]` is True for all `i`), and `coef[i]` is 1 for the last node visited.

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has processed all nodes up to `n-1`. The variable `bipartite` remains True, suggesting that the graph was determined to be bipartite throughout the process. The variable `ok` is True, indicating that the conditions for the loop to continue were met in each iteration. The variable `tot` remains 0, which might indicate that no cycles were found during the depth-first search (DFS) in any component of the graph. All nodes have been marked as visited, and the `coef` array has been updated such that the last node visited has a coefficient of 1.
