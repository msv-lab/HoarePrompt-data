Output State: **`bipartite` is True, `i` is `n`, `ok` is True, `tot` is 0, `coef[i]` is 1, and `visited[i]` is False.**

Explanation: The line `tot = 0` sets the variable `tot` to 0. All other variables (`bipartite`, `i`, `ok`, `coef[i]`, and `visited[i]`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
