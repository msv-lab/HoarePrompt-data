n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000. x, y, and r are lists of length n where for each i (0 ≤ i < n), x[i], y[i], and r[i] are integers representing the x-coordinate, y-coordinate, and radius of the i-th disk respectively. visited is a list of boolean values of length n indicating whether the i-th disk has been visited during the DFS process. coef is a list of length n initially set to None, used to store coefficients during the DFS process. tot is an integer used to keep track of the total number of disks visited during the current DFS call. bipartite is a boolean variable used to check if the graph formed by the tangency relationships between disks is bipartite.
