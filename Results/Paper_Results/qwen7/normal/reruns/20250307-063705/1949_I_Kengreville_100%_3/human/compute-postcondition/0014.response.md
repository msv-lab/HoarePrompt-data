Output State: **After the loop has completed all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, and `tot` will be 0.**

Explanation: The variable `tot` is initialized to 0. The loop processes all `n` disks, setting `i` to `n` after completing all iterations. No other changes occur to the variables, so `tot` remains 0.
