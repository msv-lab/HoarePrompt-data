Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, `x[i]`, `y[i]`, and `r[i]` will be the last set of integers input by the user for the `n`-th disk, with all values of `x[i]`, `y[i]`, and `r[i]` for `0 â‰¤ i < n` being the integers input from the user during the loop's execution.

In simpler terms, after the loop has completed all its iterations, the index `i` will have reached the value of `n`, meaning the loop has processed all `n` disks. The coordinates (`x[i]`, `y[i]`) and radius (`r[i]`) for the last disk (the `n`-th disk) will be the most recent inputs provided by the user, while the coordinates and radii for the previous disks (from the 0-th to the `(n-1)`-th) will be the inputs given during the corresponding iterations of the loop.
