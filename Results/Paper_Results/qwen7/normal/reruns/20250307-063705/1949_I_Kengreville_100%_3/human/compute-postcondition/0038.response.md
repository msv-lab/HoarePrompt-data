Output State: **`bipartite` is True, `i` is `n`, `ok` is False, `tot` is 0, `coef[i]` is 1, and `visited[i]` is True.**

Explanation: The `dfs(i)` function call initiates a depth-first search starting from node `i`. This function typically marks nodes as visited and updates the bipartite property of the graph. Since the initial state of `ok` is `True`, the `dfs` function likely checks if the graph remains bipartite during the traversal. If a conflict is found (e.g., a back edge connecting nodes of the same color), `ok` would be set to `False`. Additionally, `visited[i]` would be set to `True` after the node `i` is visited. The values of `bipartite`, `i`, `tot`, and `coef[i]` remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the `dfs` function, which is not specified here.
