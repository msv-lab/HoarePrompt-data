State: **`bipartite` is True, `i` is equal to `n`, `ok` is False, `tot` is 0, `i` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 1**

### Explanation:
1. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.
2. **Loop Execution Condition**: For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1 because `range(n)` will generate a sequence from 0 to `n-1`. If `n` is less than 1, the sequence will be empty, and the loop will not execute.
3. **Initial Value of `i`**: The initial value of `i` is set to `n`, but for the loop to start, `i` must be greater than 0 (since `range(n)` starts from 0). Therefore, `i` must be greater than 0.

The other variables (`bipartite`, `ok`, and `tot`) are not directly involved in the loop's execution condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start.
