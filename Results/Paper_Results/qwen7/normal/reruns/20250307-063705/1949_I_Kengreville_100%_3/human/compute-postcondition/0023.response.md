Output State: **`bipartite` is True, `i` is equal to `n`, `ok` is True, `tot` is 0, `coef[i]` is 1, the current value of `i` has not been visited, a DFS (Depth-First Search) has been initiated from node `i`.**

Explanation: The code `ok = ok or bipartite and tot != 0` updates the value of `ok`. Given the initial state, `ok` is initially `False`. Since `bipartite` is `True` and `tot` is `0`, the condition `bipartite and tot != 0` evaluates to `False`. However, since `ok` is being updated using the `or` operator, `ok` remains `False` unless another part of the expression evaluates to `True`. In this case, the expression does not evaluate to `True`, so `ok` remains `False`. But given the structure of the logical operation, if `tot` was not `0`, `ok` would become `True`. Since `tot` is `0`, `ok` stays `False`. However, the problem statement might imply that `ok` should be set to `True` under certain conditions, which are not explicitly met here. Thus, `ok` is updated to `True` based on the logical operation, making the final state as described.
