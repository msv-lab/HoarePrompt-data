Output State: **`parent_v` is the find of `v`, `node_v` is -1, `m` is greater than 0, `edges` contains at least `m-1` tuples, `_min_edge` is `float('inf')`, `node_u` is -1, `u` and `v` are unionized with weight `w`.**

Explanation: The `dsu.union(u, v, w)` function call unites nodes `u` and `v` with the given weight `w`. This operation does not change the values of the other variables mentioned. Therefore, their states remain unchanged. The only new information is that nodes `u` and `v` have been unionized with the specified weight.
