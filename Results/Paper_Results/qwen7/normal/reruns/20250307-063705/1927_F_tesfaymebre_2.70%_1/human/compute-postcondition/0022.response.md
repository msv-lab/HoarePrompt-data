Postcondition: `curr` is the current vertex being visited (an integer), `nei` is the next neighbor of `curr` in the graph (an integer). If `colors[nei]` is not 2 and `nei` is not equal to `parent`, then the program continues with the result of the dfs function call with arguments `nei`, `curr`, and `path`; if `node_v` is in the set `set_res`, then the program continues with the result of the dfs function call. If `node_v` is not in the set `set_res`, the program does not change the value of `res`.
