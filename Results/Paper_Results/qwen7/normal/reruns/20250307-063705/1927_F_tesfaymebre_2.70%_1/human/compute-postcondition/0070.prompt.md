You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: (n, m) is a tuple of two integers where 3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ min(⌊n(n - 1)/2⌋, 2⋅10^5), edges is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (u, v, w) representing an edge between vertices u and v with weight w, and dsu is an instance of a DSU (Disjoint Set Union) class initialized with n + 1 elements.
def func_6():
    n, m = func_3()
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    edges = []
    for i in range(m):
        u, v, w = func_3()
        
        graph[u].append(v)
        
        graph[v].append(u)
        
        edges.append((w, u, v))
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will have executed `m` times since `m` is the number of iterations specified in the `range(m)` function. After all iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `m-1`. The variable `m` remains the value returned by `func_3()`. The variables `u`, `v`, and `w` will hold the values returned by `func_3()` during the last iteration of the loop. The `graph` will contain all the vertices and their corresponding edges as appended in each iteration. Specifically, for every pair `(u, v)` added to the graph, both `graph[u]` and `graph[v]` will include the other vertex. The `edges` list will contain `m` tuples, each representing an edge with its weight and the two vertices it connects.
    #
    #In summary, the final state will have `i` set to `m-1`, `m` unchanged from its initial value, `u`, `v`, and `w` holding the values from the last call to `func_3()`, the `graph` fully populated with all the edges added, and the `edges` list containing all the weights and connections as tuples.
    edges.sort(reverse=True)
    dsu = DSU(n + 1)
    _min_edge = float('inf')
    node_u = -1
    node_v = -1
    for (w, u, v) in edges:
        parent_u = dsu.find(u)
        
        parent_v = dsu.find(v)
        
        if parent_u == parent_v:
            dsu.union(u, v, w)
            if dsu.min_edge[parent_u] < _min_edge:
                _min_edge = dsu.min_edge[parent_u]
                node_u = u
                node_v = v
        else:
            dsu.union(u, v, w)
        
    #State: All vertices in the graph are connected, and the minimum edge weight among all connected components is stored in \_min\_edge. Node\_u and Node\_v store the vertices of the minimum edge.
    colors = [0] * (n + 1)
    res = dfs(node_u, -1, [])
    print(_min_edge, len(res))
    #This is printed: _min_edge, len(res)
    print(*res)
    #This is printed: [Node_u, Node_v, ...] (where the list contains nodes visited during the DFS starting from Node_u)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but uses a tuple (n, m) of two integers where 3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ min(⌊n(n - 1)/2⌋, 2⋅10^5), a list of tuples representing edges where each tuple contains three integers (u, v, w) indicating an edge between vertices u and v with weight w, and an instance of a DSU (Disjoint Set Union) class initialized with n + 1 elements. The function returns a value based on the operations performed using these inputs.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
