Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `colors[curr]` is set to 1, `curr` is the current vertex being visited (an integer), `parent` is the parent vertex in the DFS traversal (an integer), `path` is a list representing the current path in the DFS traversal (a list of integers) with `curr` appended to it.
Code of the loop:
for nei in graph[curr]:
    if colors[nei] != 2 and nei != parent:
        res = dfs(nei, curr, path)
        set_res = set(res)
        if res and node_v in set_res:
            return res


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `colors[curr]` is set to 1, `curr` is the current vertex being visited (an integer), `parent` is the parent vertex in the DFS traversal (an integer), `path` is a list representing the current path in the DFS traversal (a list of integers) with `curr` appended to it, `graph[curr]` contains at least one neighbor, `colors[nei]` is not 2, `nei` is not equal to `parent`, and either the result `res` from the DFS function call is empty or the vertex `nei` is not in the set of results `set_res`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `curr` is the current vertex being visited (an integer), `nei` is the next neighbor of `curr` in the graph (an integer). If `colors[nei]` is not 2 and `nei` is not equal to `parent`, then the program continues with the result of the dfs function call with arguments `nei`, `curr`, and `path`; if `node_v` is in the set `set_res`, then the program continues with the result of the dfs function call. If `node_v` is not in the set `set_res`, the program does not change the value of `res`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `curr` is the current vertex being visited (an integer), `nei` is the next neighbor of `curr` in the graph (an integer). If `colors[nei]` is not 2 and `nei` is not equal to `parent`, then `res` is transformed into a set called `set_res`, and if `node_v` is in `set_res`, the function returns `res`. If `node_v` is not in `set_res`, the function does not change `res`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
