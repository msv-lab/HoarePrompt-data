Output State: **`parent_v` is the root node of `v`, `node_v` is -1, `m` is greater than 0, `edges` contains at least `m` tuples, `_min_edge` is `float('inf')`, `node_u` is -1, and `parent_u` is not equal to `parent_v`.**

Explanation: The `dsu.union(u, v, w)` function call unites nodes `u` and `v` with weight `w`. However, the specific values of `u` and `v` are not provided, so their parent relationships cannot be explicitly stated. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
