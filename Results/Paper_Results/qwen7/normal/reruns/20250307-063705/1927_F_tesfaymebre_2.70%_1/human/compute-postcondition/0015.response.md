Postcondition: `colors[curr]` is set to 1, `curr` is the current vertex being visited (an integer), `parent` is the parent vertex in the DFS traversal (an integer), `path` is a list representing the current path in the DFS traversal (a list of integers) with `curr` appended to it, `graph[curr]` contains at least one neighbor, `colors[nei]` is not 2, `nei` is not equal to `parent`, and either the result `res` from the DFS function call is empty or the vertex `nei` is not in the set of results `set_res`.
