Output State: **`colors` is a list of length `n + 1` where all elements are 0, `_min_edge` stores the minimum edge weight among all connected components, `Node_u` and `Node_v` store the vertices of the minimum edge.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `colors` with `n + 1` elements, all set to 0. This list does not affect the values of `_min_edge`, `Node_u`, and `Node_v`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
