Functionality: **The function processes a graph represented by vertices and weighted edges. It first constructs the graph and sorts the edges in descending order of their weights. Then, it uses the Disjoint Set Union (DSU) data structure to find the minimum spanning tree (MST) of the graph. Specifically, it identifies the minimum-weight edge that connects different components of the graph. After finding the MST, it performs a depth-first search (DFS) starting from one of the vertices involved in the minimum-weight edge to determine the path in the MST. Finally, it prints the weight of the minimum-weight edge and the sequence of nodes visited during the DFS traversal.**
