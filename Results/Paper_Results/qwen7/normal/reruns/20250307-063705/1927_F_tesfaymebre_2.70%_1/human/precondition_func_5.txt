(n, m) is a tuple of two integers where 3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ min(⌊n(n - 1)/2⌋, 2⋅10^5), edges is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (u, v, w) representing an edge between vertices u and v with weight w, and dsu is an instance of a DSU (Disjoint Set Union) class initialized with n + 1 elements.
