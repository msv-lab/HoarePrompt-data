Output State: **`node_u` is `u`, `_min_edge` is `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]`, `parent_v` is the `find` of `v`, `node_v` is `-1`, `m` is greater than `0`, `edges` contains at least `m-1` tuples, `node_u` is `-1`, `u` and `v` are unionized with weight `w`.**

Explanation: The line `node_u = u` assigns the value of `u` to `node_u`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
