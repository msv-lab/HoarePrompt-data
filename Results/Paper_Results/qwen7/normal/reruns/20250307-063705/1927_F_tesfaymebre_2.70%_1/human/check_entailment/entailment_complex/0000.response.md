Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding a simple cycle in a graph where the weight of the lightest edge in the cycle is minimal. The solution uses a combination of graph construction, sorting edges by weight, and a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) data structure to identify the minimum spanning tree (MST) and then perform a DFS to find the required cycle.

2. **Graph Construction and Edge Sorting**:
   - `func_6` constructs the graph and sorts the edges in descending order of their weights.
   - This ensures that when we start forming the MST, we consider the heaviest edges first, which helps in identifying cycles early.

3. **Disjoint Set Union (DSU)**:
   - `func_6` uses DSU to manage connected components and track the minimum edge weight in each component.
   - When an edge is added that connects two different components, it updates the minimum edge weight and keeps track of the vertices involved in this edge.

4. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:
   - `dfs` function performs a DFS starting from one of the vertices involved in the minimum-weight edge identified in the MST.
   - This helps in tracing the path in the MST, ensuring that the cycle found is simple and includes the minimum-weight edge.

5. **Handling Test Cases**:
   - `func_7` processes multiple test cases, ensuring that each test case adheres to the problem constraints and correctly calls `func_6` for each test case.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The solution handles the constraints effectively, including the upper limit on the number of test cases and the number of edges per test case.
   - The use of DSU and sorting ensures that the algorithm runs efficiently even for large graphs.

Given the detailed explanation and the correctness of each function in handling the problem requirements, the overall implementation appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
