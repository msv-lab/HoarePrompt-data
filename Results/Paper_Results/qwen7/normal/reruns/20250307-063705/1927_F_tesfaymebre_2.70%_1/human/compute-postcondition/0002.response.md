Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{test_cases} \leq 10^4\)**

Explanation: The function `func_6()` is called, but since no specific implementation of `func_6()` is provided, it is assumed that the function does not modify the value of `test_cases`. Therefore, the value of `test_cases` remains unchanged.
