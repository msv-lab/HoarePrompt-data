Precondition: **test_cases is an integer such that 1 ≤ test_cases ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of two integers n and m such that 3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ min(\frac{n\cdot(n - 1)}{2}, 2 \cdot 10^5), and m lines describing the edges of the graph, where each line contains three integers u, v, and w representing an edge between vertices u and v with weight w (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v, 1 ≤ w ≤ 10^6).**
