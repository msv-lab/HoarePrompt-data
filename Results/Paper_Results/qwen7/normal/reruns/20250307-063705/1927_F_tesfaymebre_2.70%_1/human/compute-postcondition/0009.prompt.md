You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: test_cases is an integer such that 1 ≤ test_cases ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of two integers n and m such that 3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ min(\frac{n\cdot(n - 1)}{2}, 2 \cdot 10^5), and m lines describing the edges of the graph, where each line contains three integers u, v, and w representing an edge between vertices u and v with weight w (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v, 1 ≤ w ≤ 10^6).
def func_7():
    test_cases = func_1()
    for _ in range(test_cases):
        func_6()
        
    #State: `test_cases` is an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{test_cases} \leq 10^4\)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter test_cases, which is an integer between 1 and 10^4. For each test case, it processes two integers n and m, where 3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ min(\frac{n\cdot(n - 1)}{2}, 2 \cdot 10^5), and m lines describing the edges of the graph. Each edge is represented by three integers u, v, and w, indicating an edge between vertices u and v with weight w (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v, 1 ≤ w ≤ 10^6). The function does not return any value explicitly but processes the input according to the described structure.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
