Reasoning:
The provided code appears to correctly solve the problem of finding a simple cycle with the minimal weight of the lightest edge. Here's a breakdown of why the code is correct:

1. **Graph Representation**: The graph is represented using an adjacency list (`graph`) and a list of edges (`edges`). This allows efficient access to the neighbors of each vertex and the edges connecting them.

2. **Disjoint Set Union (DSU)**: The DSU class is used to manage the connected components of the graph. It helps in efficiently finding and merging sets of vertices. The `union` method ensures that the minimum edge weight in each set is tracked correctly.

3. **Edge Sorting and Union-Find**: The edges are sorted in descending order of their weights. This ensures that when we process the edges, we can find the smallest-weight cycle by the time we encounter a cycle.

4. **Cycle Detection and Minimum Edge Weight**: During the processing of edges, the algorithm detects cycles by checking if the two endpoints of an edge belong to the same connected component. If they do, a cycle is detected. The algorithm keeps track of the minimum edge weight in the cycle and updates the vertices involved in the cycle.

5. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Once a cycle is detected, a DFS is performed to trace the cycle and print the vertices in the cycle. The DFS ensures that the cycle is traced correctly and prints the vertices in the required order.

6. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The outer loop in `func_7` handles multiple test cases, ensuring that the solution is applied to each test case independently.

Given the above points, the code logic aligns with the problem requirements and should work correctly for the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
