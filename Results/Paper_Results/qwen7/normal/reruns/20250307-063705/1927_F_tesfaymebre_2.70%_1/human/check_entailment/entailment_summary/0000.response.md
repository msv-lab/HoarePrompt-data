Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires finding a simple cycle in an undirected weighted graph with the minimum weight of the lightest edge in the cycle.
2. **Key Components of the Solution**:
   - **Graph Representation**: The graph is represented using an adjacency list (`graph`) and a list of edges (`edges`).
   - **Edge Sorting**: Edges are sorted in descending order of their weights.
   - **Disjoint Set Union (DSU)**: Used to manage connected components and find cycles.
   - **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Used to trace the path in the minimum spanning tree (MST) and find the cycle.
3. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_3()**: Reads the number of test cases, ensuring it's within the specified range.
   - **func_4()**: Reads the edges of the graph and returns them as a list of tuples.
   - **func_6()**: Constructs the graph, sorts edges, finds the MST, and identifies the minimum-weight edge that forms a cycle.
   - **dfs()**: Performs DFS to trace the path in the MST and find the cycle.
   - **func_7()**: Processes each test case by calling `func_6()`.

Given the detailed execution summaries, the solution correctly follows the steps required to solve the problem:
- It reads the input correctly.
- It constructs the graph and sorts the edges.
- It uses DSU to identify cycles and find the MST.
- It performs DFS to trace the path and find the cycle.
- It prints the correct output format.

Since all functions work together to achieve the desired outcome and the problem constraints are handled appropriately, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
