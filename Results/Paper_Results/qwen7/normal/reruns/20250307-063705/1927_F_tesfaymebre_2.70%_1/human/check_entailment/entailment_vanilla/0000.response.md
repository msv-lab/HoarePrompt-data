### Reasoning:

1. **Graph Representation and Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly uses `defaultdict` to represent the graph as an adjacency list.
   - It reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.

2. **Edge Sorting:**
   - The edges are sorted in reverse order based on their weights. This is done to process the heaviest edges first, which helps in finding cycles with lighter edges later.

3. **Disjoint Set Union (DSU) Data Structure:**
   - A DSU (Union-Find) data structure is used to manage the connected components of the graph.
   - The DSU maintains a record of the minimum edge weight for each component, which is crucial for identifying cycles with the smallest edge weight.

4. **Cycle Detection and Minimum Edge Weight:**
   - During the union operation, if two nodes belong to the same component, a cycle is detected.
   - The program updates the minimum edge weight and records the nodes involved in the cycle.

5. **DFS Traversal:**
   - A depth-first search (DFS) is used to find the exact cycle involving the nodes identified earlier.
   - The DFS ensures that the cycle is simple (no repeated vertices).

6. **Output Format:**
   - The output format matches the problem requirements, printing the minimum edge weight and the number of vertices in the cycle, followed by the vertices in traversal order.

### Analysis:
- The program follows a logical approach to solve the problem.
- The use of DSU and DFS is appropriate for detecting cycles and identifying the minimum edge weight.
- The code handles all the constraints and requirements specified in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The given program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description and the steps outlined above.

### Final Answer:
