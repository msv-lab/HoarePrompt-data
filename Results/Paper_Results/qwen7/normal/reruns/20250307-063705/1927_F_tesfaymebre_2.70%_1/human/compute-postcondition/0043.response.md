Output State: **`parent_v` is the find of `v`, `node_v` is -1, `m` is greater than 0, `edges` contains at least `m-1` tuples, `_min_edge` is `float('inf')`, `node_u` is -1**

Explanation: The code `parent_v = dsu.find(v)` assigns the find of `v` to the variable `parent_v`. This operation does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the values of `node_v`, `m`, `edges`, `_min_edge`, and `node_u` remain unchanged from their initial states.
