Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4 after calling `func_1()`.**

Explanation: The code `test_cases = func_1()` assigns the value returned by `func_1()` to `test_cases`. Since the exact value of `test_cases` depends on the implementation of `func_1()`, which is not provided, we can only state that `test_cases` is an integer within the specified range. All other preconditions remain unchanged.
