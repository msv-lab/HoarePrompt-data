Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `w`, `u`, and `v`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as there are tuples in the `edges` list.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `parent_v` is the root node of `v`.
   - `node_v` is -1.
   - `m` is greater than 0.
   - `edges` contains at least `m` tuples.
   - `_min_edge` is `float('inf')`.
   - `node_u` is -1.

4. **Loop body effect**:
   - If `parent_u` is equal to `parent_v`, then `_min_edge` is updated to `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]`, `node_v` is set to `v`, `node_u` is set to `u`, and the union operation between nodes `u` and `v` with weight `w` has been performed.
   - If `parent_u` is not equal to `parent_v`, then no changes are made to `_min_edge`, `node_v`, `node_u`, and `parent_u` remains unchanged.

5. **Adjusting the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues based on the presence of tuples in `edges`, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the `edges` list itself. Each iteration consumes one tuple from `edges`.
   - Therefore, after one iteration, `edges` will contain at least `m-1` tuples.

6. **Final state after the next iteration**:
   - `parent_v` remains the same.
   - `node_v` remains -1 unless `parent_u` equals `parent_v`, but since we don't know the value of `parent_u` yet, we assume it hasn't changed.
   - `m` remains greater than 0.
   - `edges` now contains at least `m-1` tuples.
   - `_min_edge` may or may not have been updated depending on the condition.
   - `node_u` remains -1 unless `parent_u` equals `parent_v`, but since we don't know the value of `parent_u` yet, we assume it hasn't changed.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `edges` now contains at least `m-1` tuples.

**State: **`parent_v` is the root node of `v`, `node_v` is -1, `m` is greater than 0, `edges` contains at least `m-1` tuples, `_min_edge` is `float('inf')`, `node_u` is -1**.
