Postcondition: `colors[curr]` is set to 1, `curr` is the current vertex being visited (an integer), `parent` is the parent vertex in the DFS traversal (an integer), `path` is a list representing the current path in the DFS traversal (a list of integers) with `curr` appended to it, `graph[curr]` contains at least one neighbor, `colors[nei]` is not 2, `nei` is not equal to `parent`, `res` is the result returned from the dfs function call, `set_res` is a set containing the elements of `res`, and either `res` is empty or `node_v` is not in `set_res`.
