Output State: **`parent_v` is the find of `v`, `parent_u` is the find of `u`, `node_v` is either `v` or `-1`, `node_u` is either `u` or `-1`, `m` is greater than `0`, `edges` contains at least `m-2` tuples, `dsu.union(u, v, w)` has been called, which means `u` and `v` have been unionized under the condition of weight `w`.**

In this output state, the union operation `dsu.union(u, v, w)` has been performed, which unites nodes `u` and `v` under the specified edge weight `w`. The other variables retain their initial conditions or states as they were not directly affected by the union operation.
