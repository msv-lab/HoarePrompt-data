Output State: **The program returns a list `res` which contains the current path in the DFS traversal and any additional nodes discovered during the traversal, where `set_res` includes the node `node_v`.**

This means that the `dfs` function has been called with the current vertex `curr`, its parent `parent`, and the updated path `path`. The function has returned a list `res` that includes the current path and potentially additional nodes found during the traversal. Since `node_v` is present in the set `set_res`, it indicates that `node_v` was part of the traversal results.
