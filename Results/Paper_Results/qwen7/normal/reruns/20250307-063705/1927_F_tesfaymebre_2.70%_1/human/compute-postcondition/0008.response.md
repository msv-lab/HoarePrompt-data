Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter test_cases, which is an integer between 1 and 10^4. For each test case, it processes two integers n and m, where 3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ min(\frac{n\cdot(n - 1)}{2}, 2 \cdot 10^5), and m lines describing the edges of the graph. Each edge is represented by three integers u, v, and w, indicating an edge between vertices u and v with weight w (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v, 1 ≤ w ≤ 10^6). The function does not return any value explicitly but processes the input according to the described structure.**
