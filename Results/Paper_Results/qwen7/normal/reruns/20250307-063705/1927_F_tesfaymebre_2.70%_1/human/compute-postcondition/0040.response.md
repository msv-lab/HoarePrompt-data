Postcondition: **`parent_v` is the root node of `v`, `node_v` is -1, `m` is greater than 0, `edges` contains at least `m` tuples, `_min_edge` is `float('inf')`, `node_u` is -1. If `parent_u` is equal to `parent_v`, then `_min_edge` is updated to `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]`, `node_v` is set to `v`, `node_u` is set to `u`, and the union operation between nodes `u` and `v` with weight `w` has been performed. If `parent_u` is not equal to `parent_v`, then no changes are made to `_min_edge`, `node_v`, `node_u`, and `parent_u` remains unchanged.**
