Output State: **`res` is the result of the dfs function call with arguments `nei`, `curr`, and `path`; `curr` is the current vertex being visited (an integer); `nei` is the next neighbor of `curr` in the graph (an integer)**.

Explanation: The line `res = dfs(nei, curr, path)` calls the `dfs` function with the arguments `nei`, `curr`, and `path`. The result of this function call is stored in the variable `res`. The values of `curr` and `nei` remain unchanged from their initial state.
