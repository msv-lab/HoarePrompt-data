Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (a placeholder for the loop index) and the variable `test_cases`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of Variables**: 
   - The variable `test_cases` is given as an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{test_cases} \leq 10^4\) after calling `func_1()`.

3. **Check the Condition for Loop Execution**: 
   - The loop will execute as long as `test_cases` is greater than 0. Since `test_cases` is guaranteed to be between 1 and \(10^4\), it will always be greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the State**: 
   - We need to ensure that `test_cases` is within the specified range and that the loop can start executing. Given that `test_cases` is already an integer within the required range, no additional adjustments are needed for `test_cases`.
   - The loop uses `_` as a placeholder, which means it doesn't depend on any specific value but rather on the fact that the loop should run `test_cases` times.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be considered is `test_cases`, and it must be within the specified range.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`test_cases` is an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{test_cases} \leq 10^4\)**
