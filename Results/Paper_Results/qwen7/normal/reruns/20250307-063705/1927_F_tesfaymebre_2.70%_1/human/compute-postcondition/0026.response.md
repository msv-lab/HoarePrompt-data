Output State: **`res` is transformed into a set called `set_res`, `curr` is the current vertex being visited (an integer), `nei` is the next neighbor of `curr` in the graph (an integer)**.

Explanation: The line `set_res = set(res)` transforms the list or set `res` into a set data structure and assigns it to `set_res`. The variables `curr` and `nei` remain unchanged from their initial state.
