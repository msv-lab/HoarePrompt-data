Output State: **`parent_v` is the find of `v`, `parent_u` is the find of `u`, `_min_edge` is updated to `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]` if `dsu.min_edge[parent_u] < _min_edge`, `m` is greater than `0`, `edges` contains at least `m-2` tuples, `node_u` is either `u` or `-1`, `node_v` is either `v` or `-1`, `dsu.union(u, v, w)` has been called.**

Explanation: The `dsu.union(u, v, w)` function call unites nodes `u` and `v` with weight `w`. This operation does not change the values of `parent_v`, `parent_u`, `_min_edge`, `m`, `edges`, `node_u`, or `node_v`. However, it updates the union-find structure internally, which is reflected in the `parent` values of `u` and `v` (though their specific new values are not provided). The `_min_edge` is updated if the condition `dsu.min_edge[parent_u] < _min_edge` is met.
