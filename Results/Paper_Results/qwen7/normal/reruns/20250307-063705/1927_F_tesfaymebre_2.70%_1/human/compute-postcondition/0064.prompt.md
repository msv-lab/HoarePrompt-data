Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `node_v` is -1, the loop will have executed `m` times since `m` is the number of iterations specified in the `range(m)` function. After all iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `m-1`. The variable `m` remains the value returned by `func_3()`. The variables `u`, `v`, and `w` will hold the values returned by `func_3()` during the last iteration of the loop. The `graph` will contain all the vertices and their corresponding edges as appended in each iteration. Specifically, for every pair `(u, v)` added to the graph, both `graph[u]` and `graph[v]` will include the other vertex. The `edges` list will contain `m` tuples, each representing an edge with its weight and the two vertices it connects. The `edges` list is sorted in descending order based on the weights of the edges. A new variable `_min_edge` is assigned the value `float('inf')`. `node_u` is assigned the value `-1`.
Code of the loop:
for w, u, v in edges:
    parent_u = dsu.find(u)
    parent_v = dsu.find(v)
    if parent_u == parent_v:
        dsu.union(u, v, w)
        if dsu.min_edge[parent_u] < _min_edge:
            _min_edge = dsu.min_edge[parent_u]
            node_u = u
            node_v = v
    else:
        dsu.union(u, v, w)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `parent_v` is the root node of `v`, `node_v` is -1, `m` is greater than 0, `edges` contains at least `m` tuples, `_min_edge` is `float('inf')`, `node_u` is -1. If `parent_u` is equal to `parent_v`, then `_min_edge` is updated to `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]`, `node_v` is set to `v`, `node_u` is set to `u`, and the union operation between nodes `u` and `v` with weight `w` has been performed. If `parent_u` is not equal to `parent_v`, then no changes are made to `_min_edge`, `node_v`, `node_u`, and `parent_u` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `parent_v` is the find of `v`, `node_v` is either `v` or `-1`, `_min_edge` is updated to `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]` if `dsu.min_edge[parent_u] < _min_edge`, `m` is greater than `0`, `edges` contains at least `m-1` tuples, `node_u` is either `u` or `-1`, and if `parent_u` is equal to `parent_v`, `u` and `v` are unionized with weight `w`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `parent_v` is the find of `v`, `parent_u` is the find of `u`, `_min_edge` is updated to `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]` if `dsu.min_edge[parent_u] < _min_edge`, `m` is greater than `0`, `edges` contains at least `m-2` tuples, `node_u` is either `u` or `-1`, `node_v` is either `v` or `-1`. If `parent_u` equals `parent_v`, then `_min_edge` remains unchanged under the condition that `dsu.min_edge[parent_u] < _min_edge`; otherwise, `_min_edge` is updated to `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]`, and `dsu.union(u, v, w)` has been called.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
