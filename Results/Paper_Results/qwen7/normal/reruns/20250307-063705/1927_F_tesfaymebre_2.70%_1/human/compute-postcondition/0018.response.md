Output State: **`res` is the result of the dfs function call with arguments `nei`, `curr`, and `path`; `curr` is the current vertex being visited (an integer); `nei` is the next neighbor of `curr` in the graph (an integer); `set_res` is a set containing the elements of `res`**.

The code `set_res = set(res)` creates a set from the list `res`. This means that `res` remains unchanged, but a new variable `set_res` is introduced which contains the unique elements of `res`. The values of `curr` and `nei` remain the same as they were not affected by the code.
