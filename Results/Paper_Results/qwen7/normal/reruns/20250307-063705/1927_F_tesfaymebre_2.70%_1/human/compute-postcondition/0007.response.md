Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{test_cases} \leq 10^4\)**.

In natural language: The output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that `test_cases` remains an integer within the range from 1 to 10,000 (inclusive). No other variables have been defined or modified within the loop, so `test_cases` retains its initial value as it was after calling `func_1()`.
