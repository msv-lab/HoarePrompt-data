Output State: `colors[curr]` is set to 1, `curr` is the current vertex being visited (an integer), `parent` is the parent vertex in the DFS traversal (an integer), `path` is a list representing the current path in the DFS traversal (a list of integers) with `curr` appended to it, and the process of recursively calling the `dfs` function on each neighbor of `curr` (except the parent) continues until either `node_v` is found in the set of results or all possible neighbors have been visited. If `node_v` is found in any of the sets returned from the recursive calls, the function will eventually return that set; otherwise, it will return an empty set when all neighbors have been checked without finding `node_v`.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, the function will have either found the vertex `node_v` in the DFS traversal and returned the path as a set, or it will return an empty set if `node_v` was not found in any of the paths explored during the traversal.
