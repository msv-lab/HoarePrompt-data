Output State: `curr` is the final vertex being visited (an integer), `parent` is the parent vertex in the DFS traversal (an integer), `path` is a list representing the final path in the DFS traversal (a list of integers) with `curr` appended to it, `graph[curr]` is either empty or none of its neighbors have been processed further (i.e., their `colors` are not 2), and `res` is either empty or contains the vertex `node_v` if it was found during the traversal.

This output state describes the condition where the loop has completed all its iterations, meaning no more unvisited neighbors of the current vertex exist, or the traversal has reached a point where further exploration does not find the vertex `node_v`. The `res` variable will hold the path to `node_v` if it was found, otherwise it will be empty.
