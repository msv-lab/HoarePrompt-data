Output State: **`node_u` is `u`, `_min_edge` is `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]`, `parent_v` is the `find` of `v`, `node_v` is `v`, `m` is greater than `0`, `edges` contains at least `m-1` tuples, `node_u` is `-1`.**

The code assigns the value of `v` to `node_v`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
