Postcondition: `curr` is the current vertex being visited (an integer), `nei` is the next neighbor of `curr` in the graph (an integer). If `colors[nei]` is not 2 and `nei` is not the `parent`, then `res` is transformed into a set called `set_res`, and if `node_v` is in `set_res`, the function returns `res`. If `node_v` is not in `set_res`, the function does not change `res`.
