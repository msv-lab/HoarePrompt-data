The only object in the loop head is the variable `test_cases`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `test_cases`. At the end of the last iteration, `test_cases` is an integer such that \(1 < \text{test_cases} \leq 10^4\). For the loop to execute one more time, `test_cases` must be greater than 1 and less than or equal to \(10^4\).

Since the loop decrements `test_cases` by 1 each iteration, after one more iteration, `test_cases` will be reduced by 1. Therefore, `test_cases` must be greater than 2 and less than or equal to \(10^4 - 1\).

State: **`test_cases` is an integer such that \(2 \leq \text{test_cases} \leq 10^4 - 1\)**
