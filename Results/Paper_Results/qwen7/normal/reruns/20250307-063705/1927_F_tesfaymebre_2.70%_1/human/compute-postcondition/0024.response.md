Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop iterates over `nei` for each `curr` in the graph. The relevant variables in the loop head are `curr` and `nei`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are neighbors (`nei`) for the current vertex (`curr`).

3. **Determine the State Adjustments**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `curr` is the current vertex being visited, and `nei` is the next neighbor of `curr` in the graph.
   - For the loop to continue, `nei` must be a valid neighbor of `curr`.

Given these points, let's determine the state adjustments needed for the next iteration:

- `curr` remains the same because the loop is iterating over the neighbors of `curr`.
- `nei` changes to the next neighbor of `curr` in the graph.

Since the loop continues based on the existence of `nei`, the next `nei` should be the next valid neighbor of `curr`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`curr` is the current vertex being visited (an integer), `nei` is the next neighbor of `curr` in the graph (an integer)**.
