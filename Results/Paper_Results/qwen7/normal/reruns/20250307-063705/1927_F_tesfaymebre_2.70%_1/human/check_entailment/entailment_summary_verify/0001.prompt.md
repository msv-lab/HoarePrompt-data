You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Given an undirected weighted graph with n vertices and m edges. There is at
most one edge between each pair of vertices in the graph, and the graph does
not contain loops (edges from a vertex to itself). The graph is not
necessarily connected.

A cycle in the graph is called simple if it doesn't pass through the same
vertex twice and doesn't contain the same edge twice.

Find any simple cycle in this graph in which the weight of the lightest edge
is minimal.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (3 \le n \le m
\le \min(\frac{n\cdot(n - 1)}{2}, 2 \cdot 10^5) ) — the size of the graph and
the number of edges.

The next m lines of the test case contain three integers u , v , and w (1 \le
u, v \le n , u \ne v , 1 \le w \le 10^6 ) — vertices u and v are connected by
an edge of weight w .

It is guaranteed that there is at most one edge between each pair of vertices.
Note that under the given constraints, there is always at least one simple
cycle in the graph.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of m for all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a pair of numbers b and k , where:

  * b — the minimum weight of the edge in the found cycle, 
  * k — the number of vertices in the found cycle. 

On the next line, output k numbers from 1 to n — the vertices of the cycle in
traversal order.

Note that the answer always exists, as under the given constraints, there is
always at least one simple cycle in the graph.

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 8 : The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two integers n and m, followed by m lines describing the edges of a graph. It does not return any value but ensures that for each test case, n and m adhere to specified constraints (3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ min(\frac{n\cdot(n - 1)}{2}, 2 \cdot 10^5)), and each edge is represented by integers u, v, and w (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v, 1 ≤ w ≤ 10^6).+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Graph Representation and Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly uses `defaultdict` to represent the graph as an adjacency list.
   - It reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.

2. **Edge Sorting:**
   - The edges are sorted in reverse order based on their weights. This is done to process the heaviest edges first, which helps in finding cycles with lighter edges later.

3. **Disjoint Set Union (DSU) Data Structure:**
   - A DSU (Union-Find) data structure is used to manage the connected components of the graph.
   - The DSU maintains a record of the minimum edge weight for each component, which is crucial for identifying cycles with the smallest edge weight.

4. **Cycle Detection and Minimum Edge Weight:**
   - During the union operation, if two nodes belong to the same component, a cycle is detected.
   - The program updates the minimum edge weight and records the nodes involved in the cycle.

5. **DFS Traversal:**
   - A depth-first search (DFS) is used to find the exact cycle involving the nodes identified earlier.
   - The DFS ensures that the cycle is simple (no repeated vertices).

6. **Output Format:**
   - The output format matches the problem requirements, printing the minimum edge weight and the number of vertices in the cycle, followed by the vertices in traversal order.

### Analysis:
- The program follows a logical approach to solve the problem.
- The use of DSU and DFS is appropriate for detecting cycles and identifying the minimum edge weight.
- The code handles all the constraints and requirements specified in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The given program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description and the steps outlined above.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
