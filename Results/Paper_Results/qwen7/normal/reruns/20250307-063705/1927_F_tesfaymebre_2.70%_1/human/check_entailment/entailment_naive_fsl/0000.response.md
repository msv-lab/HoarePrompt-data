Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program attempts to find a simple cycle with the minimal weight of the lightest edge. However, there are several issues with the implementation:

1. **Cycle Detection**: The program uses a union-find (DSU) structure to detect cycles but does not ensure that the detected cycle is simple (i.e., it does not revisit any vertex). The current implementation may find a cycle but does not guarantee that it is simple.

2. **Path Reversal**: The `dfs` function is used to trace back the path from `node_v` to `node_u`, but it does not ensure that the path forms a simple cycle. It simply checks if `node_v` is in the path, which is not sufficient to guarantee a simple cycle.

To illustrate a case where the program might fail, consider the following graph:

- Vertices: 4
- Edges: (1, 2, 1), (2, 3, 1), (3, 4, 1), (4, 1, 1)

In this graph, the edge (4, 1, 1) forms a simple cycle with weight 1. However, the program might not correctly identify this cycle because it does not explicitly check for simplicity during the cycle detection phase.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case, and thus the correctness is **False**.
