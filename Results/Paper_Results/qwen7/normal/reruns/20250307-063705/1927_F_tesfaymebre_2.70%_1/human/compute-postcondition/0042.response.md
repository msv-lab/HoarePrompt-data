Output State: **`parent_u` is the find of `u`, `node_v` is -1, `m` is greater than 0, `edges` contains at least `m-1` tuples, `_min_edge` is `float('inf')`, `node_u` is -1**

Explanation: The line `parent_u = dsu.find(u)` assigns the result of `dsu.find(u)` to `parent_u`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The `dsu.find(u)` function call returns the root node of `u` in the disjoint set union (DSU) structure, which is assigned to `parent_u`. The other variables (`node_v`, `m`, `edges`, `_min_edge`, and `node_u`) retain their initial states.
