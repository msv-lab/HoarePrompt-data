The only object in the loop head is the variable `test_cases`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `test_cases`. At the end of the last iteration, `test_cases` is an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{test_cases} \leq 10^4\). For the loop to execute one more time, `test_cases` must be greater than 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `test_cases` must be greater than 1.

State: **`test_cases` is an integer such that \(1 < \text{test_cases} \leq 10^4\)**
