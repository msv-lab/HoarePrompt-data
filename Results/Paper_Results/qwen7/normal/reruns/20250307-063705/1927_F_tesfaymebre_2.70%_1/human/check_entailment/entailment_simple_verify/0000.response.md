### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine if it correctly finds a simple cycle with the minimal weight of the lightest edge.

1. **Union-Find Structure (DSU)**:
   - The DSU structure is used to manage the connected components of the graph. This helps in identifying cycles efficiently.
   - During the union operation, the program updates the minimum edge weight for each component. This ensures that when a cycle is detected, the lightest edge in the cycle is known.

2. **Edge Sorting**:
   - The edges are sorted in descending order of their weights. This allows us to process the heaviest edges first, which can help in finding cycles more efficiently.

3. **Cycle Detection**:
   - When processing an edge, if the two vertices belong to the same component, a cycle is detected.
   - The program then updates the minimum edge weight for the component and stores the vertices of the cycle.

4. **Finding the Simple Cycle**:
   - After detecting a cycle, the program performs a DFS to trace back the path from one vertex in the cycle to another.
   - The DFS ensures that the path is traced correctly, and the cycle is simple by checking if the vertices are not revisited.

5. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**:
   - The program processes multiple test cases by calling `func_6` for each test case.

### Detailed Analysis:

#### Correctness of Cycle Detection:
- The DSU structure ensures that when an edge is added between two vertices in the same component, a cycle is detected.
- The program correctly identifies the lightest edge in the cycle by updating the minimum edge weight for the component.

#### Correctness of Simple Cycle Tracing:
- The DFS function traces the path from one vertex in the cycle to another, ensuring that the path is simple.
- By checking if `node_v` is in the path, the program ensures that the cycle is simple.

#### Handling Edge Cases:
- The provided example graph (4 vertices with edges (1, 2, 1), (2, 3, 1), (3, 4, 1), (4, 1, 1)) is correctly handled by the program.
- The program correctly identifies the cycle (4, 1) with the lightest edge weight of 1.

### Conclusion:
Based on the detailed analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find a simple cycle with the minimal weight of the lightest edge. The original assessment incorrectly identified issues that do not exist in the provided code.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct according to the problem description and the given test cases.
