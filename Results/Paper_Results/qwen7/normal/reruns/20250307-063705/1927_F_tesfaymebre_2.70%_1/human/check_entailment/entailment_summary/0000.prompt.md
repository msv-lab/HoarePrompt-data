Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Given an undirected weighted graph with n vertices and m edges. There is at
most one edge between each pair of vertices in the graph, and the graph does
not contain loops (edges from a vertex to itself). The graph is not
necessarily connected.

A cycle in the graph is called simple if it doesn't pass through the same
vertex twice and doesn't contain the same edge twice.

Find any simple cycle in this graph in which the weight of the lightest edge
is minimal.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (3 \le n \le m
\le \min(\frac{n\cdot(n - 1)}{2}, 2 \cdot 10^5) ) — the size of the graph and
the number of edges.

The next m lines of the test case contain three integers u , v , and w (1 \le
u, v \le n , u \ne v , 1 \le w \le 10^6 ) — vertices u and v are connected by
an edge of weight w .

It is guaranteed that there is at most one edge between each pair of vertices.
Note that under the given constraints, there is always at least one simple
cycle in the graph.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of m for all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a pair of numbers b and k , where:

  * b — the minimum weight of the edge in the found cycle, 
  * k — the number of vertices in the found cycle. 

On the next line, output k numbers from 1 to n — the vertices of the cycle in
traversal order.

Note that the answer always exists, as under the given constraints, there is
always at least one simple cycle in the graph.

''' 

 Output hints for function6:  The function processes a graph represented by vertices and weighted edges. It first constructs the graph and sorts the edges in descending order of their weights. Then, it uses the Disjoint Set Union (DSU) data structure to find the minimum spanning tree (MST) of the graph. Specifically, it identifies the minimum-weight edge that connects different components of the graph. After finding the MST, it performs a depth-first search (DFS) starting from one of the vertices involved in the minimum-weight edge to determine the path in the MST. Finally, it prints the weight of the minimum-weight edge and the sequence of nodes visited during the DFS traversal.

''' 

 Output hints for function7:  The function performs a Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal starting from the given vertex `curr`. It maintains a list `path` representing the current path in the traversal. If the current vertex `curr` is already being visited (color 1), it returns the current path. Otherwise, it marks the current vertex as visited, appends it to the path, and recursively explores its unvisited neighbors (excluding the parent vertex). If the target vertex `node_v` is found during the traversal, it returns the path to `node_v`. After completing the traversal or finding the target vertex, it marks the current vertex as fully visited and returns either the path to `node_v`, the current path, or an empty list if the target vertex is not found.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7():

 Output hints for function8:  The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two integers n and m, followed by m lines describing the edges of a graph. It does not return any value but ensures that for each test case, n and m adhere to specified constraints (3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ min(\frac{n\cdot(n - 1)}{2}, 2 \cdot 10^5)), and each edge is represented by integers u, v, and w (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v, 1 ≤ w ≤ 10^6).
