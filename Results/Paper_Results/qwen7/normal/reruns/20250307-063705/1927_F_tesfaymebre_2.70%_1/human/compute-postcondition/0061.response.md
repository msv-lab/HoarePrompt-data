Postcondition: `parent_v` is the find of `v`, `parent_u` is the find of `u`, `_min_edge` is updated to `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]` if `dsu.min_edge[parent_u] < _min_edge`, `m` is greater than `0`, `edges` contains at least `m-2` tuples, `node_u` is either `u` or `-1`, `node_v` is either `v` or `-1`. If `parent_u` equals `parent_v`, `_min_edge` remains unchanged; otherwise, `_min_edge` is updated to `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]`, and `dsu.union(u, v, w)` has been called.
