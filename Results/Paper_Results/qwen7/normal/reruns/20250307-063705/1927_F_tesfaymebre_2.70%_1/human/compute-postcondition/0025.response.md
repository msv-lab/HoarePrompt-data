Output State: **`res` is the result of `dfs(nei, curr, path)`, `curr` is the current vertex being visited (an integer), `nei` is the next neighbor of `curr` in the graph (an integer)**.

Explanation: The function `dfs(nei, curr, path)` is called with `nei` as the new current vertex, `curr` as the previous vertex, and `path` as the current path. The result of this function call is stored in the variable `res`. The values of `curr` and `nei` remain unchanged from their initial state.
