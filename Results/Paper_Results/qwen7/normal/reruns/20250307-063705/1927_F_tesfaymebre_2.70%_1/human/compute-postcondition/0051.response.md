Postcondition: **`parent_v` is the find of `v`, `node_v` is either `v` or `-1`, `_min_edge` is updated to `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]` if `dsu.min_edge[parent_u] < _min_edge`, `m` is greater than `0`, `edges` contains at least `m-1` tuples, `node_u` is either `u` or `-1`, and if `parent_u` is equal to `parent_v`, `u` and `v` are unionized with weight `w`.**
