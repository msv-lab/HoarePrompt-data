The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two integers n and m, followed by m lines describing the edges of a graph. It does not return any value but ensures that for each test case, n and m adhere to specified constraints (3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ min(\frac{n\cdot(n - 1)}{2}, 2 \cdot 10^5)), and each edge is represented by integers u, v, and w (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v, 1 ≤ w ≤ 10^6).
