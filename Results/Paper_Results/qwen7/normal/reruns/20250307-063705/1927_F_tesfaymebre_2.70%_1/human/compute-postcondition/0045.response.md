Output State: **_min_edge is dsu.min_edge[parent_u], parent_v is the find of v, node_v is -1, m is greater than 0, edges contains at least m-1 tuples, node_u is -1, u and v are unionized with weight w.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]` to `_min_edge`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
