Output State: **`curr` is the final vertex being visited (an integer), `parent` is the parent vertex in the DFS traversal (an integer), `path` is a list representing the final path in the DFS traversal (a list of integers) with `curr` appended to it, `graph[curr]` is either empty or none of its neighbors have been processed further (i.e., their `colors` are not 2), and `res` is either empty or contains the vertex `node_v` if it was found during the traversal; `colors[curr]` is set to 2.**

In this output state, the `colors` dictionary is updated such that the color of the current vertex `curr` is set to 2, indicating it has been fully processed in the DFS traversal. All other variables retain their previous states as described in the initial state.
