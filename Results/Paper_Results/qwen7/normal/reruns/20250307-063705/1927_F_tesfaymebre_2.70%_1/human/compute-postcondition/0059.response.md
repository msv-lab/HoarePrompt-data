Postcondition: **`parent_v` is the find of `v`, `parent_u` is the find of `u`, `node_v` is `v`, `node_u` is `u`, `m` is greater than `0`, `edges` contains at least `m-2` tuples, and if `dsu.min_edge[parent_u] < _min_edge`, then `_min_edge` remains unchanged; otherwise, `_min_edge` is equal to `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]`.**
