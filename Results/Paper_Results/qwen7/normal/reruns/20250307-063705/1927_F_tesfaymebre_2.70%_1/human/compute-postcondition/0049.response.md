Output State: **`parent_v` is the find of `v`, `node_v` is -1, `m` is greater than 0, `edges` contains at least `m-1` tuples, `_min_edge` is `float('inf')`, `node_u` is -1, `u` and `v` are unionized with weight `w`.**

Explanation: The `dsu.union(u, v, w)` function call unites nodes `u` and `v` with the given weight `w`. This operation does not change the values of `node_v`, `m`, `edges`, `_min_edge`, and `node_u`. It also does not affect `parent_v` unless `v` was the root node before the union, but since the exact state of `parent_v` is not specified to change, we assume it remains the same find of `v`. Therefore, the only changes are that `u` and `v` are now connected with weight `w`.
