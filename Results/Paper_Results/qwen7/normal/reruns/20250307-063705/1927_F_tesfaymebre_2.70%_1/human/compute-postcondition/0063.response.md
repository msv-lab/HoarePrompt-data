Output State: All vertices in the graph are connected through a series of union operations, forming a minimum spanning tree (MST). The variable `m` is the total number of iterations the loop executed, which is also the number of edges in the MST. The variable `_min_edge` holds the weight of the smallest edge in the MST. The variables `node_u` and `node_v` are the endpoints of the edge with the smallest weight in the MST. The `edges` list is empty after all iterations, as each edge has been processed and used to form the MST. The `graph` contains all vertices and their connections, reflecting the final structure of the MST. The `dsu.min_edge` dictionary is updated to reflect the minimum edge weights for each connected component during the process.
