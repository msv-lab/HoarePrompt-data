Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but uses a tuple (n, m) of two integers where 3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ min(⌊n(n - 1)/2⌋, 2⋅10^5), a list of tuples representing edges where each tuple contains three integers (u, v, w) indicating an edge between vertices u and v with weight w, and an instance of a DSU (Disjoint Set Union) class initialized with n + 1 elements. The function returns a value based on the operations performed using these inputs.**
