Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer such that \(2 \leq \text{test_cases} \leq 10^4 - 1\) and no other variables have been defined or modified.**

Explanation: The function `func_6()` is called, but since no information about what `func_6()` does is provided, no changes are made to the variables or their values. Therefore, the only information we know is the initial state of `test_cases`.
