Output State: **`parent_v` is the find of `v`, `parent_u` is the find of `u`, `node_v` is either `v` or `-1`, `node_u` is either `u` or `-1`, `m` is greater than `0`, `edges` contains at least `m-2` tuples, `_min_edge` is equal to `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]`.**

Explanation: The line `_min_edge = dsu.min_edge[parent_u]` assigns the value of `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]` to the variable `_min_edge`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged from the initial state. The precondition that `dsu.union(u, v, w)` has been called remains valid, meaning `u` and `v` have been unionized under the condition of weight `w`.
