Functionality: **The function performs a Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal starting from the given vertex `curr`. It maintains a list `path` representing the current path in the traversal. If the current vertex `curr` is already being visited (color 1), it returns the current path. Otherwise, it marks the current vertex as visited, appends it to the path, and recursively explores its unvisited neighbors (excluding the parent vertex). If the target vertex `node_v` is found during the traversal, it returns the path to `node_v`. After completing the traversal or finding the target vertex, it marks the current vertex as fully visited and returns either the path to `node_v`, the current path, or an empty list if the target vertex is not found.**
