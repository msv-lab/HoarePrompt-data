Output State: **`parent_v` is the find of `v`, `parent_u` is the find of `u`, `node_v` is either `v` or `-1`, `_min_edge` is updated to `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]` if `dsu.min_edge[parent_u] < _min_edge`, `m` is greater than `0`, `edges` contains at least `m-2` tuples, `node_u` is either `u` or `-1`.**

Explanation: The code updates `parent_v` to be the find of `v`. This means `parent_v` now holds the root (find) of `v` in the disjoint set union (DSU) structure. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
