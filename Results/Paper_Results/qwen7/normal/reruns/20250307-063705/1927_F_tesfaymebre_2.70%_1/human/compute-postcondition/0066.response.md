Output State: **`colors` is a list of length `n + 1` where all elements are 0, `_min_edge` stores the minimum edge weight among all connected components, `Node_u` and `Node_v` store the vertices of the minimum edge, `res` is the result of the dfs function call `dfs(Node_u, -1, [])`.**

The `dfs` function is called with `node_u`, `-1` (which is the parent node), and an empty list. However, without knowing the exact implementation of the `dfs` function, we cannot determine the exact value of `res`. The other variables (`colors`, `_min_edge`, `Node_u`, and `Node_v`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
