Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `curr` (the current vertex being visited, an integer), `parent` (the parent vertex in the DFS traversal, an integer), and `path` (a list representing the current path in the DFS traversal, a list of integers). It returns a list representing the current path in the DFS traversal, additional nodes discovered during the traversal, or an empty list based on different conditions.**

- If the function directly returns the list `path`, it means the current path is complete or no new nodes were added.
- If the function returns a list `res` containing the current path and additional nodes discovered, it indicates that new nodes were found during the traversal.
- If the function returns the result of another dfs function call with updated parameters, it suggests exploring further nodes in the graph.
- If the function transforms the variable `res` into a set called `set_res` and returns it, it might be converting the path to a unique set of nodes.
- If the function returns an empty list, it could mean that the traversal ended without adding any new nodes to the path.
