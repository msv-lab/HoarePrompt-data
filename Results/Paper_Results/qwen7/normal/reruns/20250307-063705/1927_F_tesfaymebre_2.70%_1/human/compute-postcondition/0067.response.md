Based on the initial state provided:

- `colors` is a list of length `n + 1` where all elements are 0. This means `colors` is a list with `n + 1` zeros.
- `_min_edge` stores the minimum edge weight among all connected components.
- `Node_u` and `Node_v` store the vertices of the minimum edge.
- `res` is the result of the `dfs` function call `dfs(Node_u, -1, [])`.

The `print(_min_edge, len(res))` statement will print two values: `_min_edge` and the length of `res`.

- `_min_edge` is the minimum edge weight among all connected components, but without knowing the specific weights, we can only refer to it as `_min_edge`.
- `len(res)` is the length of the result returned by the `dfs` function call. Since the `dfs` function is called with `Node_u`, `-1`, and an empty list `[]` as arguments, `res` will contain the path found by the depth-first search starting from `Node_u` and avoiding the parent node (`-1`).

Given the information, the precise output cannot be determined numerically for `_min_edge` and `len(res)` without additional details. Therefore, the output will be described as follows:

Output: **_min_edge, len(res)**
