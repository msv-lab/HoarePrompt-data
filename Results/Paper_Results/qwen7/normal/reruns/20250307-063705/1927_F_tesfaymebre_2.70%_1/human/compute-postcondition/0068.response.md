Based on the initial state provided:

- `colors` is a list of length `n + 1` where all elements are 0. This means `colors` is a list with `n + 1` zeros.
- `_min_edge` stores the minimum edge weight among all connected components.
- `Node_u` and `Node_v` store the vertices of the minimum edge.
- `res` is the result of the `dfs` function call `dfs(Node_u, -1, [])`.

The `dfs` function typically performs a depth-first search on a graph, starting from `Node_u` and possibly exploring other nodes connected to it. The result `res` from the `dfs` function could be a list of nodes visited during the traversal, but without more specific details about the `dfs` implementation, we can only infer that `res` is a list of nodes.

Given that the `print(*res)` statement will print the elements of `res` separated by spaces, and since `res` is the result of a DFS starting from `Node_u`, the printed output will depend on the structure of the graph and the traversal path.

However, since the exact structure of the graph and the specific nodes visited by the DFS are not provided, we can only describe `res` in a general sense.

Output: **[Node_u, Node_v, ...] (where the list contains nodes visited during the DFS starting from Node_u)**
