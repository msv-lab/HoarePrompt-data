Output State: **`parent_v` is the find of `v`, `parent_u` is the find of `u`, `node_v` is `v`, `node_u` is `u`, `m` is greater than `0`, `edges` contains at least `m-2` tuples, `_min_edge` is equal to `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]`**.

Explanation: The code `node_v = v` updates the value of `node_v` to `v`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
