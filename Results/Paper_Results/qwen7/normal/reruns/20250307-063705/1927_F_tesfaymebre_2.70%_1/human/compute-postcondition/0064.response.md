Output State: **All vertices in the graph are connected, and the minimum edge weight among all connected components is stored in \_min\_edge. Node\_u and Node\_v store the vertices of the minimum edge.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all iterations (i.e., `m` times), all vertices in the graph will be part of a single connected component due to the repeated union operations. The variable `_min_edge` will hold the weight of the minimum-weight edge that was found during any of the iterations where the union operation was performed between two different components. The variables `node_u` and `node_v` will store the vertices of this minimum-weight edge. All other variables like `m`, `edges`, and `parent` values for each node will reflect the final connected state of the graph.
