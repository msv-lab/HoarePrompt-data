Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is defined by the tuple `(w, u, v)` from the `edges` list. Therefore, the variables involved are `w`, `u`, and `v`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as there are tuples left in the `edges` list. Since `edges` contains at least `m-1` tuples and `m` is greater than `0`, it means `edges` is not empty.

3. **Update the States**:
   - `parent_v` remains unchanged because the loop does not modify it directly.
   - `node_v` remains unchanged because the loop does not modify it directly.
   - `_min_edge` remains unchanged because the loop does not modify it directly.
   - `m` remains unchanged because the loop does not modify it directly.
   - `edges` will be reduced by one tuple each time the loop runs since one tuple is processed per iteration.
   - `node_u` remains unchanged because the loop does not modify it directly.
   - If `parent_u` equals `parent_v`, `u` and `v` are unionized with weight `w`, but this does not affect the state of `u` or `v` directly in terms of their values.

Given these points, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the `edges` list, which will contain one fewer tuple after each iteration.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`parent_v` is the find of `v`, `node_v` is either `v` or `-1`, `_min_edge` is updated to `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]` if `dsu.min_edge[parent_u] < _min_edge`, `m` is greater than `0`, `edges` contains at least `m-2` tuples, `node_u` is either `u` or `-1`, and if `parent_u` is equal to `parent_v`, `u` and `v` are unionized with weight `w`.**
