Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `u` is the first integer input minus 1, `v` is the second integer input minus 1, `u2vs[u]` is a list that now contains `v`.**

Explanation: The line of code `u2vs[u].append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the list located at index `u` in the list `u2vs`. Since `u` is the first integer input minus 1 and `v` is the second integer input minus 1, after executing this line, the list `u2vs[u]` will contain the value of `v`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
