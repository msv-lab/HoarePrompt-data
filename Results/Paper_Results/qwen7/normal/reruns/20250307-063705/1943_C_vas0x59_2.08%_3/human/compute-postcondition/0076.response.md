Functionality: **The function processes an undirected tree represented by `u2vs`, where each node is connected to every other node exactly once. It performs a Breadth-First Search (BFS) twice to find specific paths within the tree. Based on these paths, it constructs a list of operations (`ops`) and prints the count of these operations followed by the details of each operation. The function ultimately returns nothing (None).**
