Output State: **`i` is 1; `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(c1, 1)`**

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(c1, i)` to the list `ops`. Given that `i` is initially 1, the tuple added to `ops` is `(c1, 1)`. The initial value of `i` remains unchanged, and the condition that `len(path_ba)` must be greater than 2 is still valid.
