Output State: **`ops` is a list containing tuples `(c, 0)`, `(c, 1)`, `(c, 2), ..., (c, ci)`.**

Explanation: The loop runs `ci + 1` times, where `ci` is initially set to half the length of `path_ba`. Since `path_ba` contains `b` and all the nodes from `b` back to the starting node 0, the length of `path_ba` is `ci + 1`. Therefore, the loop will run `ci + 1` times, appending a tuple `(c, i)` to the list `ops` in each iteration, where `i` starts from 0 and goes up to `ci`. After all iterations, `ops` will contain tuples for each iteration of the loop, ranging from `(c, 0)` to `(c, ci)`.
