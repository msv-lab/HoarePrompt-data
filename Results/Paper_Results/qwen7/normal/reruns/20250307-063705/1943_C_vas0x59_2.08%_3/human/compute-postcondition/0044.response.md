Output State: `b` is the return value from the function `func_1(d)`, `n` is the final value obtained after the loop terminates, `u` is the first integer input minus 1, `v` is the second integer input minus 1, `u2vs[u]` and `u2vs[v]` are lists that contain all integers from 0 to `n-2` (inclusive) in some order with each integer appearing exactly twice except for itself, `d` is the result of the BFS starting from node 0, `a` is the return value from the function `func_1(d)` which is now assigned to `a`, `path_ba` is a list containing the values `b` and all the nodes traversed from `b` to the starting node 0 as determined by the loop.

Explanation: The loop continues to append the value of `previous[path_ba[-1]]` to `path_ba` until `n` becomes -1. This indicates that the loop has traced back from the last node in `path_ba` to the starting node 0 using the `previous` array, which records the parent of each node in the BFS traversal. The final value of `n` when the loop breaks will be -1, and `path_ba` will contain the full path from the starting node 0 to the last node before reaching 0.
