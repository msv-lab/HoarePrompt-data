Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head**: The loop head is defined by the `for i in range(ci + 1):` statement. The key variables here are `i` and `ci`.

2. **Understand the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ops` has a new element appended, which is a tuple containing `c` and `i`.
   - This information is not directly relevant to adjusting the loop state.

3. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `ci + 1`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, let's assume `i` was `k` (where `k < ci`).
   - After appending the tuple to `ops`, `i` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1, if it was `k` before, it will now be `k + 1`.
   - `ci` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is `k + 1`, `ci` is the same as before**.

Since the exact value of `ci` is not specified, we will keep it as `ci` in the final state.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is `k + 1`, `ci` is the same as before**.
