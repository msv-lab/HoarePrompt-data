Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an input integer, 1 ≤ n ≤ 2000; `u2vs` is a list of length n where each element is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(n - 1):
    u, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    u -= 1
    v -= 1
    u2vs[u].append(v)
    u2vs[v].append(u)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` must be at least 2, `u` is the first integer input minus 1, `v` is the second integer input minus 1, `u2vs[v]` is a list that now contains `u` appended to it.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` must be at least 3, `u` is the first integer input minus 3, `v` is the second integer input minus 2, `u2vs[v]` is a list that contains the first integer input minus 1 followed by the second integer input, `u` is assigned the first integer input, `v` is assigned the second integer input minus 1, `u2vs[v]` now contains the first integer input, the second integer input, and the first integer input.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` must be at least 4, `u` is the first integer input minus 2, `v` is the second integer input minus 2, `u2vs[v]` is a list that now contains the first integer input minus 1, the second integer input, the first integer input, and the second integer input followed by `u`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
