Output State: **`i` is 3; `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(c1, 3)`**

Explanation: The variable `i` retains its value of 3. The variable `ops` is a list that now contains the tuple `(c1, i)`, which evaluates to `(c1, 3)` given that `i` is 3. The precondition that `len(path_ba) - c1` must be greater than 3 remains unchanged.
