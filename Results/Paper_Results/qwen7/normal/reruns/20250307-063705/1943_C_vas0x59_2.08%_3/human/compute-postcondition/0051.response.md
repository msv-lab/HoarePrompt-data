Output State: **`ops` has a new element appended, which is a tuple containing `c` and `i`.**

In this case, the code appends a tuple `(c, i)` to the list `ops`. Since the initial values of `c` and `i` are not specified, they remain as they are, but now `ops` contains one more element, which is the tuple `(c, i)`.
