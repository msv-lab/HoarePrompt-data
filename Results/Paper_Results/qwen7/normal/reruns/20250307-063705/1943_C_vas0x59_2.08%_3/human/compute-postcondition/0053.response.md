Output State: **`i` is `k + 1`, `ci` is the same as before, `ops` is a list with an additional tuple `(c, k + 1)` appended to it.**

This means that the value of `i` remains `k + 1`, `ci` stays unchanged, and `ops` now contains an extra tuple where the first element is `c` and the second element is `k + 1`.
