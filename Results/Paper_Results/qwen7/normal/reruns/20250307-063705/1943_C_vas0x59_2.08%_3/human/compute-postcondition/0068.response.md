Output State: **`i` is 5; `ops` contains the tuple (`c1`, 5), (`c2`, 5)**

Explanation: Initially, `i` is 5 and `ops` contains the tuple `(c1, 5)`. The code `ops.append((c2, i))` appends a new tuple `(c2, i)` to the list `ops`. Since `i` is 5, the new tuple added is `(c2, 5)`. Therefore, the updated state of `ops` includes both tuples: `(c1, 5)` and `(c2, 5)`.
