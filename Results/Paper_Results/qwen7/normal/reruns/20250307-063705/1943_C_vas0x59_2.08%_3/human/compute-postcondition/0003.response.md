Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `u` is the first integer input, `v` is the second integer input.**

Explanation: The code `u, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))` takes two integers as input separated by a space, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `u` and `v` respectively. The precondition that `n` must be at least 2 remains unchanged.
