Output State: **`n` must be at least 4, `u` is the first integer input minus 1, `v` is the second integer input minus 1, `u2vs[v]` is a list that contains the first integer input minus 1, the second integer input, and the first integer input.**

Explanation: The value of `u` is decremented by 1. The other variables (`n`, `v`, and `u2vs[v]`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
