Output State: **`n` must be at least 3, `u` is the first integer input minus 3, `v` is the second integer input minus 2, `u2vs[v]` is a list that contains the first integer input minus 1 followed by the second integer input, `u` is assigned the first integer input, `v` is assigned the second integer input minus 1, `u2vs[v]` now contains the first integer input, the second integer input, and the first integer input.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `u` (which is the first integer input) to the list `u2vs[v]`. Initially, `u2vs[v]` contains the first integer input minus 1 followed by the second integer input minus 1. After appending `u` (the first integer input), `u2vs[v]` now contains the first integer input minus 1, the second integer input minus 1, and the first integer input.
