Output State: **`n` must be at least 4, `u` is the first integer input minus 2, `v` is the second integer input minus 2, `u2vs[u]` is a list that now contains the first integer input minus 1, the second integer input, and the first integer input followed by the second integer input (`v`).**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `v` to the list `u2vs[u]`. Initially, `u2vs[u]` contains the first integer input minus 1, the second integer input, and the first integer input. After appending `v`, the list becomes the first integer input minus 1, the second integer input, the first integer input, and `v`.
