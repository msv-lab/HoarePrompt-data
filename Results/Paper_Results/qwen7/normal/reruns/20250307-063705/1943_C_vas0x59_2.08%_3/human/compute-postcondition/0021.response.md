Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `n` must be at least 4, `u` is the first integer input minus 1, `v` is the second integer input minus 1, and `u2vs[u]` and `u2vs[v]` are lists that contain all integers from 0 to `n-2` (inclusive) in some order, with each integer appearing exactly twice except for itself.

This means that after the loop completes, `u2vs` will represent an undirected graph where each node (from 0 to `n-2`) is connected to every other node exactly once. The variable `u` will hold the value of the last `u` input minus 1, and `v` will hold the value of the last `v` input minus 1.
