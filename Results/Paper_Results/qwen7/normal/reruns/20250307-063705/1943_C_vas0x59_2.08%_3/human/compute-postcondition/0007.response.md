Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `u` is the first integer input minus 1, `v` is the second integer input minus 1, `u2vs[v]` is a list that now contains `u` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `u` to the list `u2vs[v]`. Initially, `u2vs[v]` contains only `v`. After executing the line `u2vs[v].append(u)`, the list `u2vs[v]` will contain both `v` and `u`.
