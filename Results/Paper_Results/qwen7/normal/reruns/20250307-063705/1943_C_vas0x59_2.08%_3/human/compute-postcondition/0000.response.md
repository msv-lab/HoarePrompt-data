Output State: **`n` is an input integer, 1 ≤ n ≤ 2000; `u2vs` is a list of length n where each element is a list representing the neighbors of the corresponding vertex in the tree, and (u, v) are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n and u ≠ v.**

The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This changes the value of `n` to the input integer, but does not affect the value of `u2vs` or the constraints on `u` and `v`. Therefore, the length of `u2vs` remains `n`, and the constraints on `u` and `v` remain the same.
