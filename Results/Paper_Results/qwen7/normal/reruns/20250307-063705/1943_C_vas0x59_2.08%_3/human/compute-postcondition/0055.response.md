Output State: **`i` is `k + 2`, `ci` is the same as before; (`ops` list has appended a tuple `(c, k + 2)`).**

In this case, the code appends a tuple containing `c` and `i` (which is `k + 2`) to the `ops` list. Since `ci` was mentioned to be the same as before and no changes were made to it, its state remains unchanged. The value of `i` remains `k + 2`.
