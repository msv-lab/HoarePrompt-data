Output State: **`n` must be at least 3, `u` is the first integer input minus 3, `v` is the second integer input minus 2, `u2vs[u]` is a list that contains the first integer input minus 1 followed by the second integer input minus 1, `u` is assigned the first integer input, `v` is assigned the second integer input minus 1.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `v` (which is the second integer input minus 1) to the list `u2vs[u]`. Since `u` is the first integer input minus 3, the list `u2vs[u]` now contains the first integer input minus 1 and the second integer input minus 1. The values of `n`, `u`, and `v` remain unchanged from their initial states.
