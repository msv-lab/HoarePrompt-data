Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `u` is the first integer input minus 1, `v` is the second integer input minus 1**

Explanation: The code `v -= 1` subtracts 1 from the value of `v`. The initial state of `v` is the second integer input, so after executing the code, `v` becomes the second integer input minus 1. The values of `n` and `u` remain unchanged.
