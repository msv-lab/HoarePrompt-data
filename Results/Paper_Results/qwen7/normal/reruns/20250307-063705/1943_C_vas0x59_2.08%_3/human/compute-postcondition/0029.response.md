Postcondition: **`b` is the return value from the function `func_1(d)`, `n` is the value of `previous[path_ba[-1]]`, `u` is the first integer input minus 1, `v` is the second integer input minus 1, `u2vs[u]` and `u2vs[v]` are lists that contain all integers from 0 to `n-2` (inclusive) in some order, with each integer appearing exactly twice except for itself, `d` is the result of the BFS starting from node 0, `a` is the return value from the function `func_1(d)` which is now assigned to `a`, `path_ba` is a list containing the value `b`. The value of `n` is currently -1.**
