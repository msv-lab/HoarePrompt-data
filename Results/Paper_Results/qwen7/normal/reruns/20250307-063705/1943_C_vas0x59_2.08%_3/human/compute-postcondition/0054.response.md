Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(ci + 1)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `ci`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `k + 1`
   - `ci` is the same as before
   - `ops` is a list with an additional tuple `(c, k + 1)` appended to it.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < ci + 1`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was `k + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `k + 2`.
   - `ci` remains unchanged.
   - The value of `ops` does not change in this context because the loop head only involves `i` and `ci`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is `k + 2`, `ci` is the same as before**
