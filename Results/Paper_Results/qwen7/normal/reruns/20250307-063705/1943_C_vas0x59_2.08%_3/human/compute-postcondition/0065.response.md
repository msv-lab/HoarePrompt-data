Output State: **`i` is 3; `ops` is a list containing the tuples `('c1', 3)` and `('c2', 3)`**

Explanation: Initially, `i` is 3 and `ops` is a list containing the tuple `('c1', 3)`. The code snippet appends another tuple `('c2', i)` to the list `ops`. Since `i` is 3, the new tuple added is `('c2', 3)`. Therefore, the updated list `ops` contains both `('c1', 3)` and `('c2', 3)`.
