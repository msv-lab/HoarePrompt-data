Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is a placeholder) and the variable `n - 1`. Since `_` is just a placeholder and does not hold any state, we focus on `n - 1`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `n - 1` is a positive integer. This means `n` must be at least 2 (since `n - 1` must be greater than 0).

3. **Adjust the state**: We need to ensure that the condition `n - 1 > 0` holds true. Therefore, `n` must be at least 2.

4. **Consider other relevant states**: The list `u2vs` is of length `n`, but since the loop condition depends on `n - 1`, the length of `u2vs` being `n` is already ensured by the initial state.

Given these considerations, the state that needs to be adjusted is `n` to ensure the loop can execute.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` must be at least 2**
