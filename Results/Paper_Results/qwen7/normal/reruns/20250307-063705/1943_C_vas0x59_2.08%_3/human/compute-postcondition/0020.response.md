Output State: The final output state after the loop executes all its iterations will be a list `u2vs` of length `n` where each element is a list containing all other indices from 0 to `n-1`. This is because the loop iteratively adds each index `v` to the list of the index `u` and vice versa, effectively creating a fully connected graph where every node (index) is connected to every other node.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes, `u2vs[i]` will contain all integers from 0 to `n-1` for every `i` from 0 to `n-1`, representing that every index is connected to every other index.
