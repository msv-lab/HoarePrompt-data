Output State: **`n` must be at least 3, `u` is the first integer input minus 2, `v` is the second integer input minus 1, `u2vs[v]` is a list that contains the first integer input minus 1, `u` is assigned the first integer input, `v` is assigned the second integer input.**

Explanation: The code `u -= 1` decrements the value of `u` by 1. Initially, `u` was set to the first integer input minus 1, so now `u` is the first integer input minus 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
