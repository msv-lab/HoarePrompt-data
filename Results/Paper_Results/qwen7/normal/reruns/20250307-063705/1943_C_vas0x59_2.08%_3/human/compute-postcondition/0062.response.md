Output State: **`i` is 1; `ops` is a list containing the tuples `('c1', 1)` and `('c2', 1)`**

Explanation: Initially, `i` is 1 and `ops` is a list containing the tuple `('c1', 1)`. The code snippet `ops.append((c2, i))` appends a new tuple `('c2', i)` to the list `ops`. Since `i` is 1, the new tuple added to `ops` is `('c2', 1)`. Therefore, the updated list `ops` contains two tuples: `('c1', 1)` and `('c2', 1)`.
