Output State: `i` is 7; `ops` is a list containing the tuples `('c1', 7)` and `('c2', 7)`.

To understand this, let's break down the loop and its behavior:

1. The loop starts with `i` set to 1 and increments by 2 on each iteration.
2. For each iteration, it appends two tuples to `ops`: one with `c1` and the current value of `i`, and another with `c2` and the same current value of `i`.
3. After the first iteration, `i` is 1, and `ops` contains `('c1', 1)` and `('c2', 1)`.
4. After the second iteration, `i` is 3, and `ops` contains `('c1', 1), ('c2', 1), ('c1', 3), ('c2', 3)`.
5. After the third iteration, `i` is 5, and `ops` contains `('c1', 1), ('c2', 1), ('c1', 3), ('c2', 3), ('c1', 5), ('c2', 5)`.

Following this pattern, after the fourth iteration, `i` will be 7, and `ops` will contain `('c1', 1), ('c2', 1), ('c1', 3), ('c2', 3), ('c1', 5), ('c2', 5), ('c1', 7), ('c2', 7)`. Thus, the final state after all iterations is described as above.
