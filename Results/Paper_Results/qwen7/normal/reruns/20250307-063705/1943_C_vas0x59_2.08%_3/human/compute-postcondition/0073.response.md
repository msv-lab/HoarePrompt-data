To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step.

### Initial State Analysis
- `ops` is a list of tuples of the form (`'ci'`, `i`).
- The value of `i` ranges from 0 to `len(path_ba) - 1`.
- If `len(path_ba)` is odd, `ops` contains tuples like `(c, 0)`, `(c, 1)`, ..., `(c, ci)`.
- If `len(path_ba)` is even, `ops` contains tuples like (`'c1'`, i) and (`'c2'`, i) for every even `i` starting from 1 up to `len(path_ba) - 1`.

### Code Snippet Analysis
The code snippet uses a map function with a lambda function to transform each tuple in `ops` into a string and then prints these strings separated by newlines.

The lambda function inside the map function takes each tuple `(x[0], x[1])` from `ops` and returns a string formatted as `'x[0] + 1 x[1]'`.

### Detailed Calculation
Let's consider both cases for `len(path_ba)`:

#### Case 1: `len(path_ba)` is Odd
Suppose `len(path_ba) = 5` (an example of an odd number).

- `ops` would contain: `[('c', 0), ('c', 1), ('c', 2), ('c', 3), ('c', 4)]`.

For each tuple `(c, i)` in `ops`, the lambda function will transform it into:
- `(c, 0) -> 'c + 1 0' -> '1 0'`
- `(c, 1) -> 'c + 1 1' -> '2 1'`
- `(c, 2) -> 'c + 1 2' -> '3 2'`
- `(c, 3) -> 'c + 1 3' -> '4 3'`
- `(c, 4) -> 'c + 1 4' -> '5 4'`

So, the output will be:
```
1 0
2 1
3 2
4 3
5 4
```

#### Case 2: `len(path_ba)` is Even
Suppose `len(path_ba) = 6` (an example of an even number).

- `ops` would contain: `[('c1', 1), ('c2', 2), ('c1', 3), ('c2', 4), ('c1', 5)]`.

For each tuple `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` in `ops`, the lambda function will transform them into:
- `(c1, 1) -> 'c1 + 1 1' -> '2 1'`
- `(c2, 2) -> 'c2 + 1 2' -> '3 2'`
- `(c1, 3) -> 'c1 + 1 3' -> '4 3'`
- `(c2, 4) -> 'c2 + 1 4' -> '5 4'`
- `(c1, 5) -> 'c1 + 1 5' -> '6 5'`

So, the output will be:
```
2 1
3 2
4 3
5 4
6 5
```

### Conclusion
Given the initial state, the output will depend on whether `len(path_ba)` is odd or even. In either case, the output will be a series of lines where each line is a string formatted as `'x + 1 i'` for each tuple in `ops`.

Output: **'x + 1 i' for each tuple (x, i) in ops, where x is either 'c1' or 'c2' depending on the index, and i ranges from 0 to len(path_ba) - 1 as described.**
