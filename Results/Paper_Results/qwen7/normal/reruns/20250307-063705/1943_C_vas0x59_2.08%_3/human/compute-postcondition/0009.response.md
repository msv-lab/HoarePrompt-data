Output State: **`n` must be at least 3, `u` is the first integer input minus 1, `v` is the second integer input minus 1, `u2vs[v]` is a list that contains the first integer input minus 1, `u` is assigned the first integer input, `v` is assigned the second integer input.**

Explanation: The code takes two integer inputs and assigns them to `u` and `v` respectively. It also updates the value of `u2vs[v]` to contain `u`. The precondition that `n` must be at least 3 remains unchanged.
