The code `break` is executed, which breaks out of the loop or the most internal loop or if statement we were inside. However, since no loops or conditional statements are shown in the given code snippet, the only impact is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables do not change as a result of executing `break`. Therefore, the Output State is: `b` is the return value from the function `func_1(d)`, `n` is the value of `previous[path_ba[-1]]`, `u` is the first integer input minus 1, `v` is the second integer input minus 1, `u2vs[u]` and `u2vs[v]` are lists that contain all integers from 0 to `n-2` (inclusive) in some order with each integer appearing exactly twice except for itself, `d` is the result of the BFS starting from node 0, `a` is the return value from the function `func_1(d)` which is now assigned to `a`, `path_ba` is a list containing the values `b` and `n`, and `n` is updated to the value of `previous[path_ba[-1]]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
