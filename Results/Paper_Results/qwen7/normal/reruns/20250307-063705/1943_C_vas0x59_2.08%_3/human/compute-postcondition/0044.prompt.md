Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `b` is the return value from the function `func_1(d)`, `n` must be at least 4, `u` is the first integer input minus 1, `v` is the second integer input minus 1, `u2vs[u]` and `u2vs[v]` are lists that contain all integers from 0 to `n-2` (inclusive) in some order, with each integer appearing exactly twice except for itself, `d` is the result of the BFS starting from node 0, `a` is the return value from the function `func_1(d)` which is now assigned to `a`, `path_ba` is a list containing the value `b`.
Code of the loop:
while True:
    n = previous[path_ba[-1]]
    if n == -1:
        break
    path_ba.append(n)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `b` is the return value from the function `func_1(d)`, `n` is the value of `previous[path_ba[-1]]`, `u` is the first integer input minus 1, `v` is the second integer input minus 1, `u2vs[u]` and `u2vs[v]` are lists that contain all integers from 0 to `n-2` (inclusive) in some order, with each integer appearing exactly twice except for itself, `d` is the result of the BFS starting from node 0, `a` is the return value from the function `func_1(d)` which is now assigned to `a`, `path_ba` is a list containing the values `b` and `n`, and if `n == -1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `b` is the return value from the function `func_1(d)`, `n` is the value of `previous[path_ba[-1]]`, `u` is the first integer input minus 1, `v` is the second integer input minus 1, `u2vs[u]` and `u2vs[v]` are lists that contain all integers from 0 to `n-2` (inclusive) in some order with each integer appearing exactly twice except for itself, `d` is the result of the BFS starting from node 0, `a` is the return value from the function `func_1(d)` which is now assigned to `a`, `path_ba` is a list containing the values `b` and `n` with `n` appended, and if `n` equals -1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `b` is the return value from the function `func_1(d)`, `n` is the value of `previous[path_ba[-1]]`, `u` is the first integer input minus 1, `v` is the second integer input minus 1, `u2vs[u]` and `u2vs[v]` are lists that contain all integers from 0 to `n-2` (inclusive) in some order with each integer appearing exactly twice except for itself, `d` is the result of the BFS starting from node 0, `a` is the return value from the function `func_1(d)` which is now assigned to `a`, `path_ba` is a list containing the values `b` and `n` with `n` appended, and `n` is updated to the value of `previous[path_ba[-1]]`, and `path_ba` is updated with `n` appended.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
