Output State: **`n` must be at least 4, `u` is the first integer input, `v` is the second integer input minus 1, `u2vs[v]` is a list that contains the first integer input, the second integer input, and the first integer input.**

Explanation: The code `u, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))` takes two integers as input, splits them by space, converts them to integers, and assigns the first integer to `u` and the second integer to `v`. The initial values of `u` and `v` are updated according to the new inputs, while `n` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. The list `u2vs[v]` is also updated to contain the first integer input, the second integer input, and the first integer input.
