Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, len(path_ba) - c1, 2):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i`, `len(path_ba)`, and `c1`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
   - `i` is 1
   - `ops` is a list containing the tuples `('c1', 1)` and `('c2', 1)`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `1 <= i < len(path_ba) - c1` with a step of 2.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, and the step size is 2, the next value of `i` would be `1 + 2 = 3`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `len(path_ba) - c1`. Given that `i` is now 3, `len(path_ba) - c1` must be greater than 3.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `i` is now 3.
   - `len(path_ba) - c1` must be greater than 3.
   - The variable `ops` remains unchanged since it is not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`i` is 3, `len(path_ba) - c1` must be greater than 3**
