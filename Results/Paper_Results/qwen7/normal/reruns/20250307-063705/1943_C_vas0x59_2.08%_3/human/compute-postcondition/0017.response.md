Output State: **`n` must be at least 4, `u` is the first integer input minus 2, `v` is the second integer input minus 2, `u2vs[v]` is a list that contains the first integer input minus 1, the second integer input, and the first integer input.**

Explanation: The code `v -= 1` decrements the value of `v` by 1. Initially, `v` was equal to the second integer input minus 1. After executing the code, `v` becomes the second integer input minus 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
