Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for num in a:`. The objects involved here are `num` and `a`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq a[j] < 2^{31}\) for each \(j\) in range(`n`).
   - `num` is a variable that will take on each value from the list `a` during each iteration of the loop.

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - Since `a` is a list, we need to ensure that it contains at least one element for the loop to execute. If `a` is empty, the loop will not run.
   - `num` will take on the values from the list `a` during each iteration, but we don't need to specify its initial value since it changes with each iteration.

4. **Formulate the final state**:
   - We need to ensure that the list `a` is not empty for the loop to execute.
   - We don't need to specify the exact value of `num` because it will change with each iteration.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

State: **`a` must have at least one element**.

So, the final answer is:

State: **`a` must have at least one element**.
