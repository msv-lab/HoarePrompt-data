Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze whether `func_2` correctly implements the game rules described in the problem statement. Specifically, we need to check if `func_1` accurately simulates the process of kicking out players and determining the number of winners for a given initial number of players `n`.

From the execution summary of `func_1`:
- The function `func_1(n, p)` is designed to simulate the process of kicking out players based on the sequence `p`.
- It repeatedly subtracts the count of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `n` from `n` until `n` is less than the smallest element in `p`.
- After the loop completes, the function returns 0, indicating that no more players can be kicked out.

From the execution summary of `func_2`:
- The function `func_2` processes multiple test cases.
- For each test case, it reads the values of `k`, `q`, the sequence `p`, and the list of integers `qs`.
- It then applies `func_1(n, p)` for each `n` in `qs` and collects the results in a list `res`.
- Finally, it prints the results in a space-separated format for each test case.

Given the problem description and the execution summaries:
- The sequence `p` represents the positions of players to be kicked out in each round.
- The function `func_1` correctly simulates the process of kicking out players and determining the number of remaining players.
- The function `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and applies `func_1` to each `n` in `qs`.

Since both `func_1` and `func_2` follow the logic described in the problem statement and the execution summaries match the expected behavior, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
