Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `k` and `q`, both are positive integers such that 1 <= k, q <= 100; and `p`, a list of `k` integers representing the sequence `a` where 1 <= a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_k <= 100; and `qs`, a list of `q` integers representing `n_i` where 1 <= n_i <= 100. The function returns a result based on the relationship between the elements in `p` and `qs`.**

- If `n_i` (an element in `qs`) is within the range defined by any pair of consecutive elements in `p` (i.e., `a_i` and `a_{i+1}`), the function returns a specific value indicating that `n_i` falls within that range.
- If none of the elements in `qs` fall within any of the ranges defined by the pairs of consecutive elements in `p`, the function returns a different value indicating that no elements in `qs` fall within any of the specified ranges.
