Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `n` and `qs`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element in the list `qs`. The variable `n` takes the value of each element in `qs` in each iteration.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `qs` is a non-empty list of integers.
   - `n` is the second element of `qs`.
   - `res` is a list with two elements where both elements are the result of `func_1(n, p)`.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `n` is the second element of `qs`, the next element in `qs` (the third element) will be the new value of `n` in the next iteration.
   - The list `qs` remains unchanged as it is being iterated over.
   - The variable `res` will be updated based on the new value of `n` (which is the third element of `qs`), but since the loop body is omitted, we don't know the exact update rule. However, the key point is that `res` will be updated using the new value of `n`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `qs` remains the same.
   - `n` becomes the third element of `qs`.
   - `res` will be updated based on the new value of `n`.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`qs` is a non-empty list of integers, `n` is the third element of `qs`, `res` is a list with two elements where the first element is the result of `func_1(n, p)` and the second element is also the result of `func_1(n, p)`**.
