Output State: `qs` is a non-empty list of integers, `res` is a list containing the results of applying `func_1(n, p)` for each `n` in `qs`. The length of `res` is equal to the length of `qs`.

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `res` will contain the results of applying the function `func_1` to each element in the list `qs`. The length of `res` will be the same as the length of `qs`, meaning `res` will have exactly as many elements as there are integers in `qs`. Each element in `res` corresponds to the result of `func_1` applied to the corresponding element in `qs`.
