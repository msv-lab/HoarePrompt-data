Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `n` and `qs`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each element in the list `qs`. For each iteration, `n` takes the value of the current element in `qs`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `qs` is a non-empty list of integers.
   - `n` is the first element of `qs`.
   - `res` is a list with one element, which is the result of `func_1(n, p)`.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - After the previous iteration, `n` was set to the first element of `qs`.
   - For the next iteration, `n` will take the value of the second element in `qs`.
   - The list `qs` remains the same as it was not modified within the loop body.
   - The variable `res` remains unchanged as it was only initialized based on the first element of `qs`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `n` will now be the second element of `qs`.
   - `qs` remains the same.
   - `res` remains the same.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`qs` is a non-empty list of integers, `n` is the second element of `qs`, `res` is a list with one element which is the result of `func_1(n, p)`**.
