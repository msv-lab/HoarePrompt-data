The function accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), and `p`, a list of positive integers representing a strictly increasing sequence where each element is between 1 and 100 (inclusive). It repeatedly subtracts the count of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `n` from `n` until `n` is less than the smallest element in `p`. After the loop completes, the function returns 0.
