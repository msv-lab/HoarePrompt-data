Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variable `n`, which is being iterated over the list `qs`.

2. **Determine the initial state of the loop head variables**:
   - `n` is the current element being processed in the list `qs`.
   - `qs` is a list of integers from the input.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in the list `qs`. 

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `n` is the current element being processed, it will be set to each element of `qs` one by one.
   - `qs` itself should be a non-empty list to ensure the loop can execute at least once.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `qs` must be a non-empty list (since the loop will not execute if `qs` is empty).
- `n` will take the value of each element in `qs` during each iteration.

Therefore, the state after adjustment should be:

**State: **`qs` is a non-empty list of integers, `n` is the first element of `qs`**.
