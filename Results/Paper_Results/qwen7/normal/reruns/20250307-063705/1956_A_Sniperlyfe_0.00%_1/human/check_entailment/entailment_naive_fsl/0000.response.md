Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not handle the case where the sequence `p` contains values that are greater than the current number of players `n`. According to the problem description, if the `i-th` player should be kicked out but there are fewer than `i` players remaining, they are skipped. However, the current implementation subtracts the sum of all elements in `p` from `n` without considering whether each element in `p` is within the bounds of the current number of players.

For example, consider the case where `n = 5` and `p = [3, 5]`. The function should kick out the 3rd and 5th players, leaving players 1, 2, and 4. However, the function will incorrectly subtract both 3 and 5 from `n`, resulting in `n` becoming negative, which is not the intended behavior.

To fix this, the function needs to iterate through `p` and only subtract the value from `n` if it is less than or equal to `n`. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n, p):
    for x in p:
        if x <= n:
            n -= 1
    return n
```

This corrected function ensures that only valid indices are subtracted from `n`, adhering to the problem's requirements.
