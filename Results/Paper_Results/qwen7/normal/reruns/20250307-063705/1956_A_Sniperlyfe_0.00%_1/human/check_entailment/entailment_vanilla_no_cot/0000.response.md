Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Function `func_1(n, p)`**:
   - This function calculates the number of winners for a given initial number of players `n` using the sequence `p`.
   - It iteratively removes players according to the sequence `p` until no more players can be removed.
   - The loop continues as long as `n` is greater than or equal to the minimum value in `p`.
   - For each iteration, it subtracts the count of players to be removed from `n`.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - This function handles the input and output for multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `k`, `q`, the sequence `p`, and the list of initial player counts `qs`.
   - It then calls `func_1(n, p)` for each `n` in `qs` and appends the result to the list `res`.
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

The logic within `func_1` and `func_2` matches the problem description accurately. The program processes each test case correctly and outputs the expected results. Therefore, the given program is correct.
