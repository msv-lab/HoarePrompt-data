Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, we know that `qs` is a non-empty list of integers, and `res` is a list containing the results of applying `func_1(n, p)` for each `n` in `qs`. The length of `res` is equal to the length of `qs`.

2. **Loop Head**: The loop is defined as `for _ in range(t):`. This means the loop will iterate `t` times.

3. **Loop Body**: The loop body is omitted, but we need to consider what happens inside the loop. Since the loop body is not specified, we can infer that within each iteration, some operation involving `func_1` is being applied to elements of `qs` and the results are being appended to `res`.

4. **State Adjustment**: For the loop to execute one more time, the variable `t` (which controls the number of iterations) needs to be adjusted. Specifically, `t` should be decremented by 1 because each iteration reduces the value of `t` by 1 until it reaches 0.

5. **Result List**: The length of `res` remains the same as the length of `qs` throughout the loop because each iteration appends one result to `res`. Therefore, the length of `res` does not change with each iteration.

6. **Final State**: At the start of the next iteration, `t` should be `t - 1`, and the length of `res` should still be equal to the length of `qs`.

Given this reasoning, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t`.

**Answer**:
State: **`qs` is a non-empty list of integers, `res` is a list containing the results of applying `func_1(n, p)` for each `n` in `qs`, and `t` is decreased by 1**.
