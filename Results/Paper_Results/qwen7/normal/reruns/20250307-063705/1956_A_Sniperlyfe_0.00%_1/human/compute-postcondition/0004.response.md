Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `qs = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a string input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `qs`. The values of `t`, `k`, and `q` remain unchanged. The new variable `qs` is created and populated with integers from the split input.
