Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable here is `t`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `t`**: The problem states that `t` is an input integer.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is at least 1. If `t` is 0, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the state**: Since the loop depends on the value of `t`, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0.

5. **Consider other variables**: The other variables (`k`, `q`, `p`, `qs`, and `t`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and their values do not affect whether the loop will execute. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted.

Based on these steps, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
