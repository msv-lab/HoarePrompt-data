Based on the initial state provided:

- `qs` is a list with at least one element, and the third element of `qs` is `n`.
- `res` is a list with three elements where the first two elements are the result of `func_1(n, p)` and the third element is the same as the second element.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
```

Let's break down the components:

1. `res` is a list with three elements:
   - The first two elements are the result of `func_1(n, p)`.
   - The third element is the same as the second element.

2. `map(str, res)` converts each element of `res` to a string.
3. `' '.join(...)` joins these string elements with a space in between.

Therefore, the output will be the first two results of `func_1(n, p)` separated by a space, followed by the second result again (since the third element is the same as the second).

Output: **first_result_of_func_1(n, p) second_result_of_func_1(n, p) second_result_of_func_1(n, p)**
