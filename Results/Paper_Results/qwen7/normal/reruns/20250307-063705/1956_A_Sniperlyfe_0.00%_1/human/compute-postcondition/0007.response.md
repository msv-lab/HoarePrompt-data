Output State: **`qs` is a list of integers that must have at least one element; `res` is a list with one element, which is the result of `func_1(n, p)`**.

Explanation: The code appends the result of `func_1(n, p)` to the list `res`. Since `qs` was initially a list of integers with at least one element, its state remains unchanged. The variable `res` is now a list containing one element, which is the result of the function call `func_1(n, p)`.
