### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies the logic implemented in the program and verifies its correctness through the provided examples. However, let's break down the program and the function summaries in more detail to ensure there are no hidden issues or edge cases that might have been overlooked.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis

1. **Logic**: The function `func_1` correctly simulates the game process by repeatedly removing players from the game until no more players can be removed. It uses a while loop to achieve this.
2. **Edge Cases**:
   - When `n < min(p)`, the loop terminates immediately because no players can be removed.
   - The subtraction of the sum of players to be removed in each round is correct.

#### Function `func_2` Analysis

1. **Logic**: The function `func_2` processes multiple test cases. It reads the necessary inputs, calls `func_1` for each initial player count, and stores the results.
2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles multiple test cases and prints the results in the required format.

#### Example Verification

The original assessment provides a detailed verification of the example provided in the problem statement. The examples show that the function correctly determines the number of winners for different initial player counts.

Given the detailed analysis and the correct handling of edge cases, the original assessment appears to be accurate.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **True**

The given program correctly implements the logic for the game described in the problem statement and handles all the provided examples correctly. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
