Output State: **`k` is a positive integer, `q` is a positive integer, `p` is a list of `k` integers representing the sequence `a` where `1 <= a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_k <= 100`, `qs` is a list of `q` integers representing `n_i` where `1 <= n_i <= 100`, `t` is an input integer**.

This means that the variable `t` has been assigned the value of the integer input by the user, while the values of `k`, `q`, `p`, and `qs` remain unchanged from their initial state.
