Based on the initial state provided:

- `qs` is a non-empty list of integers.
- `n` is the first element of `qs`.
- `res` is a list with one element which is the result of `func_1(n, p)`.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
```

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. `res` is a list containing one element, which is the result of `func_1(n, p)`.
2. `func_1(n, p)` is called with `n` being the first element of `qs` and `p` being an unspecified parameter.
3. The `map(str, res)` function converts the single element in `res` to a string.
4. `' '.join(map(str, res))` joins these strings with a space.

Since `res` contains only one element, the output will be the string representation of this element.

Output: **'result_of_func_1(n, p)' (where result_of_func_1(n, p) is the result of calling func_1 with n as the first element of qs and p as the parameter)**
