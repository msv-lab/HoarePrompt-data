Output State: **`qs` is a non-empty list of integers, `n` is the third element of `qs`, `res` is a list with three elements where the first two elements are the result of `func_1(n, p)` and the third element is also the result of `func_1(n, p)`**.

Explanation: The code appends the result of `func_1(n, p)` to the list `res`. Since `res` initially had two elements, both being the result of `func_1(n, p)`, after appending another element (which is again the result of `func_1(n, p)`), `res` now has three elements, with the first two being the same and the third one being the result of `func_1(n, p)` as well. All other variables remain unchanged.
