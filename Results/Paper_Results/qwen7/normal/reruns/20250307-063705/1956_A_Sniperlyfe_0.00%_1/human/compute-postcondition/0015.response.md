Based on the initial state provided:

- `qs` is a list of integers with at least one element.
- `res` is a list with two elements, where the second element is the result of `func_1(n, p)`.
- `n` is the second element of `qs`.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
```

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. `res` is a list with two elements. Let's denote these elements as `res[0]` and `res[1]`.
2. `res[1]` is the result of `func_1(n, p)`, where `n` is the second element of `qs`.
3. `map(str, res)` applies the `str` function to each element of `res`, converting them to strings.
4. `' '.join(map(str, res))` joins these string representations with a space as the separator.

Since the exact values of `qs` and `p` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `res[1]`. However, we know that `res[0]` and `res[1]` are the elements of the list `res`.

Therefore, the output will be the string representation of `res[0]` followed by the string representation of `res[1]`, separated by a space.

Output: **res[0] res[1]**
