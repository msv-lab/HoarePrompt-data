Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop uses `_` as the iterator variable, but it does not actually use this variable within the loop. The loop itself is controlled by the `range(t)`, meaning the loop will run `t` times.

2. **Understand the initial state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
   - `qs` is a non-empty list of integers.
   - `n` is the last element of `qs`.
   - `res` is a list containing the results of applying `func_1(n, p)` to each element of `qs`.

3. **Determine the state adjustments needed for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is controlled by `range(t)`, the only thing that changes with each iteration is the value of the loop counter, which is represented by `_`. However, since `_` is not used in the loop body, it does not affect the state of the variables outside the loop.
   - The list `qs` remains unchanged because the loop does not modify it.
   - The variable `n` remains the last element of `qs` because the loop does not change `n`.
   - The list `res` remains the same because the loop does not modify it.

4. **State at the start of the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, the only thing that needs to be adjusted is the number of iterations remaining. Since the loop runs `t` times, after one iteration, there are `t-1` iterations left.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`qs` is a non-empty list of integers, `n` is the last element of `qs`, `res` is a list containing the results of applying `func_1(n, p)` to each element of `qs`, and `t` is decreased by 1**.
