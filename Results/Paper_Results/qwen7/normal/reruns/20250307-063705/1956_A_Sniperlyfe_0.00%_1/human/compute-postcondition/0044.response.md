Based on the initial state provided:

- `qs` is a non-empty list.
- `n` is the second element of `qs`.
- `res` is a list with two elements, both of which are the result of `func_1(n, p)`.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
```

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. `res` is a list with two elements.
2. Both elements of `res` are the result of `func_1(n, p)`.
3. `map(str, res)` converts each element of `res` to a string.
4. `' '.join(map(str, res))` joins these string elements with a space in between.

Since `res` contains two elements, both of which are the result of `func_1(n, p)`, the output will be the results of `func_1(n, p)` concatenated with a space in between.

Output: **func_1(n, p) func_1(n, p)**
