Output State: **`qs` is a non-empty list of integers, `n` is the first element of `qs`, `res` is a list with one element which is the result of `func_1(n, p)`**.

Explanation: The code appends the result of `func_1(n, p)` to the list `res`. Here, `n` is the first element of the list `qs`, and `p` is assumed to be another variable. Since `res.append(func_1(n, p))` is executed, `res` now contains one additional element, which is the result of the function call `func_1(n, p)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
