Output State: **`qs` is a non-empty list of integers, `n` is the last element of `qs`, `res` is a list containing the results of applying `func_1(n, p)` to each element of `qs`.**

This means that after all the iterations of the loop have finished, `res` will contain the results of applying the function `func_1` to each element of the list `qs`. The variable `n` will hold the last element of `qs` that was processed in the loop. The other variables (`t`, `k`, `q`, and `p`) remain unchanged from their initial or previous states.
