Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `qs` is updated to a list of integers from user input, `n` is the last element of the updated `qs`, `res` is an empty list, `t` is decreased by 1, `k` is an integer input converted to int, `q` is an integer input converted to int, `p` is a list of integers obtained from user input.
Code of the loop:
for n in qs:
    res.append(func_1(n, p))
    print(' '.join(map(str, res)))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `qs` is a non-empty list, `n` is the first element of `qs`, `res` is a list with one element which is the result of `func_1(n, p)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `qs` is a non-empty list, `n` is the second element of `qs`, `res` is a list with two elements where the first element is the result of `func_1(n, p)` and the second element is also the result of `func_1(n, p)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `qs` is a list with at least one element (the third element from the original list), `n` is the third element of `qs`, `res` is a list with three elements where the first two elements are the result of `func_1(n, p)` and the third element is the same as the second element.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
