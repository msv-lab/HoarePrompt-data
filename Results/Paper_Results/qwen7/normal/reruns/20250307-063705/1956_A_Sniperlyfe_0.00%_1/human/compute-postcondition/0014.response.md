Output State: **`qs` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `res` is a list with two elements where the second element is the result of `func_1(n, p)`, and `n` is the second element of `qs`.**

Explanation: The code `res.append(func_1(n, p))` appends the result of `func_1(n, p)` to the list `res`. This does not change the length of `qs` or the value of `n` which is set to the second element of `qs`. The precondition that `qs` must have at least one element remains valid, and `res` now contains two elements where the second element is the result of `func_1(n, p)`.
