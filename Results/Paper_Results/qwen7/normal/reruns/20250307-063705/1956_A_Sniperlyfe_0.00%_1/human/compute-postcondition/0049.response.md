Output State: **`qs` is a non-empty list, `n` is the last element of `qs`, `res` is a list with all elements which are the results of `func_1(n, p)` for each `n` in `qs`.**

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `qs` will still be a non-empty list (since it starts as such and no elements are removed within the loop). The variable `n` will be set to the last element of `qs` because the loop iterates over each element of `qs`. The list `res` will contain the result of applying `func_1(n, p)` to every element `n` in `qs`, resulting in a list whose length is equal to the number of elements in `qs`.
