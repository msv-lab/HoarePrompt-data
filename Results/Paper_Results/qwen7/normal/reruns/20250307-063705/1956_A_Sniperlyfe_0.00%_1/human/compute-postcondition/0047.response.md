Output State: **`qs` is a list with at least one element (the third element from the original list), `n` is the third element of `qs`, `res` is a list with three elements where the first two elements are the result of `func_1(n, p)` and the third element is the same as the second element.**

Explanation: The code appends the result of `func_1(n, p)` to the list `res`. Initially, `res` had two elements which were the result of `func_1(n, p)`. After appending, `res` now has three elements: the first two are the results of `func_1(n, p)`, and the third element is the same as the second element because the append operation adds the new element at the end of the list.
