Reasoning:
- The function `func_1(n, p)` correctly implements the logic required to simulate the game rounds. It reduces `n` by the count of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `n` until `n` is less than the smallest element in `p`. This accurately simulates the process of kicking out players as specified in the problem description.
- The function `func_2()` reads input, processes each test case by calling `func_1(n, p)` for each `n` in `qs`, and prints the results. The logic in `func_2()` is correct and ensures that the results are printed in the required format.
- Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in both functions, the program correctly determines the number of winners for each initial number of players `n_i`.

Correctness: **True**
