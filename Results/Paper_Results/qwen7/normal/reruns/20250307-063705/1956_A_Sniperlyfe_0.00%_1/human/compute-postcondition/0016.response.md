Output State: `qs` is a list of integers, `res` is a list containing the results of applying `func_1(n, p)` for each `n` in `qs`. The length of `res` is equal to the length of `qs`.

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `res` will contain the results of applying the function `func_1(n, p)` to each element `n` in the list `qs`. The length of `res` will be the same as the length of `qs`, meaning `res` will have exactly as many elements as there are integers in `qs`.
