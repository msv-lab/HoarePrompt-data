Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `n` and `qs`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each element in the list `qs`. For the loop to continue, `qs` must contain at least one element, and `n` will take the value of each element in `qs` in sequence.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `qs` is a non-empty list of integers.
   - `n` is the first element of `qs`.
   - `res` is a list with one element which is the result of `func_1(n, p)`.

4. **Adjusting the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `qs` is a non-empty list, it will still have elements left to iterate over.
   - After processing the first element `n`, the next element in `qs` will become the new value of `n`.
   - The list `qs` will be updated to exclude the first element (since `n` was the first element of `qs`).

5. **New State**:
   - `qs` will now be the list excluding the first element.
   - `n` will be the second element of the original `qs`.
   - `res` remains unchanged as it was only initialized based on the first element of `qs`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `qs` is a non-empty list of integers (excluding the first element), `n` is the second element of the original `qs`, `res` is a list with one element which is the result of `func_1(n, p)`**.
