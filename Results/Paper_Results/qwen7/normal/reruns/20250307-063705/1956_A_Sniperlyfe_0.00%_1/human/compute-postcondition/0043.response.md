Output State: **`qs` is a non-empty list, `n` is the second element of `qs`, `res` is a list with two elements where the first element is the result of `func_1(n, p)` and the second element is also the result of `func_1(n, p)`.**

Explanation: The code `res.append(func_1(n, p))` appends the result of `func_1(n, p)` to the list `res`. Since `res` initially had one element (the result of `func_1(n, p)`), after appending, `res` now contains two elements, both of which are the result of `func_1(n, p)`. The values of `qs` and `n` remain unchanged.
