Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for n in qs:`. The variables involved here are `n` and `qs`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `qs` is a non-empty list.
   - `n` is the second element of `qs`.
   - `res` is a list with two elements where each element is the result of `func_1(n, p)`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements left in the list `qs`. After processing the second element (which is `n`), the loop needs to check if there are more elements in `qs` to process.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `n` was the second element of `qs`, the next element in `qs` will be the third element.
   - `qs` will now be the list without the first two elements (i.e., `qs[2:]`).
   - `res` will remain unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`qs` is a list with at least one element (the third element from the original list), `n` is the third element of `qs`, `res` is a list with two elements where each element is the result of `func_1(n, p)`**.
