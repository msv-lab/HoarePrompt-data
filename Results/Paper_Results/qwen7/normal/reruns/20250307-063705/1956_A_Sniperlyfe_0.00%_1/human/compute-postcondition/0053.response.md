Functionality: **The function processes multiple inputs consisting of a sequence `p` and a list of integers `qs`. For each integer `n` in `qs`, it applies another function `func_1(n, p)` and collects the results in a list `res`. After processing all integers in `qs` across all iterations, it prints the results in a space-separated format for each iteration. The final state of the program is characterized by the list `res` containing the results of applying `func_1` to each element in `qs` from the last iteration of the loop, with the length of `res` being the sum of the lengths of `qs` from all iterations.**
