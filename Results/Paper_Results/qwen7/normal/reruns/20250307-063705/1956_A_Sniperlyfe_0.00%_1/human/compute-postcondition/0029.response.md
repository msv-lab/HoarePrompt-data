Given the initial state:
- `qs` is a non-empty list of integers.
- `n` is the second element of `qs`.
- `res` is a list with two elements where both elements are the result of `func_1(n, p)`.

The code snippet to execute is:
```python
print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
```

Let's break down the steps:

1. `res` is a list with two elements, and each element is the result of `func_1(n, p)`.
2. `func_1(n, p)` is called twice to populate `res`.
3. `map(str, res)` converts each element of `res` to a string.
4. `' '.join(map(str, res))` joins these string representations with a space as the separator.

Since `n` is the second element of `qs`, and `res` contains two elements from `func_1(n, p)`, the output will be the string representation of the results of `func_1(n, p)` joined by a space.

Output: **func_1(n, p) func_1(n, p) (where n is the second element of qs and func_1(n, p) is the result of the function call)**
