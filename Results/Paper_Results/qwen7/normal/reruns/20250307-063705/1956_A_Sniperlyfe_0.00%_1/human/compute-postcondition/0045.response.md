Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `n` and `qs`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element in the list `qs`. At the end of the previous iteration, `n` was the second element of `qs`.

3. **Determine the next value of `n`**: Since the loop iterates over each element in `qs`, the next value of `n` will be the third element of `qs`.

4. **Adjust the state of `qs`**: Since `n` is now the third element of `qs`, `qs` must still be a non-empty list, but it should now include its third element.

5. **Adjust the state of `res`**: The variable `res` is a list with two elements, each being the result of `func_1(n, p)`. Since `n` changes to the third element of `qs`, both elements of `res` should now be the result of `func_1` applied to the new value of `n`.

Given these points, the updated state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `qs` is a non-empty list, and `n` is the third element of `qs`.
- `res` is a list with two elements where each element is the result of `func_1(n, p)` applied to the new value of `n`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `qs` is a non-empty list, `n` is the third element of `qs`, `res` is a list with two elements where each element is the result of `func_1(n, p)`**
