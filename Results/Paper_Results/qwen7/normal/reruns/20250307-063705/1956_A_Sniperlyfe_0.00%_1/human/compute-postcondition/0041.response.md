Based on the initial state provided:

- `qs` is a non-empty list.
- `n` is the first element of `qs`.
- `res` is a list with one element, which is the result of `func_1(n, p)`.

The `print(' '.join(map(str, res)))` statement will execute as follows:

1. `map(str, res)` will convert the single element in `res` to a string.
2. `' '.join(...)` will join this string with a space character.
3. Since `res` contains only one element, the output will be a single string representation of this element.

Given that `res` is the result of `func_1(n, p)`, where `n` is the first element of the list `qs` and `p` is an unknown parameter, the output will be the string representation of the result of `func_1(n, p)`.

Output: **' ' .join(map(str, func_1(n, p)))(where n is the first element of qs and p is an unknown parameter)**
