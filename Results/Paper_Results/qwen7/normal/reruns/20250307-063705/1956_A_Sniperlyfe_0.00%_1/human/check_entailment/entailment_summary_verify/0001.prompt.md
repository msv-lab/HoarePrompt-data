You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Nene invented a new game based on an increasing sequence of integers a_1, a_2,
\ldots, a_k .

In this game, initially n players are lined up in a row. In each of the rounds
of this game, the following happens:

  * Nene finds the a_1 -th, a_2 -th, \ldots , a_k -th players in a row. They are kicked out of the game simultaneously. If the i -th player in a row should be kicked out, but there are fewer than i players in a row, they are skipped. 

Once no one is kicked out of the game in some round, all the players that are
still in the game are declared as winners.

For example, consider the game with a=[3, 5] and n=5 players. Let the players
be named player A, player B, \ldots , player E in the order they are lined up
initially. Then,

  * Before the first round, players are lined up as ABCDE. Nene finds the 3 -rd and the 5 -th players in a row. These are players C and E. They are kicked out in the first round. 
  * Now players are lined up as ABD. Nene finds the 3 -rd and the 5 -th players in a row. The 3 -rd player is player D and there is no 5 -th player in a row. Thus, only player D is kicked out in the second round. 
  * In the third round, no one is kicked out of the game, so the game ends after this round. 
  * Players A and B are declared as the winners. 

Nene has not yet decided how many people would join the game initially. Nene
gave you q integers n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_q and you should answer the following
question for each 1 \le i \le q independently:

  * How many people would be declared as winners if there are n_i players in the game initially? 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 250 ). The description of test cases follows.

The first line case contains two integers k and q (1 \le k, q \le 100 ) — the
length of the sequence a and the number of values n_i you should solve this
problem for.

The second line contains k integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_k (1\leq
a_1<a_2<\ldots<a_k\leq 100 ) — the sequence a .

The third line contains q integers n_1,n_2,\ldots,n_q (1\leq n_i \leq 100 ).

Output

For each test case, output q integers: the i -th (1\le i \le q ) of them
should be the number of players declared as winners if initially n_i players
join the game.

Note

The first test case was explained in the statement.

In the second test case, when n=1 , the only player stays in the game in the
first round. After that, the game ends and the only player is declared as a
winner.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, p):
    while n >= min(p):
        n -= sum((1 for x in p if x <= n))
    return n

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (k, q) = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        qs = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = []
        for n in qs:
            res.append(func_1(n, p))
            print(' '.join(map(str, res)))



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function processes multiple inputs consisting of a sequence `p` and a list of integers `qs`. For each integer `n` in `qs`, it applies another function `func_1(n, p)` and collects the results in a list `res`. After processing all integers in `qs` across all iterations, it prints the results in a space-separated format for each iteration. The final state of the program is characterized by the list `res` containing the results of applying `func_1` to each element in `qs` from the last iteration of the loop, with the length of `res` being the sum of the lengths of `qs` from all iterations.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function aims to simulate the game process.
   - It takes two parameters: `n` (number of players) and `p` (the sequence of positions to kick out).
   - The function uses a while loop to repeatedly remove players from the game until no more players can be removed.
   - Inside the loop, it calculates the number of players to remove in each round using a generator expression `(1 for x in p if x <= n)`.
   - The sum of these generators gives the total number of players to remove in the current round.
   - It subtracts this sum from `n` and continues the loop until `n < min(p)`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function handles the input and output for multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `k`, `q`, the sequence `p`, and the list of initial player counts `qs`.
   - It calls `func_1` for each initial player count `n` in `qs` and appends the result to `res`.
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

### Verification of Logic

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The logic inside `func_1` correctly simulates the game process by removing players based on the given sequence `p`.
   - The while loop ensures that the game continues until no more players can be removed.
   - The subtraction of the sum of players to be removed in each round is correct.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function correctly processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the necessary inputs and calls `func_1` for each initial player count.
   - The results are stored and printed correctly.

### Example Verification

Let's verify the example provided in the problem statement:

- For `n = 5` and `p = [3, 5]`:
  - First round: Remove players at positions 3 and 5 (C and E). Remaining: ABD.
  - Second round: Remove player at position 3 (D). Remaining: AB.
  - Third round: No more players to remove. Winners: A and B.
  - Result: 2

- For `n = 3` and `p = [3, 5]`:
  - First round: Remove player at position 3 (C). Remaining: AB.
  - Second round: No more players to remove. Winners: A and B.
  - Result: 2

- For `n = 6` and `p = [3, 5]`:
  - First round: Remove players at positions 3 and 5 (C and E). Remaining: ABD.
  - Second round: Remove player at position 3 (D). Remaining: AB.
  - Third round: No more players to remove. Winners: A and B.
  - Result: 2

- For `n = 7` and `p = [3, 5]`:
  - First round: Remove players at positions 3 and 5 (C and E). Remaining: ABD.
  - Second round: Remove player at position 3 (D). Remaining: AB.
  - Third round: No more players to remove. Winners: A and B.
  - Result: 2

- For `n = 9` and `p = [3, 5]`:
  - First round: Remove players at positions 3 and 5 (C and E). Remaining: ABD.
  - Second round: Remove player at position 3 (D). Remaining: AB.
  - Third round: No more players to remove. Winners: A and B.
  - Result: 2

### Conclusion

The given program correctly implements the logic for the game described in the problem statement. It handles the removal of players based on the given sequence and outputs the correct number of winners for each initial player count.
