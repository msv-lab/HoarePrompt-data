Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for n in qs:`. The variables involved here are `n` and `qs`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `qs` is a list of integers that must have at least one element.
   - `res` is a list with one element, which is the result of `func_1(n, p)`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `qs` has at least one element. After each iteration, `n` will be the next element in the list `qs`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `n` is being taken from `qs`, after the first iteration, `n` will be the first element of `qs`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `qs` must still have at least one element left.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `n` will be the first element of `qs`.
   - `qs` will be the remaining elements of the list after removing the first element (since `n` was taken from it).

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `n` will be the first element of `qs`.
- `qs` will be the remaining elements of the list after removing the first element.

Since we don't know the exact value of `n` or the contents of `qs`, we can represent the state as follows:

State: **`qs` is a list of integers that must have at least two elements, `res` is a list with one element, which is the result of `func_1(n, p)`, and `n` is the first element of `qs`**.
