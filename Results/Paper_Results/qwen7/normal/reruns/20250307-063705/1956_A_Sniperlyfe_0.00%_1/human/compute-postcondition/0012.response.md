Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `n` and `qs`.

2. **Understand the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as there are elements left in the list `qs`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is the first element of `qs`, and `qs` must have at least two elements.

3. **Determine the state adjustments**:
   - Since `n` is the first element of `qs`, and `qs` must have at least two elements, for the loop to continue, `qs` must still have at least two elements.
   - `n` will be updated to the next element in the list `qs` for the next iteration.

Given these points, we can conclude that for the loop to execute one more time:
- `qs` must still have at least two elements.
- `n` will be the second element of `qs`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `qs` is a list of integers that must have at least two elements, `res` is a list with two elements where the second element is the result of `func_1(n, p)`, and `n` is the second element of `qs`**
