Given the initial state:
- `qs` is a list of integers that must have at least two elements.
- `res` is a list with two elements where the second element is the result of `func_1(n, p)`.
- `n` is the first element of `qs`.

The code snippet to execute is:
```python
print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
```

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. `res` is a list with two elements.
2. The second element of `res` is the result of `func_1(n, p)`.
3. `n` is the first element of `qs`.
4. `map(str, res)` converts each element of `res` to a string.
5. `' '.join(map(str, res))` joins these string elements with a space as the separator.

Since we know that `res` has two elements and the second element is the result of `func_1(n, p)`, the output will be the two elements of `res` separated by a space.

Output: **res[0] res[1]** (where `res[0]` is the first element of `res` and `res[1]` is the result of `func_1(n, p)`).
