Output State: **`qs` is a non-empty list of integers, `n` is the last element of `qs`, `res` is a list containing the results of applying `func_1(n, p)` to each element of `qs`, `t` is decreased by 1, `k` is an integer input converted to int, `q` is an integer input converted to int.**

The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `k` and `q`. These values are not specified in the initial state, so they are treated as new variables with the values of the integers inputted by the user. The other variables remain unchanged except for `t`, which is decreased by 1.
