You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: k and q are positive integers such that 1 <= k, q <= 100; p is a list of k integers representing the sequence a where 1 <= a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_k <= 100; qs is a list of q integers representing n_i where 1 <= n_i <= 100.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        k, q = map(int, input().split())
        
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        qs = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        res = []
        
        for n in qs:
            res.append(func_1(n, p))
            print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
        
    #State: Output State: `qs` is a non-empty list of integers, `res` is a list containing the results of applying `func_1(n, p)` for each `n` in `qs` for all iterations of the loop. The length of `res` is equal to the total number of elements in `qs` across all iterations of the loop. Each element in `res` corresponds to the result of `func_1` applied to the corresponding element in `qs` from the last iteration of the loop.
    #
    #In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `res` will contain the results of applying the function `func_1` to each element in the list `qs` from all iterations. The length of `res` will be the sum of the lengths of `qs` from all iterations, meaning `res` will have exactly as many elements as there are integers in `qs` from all iterations combined. Each element in `res` corresponds to the result of `func_1` applied to the corresponding element in `qs` from the last iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: `k` and `q`, both are positive integers such that 1 <= k, q <= 100; and `p`, a list of `k` integers representing the sequence `a` where 1 <= a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_k <= 100; and `qs`, a list of `q` integers representing `n_i` where 1 <= n_i <= 100. The function returns a result based on the relationship between the elements in `p` and `qs`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
