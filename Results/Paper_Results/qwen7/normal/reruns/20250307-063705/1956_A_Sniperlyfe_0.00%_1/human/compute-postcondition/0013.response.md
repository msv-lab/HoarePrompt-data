Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for n in qs:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `n` and `qs`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `qs` is a list of integers that must have at least two elements.
   - `res` is a list with two elements where the second element is the result of `func_1(n, p)`.
   - `n` is the first element of `qs`.

3. **Understand what happens in each iteration**:
   - In each iteration, `n` takes the value of the next element in the list `qs`.
   - The loop continues as long as there are more elements in `qs`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `n` is the first element of `qs` at the start of the first iteration, after processing the first element, `n` will be set to the second element of `qs`.
   - `qs` will still be the same list, but it will now have one fewer element because the first element has been processed.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `n` will be the second element of `qs`.
   - `qs` must still have at least one element left (since it had at least two elements initially and one has been processed).

6. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `qs` must have at least one element left, meaning it must have at least one element.
   - `n` will be the second element of `qs`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `qs` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `res` is a list with two elements where the second element is the result of `func_1(n, p)`, and `n` is the second element of `qs`.**
