Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for n in qs:`. This means the variables involved in the loop head are `n` and `qs`.

2. **Understand the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `qs` is a non-empty list.
   - `n` is the first element of `qs`.
   - `res` is a list with one element which is the result of `func_1(n, p)`.

3. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `qs` must still be a non-empty list, and `n` must be the next element in the list `qs`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `qs` is a non-empty list, it will still be a non-empty list for the next iteration.
   - `n` will now be the second element of `qs` because the first element (the current `n`) has already been processed.
   - The variable `res` does not change within the loop head, so its state remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`qs` is a non-empty list, `n` is the second element of `qs`, `res` is a list with one element which is the result of `func_1(n, p)`**
