Output State: **`qs` is a non-empty list of integers, `res` is a list containing the results of applying `func_1(n, p)` for each `n` in `qs`, `t` is decreased by 1, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `p = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to `p`. The other variables (`qs`, `res`, `t`, `k`, and `q`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
