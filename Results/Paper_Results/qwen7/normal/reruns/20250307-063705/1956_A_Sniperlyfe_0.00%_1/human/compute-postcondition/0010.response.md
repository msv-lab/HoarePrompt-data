Output State: **`qs` is a list of integers that must have at least two elements, `res` is a list with two elements where the second element is the result of `func_1(n, p)`, and `n` is the first element of `qs`.**

Explanation: The code `res.append(func_1(n, p))` appends the result of the function call `func_1(n, p)` to the list `res`. Initially, `res` contains one element, which is the result of `func_1(n, p)`. After appending, `res` now contains two elements: the original element and the new result from `func_1(n, p)`. The variable `n` remains unchanged and is still the first element of the list `qs`.
