Output State: **`qs` is updated to a list of integers from user input, `n` is the last element of the updated `qs`, `res` is unchanged, `t` is decreased by 1, `k` is an integer input converted to int, `q` is an integer input converted to int, `p` is a list of integers obtained from user input.**

Explanation: The code `qs = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input and converts them into a list of integers. This list replaces the original `qs`. The variable `n` is now set to the last element of this new `qs`. The variables `res`, `t`, `k`, `q`, and `p` remain unchanged from their previous states.
