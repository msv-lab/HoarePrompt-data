Output State: **`qs` is a non-empty list of integers, `n` is the last element of `qs`, `res` is a list containing the results of applying `func_1(n, p)` to each element of `qs`, `t` is decreased by 1, `k` is an integer input converted to int, `q` is an integer input converted to int, `p` is a list of integers obtained from user input.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of space-separated integers from the user input and splits it into a list of integers using `map(int, input().split())`. This list is assigned to the variable `p`. The other variables (`qs`, `n`, `res`, `t`, `k`, `q`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
