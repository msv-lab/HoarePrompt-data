Output State: **`qs` is updated to a list of integers from the input, `res` is a list containing the results of applying `func_1(n, p)` for each `n` in the updated `qs`, `t` is decreased by 1, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code updates `qs` to a list of integers obtained from the input using `map(int, input().split())`. The other variables (`res`, `t`, `k`, `q`, `p`) remain unchanged except for `t` which is decreased by 1. The function `func_1(n, p)` is applied to each element `n` in the updated `qs`, but since the exact values of `func_1(n, p)` are not provided, `res` remains as a list of results of these function applications.
