Output State: **`qs` is a non-empty list, `n` is the first element of `qs`, `res` is a list with one element which is the result of `func_1(n, p)`.**

Explanation: The code appends the result of `func_1(n, p)` to the list `res`. Since `n` is the first element of `qs`, it remains unchanged. The list `res` is initialized or extended to include the result of the function call `func_1(n, p)`.
