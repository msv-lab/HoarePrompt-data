Output State: **`qs` is a list of integers from the input, `res` is an empty list, `t` is decreased by 1, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code initializes `res` as an empty list. This means that the previous values of `qs`, `t`, `k`, `q`, and `p` remain unchanged, while `res` is now an empty list.
