### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine the number of players who remain in the game after repeatedly removing players at positions specified by the sequence \(a\).
   - The function `func_1` simulates the process of removing players and returns the number of players remaining.
   - The function `func_2` processes multiple test cases, calling `func_1` for each initial number of players \(n\) and collecting the results.

2. **Analysis of `func_1`:**
   - The function iteratively removes players from the game until the smallest index in the sequence \(p\) is greater than the current number of players \(n\).
   - It correctly reduces \(n\) by the count of indices in \(p\) that are less than or equal to \(n\), ensuring that players are removed according to the rules.
   - The function returns 0 once no more players can be removed.

3. **Analysis of `func_2`:**
   - The function reads input for multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the sequence \(p\) and the list of initial player counts \(qs\).
   - It applies `func_1` to each initial player count and collects the results.
   - The results are printed after processing each test case.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The logic in `func_1` is correct and ensures that players are removed according to the specified sequence.
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and prints the results for each initial player count.
   - There are no logical errors or inconsistencies in the provided code.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

**Correctness: True**
