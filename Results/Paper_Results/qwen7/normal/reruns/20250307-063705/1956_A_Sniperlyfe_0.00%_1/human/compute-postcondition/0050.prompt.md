Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `k` is a positive integer, `q` is a positive integer, `p` is a list of `k` integers representing the sequence `a` where `1 <= a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_k <= 100`, `qs` is a list of `q` integers representing `n_i` where `1 <= n_i <= 100`, `t` is an input integer
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    k, q = map(int, input().split())
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    qs = list(map(int, input().split()))
    res = []
    for n in qs:
        res.append(func_1(n, p))
        print(' '.join(map(str, res)))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `qs` is a non-empty list of integers, `res` is a list containing the results of applying `func_1(n, p)` for each `n` in `qs`. The length of `res` is equal to the length of `qs`.

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `res` will contain the results of applying the function `func_1` to each element in the list `qs`. The length of `res` will be the same as the length of `qs`, meaning `res` will have exactly as many elements as there are integers in `qs`. Each element in `res` corresponds to the result of `func_1` applied to the corresponding element in `qs`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `qs` is a non-empty list of integers, `n` is the last element of `qs`, `res` is a list containing the results of applying `func_1(n, p)` to each element of `qs`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `qs` is a non-empty list, `n` is the last element of `qs`, `res` is a list with all elements which are the results of `func_1(n, p)` for each `n` in `qs`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
