Based on the initial state provided:

- `qs` is a non-empty list of integers.
- `n` is the third element of `qs`.
- `res` is a list with three elements where the first two elements are the result of `func_1(n, p)` and the third element is also the result of `func_1(n, p)`.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
```

This statement will join the elements of the list `res` into a single string, with each element converted to a string and separated by spaces. Since the third element of `res` is the same as the first two, the output will consist of the results of `func_1(n, p)` repeated three times, separated by spaces.

To summarize:
- `res[0]` and `res[1]` are both the result of `func_1(n, p)`.
- `res[2]` is also the result of `func_1(n, p)`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **func_1(n, p) func_1(n, p) func_1(n, p)**
