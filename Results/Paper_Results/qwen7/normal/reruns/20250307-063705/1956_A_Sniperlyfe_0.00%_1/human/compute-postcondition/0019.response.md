Output State: **`qs` is a non-empty list of integers, `res` is a list containing the results of applying `func_1(n, p)` for each `n` in `qs`, `t` is decreased by 1, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer.**

The code reads two integers `k` and `q` from input using `map(int, input().split())`. These values replace the previous values of `k` and `q`, which were undefined in the initial state. The other variables (`qs`, `res`, and `t`) remain unchanged except for `t` being decreased by 1.
