Let's break down the task step by step:

1. Identify the objects in the loop head: The loop head is `for n in qs:`. The objects involved here are `n` and `qs`.

2. Determine the initial state of these objects:
   - `n` is the variable that will take on each value from the list `qs` during each iteration of the loop.
   - `qs` is the list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.

3. Understand the conditions under which the loop can execute:
   - The loop will execute as long as `qs` is not empty (i.e., it has at least one element).

4. Adjust the states based on the above understanding:
   - Since `qs` is a list, we need to ensure that it has at least one element for the loop to execute.
   - The variable `n` will take on the values from `qs` during each iteration, but its initial state is not specified in the problem statement.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `qs` must have at least one element.
- `n` will take on the values from `qs`, but its initial value is not relevant to the loop's execution condition.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

State: **`qs` is a list of integers that must have at least one element**
