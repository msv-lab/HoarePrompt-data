Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `k, q = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `k` and `q`. The initial state of `t` being greater than 0 is not affected by this operation. Therefore, `t` must still be greater than 0, while `k` and `q` are now specific integers obtained from user input.
