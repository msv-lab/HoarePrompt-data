Based on the initial state provided:

- `qs` is a list of integers that must have at least one element.
- `res` is a list with one element, which is the result of `func_1(n, p)`.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
```

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. `res` is a list containing one element. This element is the result of `func_1(n, p)`.
2. `map(str, res)` converts the single element of `res` into a string.
3. `' '.join(map(str, res))` joins these strings with a space in between.

Since `res` contains a single element, let's denote this element as `result_of_func_1`. Therefore, the `print` statement will join this single string representation with no spaces in between because there's only one element.

Output: **result_of_func_1**
