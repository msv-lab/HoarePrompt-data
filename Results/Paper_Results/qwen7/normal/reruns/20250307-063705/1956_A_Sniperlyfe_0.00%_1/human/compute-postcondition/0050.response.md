Output State: `qs` is a non-empty list of integers, `res` is a list containing the results of applying `func_1(n, p)` for each `n` in `qs` for all iterations of the loop. The length of `res` is equal to the total number of elements in `qs` across all iterations of the loop.

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `res` will contain the results of applying the function `func_1` to each element in the list `qs` from all iterations. The length of `res` will be the sum of the lengths of `qs` from each iteration of the loop, meaning `res` will have as many elements as there are integers in `qs` from all iterations combined. Each element in `res` corresponds to the result of `func_1` applied to the corresponding element in `qs` from the respective iteration.
