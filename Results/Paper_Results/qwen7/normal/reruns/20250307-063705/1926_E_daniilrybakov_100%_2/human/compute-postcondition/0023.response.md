The loop condition is `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be non-zero.

At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is `n // 2`. To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 0 after the division operation.

Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 after the division.

State: **`t` must be an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0 after the division, `k` is an input integer, `s` is `s + (n + 1) // 2`, `m` is 4**
