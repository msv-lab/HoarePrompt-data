Output State: **`t` must be an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4, `n` is now `n // 2`, `k` is an input integer, `s` is 0, `m` is 1, `x` is `((n + 1) // 2)`**

Explanation: The code `n //= 2` divides `n` by 2 and assigns the quotient back to `n`. All other variables (`t`, `k`, `s`, `m`, and `x`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The precondition that `n` must be non-zero is still valid since `n` is being halved, which does not affect its non-zero status.
