Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is `n` // 2, `k` is an input integer, `s` is `s` + (`n` + 1) // 2 + (`n` + 1) // 2, `m` is 4, `x` is (n + 1) // 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables but indicates that the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was inside. All other variables retain their previous values.
