Output State: `t` is 0, `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `s` is the cumulative sum of `(n + 1) // 2` for each iteration until `n` becomes 0, `m` is \(2^{\text{number of iterations}}\), and `x` is (n + 1) // 2 for the last iteration when `n` is 0.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `t` will be 0 because it decreases by 1 for each iteration until it reaches 0. `n` will be 0 because it keeps halving until it reaches 0. The variable `s` will be the total sum of the values of `(n + 1) // 2` for each iteration. The variable `m` will be \(2^{\text{number of iterations}}\), representing the number of times the loop was executed. The variable `x` will hold the value of `(n + 1) // 2` from the last iteration when `n` is 0.
