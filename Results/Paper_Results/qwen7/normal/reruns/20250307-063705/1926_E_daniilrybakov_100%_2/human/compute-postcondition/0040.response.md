Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\) and is decreased by 1, `n` is now `n // 4`, `k` is an input integer, `s` is 0, `m` is 1, `x` is `(n + 1) // 4**.

Explanation: The code `n //= 2` divides `n` by 2 and floors the result, effectively making `n` now `n // 4` from its previous state where `n` was `n // 8`. The other variables (`t`, `k`, `s`, `m`, and `x`) remain unchanged.
