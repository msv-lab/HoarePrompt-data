Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` must be non-zero, `k` is an input integer, `s` is 0, `m` is 1, `x` is (n + 1) // 2**

The value of `x` is updated to `(n + 1) // 2`. Since `n` must be non-zero, the value of `x` will be the integer division of `n + 1` by 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.
