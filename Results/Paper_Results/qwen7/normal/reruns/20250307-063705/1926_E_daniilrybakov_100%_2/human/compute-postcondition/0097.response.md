Output State: `t` is 0, `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `s` is the cumulative sum of `(n + 1) // 2` for each iteration until `n` becomes 0, `m` is \(2^t\), and `x` is the value of `(n + 1) // 2` from the last iteration when `n` is 0.

After the loop executes all its iterations, `t` will be reduced to 0 because it decreases by 1 for each iteration of the loop. The variable `n` will be 0 because it keeps halving until it reaches 0. The variable `s` will be the cumulative sum of `(n + 1) // 2` for each iteration, starting from the initial value of `t` and continuing until `n` becomes 0. The variable `m` will be \(2^t\) since it doubles with each iteration of the loop, and initially, `t` is the number of iterations. The variable `x` will hold the value of `(n + 1) // 2` from the last iteration when `n` is 0.
