Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `s` is the accumulated sum, `m` is \(2^{\text{number of iterations}}\), `x` is 1**.

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. The variables `t`, `s`, `m`, and `x` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, their values remain as they were in the initial state.
