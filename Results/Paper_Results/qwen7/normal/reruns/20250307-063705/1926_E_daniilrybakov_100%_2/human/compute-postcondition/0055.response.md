The loop condition is `n`. Therefore, the only variable in the loop head is `n`, and we need to adjust this variable for the loop to execute one more time.

At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is `n // 2`. For the loop to continue executing, `n` must be greater than 0. Since `n` is now `n // 2`, the new value of `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 after the current iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\) and has been decreased by 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `s` is `s + (n + 1) // 2`, `m` is 4, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`, and `s` is incremented by `x`.**
