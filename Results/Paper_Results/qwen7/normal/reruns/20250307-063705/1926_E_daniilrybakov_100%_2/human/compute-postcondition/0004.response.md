Output State: **`t` must be an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `s` is 0, `m` is 1**.

In this case, the code simply assigns the value 1 to the variable `m`. Since `t`, `n`, `k`, and `s` are not affected by this line of code, their states remain unchanged. The only new information is that `m` is now equal to 1.
