Output State: **`t` must be an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4, `n` is now `n // 2`, `k` is an input integer, `s` is `s + (n + 1) // 2`, `m` is 8, and if `s < k` and `k <= s + (n + 1) // 2`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The value of `m` is multiplied by 2, so `m` changes from 4 to 8. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
