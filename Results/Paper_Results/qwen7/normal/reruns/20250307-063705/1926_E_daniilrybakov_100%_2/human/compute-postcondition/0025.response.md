Output State: **`t` must be an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4, `n` is now `n // 2`, `k` is an input integer, `s` is `s + x`, `m` is 4, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`**.

Explanation: The code `n //= 2` divides `n` by 2 and assigns the quotient back to `n`. The other variables (`t`, `k`, `s`, `m`, and `x`) are not affected by this operation. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 0 after the division remains valid, but since the exact value of `n` is halved, we cannot specify a concrete value for `n` without knowing its original value. However, we know it is now half of its original value.
