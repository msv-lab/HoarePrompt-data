Output State: **`t` must be an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0 after the division, `k` is an input integer, `s` is `s + x`, `m` is 4, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `(n + 1) // 2` to the variable `x`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `s`, and `m`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The updated value of `x` is expressed as `(n + 1) // 2`.
