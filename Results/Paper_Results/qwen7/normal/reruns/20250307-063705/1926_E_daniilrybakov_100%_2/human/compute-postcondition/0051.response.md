Postcondition: `t` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\) and has been decreased by 1, `n` is now `n // 2`, `k` is an input integer, `s` is `s + (n + 1) // 4`, `m` is 2, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`, and if `s < k` and `k <= s + x`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
