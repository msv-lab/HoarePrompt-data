Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is `n` // 2, `k` is an input integer, `s` is `s` + (`n` + 1) // 2 + (`n` + 1) // 2, `m` is 4, `x` is (n + 1) // 2**.

Explanation: The code `n //= 2` divides `n` by 2 and assigns the floor division result back to `n`. The other variables (`t`, `k`, `s`, `m`, and `x`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, their states remain unchanged except for `n`, which is now updated to `n // 2`.
