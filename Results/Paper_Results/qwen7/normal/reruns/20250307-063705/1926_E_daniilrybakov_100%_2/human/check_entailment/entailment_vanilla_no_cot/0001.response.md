Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`.

2. **Variable Initialization:**
   - `s` is initialized to 0.
   - `m` is initialized to 1.

3. **While Loop:**
   - The loop continues as long as `n` is greater than 0.
   - Inside the loop:
     - `x` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`, which represents the number of odd-numbered cards that can be laid down at the current step.
     - `n` is halved (`n //= 2`), effectively moving to the next step where the multiplier increases by 1.
     - If `s < k` and `k <= s + x`, the loop breaks, indicating that the current step is the one where the `k`-th card falls.
     - Otherwise, `s` is updated by adding `x`, and `m` is doubled (`m *= 2`).

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - After exiting the loop, the program calculates the `k`-th card using the formula `(2 * (k - s) - 1) * m`.
   - This formula correctly identifies the card based on the cumulative count `s` and the multiplier `m`.
