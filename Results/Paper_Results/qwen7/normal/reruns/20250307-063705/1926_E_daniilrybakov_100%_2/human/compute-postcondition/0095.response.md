Output State: `t` is 0, `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `s` is the sum of `s` plus (`n` + 1) // 2 for each iteration until `n` becomes 0, `m` is 2 raised to the power of the number of iterations, and `x` is (n + 1) // 2 for the last iteration.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `n` will be 0 because it keeps halving until it reaches 0. The variable `s` will be the cumulative sum of `(n + 1) // 2` for each iteration. The variable `m` will be 2 raised to the power of the number of iterations, which is equivalent to `2^number_of_iterations`. The variable `x` will hold the value of `(n + 1) // 2` from the last iteration when `n` is 0.
