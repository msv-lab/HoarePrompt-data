Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\) and has been decreased by 1, `n` is now `n // 2`, `k` is an input integer, `s` is `s + (n + 1) // 2`, `m` is 4, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`, and `s` is incremented by `x`.**

Explanation: The code `m *= 2` multiplies the value of `m` by 2. Since the initial value of `m` was 2, after executing this line, `m` becomes 4. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
