Postcondition: `t` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\) and is decreased by 1, `n` is now `n // 4`, `k` is an input integer, `s` is 0, `m` is 1, `x` is `(n + 1) // 4`, and if `s < k` and `k <= s + x` is true, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is false, the postcondition remains as initially described.
