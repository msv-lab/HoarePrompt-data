Output State: **`t` must be an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4, `n` is now `n // 2`, `k` is an input integer, `s` is `s + (n + 1) // 2`, `m` is 4.**

Explanation: The variable `m` is multiplied by 2, changing its value from 2 to 4. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
