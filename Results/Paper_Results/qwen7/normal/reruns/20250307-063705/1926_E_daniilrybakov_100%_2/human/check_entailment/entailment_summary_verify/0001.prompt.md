You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n cards numbered 1, 2, \dots, n . He wants to lay them down in a
row as follows:

  * First, he lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest. 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 2 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 3 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 3 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 4 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 4 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * And so on, until all cards are laid down. 

What is the k -th card he lays down in this process? Once Vladislav puts a
card down, he cannot use that card again.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n
\leq 10^9 ) — the number of cards Vlad has, and the position of the card you
need to output.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the k -th card Vladislav lays
down.

Note

In the first seven test cases, n=7 . Vladislav lays down the cards as follows:

  * First — all the odd-numbered cards in the order 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . 
  * Next — all cards that are twice an odd number in the order 2 , 6 . 
  * Next, there are no remaining cards that are 3 times an odd number. (Vladislav has only one of each card.) 
  * Next — all cards that are 4 times an odd number, and there is only one such card: 4 . 
  * There are no more cards left, so Vladislav stops. 

Thus the order of cards is 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 2 , 6 , 4 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        s = 0
        m = 1
        while n:
            x = (n + 1) // 2
            n //= 2
            if s < k and k <= s + x:
                break
            s += x
            m *= 2
        print((2 * (k - s) - 1) * m)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers \( n \) and \( k \). For each test case, it calculates a specific value based on the relationship between \( n \) and \( k \). Specifically, it iteratively halves \( n \) and accumulates a sum \( s \) until \( k \) falls within a certain range defined by \( s \) and the current value of \( n \). Finally, it computes and prints a result using \( s \), \( k \), and the accumulated multiplier \( m \). The function does not return any value but prints the calculated result for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires us to simulate the process of laying down cards based on the given rules.
   - We need to determine the k-th card laid down by Vladislav.

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - It initializes `s` (sum of positions where cards are laid down) and `m` (multiplier).

3. **Key Logic:**
   - The loop iterates while `n` is non-zero.
   - In each iteration, it calculates `x` as `(n + 1) // 2`, which represents the number of odd-numbered cards at the current level.
   - It updates `n` to `n // 2`, reducing the problem size by half.
   - If `k` falls within the range `[s, s + x]`, it breaks the loop.
   - It updates `s` by adding `x` and multiplies `m` by 2.

4. **Calculation of k-th Card:**
   - After the loop, the code computes the k-th card using the formula `(2 * (k - s) - 1) * m`.

5. **Verification:**
   - Let's verify the logic with the example provided:
     - For `n = 7` and `k = 1`, the first card is `1`.
     - For `n = 7` and `k = 2`, the second card is `3`.
     - For `n = 7` and `k = 3`, the third card is `5`.
     - For `n = 7` and `k = 4`, the fourth card is `7`.
     - For `n = 7` and `k = 5`, the fifth card is `2` (since the next level starts with `2 * 1 = 2`).
     - For `n = 7` and `k = 6`, the sixth card is `6`.
     - For `n = 7` and `k = 7`, the seventh card is `4`.

   - The code correctly identifies the k-th card based on the described process.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the k-th card laid down by Vladislav according to the specified rules.
