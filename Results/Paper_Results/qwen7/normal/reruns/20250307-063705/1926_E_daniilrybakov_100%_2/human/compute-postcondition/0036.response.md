Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\) and is decreased by 1, `n` is now `n // 8`, `k` is an input integer, `s` is 0, `m` is 16, `n` is updated to the value of `int(input())`, and `k` is updated to the value of `int(input())`**

Explanation: The code initializes `s` to 0. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`) remain unchanged from their previous states. The values of `n` and `k` are updated to the values of `int(input())`. Therefore, the output state includes these updated values for `n` and `k`, and the variable `s` is set to 0.
