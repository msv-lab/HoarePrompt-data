Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer, 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    s = 0
    m = 1
    while n:
        x = (n + 1) // 2
        n //= 2
        if s < k and k <= s + x:
            break
        s += x
        m *= 2
    print((2 * (k - s) - 1) * m)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `t` must be an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4, `n` is now `n // 8`, `k` is an input integer, `s` is `s + 3 * ((n + 1) // 2)`, `m` is 8, and if `s < k` and `k <= s + (n + 1) // 2`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `n` will be reduced to `n // 8` because it is halved in each iteration, and the loop runs three times. The variable `s` accumulates the sum of `x` values, which are calculated as `(n + 1) // 2` in each iteration. Since the loop runs three times, `s` will be the sum of three such values. The variable `m` is multiplied by 2 in each iteration, so after three iterations, `m` will be `2^3 = 8`. The conditions for breaking out of the loop remain the same as described in the third iteration's output state.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `t` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\) and has been decreased by 1 for each iteration until `n` becomes 0, `n` is now 0, `k` is an input integer, `s` is the sum of `(n + 1) // 2` added for each iteration until `n` becomes 0, `m` is \(2^{\text{number of iterations}}\), and `x` is `(n + 1) // 2` for the last iteration where `n` is 0.

To explain further:
- The variable `t` decreases by 1 for each iteration of the loop until it reaches 0.
- The variable `n` is halved in each iteration (`n //= 2`), and when `n` becomes 0, the loop stops.
- The variable `s` accumulates the sum of `(n + 1) // 2` for each iteration.
- The variable `m` doubles with each iteration (`m *= 2`), reaching \(2^{\text{number of iterations}}\) by the end.
- The variable `x` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2` for the last iteration where `n` is 0.

Since `n` eventually becomes 0, the loop will stop, and the final values of the variables will be as described above.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `t` is 0, `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `s` is the sum of `s` plus (`n` + 1) // 2 for each iteration until `n` becomes 0, `m` is 2 raised to the power of the number of iterations, and `x` is (n + 1) // 2 for the last iteration.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `n` will be 0 because it keeps halving until it reaches 0. The variable `s` will be the cumulative sum of `(n + 1) // 2` for each iteration. The variable `m` will be 2 raised to the power of the number of iterations, which is equivalent to `2^number_of_iterations`. The variable `x` will hold the value of `(n + 1) // 2` from the last iteration when `n` is 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
