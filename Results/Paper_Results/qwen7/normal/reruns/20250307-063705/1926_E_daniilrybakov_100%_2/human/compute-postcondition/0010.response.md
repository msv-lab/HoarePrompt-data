Output State: **`t` must be an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4, `n` is now `n // 2`, `k` is an input integer, `s` is 0, `m` is 1, `x` is `((n + 1) // 2)`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change any variable values but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is inside. Since no variables are modified by the `break` statement, their previous values remain unchanged.
