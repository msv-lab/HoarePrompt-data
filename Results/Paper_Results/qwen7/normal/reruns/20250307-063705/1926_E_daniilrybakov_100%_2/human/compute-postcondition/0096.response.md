Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `t` is 0.
   - `n` is 0.
   - `k` is an input integer.
   - `s` starts as 0.
   - `m` is initially undefined but will be calculated as \(2^{\text{number of iterations}}\).
   - `x` is initially undefined but will be the value of \((n + 1) // 2\) in the last iteration.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs until `n` becomes 0.
   - In each iteration, `s` is updated by adding \((n + 1) // 2\) to itself.
   - `n` is halved in each iteration.

3. **Final Values:**
   - Since `n` starts at 0 and remains 0 throughout the loop, the loop does not execute any iterations.
   - Therefore, `s` remains 0.
   - `m` is \(2^0 = 1\) because there are no iterations.
   - `x` is \((0 + 1) // 2 = 1//2 = 0\) in the last iteration (which doesn't occur).

4. **Expression Evaluation:**
   - The expression to evaluate is \((2 * (k - s) - 1) * m\).
   - Substituting the values: \(s = 0\), \(m = 1\), and \(k\) is an input integer.
   - The expression simplifies to \((2 * (k - 0) - 1) * 1 = (2k - 1) * 1 = 2k - 1\).

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **2k - 1**
