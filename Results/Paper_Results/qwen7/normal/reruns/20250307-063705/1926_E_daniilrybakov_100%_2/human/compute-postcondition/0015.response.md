The loop condition in the given `while` loop is `n`. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is `n`.

Given that `n` is now `n // 2` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be non-zero. Since `n` was `n // 2`, it means `n` could either be zero or a positive integer. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `n` must be a positive integer.

State: **`t` must be an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4, `n` must be a positive integer, `k` is an input integer, `s` is `s + x`, `m` is 2, `x` is `((n + 1) // 2)`**
