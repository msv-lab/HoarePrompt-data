Output State: `t` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\) and has been decreased by 1 for each iteration until `n` becomes 0, `n` is now 0, `k` is an input integer, `s` is the sum of `(n + 1) // 2` added for each iteration until `n` becomes 0, `m` is \(2^{\text{number of iterations}}\), and `x` is `(n + 1) // 2` for the last iteration where `n` is 0.

To explain further:
- The variable `t` decreases by 1 for each iteration of the loop until it reaches 0.
- The variable `n` is halved in each iteration (`n //= 2`), and when `n` becomes 0, the loop stops.
- The variable `s` accumulates the sum of `(n + 1) // 2` for each iteration.
- The variable `m` doubles with each iteration (`m *= 2`), reaching \(2^{\text{number of iterations}}\) by the end.
- The variable `x` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2` for the last iteration where `n` is 0.

Since `n` eventually becomes 0, the loop will stop, and the final values of the variables will be as described above.
