Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is `n` // 2 // 2, `k` is an input integer, `s` is `s` + (`n` + 1) // 2, `m` is 2, `x` is (`n` + 1) // 2**.

Explanation: The code `n //= 2` divides `n` by 2 and assigns the quotient (integer division) back to `n`. The previous value of `n` was `n` // 2, so now `n` is further divided by 2. The other variables (`t`, `k`, `s`, `m`, and `x`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
