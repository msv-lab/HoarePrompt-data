Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\) and is decreased by 1, `n` is now `n // 4`, `k` is an input integer, `s` is `s + (n + 1) // 4`, `m` is 2, and if `s < k` and `k <= s + (n + 1) // 4` is true, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is false, the postcondition remains as initially described.**

Explanation: The value of `m` is multiplied by 2, changing its value from 1 to 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state and the given code snippet.
