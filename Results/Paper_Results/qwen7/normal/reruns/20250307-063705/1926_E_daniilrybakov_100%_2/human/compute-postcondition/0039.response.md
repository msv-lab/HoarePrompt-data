Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\) and is decreased by 1, `n` is now `n // 8`, `k` is an input integer, `s` is 0, `m` is 1, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`**.

Explanation: The variable `x` is assigned the value of `(n + 1) // 2`. Since `n` is already updated to `n // 8`, the value of `x` is now `(n // 8 + 1) // 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.
