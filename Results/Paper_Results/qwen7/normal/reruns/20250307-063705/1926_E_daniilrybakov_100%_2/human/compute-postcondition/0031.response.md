Output State: `t` must be an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4, `n` is now `n // 8` (since the loop divides `n` by 2 each iteration and has executed 3 times), `k` is an input integer, `s` is `s + (n + 1) // 2 + ((n // 2) + 1) // 2 + ((n // 4) + 1) // 2` (the sum of `x` from each iteration), `m` is 8 (since `m` is multiplied by 2 each iteration and the loop has executed 3 times).

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` remains unchanged, `n` will be reduced to `n // 8`, `k` remains the same, `s` is the sum of `x` from each of the three iterations, and `m` is 8.
