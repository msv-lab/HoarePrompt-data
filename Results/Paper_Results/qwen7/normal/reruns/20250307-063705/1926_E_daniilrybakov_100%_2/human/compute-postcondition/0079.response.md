Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is `n` // 2, `k` is an input integer, `s` is `s` + (`n` + 1) // 2, `m` is 2, `x` is (`n` + 1) // 2**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `x` to be `(n + 1) // 2`. This calculation does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `s`, or `m`. Therefore, their values remain as they were in the initial state. The value of `x` is updated based on the current value of `n`.
