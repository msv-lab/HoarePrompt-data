Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is `n` // 2 // 2, `k` is an input integer, `s` is `s` + (`n` + 1) // 2, `m` is 2, `x` is (`n` + 1) // 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only exits the innermost loop or conditional block. Since no variables are reassigned or modified within the scope of the `break` statement, their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
