Output State: **`t` must be an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4, `n` must be a positive integer, `k` is an input integer, `s` is `s + x`, `m` is 2, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`**.

In this case, the code simply assigns the value of `(n + 1) // 2` to the variable `x`. No other variables are affected, and the conditions and values of the initial state remain unchanged.
