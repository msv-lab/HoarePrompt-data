Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4.
   - `n` is initially set to `n // 8`.
   - `k` is an input integer.
   - `s` is updated to `s + 3 * ((n + 1) // 2)`.
   - `m` is 8.
   - The loop continues until either `s < k` and `k <= s + (n + 1) // 2` or the loop breaks due to the number of iterations.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs three times, and in each iteration, `n` is halved (`n = n // 2`).
   - In each iteration, `s` is updated by adding `3 * ((n + 1) // 2)`.

3. **After Three Iterations:**
   - After three iterations, `n` becomes `n // 8` (since `n` is halved three times).
   - `s` is the sum of three terms, each term being `3 * ((n + 1) // 2)`.
   - Therefore, `s = 3 * 3 * ((n + 1) // 2) = 9 * ((n + 1) // 2)`.

4. **Final Values:**
   - `m` remains 8 after three iterations.
   - The expression inside the print statement is `(2 * (k - s) - 1) * m`.

5. **Substitute the Values:**
   - Substitute `s = 9 * ((n + 1) // 2)` into the expression.
   - The expression becomes `(2 * (k - 9 * ((n + 1) // 2)) - 1) * 8`.

6. **Final Output:**
   - The final output is the result of the expression `(2 * (k - 9 * ((n + 1) // 2)) - 1) * 8`.

Therefore, the output is:
Output: **(2 * (k - 9 * ((n + 1) // 2)) - 1) * 8**
