Output State: `t` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\) and has been decreased by the total number of iterations, `n` is now \(1\) (since it keeps halving until it reaches 1), `k` is an input integer, `s` is the sum of all terms added during each iteration, `m` is \(2^i\) where \(i\) is the number of iterations the loop executed, and `x` is the last value of \((n + 1) // 2\).

To elaborate, after all iterations, `t` will be reduced by the total number of iterations, which is equal to the number of times `n` was halved until it reached 1. The variable `n` will be 1 because it keeps halving until it can no longer be halved. The variable `k` remains unchanged. The variable `s` accumulates the sum of values added in each iteration, starting from \((n + 1) // 4\) in the first iteration, then \((n + 1) // 2\) in the second, and so on. The variable `m` doubles with each iteration, ending at \(2^i\), where \(i\) is the number of iterations. The variable `x` is the value of \((n + 1) // 2\) in the last iteration, which is 1 when `n` is 1.
