Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\) and has been decreased by 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `s` is `s + (n + 1) // 2 + (n + 1) // 2`, `m` is 4, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`**.

Explanation: The code `x = (n + 1) // 2` calculates the value of `x` as `(n + 1) // 2`. This value is already stored in `x` from the previous line `s = s + (n + 1) // 2`. Therefore, `x` is updated to `(n + 1) // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
