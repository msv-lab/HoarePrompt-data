Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\) and is decreased by 1, `n` is now `n // 8`, `k` is an input integer, `s` is `s + 3 * ((n + 1) // 2)`, `m` is 16, `n` is updated to the value of `int(input())`, and `k` is updated to the value of `int(input())`**.

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two inputs from the user, splits them, and converts them to integers. These values are then assigned to `n` and `k`. The initial values of `t` and `m` remain unchanged. The value of `s` is updated according to the formula given in the initial state, but since the exact value of `n` after division and addition is not specified, we keep it in terms of the updated `n`.
