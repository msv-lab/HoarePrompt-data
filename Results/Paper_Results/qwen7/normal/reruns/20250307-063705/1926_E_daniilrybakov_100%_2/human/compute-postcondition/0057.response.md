The code `n //= 2` divides `n` by 2 and assigns the floor division result back to `n`. Given the initial state, `n` must be greater than 0, and it is involved in the calculation of `s`. However, the exact value of `n` is not specified, only that it is an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\) and has been decreased by 1. After the operation, `n` will be half of its original value (floored).

The other variables (`k`, `s`, `m`, and `x`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\) and has been decreased by 1, `n` is now half of its original value (floored), `k` is an input integer, `s` is `s + (n + 1) // 2 + (n + 1) // 2`, `m` is 4, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`**
