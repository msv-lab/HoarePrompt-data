Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\) and has been decreased by 1, `n` is now `n // 2`, `k` is an input integer, `s` is `s + (n + 1) // 2`, `m` is 2, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`, and `s` is incremented by `x`.**

Explanation: The code `s += x` increments the value of `s` by `x`. From the initial state, `x` is defined as `(n + 1) // 2`. Therefore, `s` is updated to `s + (n + 1) // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
