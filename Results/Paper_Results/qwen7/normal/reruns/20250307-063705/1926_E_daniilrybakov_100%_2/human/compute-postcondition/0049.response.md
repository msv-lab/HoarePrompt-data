Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\) and has been decreased by 1, `n` is now `n // 2`, `k` is an input integer, `s` is `s + (n + 1) // 4`, `m` is 2, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`**.

Explanation: The code `n //= 2` divides `n` by 2 and assigns the result back to `n`. Since `n` was previously greater than 0, `n // 2` will be the integer division of `n` by 2. All other variables (`t`, `k`, `s`, `m`, and `x`) remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states.
