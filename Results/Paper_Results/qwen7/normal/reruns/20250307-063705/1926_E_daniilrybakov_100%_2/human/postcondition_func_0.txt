The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers \( n \) and \( k \). For each test case, it calculates a specific value based on the relationship between \( n \) and \( k \). Specifically, it iteratively halves \( n \) and accumulates a sum \( s \) until \( k \) falls within a certain range defined by \( s \) and the current value of \( n \). Finally, it computes and prints a result using \( s \), \( k \), and the accumulated multiplier \( m \). The function does not return any value but prints the calculated result for each test case.
