To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the loop head and the condition that controls the loop's continuation.

The loop condition is `n`. For the loop to continue executing, `n` must be non-zero (`n > 0`). 

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
- `t` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\) and has been decreased by 1.
- `n` is now `n // 4`.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `s` is `s + (n + 1) // 4`.
- The loop breaks if `s < k` and `k <= s + (n + 1) // 4` is true. Otherwise, the postcondition remains as initially described.

For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 0. Since `n` is updated to `n // 4` at the end of each iteration, we need to ensure that `n` is still positive.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n` to ensure it is greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\) and has been decreased by 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `s` is `s + (n + 1) // 4`, `m` is 2**
