Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `n`.
2. **Determine the current state**: 
   - `t` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `k` is an input integer.
   - `s` is 0.
   - `m` is 1.
3. **Check the loop condition**: For the loop to execute the first time, `n` must be non-zero (i.e., `n != 0`).

Given that `n` is the only variable in the loop head, we need to ensure that `n` is non-zero for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `n` must be non-zero.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` must be an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4, `n` must be non-zero, `k` is an input integer, `s` is 0, `m` is 1**
