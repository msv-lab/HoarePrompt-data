State: **`t` must be an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4, _ is now 1** 

Explanation:
- The variable `_` is a placeholder used in the `for` loop to iterate `t` times. It does not hold any specific value but indicates the iteration count. Therefore, its initial value does not need to be explicitly stated.
- The variable `t` determines how many times the loop will run. For the loop to execute, `t` must be an integer within the specified range (1 to 5 ⋅ 10^4).

Thus, the state that needs to be adjusted is that `t` must be an integer within the given range.
