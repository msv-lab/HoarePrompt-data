Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\) and has been decreased by 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `s` is `s + (n + 1) // 4`, `m` is 2, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`**.

The value of `x` is updated to `(n + 1) // 2`, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
