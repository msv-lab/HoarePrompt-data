Output State: **`t` must be an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4, `n` is now `n // 2`, `k` is an input integer, `s` is `s + x`, `m` is 4, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables; it only exits the loop or the most internal if statement. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `s`, `m`, and `x` remain as they were before the `break` statement.
