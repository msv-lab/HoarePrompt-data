Output State: **`t` must be an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4, `n` is now `n // 2`, `k` is an input integer, `s` is `s + x`, `m` is 2, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`**.

Explanation: The code `n //= 2` divides `n` by 2 and assigns the result back to `n`. All other variables (`t`, `k`, `s`, `m`, and `x`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
