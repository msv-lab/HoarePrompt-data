Output State: `t` is 0, `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `s` is the sum of `x` for each iteration until `n` becomes 0, `m` is 2 raised to the power of the number of iterations, `x` is the value of `n + 1` divided by 2 in the last iteration.

Explanation: The loop continues to halve `n` until it reaches 0. In each iteration, `s` is incremented by `(n + 1) // 2`. Since `n` starts as an input integer and is halved each time, eventually `n` will become 0 after logâ‚‚(n) iterations. The variable `m` is multiplied by 2 in each iteration, so after `i` iterations, `m` will be 2^i. The variable `x` will be the value of `(n + 1) // 2` in the last iteration when `n` is reduced to 0.
