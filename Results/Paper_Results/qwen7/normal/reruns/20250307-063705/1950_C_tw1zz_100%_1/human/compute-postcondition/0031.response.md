Output State: **`h` is '07', `m` is a string representing the minute part of the input, `h1` is '07', `m1` is equal to `m`, `time` is an empty string**.

Explanation: The code `h1 = '07'` assigns the string `'07'` to the variable `h1`. The value of `h` remains unchanged as `'07'`, `m` remains unchanged as a string representing the minute part of the input, `m1` remains equal to `m`, and `time` remains an empty string.
