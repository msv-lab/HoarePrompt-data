Output State: The loop will continue to execute for as many times as specified by the user via the input. After all iterations, `h` will be an empty string (`''`), `m` will be an empty string (`''`), `h1` will be one of the strings '01', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', '12', or '00', `m1` will be an empty string (`''`), and `time` will be either 'AM' or 'PM'. 

This is because each iteration of the loop processes a new input time, updates the variables `h1` and `time` based on the rules provided, and then prints these updated values before moving on to the next iteration. By the end of all iterations, all the input times have been processed, and the final state of the variables will reflect the last input time's transformation into 12-hour format with AM/PM designation.
