Postcondition: `h` is an input string representing the hour part of the input, `m` is an input string representing the minute part of the input, `h1` is either '11' or '12' depending on whether `h` is '23' or '00', `m1` is equal to `m`, and `time` is 'PM' if `h` is '23' or 'AM' if `h` is '00'. Otherwise, `h1`, `m1`, and `time` remain unchanged.
