Postcondition: `h` is a string representing the hour part of the input, `m` is a string representing the minute part of the input, `h1` is either '11' or '12', `m1` is equal to `m`, and `time` is either 'PM' or 'AM'. Specifically, if `h` is '23', then `h1` is '11', `time` is 'PM'; otherwise, `h1` is '12', `time` is 'AM', and if `h` is '00', then `h1` is set to '12', `time` is set to 'AM'.
