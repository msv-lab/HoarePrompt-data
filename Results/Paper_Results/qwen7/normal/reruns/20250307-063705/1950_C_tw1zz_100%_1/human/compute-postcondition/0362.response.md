Postcondition: `h` is an input string representing the hour part of the input, `m` is an input string representing the minute part of the input, `h1` is either '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', '12', '00', '01', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', or '12', `m1` is equal to `m`, and `time` is 'AM' if `h` is '06', and 'AM' if `h` is '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', or '12'. If `h` is not '06', `time` is 'PM'.
