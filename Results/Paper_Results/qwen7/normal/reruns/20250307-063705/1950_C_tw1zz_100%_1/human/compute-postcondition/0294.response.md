Output State: **`h` is an input string representing the hour part of the input, `m` is an input string representing the minute part of the input, `h1` is '08', `m1` is equal to `m`, `time` is 'AM'**.

The code assigns the string `'AM'` to the variable `time`. The values of `h`, `m`, `h1`, and `m1` remain unchanged from their initial states.
