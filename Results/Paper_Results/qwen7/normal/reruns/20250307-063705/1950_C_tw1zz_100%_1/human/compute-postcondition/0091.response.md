Output State: **`h` is '17', `m` is a string representing the minute part of the input', `h1` is '05', `m1` is equal to `m`, `time` is 'PM', and `h` is equal to '17'**.

The code assigns the string 'PM' to the variable `time`. The values of `h`, `m`, `h1`, and `m1` remain unchanged from their initial states.
