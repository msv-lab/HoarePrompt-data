Postcondition: `h` is an input string representing the hour part of the input, `m` is an input string representing the minute part of the input, `h1` is either '10' if `h` is '22', '11' if `h` is '23', or '12' if `h` is '00', `m1` is equal to `m`, and `time` is 'PM' if `h` is '23' or '00', and 'AM' if `h` is '22'. Otherwise, `h1`, `m1`, and `time` remain unchanged.
