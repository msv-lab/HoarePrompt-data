Postcondition: `h` is a string representing the hour part of the input, `m` is a string representing the minute part of the input, `h1` is '09' if `h` is '21', '10' if `h` is '22', '11' if `h` is '23', and '12' if `h` is '00', otherwise `h1` remains unchanged, `m1` is equal to `m`, and `time` is 'PM' if `h` is '23', otherwise `time` is 'AM'.
