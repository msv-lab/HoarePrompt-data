Output State: **`h` is '14', `m` is a string representing the minute part of the input', `h1` is '02', `m1` is equal to `m`, `time` is 'PM', and `time` is an empty string.**

Explanation: The line `time = 'PM'` assigns the string `'PM'` to the variable `time`. The other variables (`h`, `m`, `h1`, `m1`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `time` being an empty string before the assignment is overridden by the new assignment.
