Output State: **`h` is a string of the hour part of the input, `m` is a string of the minute part of the input, `h1` is an empty string, and `m1` is equal to `m`, `time` is an empty string.**

The code initializes an empty string named `time`. This does not affect the values of `h`, `m`, `h1`, or `m1`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
