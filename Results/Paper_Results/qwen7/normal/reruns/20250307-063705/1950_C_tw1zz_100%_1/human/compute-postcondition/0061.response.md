Output State: **`h` is a string representing the hour part of the input, `m` is a string representing the minute part of the input, `h1` is '12', `m1` is equal to `m`, `time` is 'PM', and `h` is equal to '12'.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the string 'PM' to the variable `time`. No other variables are affected, so their previous states remain unchanged.
