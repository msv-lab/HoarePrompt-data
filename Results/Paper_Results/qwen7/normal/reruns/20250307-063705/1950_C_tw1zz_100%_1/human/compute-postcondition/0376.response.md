Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1440) and a string `s` in the format "hh:mm". It returns information based on the time represented by `s` and the integer `t`.**

Note: The actual processing logic and return values are not described here as per the given constraints and format requirements.
