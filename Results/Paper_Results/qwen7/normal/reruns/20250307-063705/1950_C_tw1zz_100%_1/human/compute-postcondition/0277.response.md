Output State: **`h` is an input string representing the hour part of the input, `m` is an input string representing the minute part of the input, `h1` is an empty string, `m1` is equal to `m`, and `time` is 'AM' if `h` is '09', otherwise `time` is 'PM'**.

Explanation: The code `h1, m1 = '', m` assigns an empty string to `h1` and the value of `m` to `m1`. The values of `h`, `m`, and `time` remain unchanged from their initial states.
