Postcondition: `h` is a string representing the hour part of the input, `m` is a string representing the minute part of the input, `h1` is either '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', '12', or '12', `m1` is equal to `m`, and `time` is either 'PM' or 'AM'. Specifically, if `h` is '18', then `h1` is '06', `time` is 'PM', and `h` is equal to '18'. If `h` is '19', then `h1` is '07', `time` is 'PM', and `h` is equal to '19'. If `h` is '20', then `h1` is '08', `time` is 'PM', and `h` is equal to '20'. If `h` is '21', then `h1` is '09', `time` is 'PM', and `h` is equal to '21'. If `h` is '22', then `h1` is '10', `time` is 'PM', and `h` is equal to '22'. If `h` is '23', then `h1` is '11', `time` is 'PM', and `h` is equal to '23'. If `h` is '00', then `h1` is '12', `time` is 'AM', and `h` is equal to '00'. Otherwise, `h1` is '12', `time` is 'AM', and `h` is not equal to '18', '19', '20', '21', '22', '23', or '00'.
