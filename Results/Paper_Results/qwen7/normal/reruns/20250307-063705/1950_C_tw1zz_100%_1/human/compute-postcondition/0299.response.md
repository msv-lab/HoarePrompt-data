Output State: **`h` is an input string representing the hour part of the input, `m` is an input string representing the minute part of the input, `h1` is '11', `m1` is equal to `m`, and `time` is an empty string.**

The code `h1 = '11'` assigns the string `'11'` to the variable `h1`. The values of the other variables (`h`, `m`, `m1`, and `time`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
