Output State: **`h` is a string of the hour part of the input, `m` is a string of the minute part of the input, `h1` is an empty string, and `m1` is equal to `m`.**

Explanation: The code assigns an empty string to `h1` and assigns the value of `m` to `m1`. The values of `h` and `m` remain unchanged from their initial state.
