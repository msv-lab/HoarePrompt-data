Postcondition: `h` is a string representing the hour part of the input, `m` is a string representing the minute part of the input, `h1` is '12', `m1` is equal to `m`, `time` is 'AM', and `h` is not equal to '00'. If `h` is '00', then `h1` is set to '12', `m1` remains the same as `m`, and `time` is set to 'AM'.
