To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Variables and Their Values:**
   - `h`: A string representing the hour part of the input.
   - `m`: A string representing the minute part of the input.
   - `h1`: Either '01', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', or a string from '01' to '11' depending on the value of `h`.
   - `m1`: Equal to `m`.
   - `time`: 'AM' if `h` is '09', otherwise 'time' is 'PM'.

2. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   - The print statement is: `print(h1, ':', m, ' ', time, sep='')`
   - This means the values of `h1`, `m`, and `time` will be concatenated with a colon (`:`) between `h1` and `m`, and a space between `m` and `time`.

3. **Determining the Values:**
   - Since the exact values of `h` and `m` are not specified, we need to consider the conditions for `h1` and `time`:
     - If `h` is '09', then `time` will be 'AM'.
     - For any other value of `h`, `time` will be 'PM'.
     - `h1` is determined by the value of `h` as described, so it will be one of the strings '01' to '11'.

4. **Possible Scenarios:**
   - If `h` is '09', `h1` will be '09', `m1` will be the same as `m`, and `time` will be 'AM'.
   - If `h` is any other value, `h1` will be one of '01' to '11' corresponding to `h`, `m1` will be the same as `m`, and `time` will be 'PM'.

Given the general nature of the problem without specific values for `h` and `m`, the most precise answer we can give is based on the conditions provided.

Output: **h1 (which is either '01' to '11' depending on h), ':', m, ' PM' (if h is not '09') or ' AM' (if h is '09')**
