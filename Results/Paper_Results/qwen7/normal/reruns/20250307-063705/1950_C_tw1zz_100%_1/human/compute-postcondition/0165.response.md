Postcondition: `h` is a string representing the hour part of the input, `m` is a string representing the minute part of the input, `h1` is either '01', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', '12', or '12', `m1` is equal to `m`, and `time` is either 'AM' or 'PM'. If `h` is '04', then `h1` is '04' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '05', then `h1` is '05' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '06', then `h1` is '06' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '07', then `h1` is '07' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '08' to '11', then `h1` is '08' to '11' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '12', then `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '13' to '23' or '00', then `h1` is '01' to '12' and `time` is 'PM'. Otherwise, `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'AM'.
