Based on the initial state provided:

- `h` is an input string representing the hour part of the input.
- `m` is an input string representing the minute part of the input.
- `h1` is either '01', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', '12', or '00'.
- `m1` is equal to `m`.
- `time` is 'AM'.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(h1, ':', m, ' ', time, sep='')
```

Here's the step-by-step breakdown:
1. `h1` is one of the valid hour strings ('01', '02', ..., '12', or '00').
2. `m` is an input string representing the minutes.
3. `m1` is the same as `m`.
4. `time` is 'AM'.

The `sep=''` argument in the `print` function means that no separator will be added between the arguments. Therefore, the output will be a concatenation of `h1`, `:`, `m`, and `' '`, followed by `time`.

Output: **h1 : m AM**
