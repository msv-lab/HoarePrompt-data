Postcondition: `h` is an input string representing the hour part of the input, `m` is an input string representing the minute part of the input, `h1` is '02', and `m1` is equal to `m`. `time` is 'AM' if `h` is '02'. Otherwise, `h1` is either '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', '12', '00', or '01', and `time` is 'AM'.
