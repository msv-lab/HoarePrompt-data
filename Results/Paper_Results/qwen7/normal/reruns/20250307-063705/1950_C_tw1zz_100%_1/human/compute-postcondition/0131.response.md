Output State: **`h` is a string representing the hour part of the input, `m` is a string representing the minute part of the input, `h1` is '12', `m1` is equal to `m`, `time` is an empty string.**

Explanation: The code `h1 = '12'` assigns the string `'12'` to the variable `h1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
