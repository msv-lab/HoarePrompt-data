Postcondition: `h` is a string representing the hour part of the input, `m` is a string representing the minute part of the input, `h1` is either '01', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', '12', or '12', `m1` is equal to `m`, and `time` is either 'AM' or 'PM'. Specifically, if `h` is '10', then `h1` is '10', and `time` is 'AM'. Otherwise, `h1` is either '01', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '11', '12', or '12', `time` is either 'AM' or 'PM', and `h` is adjusted accordingly based on the given conditions.
