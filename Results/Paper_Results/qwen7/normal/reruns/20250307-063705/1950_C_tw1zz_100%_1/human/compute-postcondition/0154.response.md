Postcondition: `h` is a string representing the hour part of the input, `m` is a string representing the minute part of the input, `h1` is either '01', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', '12', or '12', `m1` is equal to `m`, and `time` is either 'AM' or 'PM'. Specifically, if `h` is '11', then `h1` is '11', `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '12', then `h1` is '12', `time` is 'PM', and `h` is equal to '12'. If `h` is '13' to '23' or '00', then `h1` is '01' to '12', `time` is 'PM', and `h` is equal to '13' to '23' or '00'. Otherwise, `h1` is '12', `time` is 'AM', and `h` is not equal to '13', '14', '15', '16', '17', '18', '19', '20', '21', '22', '23', or '00'.
