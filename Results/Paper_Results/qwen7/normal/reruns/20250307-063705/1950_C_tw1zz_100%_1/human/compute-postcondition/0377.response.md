Functionality: **The function processes multiple time inputs in the 24-hour format and converts them into the 12-hour format with AM/PM designations. It reads the number of test cases from the first input, then for each test case, it takes a time string in the format "hh:mm", converts the hour part into the 12-hour format, and prints the result along with the appropriate AM/PM designation. After processing all the test cases, the function does not return any value but outputs the converted times.**
