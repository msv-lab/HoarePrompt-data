Output State: **`h` is a string representing the hour part of the input, `m` is a string representing the minute part of the input, `h1` is '08', `m1` is equal to `m`, `time` is an empty string**.

Explanation: The code `h1 = '08'` assigns the string `'08'` to the variable `h1`. The values of the other variables (`h`, `m`, `m1`, and `time`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
