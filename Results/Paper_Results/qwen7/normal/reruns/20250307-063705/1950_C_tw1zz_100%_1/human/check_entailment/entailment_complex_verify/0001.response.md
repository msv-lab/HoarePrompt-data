### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by splitting the input string `hh:mm` into hours (`h`) and minutes (`m`). This part is correct.

2. **Hour Conversion**:
   - The program attempts to convert 24-hour format hours to 12-hour format hours.
   - For hours from `01` to `12`, it directly assigns the same value to `h1` and sets `time` to `AM`.
   - For hours from `13` to `23`, it subtracts `12` from the hour and sets `time` to `PM`.
   - However, the implementation is overly complex and redundant. It uses multiple `elif` statements, which can be simplified. The program also correctly handles `00` by setting `h1` to `12` and `time` to `AM`.

3. **Minute Handling**:
   - The program correctly retains the minutes as `m1`.

4. **Output Formatting**:
   - The program prints the time in the correct format, but the logic for converting hours is flawed as mentioned above. Specifically, the program does not handle `00` correctly in the final output. Instead of printing `12:00 AM`, it prints `12:00`.

### Specific Issues:
- **Handling `00`**: The program correctly converts `00` to `12` but does not handle the AM/PM designation properly in the output. It should print `12:00 AM` instead of just `12:00`.
- **Redundant Code**: The use of multiple `elif` statements can be simplified using a dictionary or a modulo operation.
- **Edge Cases**: The program does not account for the edge case where the hour is `24` (which is invalid in 24-hour format but might be valid in some contexts), though the problem statement specifies valid inputs.

### Simplified Solution:
A more efficient way to handle the conversion would be:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (h, m) = map(str, input().split(':'))
        h1 = int(h) % 12
        time = 'AM' if int(h) < 12 else 'PM'
        if h1 == 0:
            h1 = 12
        print(f'{h1}:{m} {time}')
```

### Conclusion:
The given program has a logical flaw in handling the conversion of hours from 24-hour to 12-hour format, particularly for `00`. While the program does correctly convert most other cases, it fails to print the correct AM/PM designation for `00`.

**Correctness: False**
