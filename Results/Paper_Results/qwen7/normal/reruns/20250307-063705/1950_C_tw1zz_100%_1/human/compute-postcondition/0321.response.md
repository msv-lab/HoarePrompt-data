Output State: **`h` is an input string representing the hour part of the input, `m` is an input string representing the minute part of the input, `h1` is '10', `m1` is equal to `m`, and `time` is an empty string.**

Explanation: The code assigns the string `'10'` to the variable `h1`. The values of `h`, `m`, `m1`, and `time` remain unchanged from their initial states.
