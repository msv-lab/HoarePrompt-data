To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Variables and Their Values:**
   - `h`: This is a string representing the hour part of the input.
   - `m`: This is a string representing the minute part of the input.
   - `h1`: This is derived from `h` based on specific conditions:
     - If `h` is '01', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', or '11', then `h1` is the same as `h`.
     - If `h` is '12', then `h1` is also '12'.
     - If `h` is '13' to '23' or '00', then `h1` is '01' to '12'.
   - `m1`: This is equal to `m`.
   - `time`: This is either 'AM' or 'PM' based on the value of `h`:
     - If `h` is '01' to '11', then `time` is 'AM'.
     - If `h` is '12', then `time` is 'PM'.
     - If `h` is '13' to '23' or '00', then `time` is 'PM'.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(h1, ':', m, ' ', time, sep='')
   ```
   This statement prints `h1`, followed by a colon (`:`), then `m`, followed by a space, and finally `time`, with no spaces between the arguments due to the `sep=''` parameter.

Given the conditions, the exact values of `h1`, `m`, and `time` depend on the input values of `h` and `m`. However, since the exact values of `h` and `m` are not specified, we can describe the general form of the output.

**Output:** **h1 : m time** (where `h1` is derived from `h` as described, `m` is the minute part, and `time` is either 'AM' or 'PM' based on the value of `h`).
