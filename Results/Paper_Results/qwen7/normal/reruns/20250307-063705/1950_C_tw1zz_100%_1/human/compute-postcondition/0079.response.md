Output State: **`h` is '15', `m` is a string representing the minute part of the input, `h1` is '03', `m1` is equal to `m`, `time` is 'PM', and `h` is equal to '15'.**

Explanation: The line `time = 'PM'` assigns the string 'PM' to the variable `time`. The values of the other variables (`h`, `m`, `h1`, `m1`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
