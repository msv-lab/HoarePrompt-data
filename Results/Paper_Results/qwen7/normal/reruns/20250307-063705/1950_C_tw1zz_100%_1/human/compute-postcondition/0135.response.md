Postcondition: `h` is a string representing the hour part of the input, `m` is a string representing the minute part of the input, `h1` is either '11' or '12', `m1` is equal to `m`, and `time` is either 'PM' or 'AM'. If `h` is '23', then `h1` is '11', `time` is 'PM'. Otherwise, if `h` is '00', then `h1` is '12', `time` is 'AM'. If neither '23' nor '00', then `h1` is '12', `time` is 'AM', and `h` is not '00'.
