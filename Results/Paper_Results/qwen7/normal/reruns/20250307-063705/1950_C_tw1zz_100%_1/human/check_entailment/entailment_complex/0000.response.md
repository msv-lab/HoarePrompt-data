Reasoning:
1. The function correctly processes the number of test cases and iterates through each test case.
2. For each test case, it splits the input string into hours (`h`) and minutes (`m`).
3. The logic for converting the 24-hour format to the 12-hour format with AM/PM is implemented correctly. It handles all possible hour values from 00 to 23 and maps them to their corresponding 12-hour format representations.
4. The code correctly sets `h1` to the appropriate 12-hour representation of the hour and assigns the correct AM/PM designation to the variable `time`.
5. The print statement formats the output correctly, combining `h1`, `m`, and `time` with the required separator.
6. The final state of the variables after all iterations matches the expected behavior, as described in the comment.

Given the above points, the provided program correctly implements the functionality as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
