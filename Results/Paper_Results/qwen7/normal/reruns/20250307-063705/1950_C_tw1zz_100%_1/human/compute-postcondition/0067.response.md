Output State: **`h` is '01', `m` is a string representing the minute part of the input, `h1` is '01', `m1` is a string representing the minute part of the input, `time` is 'PM', and `h` is '13'.**

Explanation: The line `time = 'PM'` assigns the string `'PM'` to the variable `time`. The values of `h`, `m`, `h1`, and `m1` remain unchanged from their initial states.
