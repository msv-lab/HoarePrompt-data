Output State: **`h` is a string representing the hour part of the input, `m` is a string representing the minute part of the input, `h1` is '03', `m1` is equal to `m`, `time` is an empty string**.

Explanation: The code `h1 = '03'` assigns the string `'03'` to the variable `h1`. This changes the value of `h1` from being an empty string to `'03'`. The values of `h`, `m`, `m1`, and `time` remain unchanged from their initial states.
