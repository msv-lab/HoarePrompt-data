Output State: **`h` is a string of the hour part of the input, `m` is a string of the minute part of the input, `h1` is '02', `m1` is equal to `m`, `time` is 'PM'**.

The code assigns the string `'PM'` to the variable `time`. The values of `h`, `m`, `h1`, and `m1` remain unchanged from their initial states.
