Postcondition: **`h` is a string representing the hour part of the input, `m` is a string representing the minute part of the input, `h1` is either '09', '10', '11', '12', or '12', `m1` is equal to `m`, and `time` is either 'PM' or 'AM'. Specifically, if `h` is '21', then `h1` is '09', `time` is 'PM', and `h` is equal to '21'. If `h` is '22', then `h1` is '10', `time` is 'PM', and `h` is equal to '22'. If `h` is '23', then `h1` is '11', `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '00', then `h1` is '12', `time` is 'AM'. Otherwise, `h1` is '12', `time` is 'AM'.**
