Output State: **`h` is '20', `m` is a string representing the minute part of the input, `h1` is '08', `m1` is equal to `m`, `time` is 'PM'**.

Explanation: The code assigns the string `'PM'` to the variable `time`. The values of the other variables (`h`, `m`, `h1`, and `m1`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
