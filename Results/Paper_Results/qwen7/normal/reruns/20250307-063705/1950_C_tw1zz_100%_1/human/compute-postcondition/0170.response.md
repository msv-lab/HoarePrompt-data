Postcondition: `h` is a string representing the hour part of the input, `m` is a string representing the minute part of the input, `h1` is either '01', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', '12', or '12', `m1` is equal to `m`, and `time` is either 'AM' or 'PM'. Specifically, if `h` is '02', then `h1` is '02' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '03' to '11', then `h1` is '03' to '11' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '12', then `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '01', '04' to '11', '13' to '23', or '00', then `h1` is '01' to '12' and `time` is 'PM'.
