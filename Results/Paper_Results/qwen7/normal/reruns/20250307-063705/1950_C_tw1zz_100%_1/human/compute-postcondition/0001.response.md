Output State: **`h` is a string representing the hour part of the input, `m` is a string representing the minute part of the input**.

This means that the code takes an input (which should be in the format of `hh:mm`), splits it into two parts (hour and minute), and assigns these parts to the variables `h` and `m` respectively, both as strings.
