Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is controlled by the expression `range(int(input()))`. This means that the loop will run based on the integer value entered by the user.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as the user inputs an integer value. The loop does not depend on the values of `h`, `m`, `h1`, `m1`, or `time` directly; it depends solely on the input value.

3. **Determine the New State**: At the start of the next iteration, the only thing that changes is the input value that controls the loop. Therefore, the state of `h`, `m`, `h1`, `m1`, and `time` remains the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

4. **Adjust the State**: Since the loop depends on the input value, the state of the input value needs to be updated. The input value itself is not explicitly stored in the given variables, but the loop will continue to prompt for input until a new integer value is provided.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop remains the same as the postcondition at the end of the previous iteration.

**Answer**:
State: **`h` is a string representing the hour part of the input, `m` is a string representing the minute part of the input, `h1` is either '01', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', or a string from '01' to '11' depending on the value of `h`, `m1` is equal to `m`, and `time` is 'AM' if `h` is '09', otherwise `time` is 'PM'**.
