Output State: **`h` is a string representing the hour part of the input, `m` is a string representing the minute part of the input, `h1` is '10', `m1` is equal to `m`, `time` is an empty string, and `h` is equal to '22'.**

Explanation: The code assigns the string `'10'` to the variable `h1`. The values of `m`, `m1`, `time`, and `h` remain unchanged from their initial states.
