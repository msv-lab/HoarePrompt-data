Output State: **`h` is a string representing the hour part of the input, `m` is a string representing the minute part of the input, `h1` is '11', `m1` is equal to `m`, `time` is an empty string, and `h` is equal to '23'.**

Explanation: The code `h1 = '11'` assigns the string `'11'` to the variable `h1`. The values of the other variables (`m`, `m1`, `time`, `h`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
