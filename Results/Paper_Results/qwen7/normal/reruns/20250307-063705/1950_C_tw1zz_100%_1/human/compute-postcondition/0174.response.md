Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is controlled by an input value, which is converted to an integer and used as the range for the loop. Therefore, the key variables involved are the input itself and the loop counter.

2. **Understand the Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as the input value (converted to an integer) is greater than 0. This means that each iteration of the loop will consume one unit from the input value until it reaches 0.

3. **Determine the State After One Iteration**: Since the loop is controlled by the input value, at the start of each iteration, the input value is decremented by 1. Thus, the input value will decrease by 1 after each iteration.

4. **Adjust the States**: The only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is the input value. It should be decremented by 1.

Given the initial postconditions for the variables `h`, `m`, `h1`, `m1`, and `time`, these variables are not directly affected by the loop control. They remain the same unless explicitly modified within the loop body, which is not provided.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the input value.

**Final Answer:**
State: **input is decreased by 1**
