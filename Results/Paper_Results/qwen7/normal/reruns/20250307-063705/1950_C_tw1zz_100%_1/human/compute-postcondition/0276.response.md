Output State: **`h` is an input string representing the hour part of the input, `m` is an input string representing the minute part of the input, `h1` is either '01', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', or a string from '01' to '11' depending on the value of `h`, `m1` is equal to `m`, and `time` is 'AM' if `h` is '09', otherwise `time` is 'PM'**.

Explanation: The code `h, m = map(str, input().split(':'))` takes an input in the format "hour:minute" and splits it into two parts, assigning the first part to `h` and the second part to `m`. Both `h` and `m` are converted to strings using `map(str, ...)`. The values of `h1`, `m1`, and `time` remain unchanged from their initial state.
