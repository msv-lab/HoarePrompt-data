Output State: **`h` is '23', `m` is a string representing the minute part of the input', `h1` is '11', `m1` is equal to `m`, `time` is 'PM'**.

Explanation: The line `time = 'PM'` assigns the string 'PM' to the variable `time`. The values of `h`, `m`, `h1`, and `m1` remain unchanged from their initial states.
