Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains `_` and `input()`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `int(input())` is a positive integer.

3. **Determine the State Adjustments:**
   - The variable `t` is given as an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1440\). However, this value does not directly affect the loop condition since the loop condition checks the input from `input()`.
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as the input is a positive integer. Therefore, we need to ensure that the input provided to `input()` results in a positive integer.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since the loop condition depends on the input from `input()`, we need to ensure that the input provided is a positive integer. Given that the loop will run for each test case, we need to ensure that the input for each test case is a positive integer.

Therefore, the state adjustments needed are:
- The input provided to `input()` must be a positive integer.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1440\).

Since `t` does not directly influence the loop condition, we focus on ensuring the input is a positive integer.

**Final State:**
State: **the input provided to `input()` must be a positive integer**
