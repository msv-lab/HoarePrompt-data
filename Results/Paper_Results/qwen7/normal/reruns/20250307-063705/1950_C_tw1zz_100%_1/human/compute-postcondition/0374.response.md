Output State: The loop will execute as many times as the integer `t` provided in the initial state. After all iterations, the variables `h`, `m`, `h1`, `m1`, and `time` will reflect the final input values processed by the loop. Specifically:

- `h` will be the last hour part of the input.
- `m` will be the last minute part of the input.
- `h1` will be the 12-hour format representation of `h`, adjusted according to the 12-hour clock system.
- `m1` will be the same as the final `m`.
- `time` will be 'AM' if `h1` is '12', '01', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', or '09'; otherwise, it will be 'PM'.

In essence, after all iterations, the program will display the 12-hour format time (with AM/PM) corresponding to the last input provided.
