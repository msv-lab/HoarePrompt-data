Output State: **`sys.setrecursionlimit` is set to 10 ** 6, t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ \min(\frac{n\cdot(n - 1)}{2}, 2 \cdot 10^5), and the subsequent m lines contain three integers u, v, and w representing an edge between vertices u and v with weight w, where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v, and 1 ≤ w ≤ 10^6. It is guaranteed that there is at most one edge between each pair of vertices, and the sum of the values of m for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.**

Explanation: The code sets the recursion limit using `sys.setrecursionlimit(10 ** 6)`. This changes the maximum recursion depth allowed by the Python interpreter. However, it does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `u`, `v`, `w`, or any other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the only change is in the value of `sys.setrecursionlimit`.
