Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 998, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers from input.**

Explanation: The code `k, x, a = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `k`, `x`, and `a`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not involved in the operation. Therefore, `t` is still an integer between 0 and 998, while `k`, `x`, and `a` now hold the values entered by the user.
