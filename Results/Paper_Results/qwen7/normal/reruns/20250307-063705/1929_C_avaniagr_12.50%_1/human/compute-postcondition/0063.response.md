Output State: `i` is equal to `x`, `x` must be a non-negative integer, and `z` is the result of adding `z // (k - 1) + 1` for each iteration from 0 to `x`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to the value of `x`. The variable `z` will be the initial value of `z` (which is 0) plus the result of the expression `z // (k - 1) + 1` added `x + 1` times (since the loop runs from 0 to `x`).
