Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variables in the given for loop are `i` and `x`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = x`. This means the loop will continue as long as `i < x`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `i` is 0.
   - `x` must be a non-negative integer.
   - `z` is defined as `z // (k - 1) + 1`.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `x`. Therefore, `x` must remain the same or be greater than 1.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 1.
   - `x` must remain a non-negative integer and should be such that `i < x` holds true for the next iteration. Given that `i` is now 1, `x` must be at least 1.

6. **Final state**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `x` must be a non-negative integer and at least 1.
   - `z` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `x` must be a non-negative integer and at least 1, `z` is `z // (k - 1) + 1`**.
