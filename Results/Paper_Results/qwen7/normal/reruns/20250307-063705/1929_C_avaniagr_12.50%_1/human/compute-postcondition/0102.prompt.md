Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 30, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 100, `a` is an integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^9, `t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    k, x, a = map(int, input().split())
    if x < k - 1:
        if a >= x + 1:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    elif x == k - 1:
        if a >= x + 3:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    else:
        z = 0
        for i in range(x + 1):
            z += z // (k - 1) + 1
        if a >= z:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers assigned the values from the input split by spaces. If `x` is less than `k - 1`:
- If `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`, the condition remains unchanged.
- Otherwise, the condition also remains unchanged.
Otherwise (`x` is equal to `k - 1`):
- If `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3`, `a` remains unchanged.
- Otherwise, `a` is less than or equal to `x + 2`.
If `x` is greater than `k - 1`:
- `z` is set to 15.
- `i` is set to 3.
- If `a` is greater than or equal to 15, `a` remains unchanged.
- Otherwise, `a` is less than 15.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 999, `k` is an integer from input, `x` is an integer from input, `a` is an integer from input. If `x < k - 1` and `a` is less than `x + 1`, then `i` is equal to `x`, `x` is a non-negative integer, and `z` is the sum of `z` initialized to 0 plus `z // (k - 1) + 1` added `x + 1` times. Otherwise, no changes are made to `i`, `x`, and `z`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 0 and 998, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers from input. If `x < k - 1` and `a` is less than `x + 1`, no changes are made. Otherwise, if `x == k - 1` and `a` is less than `x + 3`, then `z` is 15 and `i` is 3. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
