Reasoning:
1. The program correctly handles the logic for different scenarios based on the values of `k`, `x`, and `a`.
2. It checks if `x` is less than `k - 1`, equal to `k - 1`, or greater than `k - 1` and applies the appropriate logic.
3. For the case when `x < k - 1`, it checks if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1` and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly.
4. For the case when `x == k - 1`, it checks if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3` and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly.
5. For the case when `x > k - 1`, it calculates the minimum number of coins required using the formula `z = 0; for i in range(x + 1): z += z // (k - 1) + 1` and checks if `a` is greater than or equal to `z` and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly.
6. The program does not return any value but prints the result for each test case, which matches the expected behavior as described in the problem statement.

Given the above points, the program appears to be correctly implemented according to the problem description and the provided examples.

Correctness: **True**
