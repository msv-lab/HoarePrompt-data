Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is defined as `for i in range(x + 1)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `x`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000.
   - `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers assigned from the input split by spaces.
   - `x` is greater than `k - 1`.
   - `z` is 1.
   - `i` is 0.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < x + 1`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 1.
   - The value of `x` remains unchanged.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `t` remains an integer between 1 and 1000.
   - `k`, `x`, and `a` remain the same as they were not involved in the loop head.
   - `z` remains 1.
   - `i` is now 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers assigned from the input split by spaces, `x` is greater than `k - 1`, `z` is 1, `i` is 1**
