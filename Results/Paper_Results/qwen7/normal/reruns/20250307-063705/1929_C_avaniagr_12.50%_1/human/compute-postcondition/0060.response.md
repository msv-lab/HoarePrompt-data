Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` must be a non-negative integer and at least 1, `z` is 2 * (`z // (k - 1) + 1')**

Explanation: The variable `z` is updated by adding `z // (k - 1) + 1` to its current value. Given the initial state where `z` is `z // (k - 1) + 1`, the new value of `z` becomes `z + (z // (k - 1) + 1)`. Since `z` is initially `z // (k - 1) + 1`, the expression simplifies to `z + (z // (k - 1) + 1)`, which is equivalent to `2 * (z // (k - 1) + 1)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
