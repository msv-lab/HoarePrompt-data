Output State: **`k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 30, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 100, `a` is an integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^9, `t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000.**

The code `t = int(input())` assigns the value of the input to `t`. The values of `k`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states. The input for `t` must be an integer within the specified range [1, 1000].
