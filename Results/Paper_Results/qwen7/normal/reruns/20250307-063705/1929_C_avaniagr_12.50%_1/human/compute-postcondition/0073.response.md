Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 999, `k` is an integer from input, `x` is an integer from input, `a` is an integer from input. If `x < k - 1` and `a` is less than `x + 1`, then `i` is equal to `x`, `x` is a non-negative integer, and `z` is the sum of `z` initialized to 0 plus `z // (k - 1) + 1` added `x + 1` times. Otherwise, no changes are made to `i`, `x`, and `z`.
