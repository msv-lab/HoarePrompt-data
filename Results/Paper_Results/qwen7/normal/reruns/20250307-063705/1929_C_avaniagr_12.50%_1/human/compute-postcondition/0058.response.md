Output State: **`i` is 0, `x` must be a non-negative integer, `z` is `z // (k - 1) + 1`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `z` by adding `z // (k - 1) + 1` to its current value. However, the initial value of `z` is not provided, and neither is the value of `k`. Therefore, we can only express the updated value of `z` in terms of itself and the unknown `k`. The values of `i` and `x` remain unchanged.
