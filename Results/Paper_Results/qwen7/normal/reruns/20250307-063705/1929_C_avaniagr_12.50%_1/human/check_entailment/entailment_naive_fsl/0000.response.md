Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as per the problem description. Specifically, the logic used to determine if Sasha can achieve his goal is flawed.

Consider the following test case:
- \( k = 2 \)
- \( x = 1 \)
- \( a = 1 \)

According to the problem description, Sasha should be able to achieve any number of coins since he can place a bet of 1 coin and win it back, effectively increasing his coin count without any restrictions. However, the program incorrectly outputs 'NO' for this case because it checks if \( a \geq x + 1 \) and \( a \geq x + 3 \), which are both false for \( a = 1 \) and \( x = 1 \).

The correct logic should be to check if Sasha can place enough bets to ensure he can eventually reach any desired number of coins, regardless of the number of consecutive losses allowed. The current implementation fails to account for this properly.
