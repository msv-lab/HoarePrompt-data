Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(x + 1)`. The variables involved in this loop are `i` and `x`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer between 0 and 998.
   - `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers from input.
   - `z` is 1.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `x` must be a non-negative integer.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < x + 1`.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 1.
   - The value of `x` remains unchanged unless there is additional logic inside the loop that modifies it, but based on the given information, `x` stays the same.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `t` remains an integer between 0 and 998.
   - `k`, `x`, and `a` remain integers from input.
   - `z` remains 1.
   - `i` changes to 1.
   - `x` remains a non-negative integer.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 998, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers from input, `z` is 1, `i` is 1, `x` must be a non-negative integer**.
