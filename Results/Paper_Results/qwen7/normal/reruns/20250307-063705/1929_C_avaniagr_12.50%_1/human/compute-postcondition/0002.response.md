Output State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 1000, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers assigned the values from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `k, x, a = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `k`, `x`, and `a`. The initial state of `t` remains unchanged and is still an integer between 1 and 1000.
