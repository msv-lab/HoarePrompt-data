Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers assigned the values from the input split by spaces. If `x` is equal to `k - 1`, then:
- If `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3`, `a` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `a` is less than or equal to `x + 2`.
Otherwise (`x` is greater than `k - 1`), `z` is 15, `i` is 3, and if `a` is greater than or equal to 15, `a` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `a` is less than 15.
