Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(x + 1):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `x`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `x` must be a non-negative integer and at least 1.
   - `z` is 2 * (`z // (k - 1) + 1`), but since we are only concerned with adjusting the states of objects in the loop head, we do not need to modify `z`.

3. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `x + 1`.
   - Since `i` is currently 1, the loop will execute again if `x` is greater than 1.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 from 1 to 2.
   - `x` must remain the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration, which is a non-negative integer and at least 1. However, for the loop to execute again, `x` must be greater than 1.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 2, `x` must be a non-negative integer and at least 2**
