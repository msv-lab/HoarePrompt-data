Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000.
- `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers assigned values from the input split by spaces.
- The current value of `x` is less than `k - 1`.
- The current value of `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`.

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
