Functionality: **The function processes multiple sets of inputs (t, k, x, a) where t is the number of test cases, and for each test case, it checks if certain conditions are met based on the values of k, x, and a. If the conditions are satisfied, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.**
