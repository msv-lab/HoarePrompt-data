Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` must be a non-negative integer and at least 2, `z` is `z + z // (k - 1) + 1`**

Explanation: The code `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` increments `z` by the value of `z // (k - 1) + 1`. However, since the initial state does not specify the values of `z` and `k`, and these values are not updated or defined within the given code snippet, the only change is to `z`. The precondition that `x` must be a non-negative integer and at least 2 remains unchanged, and `i` also remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
