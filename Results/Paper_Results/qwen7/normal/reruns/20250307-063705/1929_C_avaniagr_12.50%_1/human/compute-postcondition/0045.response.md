Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers assigned the values from the input split by spaces. If `x` is less than `k - 1`:
- If `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`, the condition remains unchanged.
- Otherwise, the condition also remains unchanged.
Otherwise (`x` is equal to `k - 1`):
- If `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3`, `a` remains unchanged.
- Otherwise, `a` is less than or equal to `x + 2`.
If `x` is greater than `k - 1`:
- `z` is set to 15.
- `i` is set to 3.
- If `a` is greater than or equal to 15, `a` remains unchanged.
- Otherwise, `a` is less than 15.
