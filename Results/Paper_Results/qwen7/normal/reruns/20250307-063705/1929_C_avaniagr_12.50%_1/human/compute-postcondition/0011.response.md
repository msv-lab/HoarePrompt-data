Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers assigned the values from the input split by spaces, and the current value of `x` is less than `k - 1`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`, then the condition remains unchanged. Otherwise, the condition also remains unchanged.
