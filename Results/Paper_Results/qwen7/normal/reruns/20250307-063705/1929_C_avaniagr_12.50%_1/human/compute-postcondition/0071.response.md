Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 999, `k` is an integer from input, `x` is an integer from input, `a` is an integer from input, `i` is equal to `x`, `x` is a non-negative integer, and `z` is the sum of `z` initialized to 0 plus `z // (k - 1) + 1` added `x + 1` times. Regardless of whether `x` equals `k - 1` or not, the values of `i`, `x`, and `z` remain unchanged from their initial states after the if-else block executes.
