Output: **YES**

Explanation: The initial state does not provide specific values for `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a`, but it does give us the relationship between these variables. Specifically, `x` is assigned the value of `k - 1`, and `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3`. The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`, and there are no variables or objects within the print statement itself that need further evaluation. Therefore, the output is simply the string `'YES'`.
