Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `x`, where `x` is a non-negative integer.
- `z` is the sum of `z` initialized to 0 plus `z // (k - 1) + 1` added `x + 1` times.
- The current value of `a` is greater than or equal to `z`.

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('YES')
```

This print statement will output the string 'YES' without any dependence on the values of `x`, `k`, `z`, or `a`.

Output: **YES**
