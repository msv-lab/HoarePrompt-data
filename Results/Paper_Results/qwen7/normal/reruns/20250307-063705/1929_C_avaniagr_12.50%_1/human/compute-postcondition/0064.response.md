Output State: `i` is equal to `x`, `x` must be a non-negative integer, and `z` is the sum of `z` initialized to 0 plus `z // (k - 1) + 1` added `x + 1` times.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to the value of `x`. The variable `z` will be the result of starting with 0 and repeatedly adding `z // (k - 1) + 1` a total of `x + 1` times.
