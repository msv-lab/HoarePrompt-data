Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers assigned from the input split by spaces, `x` is greater than `k - 1`, `z` is 2, `i` is 1**

Explanation: The variable `z` is updated by adding `z // (k - 1) + 1` to its current value. Given that `z` is initially 1, `z // (k - 1)` would evaluate to 0 because `k - 1` is a non-zero integer, making `z // (k - 1) + 1` equal to 1. Thus, `z` becomes `1 + 1`, which is 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
