Postcondition: **`i` is equal to `x`, `x` must be a non-negative integer, and `z` is the sum of `z` initialized to 0 plus `z // (k - 1) + 1` added `x + 1` times. Regardless of whether `a` is greater than or equal to `z` or less than `z`, the values of `i`, `x`, and `z` remain unchanged from their initial states after the if-else block executes.**
