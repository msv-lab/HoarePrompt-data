Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and for each test case, s is a binary string with a length between 1 and 500, inclusive.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        
        count = 1
        
        flag = False
        
        j = 0
        
        while j < len(s) - 1:
            if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
                count += 1
                if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                    flag = True
                    j += 1
            j += 1
        
        if flag:
            count -= 1
        
        print(count)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500, `s` is an updated input string with a length equal to the total number of iterations plus one, `count` is the total number of times the condition `s[j] != s[j + 1]` was met across all iterations, which is equal to `len(s) - 1`, `flag` is True because the loop executed at least once with the condition `s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1'` being true in at least one iteration, `i` is 0, `j` is `len(s) - 1`, and the condition `flag` is True.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will still be the initial value since it's not modified within the loop. The string `s` will have a length equal to the total number of iterations plus one because each iteration processes one character of the string. The variable `count` accumulates the number of transitions from '0' to '1' or vice versa across all iterations. The variable `flag` remains True as long as there is at least one instance where `s[j]` is '0' and `s[j + 1]` is '1' during any iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, where for each test case, it reads a positive integer `t` and a binary string `s`. It then counts the number of times the string `s` transitions from '0' to '1' or '1' to '0'. If there is at least one transition from '0' to '1', it subtracts one from the count. Finally, it prints the count for each test case.
