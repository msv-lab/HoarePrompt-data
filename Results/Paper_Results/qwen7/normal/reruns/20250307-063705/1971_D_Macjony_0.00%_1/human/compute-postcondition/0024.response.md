Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500; `s` is an input string with a length of at least 4; `count` is 3; `flag` is True; `j` is 3; if `s[1]` is '1', then `s[2]` is also '1'; if `s[j]` (which is `s[3]`) is not equal to `s[j + 1]` (which is `s[4]`), then the conditions remain as initially described, otherwise, `s[3]` is '0' and `s[4]` is '1'.
