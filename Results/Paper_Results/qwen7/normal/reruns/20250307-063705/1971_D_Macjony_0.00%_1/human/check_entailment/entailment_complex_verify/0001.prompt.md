You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 1
        flag = False
        j = 0
        while j < len(s) - 1:
            if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
                count += 1
                if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                    flag = True
                    j += 1
            j += 1
        if flag:
            count -= 1
        print(count)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and for each test case, s is a binary string with a length between 1 and 500, inclusive.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        
        count = 1
        
        flag = False

                count += 1

    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500, `s` is an updated input string with a length equal to the total number of iterations plus one, `count` is the total number of times the condition `s[j] != s[j + 1]` was met across all iterations, which is equal to `len(s) - 1`, `flag` is True because the loop executed at least once with the condition `s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1'` being true in at least one iteration, `i` is 0, `j` is `len(s) - 1`, and the condition `flag` is True.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will still be the initial value since it's not modified within the loop. The string `s` will have a length equal to the total number of iterations plus one because each iteration processes one character of the string. The variable `count` accumulates the number of transitions from '0' to '1' or vice versa across all iterations. The variable `flag` remains True as long as there is at least one instance where `s[j]` is '0' and `s[j + 1]` is '1' during any iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, where for each test case, it reads a positive integer `t` and a binary string `s`. It then counts the number of times the string `s` transitions from '0' to '1' or '1' to '0'. If there is at least one transition from '0' to '1', it subtracts one from the count. Finally, it prints the count for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `s`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - `count` is initialized to 1, representing the initial assumption that at least one piece is needed.
   - `flag` is a boolean variable used to check if there is a transition from '0' to '1'.
   - `j` is an index variable used to iterate through the string.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - The program iterates through the string using a while loop.
   - If the current character `s[j]` is different from the next character `s[j+1]`, it increments `count` by 1.
   - If the current character is '0' and the next character is '1', it sets `flag` to `True` and increments `j` by 1 to skip the next character.
   - After the loop, if `flag` is `True`, it decrements `count` by 1.

4. **Output:**
   - The final value of `count` is printed for each test case.

### Correctness Analysis

1. **Handling Transitions:**
   - The logic correctly identifies transitions from '0' to '1'. Each such transition requires an additional piece.
   - However, the decrement of `count` when `flag` is `True` is unnecessary because the increment of `count` already accounts for the transition.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - If the string is already sorted (all '0's followed by all '1's), the program should output 1.
   - If the string has no transitions (e.g., "000000" or "111111"), the program should output 1.
   - If the string has multiple transitions, the program should output the correct number of pieces.

3. **Testing Specific Examples:**
   - For the example "11010", the program outputs 3, which is correct.
   - For the example "00000000", the program outputs 1, which is correct.
   - For the example "1", the program outputs 1, which is correct.
   - For the example "10", the program outputs 2, which is correct.
   - For the example "0001111", the program outputs 1, which is correct.
   - For the example "0110", the program outputs 2, which is correct.

### Conclusion

The program correctly identifies the number of pieces needed to rearrange the binary string into a sorted binary string. The logic is sound, and the edge cases are handled appropriately.
