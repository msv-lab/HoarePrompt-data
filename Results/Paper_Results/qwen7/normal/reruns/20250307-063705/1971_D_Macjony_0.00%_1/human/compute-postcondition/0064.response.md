Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500, `s` is an input string with a length greater than or equal to 7, `count` is either 2 or 3, `flag` is True, `i` is `t - 1`, `j` is `j + 2`.**

Explanation: The code `j += 1` increments the value of `j` by 1. Initially, `j` was `j + 1`. After executing the code, `j` becomes `j + 2`. All other variables (`t`, `s`, `count`, `flag`, and `i`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
