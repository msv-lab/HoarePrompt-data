Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500, `s` is an updated input string with a length greater than or equal to 7, `count` is 4, `flag` is True, `i` is 0, `j` is 4. If the substring `s[j:j+2]` equals "01", then `j` is set to 4; otherwise, the values of `t`, `s`, `count`, `flag`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.
