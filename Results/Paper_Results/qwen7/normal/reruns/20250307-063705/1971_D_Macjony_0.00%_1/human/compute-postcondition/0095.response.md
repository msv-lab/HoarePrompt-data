Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500, `s` is an updated input string with a length greater than or equal to 7, `count` is 2, `flag` is True, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, if the current value of `s[j]` is '0' and the current value of `s[j + 1]` is '1', `flag` is set to True and `j` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `flag` remains False and `j` remains unchanged.
