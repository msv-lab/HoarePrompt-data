Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500; `s` is an input string with a length of at least 2; `count` is either 2 or 1; `flag` is True; `j` is 1; the current value of `s[j]` is '1' and the current value of `s[j + 1]` is '1'. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[j + 1]`, then `count` is 2, `flag` is True, and `j` is 1. If the condition `s[j] != s[j + 1]` is false, then `count` remains 1.
