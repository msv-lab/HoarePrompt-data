Reasoning:
- The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
- For each test case, the program initializes `count` to 1, indicating that the initial piece is the entire string.
- It then iterates through the string `s` to count the number of transitions from '0' to '1' or '1' to '0'.
- If there is at least one transition from '0' to '1', it subtracts one from `count`.
- This logic is correct because:
  - Each transition from '0' to '1' or '1' to '0' indicates a point where the string needs to be split to ensure all '0's come before all '1's.
  - Subtracting one from `count` when there is at least one '0' followed by a '1' ensures that we do not overcount the number of pieces needed.
- The final count is printed for each test case, which is the minimum number of pieces required to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Given the above analysis, the program logic matches the problem requirements and the provided example test cases.

Correctness: **True**
