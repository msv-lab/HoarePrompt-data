Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `t`.
2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < t`.
3. **Determine the initial state of `i` and `t`**:
   - `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is a positive integer between 1 and 500.
   - `i` is initialized to 0 before the loop starts.

Given these points, we need to ensure that the loop can execute at least once. This means `i` should be less than `t` initially.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500, we need to ensure `t` is set to a valid value within this range.
   - `i` is initialized to 0, so no adjustment is needed for `i`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `t` must be a positive integer between 1 and 500.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500**
