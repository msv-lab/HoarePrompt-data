The function processes a series of test cases, where for each test case, it reads a positive integer `t` and a binary string `s`. It then counts the number of times the string `s` transitions from '0' to '1' or '1' to '0'. If there is at least one transition from '0' to '1', it subtracts one from the count. Finally, it prints the count for each test case.
