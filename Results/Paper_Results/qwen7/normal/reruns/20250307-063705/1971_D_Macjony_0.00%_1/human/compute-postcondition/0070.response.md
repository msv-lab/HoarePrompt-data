Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500, `s` is an input string with a length greater than or equal to 7, `count` is 3 or 4, `flag` is True, `i` is `t - 1`, `j` is `j + 1`, and if `s[j]` is '0' and `s[j + 1]` is '1', then `count` remains unchanged; otherwise, `count` remains unchanged.
