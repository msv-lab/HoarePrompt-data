You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 1
        flag = False
        j = 0
        while j < len(s) - 1:
            if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
                count += 1
                if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                    flag = True
                    j += 1
            j += 1
        if flag:
            count -= 1
        print(count)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and for each test case, s is a binary string with a length between 1 and 500, inclusive.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        
        count = 1
        
        flag = False
        
        j = 0

                count += 1

    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500, `s` is an updated input string with a length equal to the total number of iterations plus one, `count` is the total number of times the condition `s[j] != s[j + 1]` was met across all iterations, which is equal to `len(s) - 1`, `flag` is True because the loop executed at least once with the condition `s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1'` being true in at least one iteration, `i` is 0, `j` is `len(s) - 1`, and the condition `flag` is True.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will still be the initial value since it's not modified within the loop. The string `s` will have a length equal to the total number of iterations plus one because each iteration processes one character of the string. The variable `count` accumulates the number of transitions from '0' to '1' or vice versa across all iterations. The variable `flag` remains True as long as there is at least one instance where `s[j]` is '0' and `s[j + 1]` is '1' during any iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, where for each test case, it reads a positive integer `t` and a binary string `s`. It then counts the number of times the string `s` transitions from '0' to '1' or '1' to '0'. If there is at least one transition from '0' to '1', it subtracts one from the count. Finally, it prints the count for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the program fails to account for the scenario where the entire string is a sorted binary string. For example, consider the input `00000000`. According to the problem description, this string can be rearranged into a sorted binary string using just one piece. However, the program incorrectly counts this as needing 1 piece but does not handle the case where no cuts are necessary.

To fix this, the program should check if the string is already sorted and return 1 in that case. Here is an updated version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        if s == ''.join(sorted(s)):
            print(1)
        else:
            count = 1
            flag = False
            j = 0
            while j < len(s) - 1:
                if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
                    count += 1
                    if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                        flag = True
                        j += 1
                j += 1
            if flag:
                count -= 1
            print(count)
```

This updated version correctly handles the case where the string is already sorted, ensuring the program works for all potential cases.
