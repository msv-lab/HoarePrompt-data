Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500; `s` is an input string; `count` is 1; `flag` is False.**

The code simply assigns the boolean value `False` to the variable `flag`. No other changes are made to the values of `t`, `s`, or `count`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states, and `flag` is set to `False`.
