Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500, `s` is an input string with a length greater than or equal to 7, `count` is either 1 or 2, `flag` is either False or True, `i` is `t - 1`, `j` is 1, and if `s[j]` is '0' and `s[j + 1]` is '1', then `flag` is set to True and the current characters at positions `j` and `j + 1` in string `s` are both '1'. Otherwise, the values of the variables remain unchanged as per the precondition.**
