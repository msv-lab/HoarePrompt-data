Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500, `s` is an updated input string with a length greater than or equal to 7, `count` is 2, `flag` is True, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, the current value of `s[j]` is '1', and the current value of `s[j + 1]` is '1'.**

Explanation: The variable `j` is incremented by 1, so its new value is 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The current value of `s[j]` changes from '0' to '1' because `j` now points to the next character in the string `s`.
