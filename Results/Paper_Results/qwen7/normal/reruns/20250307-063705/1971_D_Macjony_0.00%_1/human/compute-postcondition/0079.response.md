Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500, `s` is an input string with a length greater than or equal to 7, `count` is a value between 2 and 4 (inclusive), `flag` is True, `i` is `t - 1`, `j` is `len(s) - 1`.**

This postcondition summarizes that regardless of whether the if condition (`flag`) is true or not, the values of `t`, `s`, `count`, `flag`, `i`, and `j` remain the same as they were at the end of the loop. Specifically, `j` is `len(s) - 1`, `count` is between 2 and 4, `flag` is True, and `i` is `t - 1`.
