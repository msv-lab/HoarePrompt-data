Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500, `s` is an updated input string with a length greater than or equal to 7, `count` is either 1 or 2, `flag` is either True or False, `i` is 0, `j` is either 0 or 1. If the current value of `s[j]` is not equal to the current value of `s[j + 1]`, then `count` is incremented by 1, `flag` is set to True, and `j` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `flag` remains False and `j` remains unchanged.
