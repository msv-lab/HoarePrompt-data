Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500, `s` is an input string with a length greater than or equal to 7, `count` is a value between 2 and 4 (inclusive), `flag` is True, `i` is `t - 1`, `j` is `len(s) - 1`.

This postcondition summarizes that regardless of whether the if condition (`flag`) is true or not, the values of `t`, `s`, `count`, `flag`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged from their initial states. The loop's execution does not affect these variables outside of the if-else block, and since there is no modification to `flag` in the else part, it remains True.
