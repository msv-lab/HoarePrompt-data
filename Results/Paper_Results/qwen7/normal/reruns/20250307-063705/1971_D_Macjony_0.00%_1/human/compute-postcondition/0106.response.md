Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500, `s` is an updated input string with a length greater than or equal to 7, `count` is 3, `flag` is True, `i` is 0, `j` is 1. If the substring `s[j]` is '0' and `s[j + 1]` is '1', then `flag` is set to True; otherwise, `flag` remains unchanged.
