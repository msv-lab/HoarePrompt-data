Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500; `s` is an input string; `count` is 1; `flag` is False; `j` is 0.**

The code initializes a new variable `j` and assigns it the value `0`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `s`, `count`, or `flag`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
