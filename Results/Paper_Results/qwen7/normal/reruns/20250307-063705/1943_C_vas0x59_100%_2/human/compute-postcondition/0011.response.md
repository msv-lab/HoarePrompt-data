Output State: **`n` must be at least 3, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, each containing two elements: the first element is `v-1` and the second element is `u-1`, `u` is an input integer decreased by 1, `v` is an input integer decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The value of `v` is decremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state. Therefore, `v` is now `v-1`. All other conditions and values of the variables remain the same as the initial state.
