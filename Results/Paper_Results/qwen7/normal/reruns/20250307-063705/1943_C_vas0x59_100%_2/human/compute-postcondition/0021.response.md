Output State: `n` must be at least 3, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, each containing two elements: the first element is `u-1` and the second element is `v-1`, where `u` and `v` are integers that have been input during the loop iterations, and their values are decremented by 1 before being appended to the respective lists. After all iterations, `u2vs[u]` will contain a list of all `v-1` values that were paired with `u` during the loop, and similarly, `u2vs[v]` will contain a list of all `u-1` values that were paired with `v`.
