Output State: **`n` must be at least 3, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, each containing two elements: the first element is `u-1` and the second element is `v-1`, `u2vs[u-1]` now contains the elements `[u-2, v-1]`, `u` is an input integer decreased by 1, `v` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The value of `u` is decremented by 1. So, `u2vs[u]` changes to `u2vs[u-1]` and its content changes from `[u-1, v-1, v-1]` to `[u-2, v-1]`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
