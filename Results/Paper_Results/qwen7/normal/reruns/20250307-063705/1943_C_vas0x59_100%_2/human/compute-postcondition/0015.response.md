Output State: **`n` must be at least 3, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, each containing two elements: the first element is `u-1` and the second element is `v-1`, `u2vs[u]` now contains the elements `[u-1, v-1, v-1]`, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from input and assigns them to `u` and `v`. These values are converted to integers using `map(int, input().split())` and then unpacked into `u` and `v`. The initial conditions for `n` and `u2vs` remain unchanged, except that `u2vs[u]` now includes an additional element `[u-1, v-1, v-1]`.
