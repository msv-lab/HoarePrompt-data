Output State: **`n` is assigned the value of `previous[path_ba[-1]]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the value of `n`, but it indicates that we exit the innermost loop or conditional block. Therefore, the value of `n` remains as it was before the `break` statement was executed.
