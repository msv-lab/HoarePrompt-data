#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^3. u2vs is a list of lists, where u2vs[i] is a list of integers representing the neighbors of vertex i in the tree. Each vertex is initially white and the tree is represented by its edges.

    #State: Output State: `n` must be at least 3, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, each containing two elements: the first element is `u-1` and the second element is `v-1`, where `u` and `v` are integers that have been input during the loop iterations, and their values are decremented by 1 before being appended to the respective lists. After all iterations, `u2vs[u]` will contain a list of all `v-1` values that were paired with `u` during the loop, and similarly, `u2vs[v]` will contain a list of all `u-1` values that were paired with `v`.

        path_ba.append(n)
        
    #State: Output State: `d` is the result of the bfs function call with argument `a`, `previous` is the second return value of the bfs function call with argument `a`, `b` is the result of calling `func_1(d)`, `n` is -1, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, each containing two elements: the first element is `u-1` and the second element is `v-1`, where `u` and `v` are integers that have been input during the loop iterations, their values are decremented by 1 before being appended to the respective lists, `a` is the result of calling `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the elements `b` and `-1` repeated until the condition `n == -1` is met, and the loop terminates when `n` becomes -1.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop continues to append the value of `n`, which is calculated as `previous[path_ba[-1]]`, to the `path_ba` list until `n` equals -1. Once `n` equals -1, the loop breaks. Therefore, `path_ba` will contain the sequence of values from `b` down to -1, with -1 being the final element. All other variables (`d`, `previous`, `b`, `u2vs`, and `a`) remain unchanged from their initial or previous states after the first three iterations.
    ops = []
    if (len(path_ba) % 2 == 1) :
        ci = len(path_ba) // 2

        #
        #In this final state, the loop has executed all its iterations. The variable `ci` remains as the length of `path_ba` divided by 2 because `path_ba` starts with at least 2 elements and no new elements are added or removed during the loop. The variable `i` reaches 4 because the loop runs from 0 to `ci-1`, and since `ci` is initially set to the length of `path_ba` divided by 2, and assuming `path_ba` starts with at least 2 elements, `i` will reach `ci-1` which is 4 in this case. The list `ops` contains tuples where the first element is `c` and the second element is each index from 0 up to `ci-1`, resulting in four elements as described.
    else :
        ci2 = len(path_ba) // 2

        #
        #Explanation: The loop continues to increment `i` by 2 starting from 1. After 3 iterations, `i` is 5. Since the loop increments `i` by 2 in each iteration, it will continue to add elements to `ops` until `i` reaches the length of `path_ba` minus `ci1`. If `path_ba` has 6 elements (0-indexed), then the loop will run 3 more times (iterations 7, 9, but 9 is out of bounds for a 6-element list), thus `i` will be 7 in the last iteration. Therefore, the loop will append `(ci1, 7)` and `(c2, 7)` to `ops`.
    #State: `path_ba` must have at least 2 elements, `ci` is the length of `path_ba` divided by 2, `i` is 4, and `ops` is a list with four elements `[(c, 0), (c, 1), (c, 3), (ci, 4)]` if `len(path_ba) % 2 == 1`. Otherwise, `path_ba` must have at least 6 elements, `ci1` must be less than 6, `i` is 5, and `ops` is a list that now contains the tuples `(ci1, 1)`, `(c2, 1)`, `(ci1, 3)`, `(c2, 3)`, `(c1, 5)`, `(c2, 5)`, `(ci1, 7)`, and `(c2, 7)` if `len(path_ba) % 2 != 1`.
    print(len(ops))

    print(*map(lambda x: f'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}', ops), sep='\n')
    #This is printed: - The output will be a series of strings, each representing the transformed tuples from `ops`.
    #
    #Given the above steps, the output will be:
    #
    #Output:
    return None
    #The program returns None
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes an undirected tree represented by the number of vertices `n` and a list of lists `u2vs`. It performs a breadth-first search (BFS) twice to find specific paths within the tree, constructs a list of operations based on these paths, and finally prints the count of operations and details of each operation. The function returns None.
