Output State: `path_ba` must have at least 2 elements, `ci` is the length of `path_ba` divided by 2, `i` is 4, `ops` is a list with four elements `[(c, 0), (c, 1), (ci, 3), (c, 4)]`.

In this final output state, the loop has executed all its iterations. The variable `ci` remains as half the length of `path_ba`, which now contains at least 2 elements. The variable `i` reaches 4 since the loop runs from 0 to `ci - 1`, inclusive. The list `ops` accumulates tuples `(c, i)` for each iteration of the loop, resulting in four such tuples.
