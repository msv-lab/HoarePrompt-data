Output State: **`n` is an input integer; `u2vs` is a list of n empty lists.**

Explanation: The code initializes `u2vs` as a list of n empty lists. This means that for each vertex from 0 to n-1, there are no neighbors initially specified. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and the structure of `u2vs` is now a list containing n sublists, each of which is empty.
