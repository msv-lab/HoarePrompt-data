Output State: **`n` must be at least 3, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, each containing two elements: the first element is `u-1` and the second element is `v-1`, `u2vs[u]` now contains the elements `[u-1, v-1, v-1], `u` is an input integer decreased by 1, `v` is an input integer decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `u2vs[v].append(u)` appends the value of `u` (which is `u-1`) to the list `u2vs[v]`. Initially, `u2vs[v]` contains `[u-1, v-1]`. After executing the code, `u2vs[v]` becomes `[u-1, v-1, u-1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
