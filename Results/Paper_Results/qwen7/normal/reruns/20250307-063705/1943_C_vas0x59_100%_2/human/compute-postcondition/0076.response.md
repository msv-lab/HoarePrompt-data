Postcondition: **`path_ba` must have at least 2 elements, `ci` is the length of `path_ba` divided by 2, `i` is 4, and `ops` is a list with four elements `[(c, 0), (c, 1), (c, 3), (ci, 4)]` if `len(path_ba) % 2 == 1`. Otherwise, `path_ba` must have at least 6 elements, `ci1` must be less than 6, `i` is 5, and `ops` is a list that now contains the tuples `(ci1, 1)`, `(c2, 1)`, `(ci1, 3)`, `(c2, 3)`, `(c1, 5)`, `(c2, 5)`, `(ci1, 7)`, and `(c2, 7)` if `len(path_ba) % 2 != 1`.**
