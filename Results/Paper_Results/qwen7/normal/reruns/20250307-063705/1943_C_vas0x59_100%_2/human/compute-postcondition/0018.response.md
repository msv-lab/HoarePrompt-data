Output State: **`n` must be at least 3, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, each containing two elements: the first element is `u-1` and the second element is `v-1`, `u2vs[u]` now contains the additional element `v-1`.**

Explanation: The code `u2vs[u].append(v)` appends the value `v-1` to the list `u2vs[u]`. The initial state specifies that `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, each containing two elements: the first element is `u-1` and the second element is `v-1`. After executing the code, the list `u2vs[u]` will have an additional element `v-1` appended to it. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
