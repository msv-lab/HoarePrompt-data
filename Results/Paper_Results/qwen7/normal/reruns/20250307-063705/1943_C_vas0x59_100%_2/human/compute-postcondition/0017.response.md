Output State: **`n` must be at least 3, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, each containing two elements: the first element is `u-1` and the second element is `v-1`, `u` is an input integer decreased by 1, `v` is an input integer decreased by 1.**

The code `v -= 1` decrements the value of `v` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state of `v` is its original value decreased by 1.
