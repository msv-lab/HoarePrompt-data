Postcondition: **`d` is the result of the bfs function call with argument `a`, `previous` is the second return value of the bfs function call with argument `a`, `b` is the result of calling `func_1(d)`, `n` is `previous[path_ba[-1]]`, and `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, each containing two elements: the first element is `u-1` and the second element is `v-1`, where `u` and `v` are integers that have been input during the loop iterations, their values are decremented by 1 before being appended to the respective lists, `a` is the result of calling `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the element `b` and `-1`. If `n` equals -1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
