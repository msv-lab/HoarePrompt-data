Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `u2vs` is a list of n empty lists, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer - 1**

Explanation: The code `v -= 1` decrements the value of `v` by 1. Since `u` is defined as `input integer - 1`, its value remains unchanged. The value of `n` and the structure of `u2vs` also remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes `v` being reduced by 1 compared to its original value.
