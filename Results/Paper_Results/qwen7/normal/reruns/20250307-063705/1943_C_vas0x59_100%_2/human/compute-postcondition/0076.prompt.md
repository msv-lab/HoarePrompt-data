You are assigned the role of a program verifier, responsible for completing the overall postcondition of Hoare triples for if statements based on the postconditions of the if and the else part. In addition to the Hoare triples, you will also see the postconditions for the if and else parts. Each Hoare triple is made up of three components: a precondition, a program fragment, and a postcondition. The precondition and the postcondition are expressed in natural language.

Precondition: describes the initial state of the program variables before the execution of the program fragment. This description should only include the values of the variables, without detailing the operational aspects of the program.

Program Fragment: This is a given part of the task and is not something you need to create or modify. This contains the condition of the if statement and if there is an else part there will also be an else: in the program fragment.

Postcondition: describes the state of the program variables after the execution of the program fragment with the initial state described in the precondition. This description should include both the values of the variables and the relationships between them. Similar to the precondition, avoid explaining how the program operates; concentrate solely on the variable values and their interrelations. Ensure that the postcondition retains the conditions stated in the precondition. You need to strictly follow the format and summarize the if statement in a coherent paragraph, rather than discussing it in separate paragraphs.

The if part : the postcondition of the if part

The else part : the postcondition of the else part

Combine the postconditions of the if and else part(if an else exists), taking into account the if condition,  to get the overall postcondition of the if else block

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
Follow the format Postcondition: **the calculated postcondition**

Example 1:
Precondition: `str` is a string
Program Fragment:
```
if len(str) < 3:
```
If part: `str` is a string with lenght less than 3, the function returns None
Else part: there is no else part in the code

Example Answer 1:
Postcondition: ***`str` is a string, if the length of `str` is less then 3, the function return None***


Example 2:
Precondition: `n` can have any value
Program Fragment:
```
if isinstance(n, int):
    
else:
    
```

If part: n is an integer of any value and the function returns `n`
Else part: n can have any value except an integer one and the function returns `int(n)`

Example Answer 2:
Postcondition: ***if `n` is integer, then the function returns `n` itself. Otherwise, the function return `int(n)`***

Example 3:
Precondition: `x` is an positive integer
Program Fragment:
```
if x < 2:
   
else:
    
```

If part: `x` is an positive integer less than 2, the function returns False
Else part: `x` is an positive integer larger or equal to 2 and the function returns True

Example Answer 3:
Postcondition: ***x is a positive integer, if x is less then 2, the function return False. Otherwise, the function return True***

Example 4:
Precondition: `m` is an integer, `n` is an integer
Program Fragment:
```
if n < 0:
    
else:
    
```
if part: the integer n was originally negative and `n` is updated to its negation. Integer `m` is increased by 1
else part: if n is 0 then return m , otherwise the integer `n` is decreased by 13. Integer `m` is increased by 1

Example Answer 4:
Postcondition: ***`m`, `n` are integers. If n < 0, `m` is increased by 1 and `n` is negated. If n == 0, the function returns `m`. Otherwise, `n` is decreased by 13 and `m` is increased by 1.***

Example 5:
Precondition: `x` is an integer, y is zero.
Program Fragment:
```
if x > 0:
```
If part: `x` is a positive integer, if `x` > 10, `y` is set to twice the value of `x`. Otherwise, `y` is set to the value of `x` plus 5.
Else part: there is no else part in the code

Example Answer 5:
Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer. If `x` > 10, `y` is set to twice the value of `x`. If x is larger than 0 but lower than 10, `y` is set to the value of `x` plus 5.***

Your Task:
Precondition: `d` is the result of the bfs function call with argument `a`, `previous` is the second return value of the bfs function call with argument `a`, `b` is the result of calling `func_1(d)`, `n` is -1, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, each containing two elements: the first element is `u-1` and the second element is `v-1`, where `u` and `v` are integers that have been input during the loop iterations, their values are decremented by 1 before being appended to the respective lists, `a` is the result of calling `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the elements `b` and `-1` repeated until the condition `n == -1` is met, and the loop terminates when `n` becomes -1; `ops` is an empty list.
Program Fragment:
```
if len(path_ba) % 2 == 1:
else:

```
if part: Output State: `path_ba` must have at least 2 elements, `ci` is the length of `path_ba` divided by 2, `i` is 4, `ops` is a list with four elements `[(c, 0), (c, 1), (c, 3), (ci, 4)]`.

In this final state, the loop has executed all its iterations. The variable `ci` remains as the length of `path_ba` divided by 2 because `path_ba` starts with at least 2 elements and no new elements are added or removed during the loop. The variable `i` reaches 4 because the loop runs from 0 to `ci-1`, and since `ci` is initially set to the length of `path_ba` divided by 2, and assuming `path_ba` starts with at least 2 elements, `i` will reach `ci-1` which is 4 in this case. The list `ops` contains tuples where the first element is `c` and the second element is each index from 0 up to `ci-1`, resulting in four elements as described.
else part: Output State: `path_ba` must have at least 6 elements; `ci1` must be less than 6; `i` is 5; `ops` is a list that now contains the tuples `(ci1, 1)`, `(c2, 1)`, `(ci1, 3)`, `(c2, 3)`, `(c1, 5)`, `(c2, 5)`, `(ci1, 7)`, and `(c2, 7)`.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `i` by 2 starting from 1. After 3 iterations, `i` is 5. Since the loop increments `i` by 2 in each iteration, it will continue to add elements to `ops` until `i` reaches the length of `path_ba` minus `ci1`. If `path_ba` has 6 elements (0-indexed), then the loop will run 3 more times (iterations 7, 9, but 9 is out of bounds for a 6-element list), thus `i` will be 7 in the last iteration. Therefore, the loop will append `(ci1, 7)` and `(c2, 7)` to `ops`.

Your task is to complete the overall postcondition of the whole if else block. Summarise all the cases and give the overall postcondition of the program after the if else executes.
In your response strictly use the format: Postocndition: **the postocndition you calculate.**, and describe this postcondition in Natural language easily understandable by humans
