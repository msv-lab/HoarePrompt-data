Output State: **`d` is the result of the bfs function call with argument `a`, `previous` is the second return value of the bfs function call with argument `a`, `n` must be at least 3, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, each containing two elements: the first element is `u-1` and the second element is `v-1`, where `u` and `v` are integers that have been input during the loop iterations, and their values are decremented by 1 before being appended to the respective lists, `a` is the result of calling `func_1(d)`**.

This means that the BFS function has been called with argument `a`, and it has returned two values: `d` and `previous`. The variable `n` remains unchanged, as does the structure of `u2vs`. Additionally, `a` has been updated to the result of calling `func_1(d)`.
