Output State: **`path_ba` must have at least one element; `ci1` must be less than `len(path_ba)`; `i` is 3; `ops` is a list that now contains the tuples `(ci1, 1)`, `(c2, 1)`, and `(ci1, 3)`**.

Explanation: The code `ops.append((c1, i))` appends a new tuple `(c1, i)` to the list `ops`. Given that `i` is 3, the new tuple added is `(c1, 3)`. Since `c1` is not defined in the initial state, it is assumed to be the same as `ci1` (as per the precondition `ci1` must be less than `len(path_ba)`). Therefore, the updated list `ops` includes the tuples `(ci1, 1)`, `(c2, 1)`, and `(ci1, 3)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
