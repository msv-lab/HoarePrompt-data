Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `ci`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < ci + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `path_ba` must have at least 2 elements.
   - `ci` is the length of `path_ba` divided by 2.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `ops` is a list with one element `(c, 0)`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 0, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 1.
   - `ci` remains unchanged because it is derived from the length of `path_ba`, which does not change within the loop body.
   - `path_ba` must still have at least 2 elements.
   - `ops` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.

5. **Final state for the next iteration**:
   - `path_ba` must have at least 2 elements.
   - `ci` is the length of `path_ba` divided by 2.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `ops` is a list with one element `(c, 0)`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`path_ba` must have at least 2 elements, `ci` is the length of `path_ba` divided by 2, `i` is 1, `ops` is a list with one element (c, 0)**.
