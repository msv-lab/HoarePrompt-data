Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `u2vs` is a list of n empty lists, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `u, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `u` and `v`. The initial state of `n` and `u2vs` remains unchanged, except that now `u` and `v` are assigned the values of the input integers.
