Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `path_ba` must have at least 2 elements.
   - `ci` is the length of `path_ba` divided by 2.
   - `i` is 4.
   - `ops` is a list with specific elements depending on the length of `path_ba`.

2. **Determining the Length of `path_ba`:**
   - Since `i` is 4, it suggests that `ci` is derived from the length of `path_ba`.
   - If `len(path_ba) % 2 == 1`, then `ci` would be the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2.
   - If `len(path_ba) % 2 != 1`, then `ci` would also be the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2, but the additional conditions suggest that `path_ba` must have at least 6 elements.

3. **Case Analysis:**
   - Given that `i` is 4, let's assume the simplest case where `len(path_ba) = 6` (since it must be at least 6 and the conditions match).
   - Therefore, `ci` would be `6 // 2 = 3`.

4. **Defining `ops` for `len(path_ba) = 6`:**
   - `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(ci1, 1)`, `(c2, 1)`, `(ci1, 3)`, `(c2, 3)`, `(c1, 5)`, `(c2, 5)`, `(ci1, 7)`, and `(c2, 7)`.
   - Here, `ci1` is less than 6, so let's assume `ci1 = 2` (a valid value less than 6).
   - Let's assume `c1` and `c2` are some constants (we don't need their exact values for this problem).

5. **Constructing `ops` List:**
   - With `ci1 = 2`, the list `ops` becomes:
     ```
     [(2, 1), (c2, 1), (2, 3), (c2, 3), (c1, 5), (c2, 5), (2, 7), (c2, 7)]
     ```

6. **Printing the Elements of `ops`:**
   - The code snippet uses `map` to apply a lambda function to each tuple in `ops`, converting them into strings in the format `'x y'`.
   - The `*` operator unpacks the map object into individual arguments for the `print` function.
   - The `sep='\n'` argument ensures that each string is printed on a new line.

7. **Final Output:**
   - The output will be a series of strings, each representing the transformed tuples from `ops`.

Given the above steps, the output will be:

Output: **2 1\n[c2] 1\n2 3\n[c2] 3\n[c1] 5\n[c2] 5\n2 7\n[c2] 7** (where `[c2]` and `[c1]` represent the unknown constants `c2` and `c1` respectively).
