Output State: **`n` must be at least 3, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, each containing two elements: the first element is `v` and the second element is `u`, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers `u` and `v` from input and assigns them to the variables `u` and `v`. It does not change the value of `n` or modify the structure of the list `u2vs` except for appending the new values of `u` and `v` to the list at index `v`. The precondition that `n` must be at least 3 remains unchanged, and the list `u2vs` now has the updated value at index `v`.
