Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `u2vs` is a list of lists where each element is a list of integers representing the neighbors of vertex i in the tree. Each vertex is initially white and the tree is represented by its edges.**

Explanation: The code reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This changes the value of `n` from being an unspecified integer to the actual integer input. However, the initial state of `u2vs` remains unchanged as no operation is performed on it. The description of each vertex being initially white and the tree being represented by its edges also remains valid.
