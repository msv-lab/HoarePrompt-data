Output State: **`path_ba` must have at least 2 elements, `ci` is the length of `path_ba` divided by 2, `i` is 3, `ops` is a list with three elements `[(c, 0), (c, 1), (ci, 3)]**.

Explanation: The code appends a new tuple `(c, i)` to the list `ops`. Given that `i` is 3, the tuple added is `(c, 3)`. Since `ci` is the length of `path_ba` divided by 2, it remains unchanged. The initial list `ops` had two elements `[(c, 0), (c, 1)]`, and now it has three elements: `[(c, 0), (c, 1), (ci, 3)]`. All other variables remain in their initial states.
