Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: an integer `n` representing the number of vertices in the tree, and a list of lists `u2vs` where each element `u2vs[i]` is a list of integers representing the neighbors of vertex `i`. The function also assumes that each vertex is initially white and the tree is represented by its edges. After processing, the function returns None.**
