Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `u2vs` is a list of n empty lists with one appended element at index u which is v, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, the list `u2vs[v]` now contains two elements: v and u.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `u` to the list located at index `v` in the list `u2vs`. Initially, each list in `u2vs` has one element, which is `v`. After executing the code, the list at index `v` will have two elements: `v` and `u`. All other variables remain unchanged.
