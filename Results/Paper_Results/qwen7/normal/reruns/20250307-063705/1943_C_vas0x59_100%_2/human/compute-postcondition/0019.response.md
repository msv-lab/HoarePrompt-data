Output State: **`n` must be at least 3, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, each containing two elements: the first element is `u-1` and the second element is `v-1`, `u2vs[v]` now contains the elements `v-1` and `u-1`.**

Explanation: The code `u2vs[v].append(u)` appends the value of `u-1` to the list `u2vs[v]`. Initially, `u2vs[v]` contains the element `v-1`. After executing the code, `u2vs[v]` will contain both `v-1` and `u-1`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
