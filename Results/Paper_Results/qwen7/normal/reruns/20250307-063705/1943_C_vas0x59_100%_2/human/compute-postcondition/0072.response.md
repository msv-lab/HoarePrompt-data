Output State: **`path_ba` must have at least one element; `ci1` must be less than `len(path_ba)`; `i` is 5; `ops` is a list that now contains the tuples `(ci1, 1)`, `(c2, 1)`, `(ci1, 3)`, `(c2, 3)`, and `(c1, 5)`**.

Explanation: The code appends a new tuple `(c1, i)` to the list `ops`. Given that `i` is 5, the new tuple added to `ops` is `(c1, 5)`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
