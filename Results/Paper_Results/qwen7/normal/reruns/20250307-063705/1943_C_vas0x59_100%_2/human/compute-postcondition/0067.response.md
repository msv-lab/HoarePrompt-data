Output State: **`path_ba` must have at least one element; `ci1` must be less than `len(path_ba)`; `i` is 1; `ops` is a list that now contains the tuples `(ci1, 1)` and `(c2, 1)`**.

Explanation: The code `ops.append((c2, i))` appends a new tuple `(c2, i)` to the list `ops`. Given that `i` is 1, the new tuple added to `ops` is `(c2, 1)`. The other variables remain unchanged.
