Functionality: **The function processes an undirected tree represented by the number of vertices `n` and a list of lists `u2vs`. It performs a breadth-first search (BFS) twice to find specific paths within the tree, constructs a list of operations based on these paths, and finally prints the count of operations and details of each operation. The function returns None.**
