Output State: **`n` is assigned the value of `previous[path_ba[-1]]`.**

This means that the variable `n` is now holding the value of `previous[path_ba[-1]]`, where `path_ba` is assumed to be a list and `path_ba[-1]` refers to the last element of this list. The value of `n` is specifically set to whatever value is stored in the dictionary `previous` at the key given by the last element of `path_ba`. Other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
