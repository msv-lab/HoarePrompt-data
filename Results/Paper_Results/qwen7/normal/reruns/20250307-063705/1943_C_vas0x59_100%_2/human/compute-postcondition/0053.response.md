Output State: **`path_ba` must have at least 2 elements, `ci` is the length of `path_ba` divided by 2, `i` is 0, `ops` is a list with one element (c, 0)**

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(c, i)` to the list `ops`. Given that `ci` is the length of `path_ba` divided by 2 and `i` is 0, the tuple added to `ops` is `(c, 0)`. The initial conditions of `path_ba`, `ci`, and `i` remain unchanged except for the addition of the tuple to `ops`.
