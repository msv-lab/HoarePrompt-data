Let's break down the initial state and the conditions given:

1. **Initial State and Conditions**:
   - `path_ba` must have at least 2 elements.
   - `ci` is the length of `path_ba` divided by 2.
   - `i` is 4.
   - `ops` is a list with four elements `[(c, 0), (c, 1), (c, 3), (ci, 4)]` if `len(path_ba) % 2 == 1`.
   - If `len(path_ba) % 2 != 1`, then `path_ba` must have at least 6 elements, `ci1` must be less than 6, `i` is 5, and `ops` is a list that now contains the tuples `(ci1, 1)`, `(c2, 1)`, `(ci1, 3)`, `(c2, 3)`, `(c1, 5)`, `(c2, 5)`, `(ci1, 7)`, and `(c2, 7)`.

2. **Determine the Value of `ci`**:
   - Since `i` is 4, and `ci` is the length of `path_ba` divided by 2, we need to determine the length of `path_ba`.
   - If `len(path_ba) % 2 == 1`, then `ci` would be the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2.
   - If `len(path_ba) % 2 != 1`, then `path_ba` must have at least 6 elements, and `ci` would also be the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2.

3. **Determine the Value of `ops`**:
   - If `len(path_ba) % 2 == 1`, then `ops` is a list with four elements `[(c, 0), (c, 1), (c, 3), (ci, 4)]`.
   - If `len(path_ba) % 2 != 1`, then `ops` is a list with eight elements `[(ci1, 1)`, `(c2, 1)`, `(ci1, 3)`, `(c2, 3)`, `(c1, 5)`, `(c2, 5)`, `(ci1, 7)`, `(c2, 7)]`.

Given that `i` is 4, it suggests that the condition `len(path_ba) % 2 == 1` is met because `i` is even, and the only way `i` could be 4 is if the length of `path_ba` is odd (since `ci` would be an integer).

Therefore, `ops` will be a list with four elements `[(c, 0), (c, 1), (c, 3), (ci, 4)]`.

4. **Calculate the Length of `ops`**:
   - Since `ops` is explicitly defined as having four elements, the length of `ops` is 4.

Output: **4**
