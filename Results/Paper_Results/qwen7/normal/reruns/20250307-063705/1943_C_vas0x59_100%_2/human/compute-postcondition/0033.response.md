Output State: **`d` is the result of the bfs function call with argument `a`, `previous` is the second return value of the bfs function call with argument `a`, `b` is the result of calling `func_1(d)`, `n` is -1, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, each containing two elements: the first element is `u-1` and the second element is `v-1`, where `u` and `v` are integers that have been input during the loop iterations, their values are decremented by 1 before being appended to the respective lists, `a` is the result of calling `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the element `b`, and `path_ba.append(n)` appends -1 to the list `path_ba`.**

This means that the list `path_ba` now contains the element `b` and the element `-1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
