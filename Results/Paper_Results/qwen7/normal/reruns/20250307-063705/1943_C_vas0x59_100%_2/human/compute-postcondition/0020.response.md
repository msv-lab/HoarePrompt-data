Output State: `n` must be at least 4, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, each containing two elements: the first element is `u-1` and the second element is `v-1`. After all iterations, `u2vs[u]` will contain `k` occurrences of `u-1` and `k` occurrences of `v-1` for every pair `(u, v)` entered into the list during the loop, where `k` is the total number of times the pair `(u, v)` was entered. The values of `u` and `v` are integers decreased by 1 for each iteration they were used.

This means that for each pair of integers `(u, v)` entered into the list, `u2vs[u]` and `u2vs[v]` will each contain multiple occurrences of `u-1` and `v-1` respectively, depending on how many times that specific pair was input.
