Output State: **`path_ba` must have at least one element; `ci1` must be less than `len(path_ba)`; `i` is 3; `ops` is a list that now contains the tuples `(ci1, 1)`, `(c2, 1)`, `(ci1, 3)`, and `(c2, 3)`**.

Explanation: The code appends a new tuple `(c2, i)` to the list `ops`. Given that `i` is 3, the new tuple added is `(c2, 3)`. The other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
