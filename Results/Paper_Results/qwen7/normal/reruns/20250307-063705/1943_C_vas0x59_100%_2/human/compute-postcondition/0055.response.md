Output State: **`path_ba` must have at least 2 elements, `ci` is the length of `path_ba` divided by 2, `i` is 2, `ops` is a list with two elements [(c, 0), (c, 1)]**.

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(c, i)` to the list `ops`. Initially, `ops` contains one element `(c, 0)`. After executing `ops.append((c, i))`, the list `ops` now contains two elements: `(c, 0)` and `(c, 1)`. The value of `i` is incremented from 1 to 2, but `path_ba` and `ci` remain unchanged.
