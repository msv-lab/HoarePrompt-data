Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `u2vs` is a list of n empty lists with one appended element at index u which is v, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer - 1.**

This means that the list `u2vs` at index `u` now contains the value `v` in addition to being an empty list before. All other variables remain unchanged.
