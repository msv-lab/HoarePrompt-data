Postcondition: `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, and either `idx1` is 2 or `idx2` is 2, depending on whether `l1[i + p1]` equals `l2[i + p2]`. If the condition `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1` is true, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l1[i + p1]` does not equal `l2[i + p2]`, then either `idx1` is set to 2 or `idx2` is set to 2, and the condition `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1` is checked to determine if a break occurs.
