Output State: **`m` is 5, `idx1` is 0, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, the value of `l1[i + p1]` is equal to the value of `a2`.**

Explanation: The variable `p1` is assigned the value `1`, while the other variables remain unchanged. The initial conditions for `n`, `i`, `l1[i + p1]`, and `a2` are preserved.
