Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `val` is an empty list, `n` is an integer from the first input split, `m` is an integer from the second input split, `a1` is the first integer from the input split, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input split excluding the second integer (`a2`), `a2` is the second integer from the input split, `l2` is a list containing the rest of the integers from the input split, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding `a1`, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1:
        break
    if l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]:
        if l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1:
            idx1 = idx2 = i
            break
        else:
            if l1[i + p1] == a2:
                idx1 = i
                p1 = 1
            else:
                idx2 = i
                p2 = 1
            if idx1 >= 0 and idx2 >= 0:
                break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0. If the element at index `i + p1` in list `l1` is not equal to the element at index `i + p2` in list `l2`, then `p2` is incremented by 1, or `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative indices leading to breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement, or the element at index `i + 1` in list `l1` is not equal to the element at index `i + p2` in list `l2`, and `l1[i + 1]` is not equal to `a2`. If the element at index `i + p1` in list `l1` is equal to `a2` and the element at index `i + p2` in list `l2` is equal to `a1`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, and either `idx1` is set to 1 or `idx2` is set to 1, depending on whether `l1[i + p1]` equals `l2[i + p2]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, and either `idx1` is 2 or `idx2` is 2, depending on whether `l1[i + p1]` equals `l2[i + p2]`. If the condition `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1` is true, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
