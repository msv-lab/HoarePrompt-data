Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop is iterating over pairs `(a3, l3)` where `val` is a collection of such tuples.
   - The loop variables are `a3` and `l3`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as there are more tuples in `val`.
   - After each iteration, `a3` and `l3` are set to the next tuple in `val`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `m` must be greater than 3.
   - `val` must contain exactly `m-3` tuples.
   - If `l3` is not equal to a list of elements from `l` excluding `a3`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

4. **Determine the Next State:**
   - Since the loop is iterating over `val`, the next tuple in `val` will be used in the next iteration.
   - Therefore, `a3` and `l3` will be updated to the next tuple in `val`.

5. **Adjust the States:**
   - `m` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `val` will now have one less tuple since we are moving to the next tuple in the collection.
   - `a3` and `l3` will be updated to the next tuple in `val`.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `m` must still be greater than 3.
- `val` must now contain exactly `m-4` tuples (one less than before).
- `a3` and `l3` will be the values of the next tuple in `val`.

So, the final state is:

**State: **`m` must be greater than 3, `val` must contain exactly `m-4` tuples, and `a3` and `l3` will be the values of the next tuple in `val`**.
