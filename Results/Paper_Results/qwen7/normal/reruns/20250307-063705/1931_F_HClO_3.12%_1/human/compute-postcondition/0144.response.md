Based on the initial state provided:

- `m` must be greater than 3.
- `a3` is the first element of the next tuple in `val`.
- `l3` is the second element of the next tuple in `val`.

The `print('no')` statement simply prints the string 'no' without referencing any of the variables `m`, `a3`, or `l3`.

Output: **no**
