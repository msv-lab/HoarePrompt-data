Output State: **`val` is an empty list, and `a3` and `l3` do not exist or are undefined.**

Natural Language Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `val` will be an empty list because it loses one tuple on each iteration until it is completely exhausted. Since `val` is now empty, the variables `a3` and `l3` will no longer have any meaningful values and can either be considered undefined or do not exist in the scope anymore. The loop's condition checks if `l3` is not equal to a modified version of `l` without `a3`, but since `val` is empty, this check will never be performed as there are no more tuples left in `val`. Therefore, the loop will exit cleanly without printing 'no', and the final output will be 'yes' if all previous conditions were met throughout the iterations.
