Output State: **`m` is at least 5, `a3` is the third integer from the input, `l3` is the list of integers from the input starting from the fourth integer, `val` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer and a list of integers corresponding to the inputs provided during each iteration of the loop, `n` is the first integer from the input, `a1` is the second integer from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the input split and converted to an integer, and `l2` is the remaining integers from the input split and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code `a2, *l2 = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts them to integers, and assigns the first integer to `a2` and the rest to the list `l2`. The values of `m`, `a3`, `l3`, `val`, `n`, and `a1` remain unchanged from their initial states.
