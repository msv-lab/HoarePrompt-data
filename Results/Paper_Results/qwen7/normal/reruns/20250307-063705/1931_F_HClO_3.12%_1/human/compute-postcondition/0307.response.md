Postcondition: `val` is a list containing at least one tuple, and its length is `m-4` where `m` is greater than 3; `a3` and `l3` are the values of the next tuple in `val`; if `l3` is not equal to the list comprehension `[i for i in l if i != a3]`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
