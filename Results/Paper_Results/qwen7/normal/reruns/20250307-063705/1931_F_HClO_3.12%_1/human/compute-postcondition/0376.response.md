Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and the condition `n - 1`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
   - `i` is currently 1.
   - Either `idx1` is set to 1 or `idx2` is set to 1, depending on the comparison result.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 2.
   - The condition `n - 1` remains unchanged because it depends on the value of `n`, which is not modified within the loop head.

5. **Update the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - `idx1` and `idx2` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head and their values depend on the loop body, which is omitted.

Therefore, the updated state for the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, and either `idx1` is set to 1 or `idx2` is set to 1, depending on whether `l1[i + p1]` equals `l2[i + p2]`**.
