Output State: **`m` is 5, `idx1` is 1, `idx2` is 1, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 1 or 0, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and if `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The code sets both `idx1` and `idx2` to the current value of `i`, which is 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previous states.
