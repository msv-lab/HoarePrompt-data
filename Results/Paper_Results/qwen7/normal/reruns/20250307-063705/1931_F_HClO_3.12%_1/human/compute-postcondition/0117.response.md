Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the input split by spaces, `m` is 1, `a1` is the first integer from the input split by spaces, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input split by spaces excluding any occurrences of `a2`, `a2` is the second integer from the input split by spaces, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the input split by spaces, `l22` is a list of elements in `l2` excluding `a1`, `idx1` is either 2 or -1, `idx2` is either 2 or -1, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `val` is a list containing a tuple `(a3, l3)`, `a3` is the third integer from the input split by spaces, and `l3` is a list containing the rest of the integers from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The value of `m` is decremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
