Output State: **`idx1` is 1, `idx2` is 1, `i` is 1**.

Explanation: The code assigns the current value of `i` (which is 1) to both `idx1` and `idx2`. Since `i` was initially 1, `idx1` and `idx2` are also set to 1. The conditions related to `n` and the loop or if statement are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the postconditions for `n` and `i` remain unchanged.
