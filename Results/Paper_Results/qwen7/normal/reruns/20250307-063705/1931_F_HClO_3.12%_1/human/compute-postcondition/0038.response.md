Output State: **`idx1` is 2, `idx2` is 2, `i` is 2, `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2`, and `l2[i + p2]` is equal to `a1`**.

Explanation: The code sets both `idx1` and `idx2` to the value of `i`, which is 2. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `idx1` and `idx2` are both updated to 2, while `i` remains 2. The conditions involving `l1` and `l2` also remain true as they are not affected by the code.
