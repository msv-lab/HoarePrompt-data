Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the input split by spaces, `m` is 1, `a1` is the first integer from the input split by spaces, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input split by spaces excluding any occurrences of `a2`, `a2` is the second integer from the input split by spaces, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the input split by spaces, `l22` is a list of elements in `l2` excluding `a1`, `idx1` is 2, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `val` is an empty list, `l1` now has `a1` inserted at index `-1`.**

Explanation: The code `l1.insert(idx2, a1)` inserts the value of `a1` into the list `l1` at the index specified by `idx2`, which is `-1`. Since lists in Python allow negative indexing, inserting at `-1` means that `a1` is added as the last element of `l1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
