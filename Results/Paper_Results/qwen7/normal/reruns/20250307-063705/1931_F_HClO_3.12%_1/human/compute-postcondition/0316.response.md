Output State: **`val` is an empty list, `n` is an integer from the first input split, `m` is an integer from the second input split, `a1` is the first integer from the input split, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input split, `a2` is the second integer from the input split, and `l2` is a list containing the rest of the integers from the input split.**

Explanation: The code splits the input into multiple integers using `map(int, input().split())`. It assigns the first two integers to `a2` and `l2` respectively, where `a2` gets the second integer and `l2` gets the rest of the integers as a list. The other variables (`val`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, and `l1`) remain unchanged.
