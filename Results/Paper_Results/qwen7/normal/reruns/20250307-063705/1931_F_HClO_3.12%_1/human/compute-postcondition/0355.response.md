Postcondition: `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0. If the element at index `i + p1` in list `l1` is not equal to the element at index `i + p2` in list `l2`, then either `p2` is incremented by 1, or `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative indices leading to breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the elements at indices `i + p1` in `l1` and `i + p2` in `l2` are equal to `a2` and `a1` respectively, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
