Output State: **Postcondition: `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since no loop or conditional block is specified, the `break` statement simply indicates that we are breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged, and the condition checks for `idx1` and `idx2` are not affected by the `break` statement.
