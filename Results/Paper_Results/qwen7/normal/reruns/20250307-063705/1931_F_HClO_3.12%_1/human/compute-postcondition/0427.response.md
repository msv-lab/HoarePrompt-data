Postcondition: **After executing the if-else block, `i` is either `n-2` or `n-3`. `idx1` and `idx2` satisfy the condition that either `idx1 < idx2` or `idx1 >= idx2`. Both `p1` and `p2` are 0. `val` is a list containing zero or one tuple. If `idx1 < idx2`, then `idx1` is set to a value between 0 and `n-2`, inclusive, and `l` is updated to `l2`. If `idx1 >= idx2`, then `idx2` is updated to insert `a1` at its position, and `l` is updated to `l1`. Alternatively, `a3` is the first element of the input split and converted to an integer, `l3` is a list containing the rest of the elements from the input split and converted to integers, and `val` is a list containing one tuple `(a3, l3)`.**
