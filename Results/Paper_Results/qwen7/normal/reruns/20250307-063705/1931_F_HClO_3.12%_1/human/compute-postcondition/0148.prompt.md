Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `m` must be greater than the total number of iterations the loop ran, `a3` is the third integer from the input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input after the first three integers, `val` is a list containing tuples, each tuple consists of an integer (`a3`) and a list of integers (`l3`) for each iteration of the loop, totaling the number of iterations the loop ran.

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, `m` will be at least 5 (since it must have been greater than 3 initially and increased by 1 for each iteration), `a3` will be the third integer from the input, `l3` will be the list of integers from the input starting from the fourth integer, and `val` will be a list of tuples, each containing an integer and a list of integers corresponding to the inputs provided during each iteration of the loop.
Code of the loop:
for a3, l3 in val:
    if l3 != [i for i in l if i != a3]:
        print('no')
        break
else:
    print('yes')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `m` must be greater than 3, `a3` is the third integer from the input, `l3` is the list of the remaining integers from the input after the first three integers, `val` must contain at least one tuple, and if the current value of `l3` is not equal to the list of all elements in `l` excluding `a3`, the conditions remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `m` must be greater than 3, `a3` is the second element of the next tuple in `val`, `l3` is the second element of the next tuple in `val`. If `l3` is not a list containing elements other than `a3`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `m` must be greater than 3, `a3` is the first element of the next tuple in `val`, `l3` is the second element of the next tuple in `val`. If `l3` is not equal to the list comprehension `[i for i in l if i != a3]`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l3` is equal to the list comprehension, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
