Output State: **`m` is 5, `idx1` is 2, `idx2` is 2, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 1 or 0, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The code sets both `idx1` and `idx2` to the value of `i`, which is 2. The other variables (`m`, `p1`, `p2`, `n`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Additionally, since the condition `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1` was already satisfied (as `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 1), the code breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
