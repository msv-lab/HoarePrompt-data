Output State: **`val` is a list containing at least one tuple (one less tuple than before), and its length is `m-3` where `m` is greater than 3; and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This means that the `val` list has at least one tuple, but now contains one less tuple than before, and its length is `m-3` where `m` is greater than 3. Additionally, we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement.
