Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `m` must be greater than 3; `a3` is the first integer from each input split across all iterations, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from each input split across all iterations converted to integers, and `val` is a list containing `m-2` tuples, where each tuple consists of an `a3` and its corresponding `l3`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `val` will contain a list of tuples, with each tuple representing the `a3` and `l3` from each iteration of the loop. The length of `val` will be `m-2`, as the loop runs `m-2` times.
Code of the loop:
for a3, l3 in val:
    if l3 != [i for i in l if i != a3]:
        print('no')
        break
else:
    print('yes')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `m` must be greater than 3, `val` must contain exactly `m-2` tuples, and `l3` is a list that either does not contain any elements that are present in `l` except for `a3`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or there is no additional condition since there is no else part specified.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `m` must be greater than 3, `val` must contain exactly `m-3` tuples, and if `l3` is not equal to a list of elements from `l` excluding `a3`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `m` must be greater than 3, `val` must contain exactly `m-4` tuples, and if `l3` is not equal to a list comprehension excluding `a3` from `l`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition `l3 != [i for i in l if i != a3]` is false, no changes occur to `val`, `m`, `a3`, and `l3`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
