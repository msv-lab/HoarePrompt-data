Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < n - 1`.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `m` is 5
   - `idx1` is either 0 or -1
   - `idx2` is either 0 or -1
   - `p1` is either 1 or 0
   - `p2` is either 1 or 0
   - `n` is greater than 1
   - `i` is 0
   - Either `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`, leading to `idx1` and `idx2` being set to either 0 or -1, and `p1` and `p2` being set to either 1 or 0, or the variables remain unchanged as per the else part.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 0, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented to 1.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `i < n - 1`. Given that `n` is greater than 1, `i` needs to be 1 for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the only variables that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n` (though `n` remains unchanged).

5. **New States**:
   - `i` will be 1.
   - `n` remains greater than 1.

The other variables (`m`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `l1`, `l2`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`m` is 5, `idx1` is either 0 or -1, `idx2` is either 0 or -1, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 1 or 0, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1**
