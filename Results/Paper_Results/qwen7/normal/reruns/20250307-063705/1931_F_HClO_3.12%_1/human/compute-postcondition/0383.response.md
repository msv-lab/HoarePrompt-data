Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, `idx2` is 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The code `idx2 = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 2) to `idx2`. All other variables remain unchanged. The condition `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1` is not relevant to the assignment of `idx2` and does not affect the output state.
