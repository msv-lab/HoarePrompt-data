Output State: **`m` must be greater than 2; `a3` is an integer from the input; `l3` is a list of integers from the input; `val` is a list containing one tuple `(a3, l3)`**.

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(a3, l3)` to the list `val`. Since `a3` is an integer from the input and `l3` is a list of integers from the input, the list `val` now contains this single tuple. The conditions and values of `m` and `a3` remain unchanged.
