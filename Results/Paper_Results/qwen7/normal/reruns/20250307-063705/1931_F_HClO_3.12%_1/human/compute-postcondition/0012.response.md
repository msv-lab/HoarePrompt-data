Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the input split by spaces, `m` is 1, `a1` is the first integer from the input split by spaces, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input split by spaces excluding any occurrences of `a2`, `a2` is the second integer from the input split by spaces, and `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code creates a new list `l11` which contains elements from `l1` (the list of remaining integers from the input split by spaces) excluding any occurrences of `a2`. The other variables remain unchanged.
