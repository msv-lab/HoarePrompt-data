Output State: **`m` is 5, `idx1` is 2, `idx2` is 2, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 1 or 0, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change any variable values but indicates that we exit the most internal loop or if statement. All other variables retain their initial states.
