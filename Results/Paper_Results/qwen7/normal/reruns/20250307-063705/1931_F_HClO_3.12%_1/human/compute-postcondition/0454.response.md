Postcondition: `m` must be greater than 3, `val` must contain exactly `m-4` tuples, and if `l3` is not equal to the list comprehension `[i for i in l if i != a3]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l3` is equal to the list comprehension, the postcondition remains unchanged from the precondition.
