Postcondition: `a3` is the first element of the input split and converted to an integer, `l3` is a list containing the rest of the elements from the input split and converted to integers, `i` is equal to `n-2`, either `idx1` or `idx2` will be set to a value between 0 and `n-2`, inclusive, the values of `p1` and `p2` will be 0, `val` is an empty list, and `idx1` is greater than or equal to `idx2`. Additionally, if `m` is equal to 2, the loop or iteration continues as before. The index of `a1` in `l3` is greater than or equal to the index of `a2` in `l3`.
