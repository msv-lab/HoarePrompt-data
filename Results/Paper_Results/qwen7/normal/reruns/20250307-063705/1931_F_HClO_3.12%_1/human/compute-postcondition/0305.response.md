Output State: **`val` is a list containing at least one tuple, and its length is `m-4` where `m` is greater than 3; `a3` and `l3` are the values of the next tuple in `val`; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not affect the values of `val`, `a3`, or `l3`. It only indicates that the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was inside. All other variables and their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
