Postcondition: `m` must be greater than 3, `a3` is the first element of the next tuple in `val`, `l3` is the second element of the next tuple in `val`. If `l3` is not equal to the list comprehension `[i for i in l if i != a3]`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l3` is equal to the list comprehension, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.
