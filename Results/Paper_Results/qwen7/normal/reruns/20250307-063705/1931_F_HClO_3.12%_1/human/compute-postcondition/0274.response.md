Postcondition: `m` is 2, `idx1` is either 1 or 0 or -1 and is less than or equal to `idx2`, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 1 or 0, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 3, `val` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `a3` is the first element of this list, `l3` is a list containing the rest of the elements, if `l3.index(a1) < l3.index(a2)`, then `l` has had its `idx2`-th position inserted with `a1`. Otherwise, `l` has had the element `a2` inserted at index `idx1`.
