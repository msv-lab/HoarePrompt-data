Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the input split by spaces, `m` is 1, `a1` is the first integer from the input split by spaces, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input split by spaces excluding any occurrences of `a2`, `a2` is the second integer from the input split by spaces, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the input split by spaces, `l22` is a list of elements in `l2` excluding `a1`, `idx1` is 2, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 0, and `i` is 2.**

The code `p1 = 1` assigns the value 1 to `p1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
