Output State: **`m` is 2, `idx1` is either 1 or 0 or -1 and is less than or equal to `idx2`, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 1 or 0, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 3, `val` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `a3` is the first element of this list, `l3` is a list containing the rest of the elements, `l2` has had the element `a2` inserted at index `idx1`, `l` is now equal to `l2`**.

Explanation: The line `l = l2` assigns the value of `l2` to `l`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged. Therefore, `l` is now a reference to `l2`.
