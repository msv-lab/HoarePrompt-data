Output State: `m` must be greater than 3; `a3` is the first integer from each input split across all iterations, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from each input split across all iterations converted to integers, and `val` is a list containing `m-2` tuples, where each tuple consists of an `a3` and its corresponding `l3`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `val` will contain a list of tuples, with each tuple representing the `a3` and `l3` from each iteration of the loop. The length of `val` will be `m-2`, as the loop runs `m-2` times.
