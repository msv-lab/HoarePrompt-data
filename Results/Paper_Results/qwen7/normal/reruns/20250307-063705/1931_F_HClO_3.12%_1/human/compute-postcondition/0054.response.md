Output State: **Postcondition: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the input split by spaces, `m` is 1, `a1` is the first integer from the input split by spaces, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input split by spaces excluding any occurrences of `a2`, `a2` is the second integer from the input split by spaces, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the input split by spaces, `l22` is a list of elements in `l2` excluding `a1`, `idx1` is 2, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change any of the variable values or the list contents. It only breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such block is specified, we assume it breaks out of an implied loop or conditional. All other variables retain their original values from the initial state.
