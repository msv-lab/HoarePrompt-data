Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be equal to `n-2`, and either `idx1` or `idx2` will be set to a value between 0 and `n-2`, inclusive, depending on the conditions within the loop. The values of `p1` and `p2` will be 0, and `val` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list `val`. This does not affect the values of `i`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, and `p2`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain as described in the initial state.
