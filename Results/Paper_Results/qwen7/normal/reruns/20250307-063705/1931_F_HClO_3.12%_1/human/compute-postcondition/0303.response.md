Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over each tuple `(a3, l3)` in the list `val`.
   - The variables in the loop head are `a3` and `l3`.

2. **Understand the Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop continues as long as there are tuples left in `val`.
   - The postcondition mentions that `val` is a list containing at least one tuple, and its length is `m-3` where `m` is greater than 3.
   - The loop breaks if `l3` is not equal to a list comprehension that generates a list of elements `i` from `l` where `i` is not equal to `a3`.

3. **Determine the State Adjustments:**
   - Since the loop iterates over `val`, at the start of the next iteration, `val` should have one less tuple than before.
   - `a3` and `l3` will be the values of the next tuple in `val`.

4. **Adjust the State:**
   - `val` will have one less tuple, so its length will be `m-4`.
   - `a3` and `l3` will be the values of the next tuple in `val`.

Given the postcondition and the loop structure, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect these adjustments.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`val` is a list containing at least one tuple, and its length is `m-4` where `m` is greater than 3; `a3` and `l3` are the values of the next tuple in `val`**.
