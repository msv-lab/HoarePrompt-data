Output State: **`m` must be greater than 3, `a3` is the third integer from the input, `l3` is the list of the remaining integers from the input after the first three integers, `val` must contain at least one tuple, and the current value of `l3` is not equal to the list of all elements in `l` excluding `a3`.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or a block of code. In this case, it does not change the values of any variables. It simply exits the loop or block. Therefore, the conditions and values of the variables remain the same as the initial state.
