Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(m - 2):`. The variables involved here are `m` and the loop variable `_`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The loop `for _ in range(m - 2)` will execute as long as `m - 2` is a positive integer. This means `m` must be at least 3 (since `m - 2` should be greater than 0).
   - The loop variable `_` is a dummy variable used to iterate over the range, and its initial value is not relevant for the loop condition.

3. **Adjust the States**:
   - We need to ensure that `m` is at least 3 for the loop to execute.
   - The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l22`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and their values do not affect whether the loop can execute or not.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `m` to be at least 3.

**State:**
**`m` must be at least 3**
