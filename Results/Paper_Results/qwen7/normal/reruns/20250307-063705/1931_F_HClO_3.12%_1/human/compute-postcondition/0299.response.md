Based on the initial state provided:

- `val` is a list containing at least one tuple, and its length is `m-3` where `m` is greater than 3.
- `l3` is not equal to a list comprehension that generates a list of elements `i` from `l` where `i` is not equal to `a3`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('no')
```

This statement will print the string `'no'` directly without any dependency on the values of `val` or `l3`.

Output: **'no'**
