Output State: **`m` is 5, `idx1` is either 1 or 0 or -1, `idx2` is either 1 or 0 or -1, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 1 or 0, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 3, and `val` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `val`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
