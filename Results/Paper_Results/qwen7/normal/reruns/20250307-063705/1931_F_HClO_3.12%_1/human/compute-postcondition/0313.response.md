Output State: **`val` is an empty list, `n` is an integer from the first input split, `m` is an integer from the second input split, and we continue waiting for user input.**

The `continue` statement in this context does not change any variable values or affect the state of the program beyond continuing the loop or iteration it is within. Since no specific loop or iteration context is provided, we assume the program continues to wait for further user input as per its initial state.
