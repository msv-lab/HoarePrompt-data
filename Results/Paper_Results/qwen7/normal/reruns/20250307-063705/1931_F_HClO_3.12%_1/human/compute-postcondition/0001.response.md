State: **`t` must be an integer greater than 0, `_` is not adjusted as it is a dummy variable**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variable `_` and the variable `t`.
2. The loop condition `range(t)` requires that `t` be a non-negative integer.
3. If `t` is less than 1 (i.e., 0 or negative), the loop will not execute.
4. The dummy variable `_` (underscore) is typically used for iterating over sequences where the actual values are not needed. It does not affect the loop's execution condition and thus does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the only state that needs adjustment is ensuring `t` is an integer greater than 0.
