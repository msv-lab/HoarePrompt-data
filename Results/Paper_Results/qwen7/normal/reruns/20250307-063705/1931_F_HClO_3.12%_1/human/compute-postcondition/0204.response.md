Postcondition: `m` is 5, `idx1` is either 0 or -1, `idx2` is either 0 or -1, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 1 or 0, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, and either `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`, leading to setting `idx1` and `idx2` to either 0 or -1, and `p1` and `p2` to either 1 or 0, or the variables remain unchanged as per the else part.
