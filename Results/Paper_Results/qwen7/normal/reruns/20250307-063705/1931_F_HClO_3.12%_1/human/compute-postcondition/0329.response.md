Output State: **`val` is an empty list, `n` is an integer from the first input split, `m` is an integer from the second input split, `a1` is the first integer from the input split, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input split excluding the second integer (`a2`), `a2` is the second integer from the input split, `l2` is a list containing the rest of the integers from the input split, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding `a1`, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1.**

The code initializes two variables, `idx1` and `idx2`, both set to -1. This assignment does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the output state retains all the initial conditions except for the new values of `idx1` and `idx2`.
