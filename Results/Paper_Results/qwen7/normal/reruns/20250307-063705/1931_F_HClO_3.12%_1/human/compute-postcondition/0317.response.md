Output State: **`val` is an empty list, `n` is an integer from the first input split, `m` is an integer from the second input split, `a1` is the first integer from the input split, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input split excluding the second integer (a2), `a2` is the second integer from the input split, and `l2` is a list containing the rest of the integers from the input split.**

Explanation: The code creates a new list `l11` that contains elements from `l1` except for the element `a2`. The original lists `l1` and `l2` remain unchanged, and the variables `val`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `a2` retain their initial values.
