Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be equal to `n-2`, and either `idx1` or `idx2` will be set to a value between 0 and `n-2`, inclusive, depending on the conditions within the loop. The values of `p1` and `p2` will be 1 if their respective indices were updated during the loop's execution, otherwise they will remain 0.**

In this final state, the loop will have completed all its iterations (from 0 to `n-2`), and the conditions inside the loop will have determined the values of `idx1` and `idx2`. If the loop breaks due to the condition `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, it means that the loop has iterated through all necessary comparisons. The indices `idx1` and `idx2` will reflect the positions where certain conditions were met during the loop's execution.
