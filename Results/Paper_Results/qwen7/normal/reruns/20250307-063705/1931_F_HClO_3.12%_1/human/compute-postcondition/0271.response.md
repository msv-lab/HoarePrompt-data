Output State: **`m` is 2, `idx1` is either 1 or 0 or -1 and is less than or equal to `idx2`, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 1 or 0, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 3, `val` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `a3` is the first element of this list, `l3` is a list containing the rest of the elements, and `l2` has had the element `a2` inserted at index `idx1`.**

The code `l2.insert(idx1, a2)` inserts the element `a2` into the list `l2` at the index specified by `idx1`. Since `idx1` is either 1, 0, or -1, the insertion point is known, but the exact position within the list `l2` is not specified without knowing the current contents of `l2`. The other variables remain unchanged.
