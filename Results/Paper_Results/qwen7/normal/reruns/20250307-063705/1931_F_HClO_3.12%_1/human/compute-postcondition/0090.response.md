Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the input split by spaces, `m` is 1, `a1` is the first integer from the input split by spaces, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input split by spaces excluding any occurrences of `a2`, `a2` is the second integer from the input split by spaces, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the input split by spaces, `l22` is a list of elements in `l2` excluding `a1`, `idx1` is either 2 or -1, `idx2` is either 2 or -1, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1.**

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l22`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, and `p2` will retain their final values determined by the loop's execution. The loop iterates based on the condition `i + max(p1, p2) < n - 1`, and it breaks when this condition no longer holds or when specific equality checks are met. Given that the loop is designed to run until `i + max(p1, p2)` reaches `n - 1` or a mismatch is found with certain conditions, the final values of `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, and `p2` will be either 2 or -1, depending on whether the conditions inside the loop were satisfied during its execution. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `a2`, `l1`, `l2`, `l22`) will remain unchanged from their initial states since they are not modified within the loop.
