Output State: **`m` is 2, `idx1` is either 1 or 0 or -1 and is less than or equal to `idx2`, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 1 or 0, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 3, `val` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `a3` is the first element of this list, `l3` is a list containing the rest of the elements, and `l1` has had its `idx2`-th position inserted with `a1`.**

Explanation: The code `l1.insert(idx2, a1)` inserts the element `a1` into the list `l1` at the index `idx2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
