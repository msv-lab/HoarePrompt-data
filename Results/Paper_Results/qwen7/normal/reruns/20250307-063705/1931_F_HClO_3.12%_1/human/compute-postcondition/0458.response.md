Output State: All test cases have been processed, and for each test case, either 'yes' or 'no' has been printed based on the conditions specified within the loop. The variable `val` contains the results of all additional queries made during the processing of each test case, and `m` reflects the total number of queries (including the initial ones) for each test case. If the final check within the loop for each test case determines that the lists `l1` and `l2` can be transformed into each other by swapping occurrences of `a1` and `a2` while maintaining the relative order of other elements, 'yes' is printed; otherwise, 'no' is printed.

This means that after all iterations, the output will consist of 'yes' or 'no' for each test case, indicating whether it's possible to transform one list into another under the given constraints, along with the detailed history of queries stored in `val` for each test case.
