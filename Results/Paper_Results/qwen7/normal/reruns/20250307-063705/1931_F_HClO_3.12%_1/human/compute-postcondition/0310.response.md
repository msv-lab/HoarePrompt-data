Output State: **`val` is an empty list, `n` is an integer from the first input split, `m` is an integer from the second input split, `a3` and `l3` do not exist or are undefined.**

The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input separated by a space, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `n` and `m` respectively. The initial state of `val` remains an empty list, and `a3` and `l3` remain undefined.
