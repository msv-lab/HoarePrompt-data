Output State: **`i` is equal to `n-2`, `idx1` is set to a value between 0 and `n-2`, inclusive, `p1` and `p2` are both 0, `val` is an empty list, and `a2` is inserted into `l2` at index `idx1`.**

Explanation: The code `l2.insert(idx1, a2)` inserts the value `a2` into the list `l2` at the index specified by `idx1`. The other variables (`i`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, and `val`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
