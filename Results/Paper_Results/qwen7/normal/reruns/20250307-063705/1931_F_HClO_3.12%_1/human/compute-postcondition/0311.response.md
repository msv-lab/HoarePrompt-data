Output State: **`val` is an empty list, `n` is an integer from the first input split, `m` is an integer from the second input split, and the program waits for user input.**

Explanation: The code `input()` reads a line of input from the user. Since no specific assignment or operation is performed on the input, the values of `val`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. The program now waits for the user to provide input, which will be used but not yet defined in the current state.
