Output State: **`m` is at least 5, `a3` is the third integer from the input, `l3` is the list of integers from the input starting from the fourth integer, and `val` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer and a list of integers corresponding to the inputs provided during each iteration of the loop.**

In Natural Language: After the loop has completed all its iterations, `m` will have incremented by 1 for each iteration, making it at least 5 (since it must have been greater than 3 initially). The variable `a3` will be the third integer from the input, and `l3` will be the list of integers from the input starting from the fourth integer. The list `val` will contain tuples, each representing the inputs provided during each iteration of the loop, with each tuple consisting of an integer (`a3`) and a list of integers (`l3`). If the condition `if l3 != [i for i in l if i != a3]:` holds true for all iterations, the loop will complete without breaking, and the final state will reflect these conditions.
