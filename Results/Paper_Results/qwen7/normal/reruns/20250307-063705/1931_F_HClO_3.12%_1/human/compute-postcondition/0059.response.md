Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < n - 1`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer greater than 0.
   - `n` is the first integer from the input split by spaces.
   - `m` is 1.
   - `a1` is the first integer from the input split by spaces.
   - `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input split by spaces excluding any occurrences of `a2`.
   - `a2` is the second integer from the input split by spaces.
   - `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the input split by spaces.
   - `l22` is a list of elements in `l2` excluding `a1`.
   - `idx1` is either 2 or -1.
   - `idx2` is either 2 or -1.
   - `p1` is either 0 or 1.
   - `p2` is either 0 or 1.
   - The condition `(l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2])` is true.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues as long as `i < n - 1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will be `i + 1`.

Given the current state:
- `i` is such that the condition `(l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2])` is true.
- To continue the loop, `i` must be incremented by 1.

So, the new state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `i` is `i + 1`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the updated state is:
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the input split by spaces, `m` is 1, `a1` is the first integer from the input split by spaces, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input split by spaces excluding any occurrences of `a2`, `a2` is the second integer from the input split by spaces, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the input split by spaces, `l22` is a list of elements in `l2` excluding `a1`, `idx1` is either 2 or -1, `idx2` is either 2 or -1, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, and the condition `(l1[i + 1 + p1] != l2[i + 1 + p2])` is true if the elements at the specified indices are not equal.**
