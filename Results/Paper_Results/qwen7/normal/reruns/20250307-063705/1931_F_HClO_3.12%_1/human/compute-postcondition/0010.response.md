Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the input split by spaces, `m` is 1, and an empty line is read from input; `a1` is the first integer from the input split by spaces, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `a1, *l1 = map(int, input().split())` takes a line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each part to an integer. The first integer is assigned to `a1`, and the rest are collected into a list `l1`. The variables `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged, and an empty line is read from the input as per the precondition.
