Output State: **`m` is at least 5, `a3` is the third integer from the input, `l3` is the list of integers from the input starting from the fourth integer, `val` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer and a list of integers corresponding to the inputs provided during each iteration of the loop, `n` is the first integer from the input, `a1` is the second integer from the input, and an empty line is read if `m` equals 1.**

Explanation: The code `a1, *l1 = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts them to integers, and assigns the first integer to `a1` and the rest to the list `l1`. This affects the values of `n` (first integer) and `m` (second integer), updating them to `a1` and the length of the remaining list (`len(l1)`), respectively. However, since the initial state specifies that `m` is at least 5 and `m` is the second integer from the input, after reading the input, `m` will be updated to the length of the list `l1` plus one (since `a1` is also considered). The other variables remain unchanged, and an empty line is read if `m` equals 1, which is consistent with the initial state description.
