Output State: **`m` must be greater than 3, `val` must contain exactly `m-2` tuples, `l3` is a list that does not contain any elements that are present in `l` except for `a3`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead exits the current loop or conditional block. Therefore, the conditions and values of `m`, `val`, `l3`, `l`, and `a3` remain unchanged from the initial state.
