Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for _ in range(m - 2):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `m` and the underscore `_`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will run for `m - 2` times. At the end of the previous iteration, the loop has run for `m - 3` times.

3. **Determine the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, it needs to run for `m - 2` times in total. This means the loop needs to run one more time from `m - 3` to `m - 2`.

4. **Adjust the State**: Since the loop runs for `m - 2` times, at the start of the next iteration, `m` should remain the same as it was at the start of the previous iteration because the loop does not modify `m`. The underscore `_` is just a placeholder and does not hold any state that needs to be adjusted.

5. **State Adjustment**: The only thing that changes is the number of iterations left. Initially, the loop was set to run `m - 2` times. After running `m - 3` times, it needs to run one more time, meaning it now has 1 iteration left to run.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that there is 1 iteration left to run.

**Final Answer**:
State: **An input is taken but not assigned to any variable, `m` remains the same, 1 iteration left to run**
