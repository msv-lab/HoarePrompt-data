Output State: **`a3` is an integer input from the user, `l3` is a list containing integers from the user's input split by spaces, `val` is a list containing one tuple, where the first element is `a3` and the second element is `l3`.**

The code appends a tuple to the list `val`. The tuple contains `a3` and `l3` as its elements. The values of `a3` and `l3` remain unchanged from their initial state.
