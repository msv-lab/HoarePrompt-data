Output State: **`val` is an empty list, `n` is an integer from the first input split, `m` is an integer from the second input split, `a1` is the first integer from the input split, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input split excluding the second integer (a2), `a2` is the second integer from the input split, and `l2` is a list containing the rest of the integers from the input split, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding `a1`.**

Explanation: The code creates a new list `l22` that contains elements from `l2` except for `a1`. The values of `val`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, and `l2` remain unchanged.
