Postcondition: `m` is 2, `idx1` is either 1 or 0 or -1 and is less than or equal to `idx2`, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 1 or 0, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 3, `val` is updated to a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `a3` is the first element of this list, `l3` is a list containing the rest of the elements, and the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`.
