Output State: **`a3` is the first element of the input split and converted to an integer, `l3` is a list containing the rest of the elements from the input split and converted to integers, `i` is equal to `n-2`, `idx1` or `idx2` will be set to a value between 0 and `n-2`, inclusive, the values of `p1` and `p2` will be 0, `val` is an empty list, and `idx1` is greater than or equal to `idx2`; `l2` now contains an additional element `a2` at index `idx1`.**

Explanation: The code inserts `a2` into the list `l2` at the position specified by `idx1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
