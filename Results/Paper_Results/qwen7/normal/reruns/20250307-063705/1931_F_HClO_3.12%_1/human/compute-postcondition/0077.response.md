Output State: **`idx1` is `i`, `idx2` is `i`, `n` is the first integer from the input split by spaces, `m` is 1, `a1` is the first integer from the input split by spaces, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input split by spaces excluding any occurrences of `a2`, `a2` is the second integer from the input split by spaces, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the input split by spaces, `l22` is a list of elements in `l2` excluding `a1`, `idx1` is either 2 or -1, `idx2` is either 2 or -1, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, and if `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this step, the code assigns the value of `i` to both `idx1` and `idx2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
