State: **`m` is 5, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1 and `i` must be 0 initially** 

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.
2. For the loop to execute, `n - 1` must be a non-negative integer (since `range(n - 1)` generates integers from 0 to `n-2`).
3. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 1.
4. At the start of the loop, `i` should be 0 because the loop will start iterating from 0 up to `n-2`.

Since the initial values of `m`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, and `p2` do not affect the loop's execution condition, they do not need to be adjusted.
