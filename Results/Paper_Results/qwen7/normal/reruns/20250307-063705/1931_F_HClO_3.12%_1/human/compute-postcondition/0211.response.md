Output State: **`m` is 5, `idx1` is 1, `idx2` is 1, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 1 or 0, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the most internal loop or if statement it is inside. Since no variables are modified within the code snippet, their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
