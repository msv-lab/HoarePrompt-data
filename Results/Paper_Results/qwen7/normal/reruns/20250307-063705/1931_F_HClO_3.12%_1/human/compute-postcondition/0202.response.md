Postcondition: `m` is 5, `idx1` is either 0 or -1, `idx2` is either 0 or -1, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 1 or 0, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, and either `idx1` and `idx2` are both non-negative, leading to breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement, or there are no additional changes to the variables due to the absence of an else part.
