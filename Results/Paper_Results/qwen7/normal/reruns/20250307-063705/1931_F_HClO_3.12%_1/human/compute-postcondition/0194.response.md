Output State: **`m` is 5, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is 0, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, and the value of `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to the value of `l2[i + p2]`.**

Explanation: The code `p2 = 1` assigns the value 1 to the variable `p2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
