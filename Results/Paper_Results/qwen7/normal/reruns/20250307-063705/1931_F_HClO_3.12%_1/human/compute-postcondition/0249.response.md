Output State: **`m` is 5, `idx1` is either 1 or 0 or -1 with the current value being less than `idx2`, `idx2` is either 1 or 0 or -1, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 1 or 0, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 3, `val` is an empty list, `l` is `l2`, `a2` is inserted at index `idx1` in list `l2`.**

The code `l = l2` simply assigns the reference of `l2` to the variable `l`. It does not change the values of any variables or lists. Therefore, the values of `m`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `n`, `i`, `val`, and the insertion operation in `l2` remain unchanged.
