Based on the initial state provided:

- `val` is a list containing at least one tuple.
- The length of `val` is `m-2` where `m` is greater than 3.
- `l3` is not equal to a list comprehension that generates a list of elements `i` from `l` where `i` is not equal to `a3`.

The code snippet to execute is:
```python
print('no')
```

This `print` statement simply outputs the string `'no'` without any reference to the variables `val`, `l3`, or `a3`.

Output: **no**
