Output State: **`m` is at least 5, `a3` is the third integer from the input, `l3` is the list of integers from the input starting from the fourth integer, `val` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer and a list of integers corresponding to the inputs provided during each iteration of the loop, `n` is the first integer from the input, `a1` is the second integer from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the input split and converted to an integer, `l2` is the remaining integers from the input split and converted to integers, `l11` is a list of integers from `l1` excluding `a2`.**

Explanation: The code creates a new list `l11` which contains all elements from `l1` except for `a2`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.
