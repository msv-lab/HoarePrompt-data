Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the input split by spaces, `m` is 1, `a1` is the first integer from the input split by spaces, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input split by spaces excluding any occurrences of `a2`, `a2` is the second integer from the input split by spaces, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the input split by spaces, `l22` is a list of elements in `l2` excluding `a1`, `idx1` is 2, `idx2` is either 2 or -1, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `val` is an empty list, and `l` is equal to `l2` if `idx1` is less than `idx2`, otherwise `l` is equal to `l1` if `idx1` is greater than `idx2`, otherwise `val` is a list containing a tuple `(a3, l3)`, where `a3` is the third integer from the input split by spaces, and `l3` is a list containing the rest of the integers from the input split by spaces.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m - 2):
    a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())
    val.append((a3, l3))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `m` must be greater than 2, `a3` is an integer from the input, `l3` is a list of integers from the input, `val` is a list containing one tuple `(a3, l3)`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `m` must be greater than 3, `a3` is an integer converted from the input, `l3` is a list of integers converted from the input, `val` is a list containing two tuples, the first tuple is (`a3`, `l3`)

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `m` must be greater than 3, `a3` is the first integer from the input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `val` is a list containing two tuples, the first tuple is (`a3`, `l3`).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
