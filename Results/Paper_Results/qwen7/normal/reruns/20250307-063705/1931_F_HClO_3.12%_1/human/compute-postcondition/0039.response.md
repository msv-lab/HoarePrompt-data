Output State: **`idx1` is 2, `idx2` is 2, `i` is 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `idx1`, `idx2`, or `i`. It only breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement it is within. The values of `l1[i + p1]` being equal to `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` being equal to `a1` remain unchanged as well.
