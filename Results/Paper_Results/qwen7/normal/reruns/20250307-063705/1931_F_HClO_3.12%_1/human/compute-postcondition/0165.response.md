Output State: **`m` must be greater than 2, `a3` is the third integer from the input, `l3` is the list of integers from the input starting from the fourth integer, `val` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer and a list of integers corresponding to the inputs provided during each iteration of the loop, `n` is the first integer from the input, `a1` is the second integer from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the input split and converted to an integer, `l11` is a list of integers from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding `a1`, an empty string is taken as input, an empty string is inputted.**

Explanation: The code `input()` reads a line of input from the user. Since no specific values are assigned to any variable using this input, the variables remain unchanged except for the fact that an empty string is taken as input. All other conditions and values of the variables remain the same as the initial state.
