Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, if the element at index `i + p1` in list `l1` is equal to `a2`, then the element at index `i + p2` in list `l2` is not equal to the element at index `i + p1` in list `l1`. Otherwise, the element at index `i + 1` in list `l1` is not equal to the element at index `i + p2` in list `l2`, and `l1[i + 1]` is not equal to `a2`, `p2` is 1.**
