Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `idx2` is 0, the element at index `i + p1` in list `l1` is not equal to the element at index `i + p2` in list `l2`, and `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `i` to `idx2`. Since `i` is initially 0, `idx2` is also 0. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
