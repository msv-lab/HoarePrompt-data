Output State: **`m` must be greater than 2, `a3` is an integer from the input, and `l3` is a list of integers from the input.**

Explanation: The code `a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())` takes a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the first integer to `a3` while the rest are collected into a list `l3`. The precondition that `m` must be greater than 2 remains unchanged.
