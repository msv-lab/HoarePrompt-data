Output State: **`m` must be greater than 3, `a3` is the first element of the next tuple in `val`, `l3` is the second element of the next tuple in `val`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of `m`, `a3`, or `l3`. It only indicates that the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was inside.
