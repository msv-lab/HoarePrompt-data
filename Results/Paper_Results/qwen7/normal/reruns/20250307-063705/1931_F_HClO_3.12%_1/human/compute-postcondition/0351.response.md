Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `p2` is 1, `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative indices and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it does not change the values of `n`, `i`, `p2`, `idx1`, or `idx2`. It simply breaks out of the loop or conditional block it is within.
