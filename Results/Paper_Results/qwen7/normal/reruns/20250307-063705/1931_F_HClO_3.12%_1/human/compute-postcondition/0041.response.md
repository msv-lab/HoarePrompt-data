Postcondition: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the input split by spaces, `m` is 1, `a1` is the first integer from the input split by spaces, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input split by spaces excluding any occurrences of `a2`, `a2` is the second integer from the input split by spaces, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the input split by spaces, `l22` is a list of elements in `l2` excluding `a1`, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `i` is 2, and the condition `(l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2])` is true, `(l1[i + p1] != a2 or l2[i + p2] != a1)` is true.
