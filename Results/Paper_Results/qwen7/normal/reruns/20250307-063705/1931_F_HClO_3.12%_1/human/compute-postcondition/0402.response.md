Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `idx1` is greater than or equal to `idx2`, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `val` is an empty list, `idx2` is updated to insert `a1` at its position, and `idx1` is greater than `idx2`.**

Explanation: The code `l1.insert(idx2, a1)` inserts the value `a1` at the index `idx2` in the list `l1`. This operation does not affect the values of `i`, `idx1`, `p1`, `p2`, and `val`. It only updates `idx2` to reflect the new position of the inserted element, maintaining the condition that `idx1` is greater than or equal to `idx2` and `idx1` is greater than `idx2` after the insertion.
