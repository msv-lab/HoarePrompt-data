Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < n - 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `m` is 5
   - `idx1` is either 1 or 0 or -1
   - `idx2` is either 1 or 0 or -1
   - `p1` is either 1 or 0
   - `p2` is either 1 or 0
   - `n` is greater than 1
   - `i` is 1

4. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n - 1`.
   - Currently, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, to satisfy the condition `i < n - 1`, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will become 2.
   - The value of `n` does not change as it is not modified within the loop.

6. **Final state**:
   - `m` remains 5
   - `idx1` remains either 1 or 0 or -1
   - `idx2` remains either 1 or 0 or -1
   - `p1` remains either 1 or 0
   - `p2` remains either 1 or 0
   - `n` remains greater than 1
   - `i` becomes 2

**State: **`m` is 5, `idx1` is either 1 or 0 or -1, `idx2` is either 1 or 0 or -1, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 1 or 0, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2**
