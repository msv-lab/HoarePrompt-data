Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, and either `idx1` is set to 2 or `idx2` is set to 2, depending on whether `l1[i + p1]` equals `l2[i + p2]`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the most internal loop or if statement. It does not change the values of the variables `n`, `i`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `l1`, `l2`, `p1`, or `p2`. The conditions and values of these variables remain as they were before the `break` statement was executed.
