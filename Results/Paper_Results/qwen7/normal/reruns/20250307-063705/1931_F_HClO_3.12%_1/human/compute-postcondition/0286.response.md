Output State: **`a3` is an integer, `l3` is a list of integers, `val` is a list containing two tuples where the first tuple is (a3, l3), and `m` must be greater than 2.**

Explanation: The code appends a new tuple `(a3, l3)` to the list `val`. Initially, `val` contains one tuple where the first element is `a3` and the second element is `l3`. After executing the code, `val` now contains two such tuples. The values of `a3`, `l3`, and `m` remain unchanged.
