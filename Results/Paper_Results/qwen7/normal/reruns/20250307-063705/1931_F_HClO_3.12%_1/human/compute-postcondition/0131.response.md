Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables:**
   - The loop head in the given code is `for (a3, l3) in val:`.
   - The variables in the loop head are `a3`, `l3`, and `val`.

2. **Determine the Initial Conditions for the Loop:**
   - For the loop to execute, `val` must contain at least one tuple. This ensures there is at least one iteration of the loop.
   - `a3` is the first element of the tuple in `val`.
   - `l3` is the second element of the tuple in `val`.

3. **Consider the Constraints Given:**
   - After the loop completes all its iterations, `m` must be greater than the total number of iterations the loop ran.
   - Initially, `m` must be greater than 3 because the loop will run at least once (since `a3` and `l3` are defined).

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since the loop will run at least once, `m` must be greater than 3.
   - `a3` is the third integer from the input.
   - `l3` is the list of the remaining integers from the input after the first three integers.
   - `val` must contain at least one tuple to ensure the loop runs at least once.

### Final State Adjustment:

Based on the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `m` must be greater than 3.
- `a3` is the third integer from the input.
- `l3` is the list of the remaining integers from the input after the first three integers.
- `val` must contain at least one tuple.

Thus, the final state is:

**State: **`m` must be greater than 3, `a3` is the third integer from the input, `l3` is the list of the remaining integers from the input after the first three integers, `val` must contain at least one tuple**.
