Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `idx2` is 1**.

Explanation: The code assigns the current value of `i` to `idx2`. Since the initial value of `i` is 1, `idx2` is also set to 1. No other changes are made to the variables `n` or `i`. Therefore, the conditions and values of `n` and `i` remain the same as the initial state, and `idx2` is now equal to 1.
