Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(m - 2):`. The only variables involved here are `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable), `m`, and the loop counter which starts from 0 and goes up to `m-3`.

2. **Determine the Initial State Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `m - 2 > 0`, which means `m` must be greater than 2.
   - The initial value of the loop counter `_` is irrelevant since it is a throwaway variable.

3. **Adjust the States**:
   - We need to ensure that the loop can execute, which means `m` must be greater than 2.
   - The values of `i`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `val`, `l1`, `l2`, `l3`, and `a3` are not relevant to the loop execution and do not need to be adjusted based on the loop head.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

- `m` must be greater than 2.

So, the final state is:

**State: **`m` must be greater than 2**.
