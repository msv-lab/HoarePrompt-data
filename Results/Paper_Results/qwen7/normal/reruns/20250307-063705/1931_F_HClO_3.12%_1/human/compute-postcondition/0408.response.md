Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `n-2`
- Either `idx1` or `idx2` will be set to a value between 0 and `n-2`, inclusive
- The values of `p1` and `p2` will be 0
- `val` is an empty list
- `idx1` is greater than or equal to `idx2`
- `m` is equal to 2

The print statement is simply `print('yes')`.

The output of this print statement does not depend on any of the other variables or their values; it directly prints the string `'yes'`.

Output: **yes**
