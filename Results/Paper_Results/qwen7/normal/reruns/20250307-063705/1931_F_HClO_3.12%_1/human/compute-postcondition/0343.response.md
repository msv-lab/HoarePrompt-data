Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `idx1` is 0, the element at index `i + p1` in list `l1` is equal to `a2`, the element at index `i + p2` in list `l2` is not equal to the element at index `i + p1` in list `l1`.**

Explanation: The line `idx1 = i` assigns the current value of `i` (which is 0) to `idx1`. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
