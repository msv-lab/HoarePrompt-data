Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `idx1` is 0, `idx2` is 0, the element at index `i + p1` in list `l1` is equal to `a2`, and the element at index `i + p2` in list `l2` is equal to `a1`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `i` to both `idx1` and `idx2`. Since `i` is initially 0, `idx1` and `idx2` are also set to 0. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
