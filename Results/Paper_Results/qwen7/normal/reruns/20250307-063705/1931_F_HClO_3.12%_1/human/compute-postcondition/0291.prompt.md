Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Postcondition: `m` is 5, `idx1` is either 1 or 0 or -1, `idx2` is either 1 or 0 or -1, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 1 or 0, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 3, `val` is an empty list, `a2` is inserted at index `idx1` in list `l2` if `idx1` is less than `idx2`, otherwise `a1` is inserted at index `idx2` in list `l1` and `idx1` is greater than `idx2`, or `m` is 1, `idx1` is either 1 or 0 or -1 and is less than or equal to `idx2`, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 1 or 0, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 3, `val` is a list of tuples where the first tuple contains `a3` and `l3`, `a3` is the first element of the list obtained from the input split by spaces, `l3` is a list containing the rest of the elements, `a1` and `a2` are undefined in this context, `l` is unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m - 2):
    a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())
    val.append((a3, l3))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a3` is an integer input from the user, `l3` is a list containing integers from the user's input split by spaces, `val` is a list containing one tuple, where the first element is `a3` and the second element is `l3`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a3` is an integer, `l3` is a list of integers, `val` is a list containing two tuples where the first tuple is (a3, l3), and `m` must be greater than 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a3` is an integer converted from the first input, `l3` is a list of integers converted from the remaining inputs, `val` is a list containing two tuples where the first tuple is (`a3`, `l3`), and `m` must be greater than 3.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
