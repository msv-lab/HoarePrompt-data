Output State: **`m` must be greater than 3, `val` must contain exactly `m-3` tuples, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the most internal loop or if statement. Since there are no changes made to the variables `m`, `val`, or `l3` within the scope of the `break` statement, their states remain unchanged. Therefore, the conditions and constraints on these variables still hold true, and we simply note that we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement.
