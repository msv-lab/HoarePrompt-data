Output State: **`m` is 5, `idx1` is either 1 or 0 or -1 with the current value being less than `idx2`, `idx2` is either 1 or 0 or -1, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 1 or 0, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 3, `val` is an empty list, `a2` is inserted at index `idx1` in list `l2`.**

Explanation: The code `l2.insert(idx1, a2)` inserts the element `a2` into the list `l2` at the position specified by `idx1`. Since `idx1` is either 1 or 0 or -1, and it is less than `idx2`, the value of `idx2` remains unchanged. All other variables (`m`, `p1`, `p2`, `n`, `i`, and `val`) remain in their initial states.
