Output State: **`m` is 5, `idx1` is 1, `idx2` is either 0 or -1, `p1` is 1, `p2` is either 1 or 0, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1 and we assign `i` to `idx1`.**

Explanation: The code snippet sets `p1` to 1. This updates the value of `p1` from its previous state (either 1 or 0) to 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
