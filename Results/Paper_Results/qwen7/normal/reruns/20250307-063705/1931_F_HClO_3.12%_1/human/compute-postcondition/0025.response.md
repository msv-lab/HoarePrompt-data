Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the input split by spaces, `m` is 1, `a1` is the first integer from the input split by spaces, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input split by spaces excluding any occurrences of `a2`, `a2` is the second integer from the input split by spaces, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the input split by spaces, `l22` is a list of elements in `l2` excluding `a1`. If `l11 != l22`, `m` must be greater than or equal to 5 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop. If `l11 == l22`, no change occurs in the variables.**
