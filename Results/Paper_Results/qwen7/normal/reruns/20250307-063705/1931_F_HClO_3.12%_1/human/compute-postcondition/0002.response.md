Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the first integer input split from input().split(), `m` is the second integer input split from input().split()**.

The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input, splits it into two parts, and converts these parts into integers. These integers are then assigned to `n` and `m` respectively. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was initially defined as an integer greater than 0, and `_` is not used or modified in the given code.
