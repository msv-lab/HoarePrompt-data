Output State: **`m` is 5, `a3` is the third integer from the input, `l3` is the list of integers from the input starting from the fourth integer, `val` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer and a list of integers corresponding to the inputs provided during each iteration of the loop, `n` is the first integer from the input, `a1` is the second integer from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the input split and converted to an integer, `l11` is a list of integers from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding `a1`, three empty strings are taken as input during the loop.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement in the loop causes the loop to skip to the next iteration without executing any further statements in the current iteration. Since the loop has already completed 3 iterations and `m = 5`, the loop will now stop after the next iteration (which would be the 4th iteration). The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables, so the values of `m`, `a3`, `l3`, `val`, `n`, `a1`, `a2`, `l11`, `l22`, and the fact that three empty strings were taken as input during the loop remain unchanged.
