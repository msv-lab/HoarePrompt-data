Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `idx1` is greater than or equal to `idx2`, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `val` is an empty list, `idx2` is updated to insert `a1` at its position, and `l` is now equal to `l1`, and `idx1` is greater than `idx2`.**

Explanation: The line `l = l1` assigns the value of `l1` to `l`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `i`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, and `val` remain unchanged. `idx2` is updated to insert `a1` at its position, which is part of the initial state.
