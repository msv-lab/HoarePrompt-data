Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, and either `idx1` is set to 1 or `idx2` is set to 1, depending on whether `l1[i + p1]` equals `l2[i + p2]`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it breaks out of the loop or conditional block that was checking the condition for `idx1` or `idx2`. The values of `n`, `i`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `l1`, `l2`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged.
