Output State: **`val` is an empty list, `n` is an integer from the first input split, `m` is an integer from the second input split, `a1` is the first integer from the input split, and `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input split.**

Explanation: The code `a1, *l1 = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the first integer to `a1` and the rest to `l1`. The initial values of `val`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.
