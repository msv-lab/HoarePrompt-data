Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: The state at the end of the previous iteration is given as:
   - An input is taken
   - `m` remains the same
   - 0 iterations left to run

2. **Loop Statement**: The loop statement is:
   ```python
   for _ in range(m - 2):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop**:
   - The loop runs for `m - 2` iterations.
   - Since there are 0 iterations left to run, it means the loop has already completed its execution.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - The loop variable `_` is an underscore, which is used when the variable itself is not needed within the loop body.
   - The only state that needs to be considered here is `m`, because the loop condition depends on `m`.
   - Since the loop has completed all its iterations (0 left), `m` should remain the same as it was before the loop started.

5. **Final State**:
   - The input is still taken.
   - `m` remains the same.
   - Since the loop has completed, there are no iterations left to run.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration (which is actually the state after the loop completes) is:

State: **An input is taken, `m` remains the same, 0 iterations left to run**
