Output State: **`m` is 5, `idx1` is 0, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, the value of `l1[i + p1]` is equal to the value of `a2`.**

Explanation: The line `idx1 = i` assigns the current value of `i` (which is 0) to `idx1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
