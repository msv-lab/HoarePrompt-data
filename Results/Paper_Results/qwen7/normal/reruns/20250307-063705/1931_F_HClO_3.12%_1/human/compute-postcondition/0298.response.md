Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for (a3, l3) in val:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `a3` and `l3`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are tuples in the list `val`. Since `val` is a list containing at least one tuple, the loop will continue until all tuples in `val` have been processed.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `val` is a list containing at least one tuple, and its length is `m-2` where `m` is greater than 3.
   - `l3` is not equal to a list comprehension that generates a list of elements `i` from `l` where `i` is not equal to `a3`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `val` must still contain at least one tuple.
   - After processing one tuple `(a3, l3)`, the next tuple in `val` will be used. Therefore, `val` will now contain one less tuple.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `val` is a list containing at least one tuple (one less tuple than before).
- `l3` is not equal to a list comprehension that generates a list of elements `i` from `l` where `i` is not equal to `a3`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`val` is a list containing at least one tuple (one less tuple than before), and its length is `m-3` where `m` is greater than 3; `l3` is not equal to a list comprehension that generates a list of elements `i` from `l` where `i` is not equal to `a3`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
