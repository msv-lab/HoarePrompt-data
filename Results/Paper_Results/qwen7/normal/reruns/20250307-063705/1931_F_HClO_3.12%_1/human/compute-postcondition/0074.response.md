Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n - 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer greater than 0.
   - `n` is the first integer from the input split by spaces.
   - `m` is 1.
   - `a1` is the first integer from the input split by spaces.
   - `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input split by spaces excluding any occurrences of `a2`.
   - `a2` is the second integer from the input split by spaces.
   - `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the input split by spaces.
   - `l22` is a list of elements in `l2` excluding `a1`.
   - `idx1` is either 2 or -1.
   - `idx2` is either 2 or -1.
   - `p1` is either 0 or 1.
   - `p2` is either 0 or 1.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues as long as `i < n - 1`, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` must be less than `n - 1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `i + 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `t` remains an integer greater than 0.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `m` remains 1.
   - `a1` remains the same.
   - `l1` remains the same.
   - `a2` remains the same.
   - `l2` remains the same.
   - `l22` remains the same.
   - `idx1` remains either 2 or -1.
   - `idx2` remains either 2 or -1.
   - `p1` remains either 0 or 1.
   - `p2` remains either 0 or 1.
   - `i` is now `i + 1`.

Given the above reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the input split by spaces, `m` is 1, `a1` is the first integer from the input split by spaces, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input split by spaces excluding any occurrences of `a2`, `a2` is the second integer from the input split by spaces, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the input split by spaces, `l22` is a list of elements in `l2` excluding `a1`, `idx1` is either 2 or -1, `idx2` is either 2 or -1, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, and `i` is `i + 1`**.
