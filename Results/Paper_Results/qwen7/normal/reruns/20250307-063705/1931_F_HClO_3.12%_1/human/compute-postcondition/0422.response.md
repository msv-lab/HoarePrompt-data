Postcondition: `a3` is the first element of the input split and converted to an integer, `l3` is a list containing the rest of the elements from the input split and converted to integers, `i` is equal to `n-2`, either `idx1` or `idx2` will be set to a value between 0 and `n-2`, inclusive, the values of `p1` and `p2` will be 0, `val` is an empty list, and `idx1` is greater than or equal to `idx2`; if the current index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the current index of `a2` in `l3`, then `l` contains the elements of `l1`, `a1`, and `a2` where the index of `a1` is less than the index of `a2`. Otherwise, `l` contains an additional element `a2` at index `idx1`.
