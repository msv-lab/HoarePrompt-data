Output State: **`a3` is an integer input from the user, `l3` is a list containing integers from the user's input split by spaces.**

The code `a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of space-separated integers as input from the user. It splits the input into a sequence of strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the first integer to `a3` and the rest to the list `l3`. The initial state of other variables remains unchanged.
