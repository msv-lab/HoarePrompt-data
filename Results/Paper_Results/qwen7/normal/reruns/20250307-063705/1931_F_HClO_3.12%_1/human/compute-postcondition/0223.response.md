Postcondition: `m` is 5, `idx1` is either 1 or 0 or -1, `idx2` is either 1 or 0 or -1, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 1 or 0, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and if `l1[1 + p1] != l2[1 + p2]`, then `idx1` remains unchanged and `idx2` is set to 1. If `l1[1 + p1] == l2[1 + p2]`, then `idx1` is set to 1 and `idx2` is set to 1.
