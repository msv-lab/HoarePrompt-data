Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each involving two lists of integers. For each test case, it checks if one list can be transformed into the other by swapping occurrences of specific elements (a1 and a2) while maintaining the relative order of other elements. If the transformation is possible, it prints 'yes'; otherwise, it prints 'no'. Additionally, it records the sequence of operations performed during the transformation process in a list called `val`.**
