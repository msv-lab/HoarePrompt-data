Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the input split by spaces, `m` is 1, `a1` is the first integer from the input split by spaces, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input split by spaces excluding any occurrences of `a2`, `a2` is the second integer from the input split by spaces, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the input split by spaces, `l22` is a list of elements in `l2` excluding `a1`, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1.**

The code initializes two variables, `idx1` and `idx2`, both set to -1. This does not affect any of the existing values of the other variables. Therefore, the output state retains all the original conditions and values, updating only the new variables `idx1` and `idx2` to -1.
