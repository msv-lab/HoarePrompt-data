### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually. It reads the values of `n` and `m` (number of participants and number of screenshots, respectively).

2. **Single Screenshot Case**: For the case where only one screenshot is provided (`m == 1`), the program prints "yes" without further checks. This is correct because a single screenshot can trivially match any order if we consider the user's perspective.

3. **Multiple Screenshots Comparison**: When multiple screenshots are provided, the program compares the positions of the first element in each screenshot. If the positions do not match, it immediately prints "no". This is a crucial step to ensure that the orders can be consistent across all screenshots.

4. **Index Matching**: The program attempts to find matching indices for the first elements in the screenshots. If a match is found, it inserts the first element into the appropriate position in one of the lists. This ensures that the relative order of other elements remains consistent.

5. **Additional Queries**: For cases where more than two screenshots are provided, the program makes additional queries to resolve inconsistencies. If the additional queries confirm that the lists can be transformed into each other, it prints "yes"; otherwise, it prints "no".

6. **Output Validation**: The program ensures that the final output is consistent with the conditions specified in the problem statement. It prints "yes" if the lists can be transformed into each other, and "no" otherwise.

Given the above points, the program logic aligns with the problem requirements and handles all edge cases appropriately.
