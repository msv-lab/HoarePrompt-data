Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, `idx2` is 2, and `p2` is 1.**

The code assigns the value `1` to the variable `p2`. Since no other variables are affected, their previous states remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `p2` and retains the conditions and values of the other variables from the initial state.
