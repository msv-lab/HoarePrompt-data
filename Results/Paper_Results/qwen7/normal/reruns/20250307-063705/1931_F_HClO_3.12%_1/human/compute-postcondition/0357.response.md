Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case involves the variable `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n - 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n - 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
   - `i` is 0.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 0, for the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 to become 1.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop body based on the given information.

5. **Final state**:
   - `i` should be 1.
   - `n` remains the same (must be greater than or equal to 1).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1**
