Postcondition: `m` must be greater than 3, `val` must contain exactly `m-2` tuples, and `l3` is a list that either does not contain any elements that are present in `l` except for `a3`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or there is no additional condition since there is no else part specified.
