Reasoning:
1. The provided program aims to determine if there is a consistent order of participants that matches all the given screenshots.
2. The program processes each test case separately, handling the case where only one screenshot is provided (`m == 1`) by directly printing 'yes'.
3. For more than one screenshot, the program attempts to align the positions of specific elements (`a1` and `a2`) in both lists to see if they can be transformed into each other.
4. The logic for transforming the lists involves checking if the positions of `a1` and `a2` can be swapped without disrupting the relative order of other elements.
5. The program correctly handles the case where the initial elements do not match by inserting them at the appropriate positions.
6. The program also correctly handles additional screenshots by ensuring that the transformations remain consistent across all screenshots.
7. The program uses a list `val` to record the sequence of operations, which is not directly relevant to the final output but helps in debugging and understanding the transformation process.

Given the detailed logic and the steps involved in the program, it appears to correctly implement the solution as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
