Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `_` and `m`.
2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `m - 2` times.
3. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `a3` is an integer, `l3` is a list of integers, `val` is a list containing two tuples where the first tuple is `(a3, l3)`, and `m` must be greater than 2.
4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop runs `m - 2` times, after the previous iteration, the loop has run `m - 3` times.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, it needs to run `m - 2` times in total.
   - Therefore, `m` must be decreased by 1 to allow the loop to run one more time.

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`a3` is an integer, `l3` is a list of integers, `val` is a list containing two tuples where the first tuple is (a3, l3), and `m` must be greater than 3**.
