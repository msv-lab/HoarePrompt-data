Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the input split by spaces, `m` is 1, `a1` is the first integer from the input split by spaces, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input split by spaces excluding any occurrences of `a2`, `a2` is the second integer from the input split by spaces, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the input split by spaces, `l22` is a list of elements in `l2` excluding `a1`, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0.**

The code initializes two variables, `p1` and `p2`, both to 0. No other changes are made to the existing variables. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l22`, `idx1`, and `idx2` remain unchanged.
