Postcondition: **`val` is an empty list, `n` is an integer from the first input split, `m` is an integer from the second input split, `a1` is the first integer from the input split, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input split excluding the second integer (`a2`), `a2` is the second integer from the input split, and `l2` is a list containing the rest of the integers from the input split, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding `a1`. If `l11` is not equal to `l22`, then `m` remains the same and there are 0 iterations left to run. If `l11` is equal to `l22`, then the state of the variables does not change.**
