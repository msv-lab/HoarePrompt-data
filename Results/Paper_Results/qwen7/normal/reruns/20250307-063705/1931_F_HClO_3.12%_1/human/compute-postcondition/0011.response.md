Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the input split by spaces, `m` is 1, `a1` is the first integer from the input split by spaces, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input split by spaces, `a2` is the second integer from the input split by spaces, and `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `a2, *l2 = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each element to an integer. The first element is assigned to `a2`, and the rest are unpacked into `l2`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, and `l1`) remain unchanged.
