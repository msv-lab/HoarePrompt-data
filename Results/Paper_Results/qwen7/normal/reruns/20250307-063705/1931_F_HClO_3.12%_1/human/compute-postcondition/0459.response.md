Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes inputs (n and k) that are derived from a list of screenshots, where each screenshot is represented as a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n, inclusive, and all authors of the screenshots are unique. The function returns information based on the values of n and k, which are constraints on the list.**

This means the function indirectly accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, through the structure of the input data (a list of screenshots), and returns a result based on these parameters.
