Output State: `a3` is an integer converted from each of the three user inputs, `l3` is a list of integers converted from the remaining parts of each user input, `val` is a list containing three tuples where each tuple consists of an `a3` and its corresponding `l3`. The variable `m` must be greater than 3 after all iterations of the loop have completed.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `val` will contain three tuples, each representing the `a3` and `l3` from each of the three user inputs. The value of `m` will reflect the total number of iterations, which is `m - 2` (since the loop runs `m - 2` times).
