Output State: **`idx1` is `i`, `idx2` is `i`, `n` is the first integer from the input split by spaces, `m` is 1, `a1` is the first integer from the input split by spaces, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input split by spaces excluding any occurrences of `a2`, `a2` is the second integer from the input split by spaces, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the input split by spaces, `l22` is a list of elements in `l2` excluding `a1`, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the most internal loop or if statement. It does not modify any variable values but indicates that the execution has exited the loop or if statement. All other variables retain their previous values as per the initial state.
