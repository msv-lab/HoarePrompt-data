Output State: **`a3` is the first element of the input split and converted to an integer, `l3` is a list containing the rest of the elements from the input split and converted to integers, `i` is equal to `n-2`, either `idx1` or `idx2` will be set to a value between 0 and `n-2`, inclusive, the values of `p1` and `p2` will be 0, `val` is a list containing one tuple `(a3, l3)`, and `idx1` is greater than or equal to `idx2`.**

The code `val.append((a3, l3))` appends a tuple `(a3, l3)` to the list `val`. This does not affect the values of `a3`, `l3`, `i`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, or the condition involving `idx1` and `idx2`. The list `val` now contains one element, which is the tuple `(a3, l3)`.
