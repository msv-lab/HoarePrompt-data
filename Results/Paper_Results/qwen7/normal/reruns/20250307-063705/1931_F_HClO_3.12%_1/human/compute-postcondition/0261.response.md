Output State: **`m` is 2, `idx1` is either 1 or 0 or -1 and is less than or equal to `idx2`, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 1 or 0, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 3, and `val` is an empty list.**

The `continue` statement does not affect any variable values or the conditions of the variables. It merely moves the control flow to the next iteration of a loop without changing any variable states. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
