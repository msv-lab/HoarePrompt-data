Output State: **`val` is a list containing at least one tuple, and its length is `m-2` where `m` is greater than 3; `l3` is not equal to a list comprehension that generates a list of elements `i` from `l` where `i` is not equal to `a3`; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of `val` or `l3`, nor does it affect the relationship between `m`. It only indicates that the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was inside.
