Output State: **`m` must be greater than 3, `a3` is the first integer from the input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `val` is a list containing three elements: (`a3`, `l3`), and the tuple (`a3`, `l3`) appended to `val`.**

Explanation: The code appends a new tuple `(a3, l3)` to the list `val`. Initially, `val` contains one element, which is the tuple `(a3, l3)`. After executing the code, `val` will contain two elements: the original tuple and the newly appended tuple. All other variables remain unchanged.
