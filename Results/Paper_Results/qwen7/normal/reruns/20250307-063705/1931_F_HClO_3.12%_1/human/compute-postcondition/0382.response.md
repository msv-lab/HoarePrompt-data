Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, `idx1` is 2, `p1` is 1, and either `idx2` is set to 1 or `idx2` remains unchanged, depending on whether `l1[i + p1]` equals `l2[i + p2]`.**

Explanation: The variable `p1` is assigned the value `1`. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `idx1`, and `idx2`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition for `idx2` (whether it is set to 1 or remains unchanged) is still dependent on the comparison between `l1[i + p1]` and `l2[i + p2]`.
