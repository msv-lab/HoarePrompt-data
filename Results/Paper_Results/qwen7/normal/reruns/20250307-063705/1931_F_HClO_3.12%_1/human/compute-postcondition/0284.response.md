The only objects in the loop head are the variable `m` (which is used in the range function), so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute again if `m - 2` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, the loop has executed `m - 2` times, meaning `m - 2` was greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `m - 2` must still be greater than 0, which means `m` must be greater than 2.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`a3` is an integer input from the user, `l3` is a list containing integers from the user's input split by spaces, `val` is a list containing one tuple, where the first element is `a3` and the second element is `l3`, `m` must be greater than 2**
