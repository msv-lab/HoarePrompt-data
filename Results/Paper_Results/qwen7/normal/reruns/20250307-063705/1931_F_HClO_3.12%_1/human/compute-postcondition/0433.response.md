Output State: **`m` must be greater than 3, `a3` is an integer from the input converted to int, `l3` is a list of integers from the input converted to int, `val` is a list containing two tuples: (a3, l3)**

Explanation: The code appends a new tuple `(a3, l3)` to the list `val`. Initially, `val` contains one tuple `(a3, l3)`. After executing `val.append((a3, l3))`, `val` now contains two tuples: the original one and the newly appended one. All other variables remain unchanged.
