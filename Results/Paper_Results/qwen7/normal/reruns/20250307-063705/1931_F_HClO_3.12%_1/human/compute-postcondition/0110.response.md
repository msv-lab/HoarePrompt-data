Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the input split by spaces, `m` is 2, `a1` is the first integer from the input split by spaces, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input split by spaces excluding any occurrences of `a2`, `a2` is the second integer from the input split by spaces, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the input split by spaces, `l22` is a list of elements in `l2` excluding `a1`, `idx1` is either 2 or -1, `idx2` is either 2 or -1, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is the third integer from the input split by spaces, `l3` is a list containing the rest of the integers from the input split by spaces, `l` is `l1` after inserting `a1` at the position specified by `idx2`.**

The code `l = l1` simply assigns the list `l1` to the variable `l`. This does not change the contents of `l1`, but merely changes the reference of `l` to point to `l1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
