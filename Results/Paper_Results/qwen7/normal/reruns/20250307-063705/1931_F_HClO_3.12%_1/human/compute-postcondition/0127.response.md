Output State: **`m` must be greater than 3, `a3` is the first integer from the input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `val` is a list containing one tuple, the first element of which is `a3` and the second element is `l3`.**

Explanation: The code splits the input into multiple parts using `map(int, input().split())`. It assigns the first part to `a3` and the rest to `l3` as a list. The initial conditions for `m` and `val` remain unchanged.
