Output State: **`m` is 2, `idx1` is either 1 or 0 or -1 and is less than or equal to `idx2`, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 1 or 0, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 3, `val` is updated to a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, and `a3` is the first element of this list while `l3` is a list containing the rest of the elements.**

Explanation: The code `a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())` takes a line of input split by spaces, converts each part to an integer, and assigns the first part to `a3` and the rest to `l3`. The initial values of other variables remain unchanged.
