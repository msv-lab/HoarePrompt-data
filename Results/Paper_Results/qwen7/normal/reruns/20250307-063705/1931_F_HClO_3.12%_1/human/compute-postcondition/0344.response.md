Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `idx1` is 0, `p1` is 1, the element at index `i + p1` in list `l1` is equal to `a2`, the element at index `i + p2` in list `l2` is not equal to the element at index `i + p1` in list `l1`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value 1 to the variable `p1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the updated state includes the new value of `p1` while keeping the rest of the conditions and values intact.
