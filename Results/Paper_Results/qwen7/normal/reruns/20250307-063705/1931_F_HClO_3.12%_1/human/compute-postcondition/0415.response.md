Output State: **`a3` is the first element of the input split and converted to an integer, `l3` is a list containing the rest of the elements from the input split and converted to integers, `i` is equal to `n-2`, `idx1` or `idx2` will be set to a value between 0 and `n-2`, inclusive, the values of `p1` and `p2` will be 0, `val` is an empty list, and `idx1` is greater than or equal to `idx2`; `l1` now contains the element `a1` inserted at index `idx2`, `a1` and `a2` are elements in `l3`, and the current index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the current index of `a2` in `l3`.**

In this output state, the list `l1` has had the element `a1` inserted at index `idx2`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged from the initial state.
