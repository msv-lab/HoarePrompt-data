Output State: **An input is taken but not assigned to any variable, m must be greater than or equal to 5, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**

The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next one. Since no variables are assigned or modified within the scope of the `continue` statement, their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
