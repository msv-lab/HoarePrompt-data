Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, `idx1` is 2, `idx2` is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since no variables are modified by the `break` statement, their previous values remain unchanged.
