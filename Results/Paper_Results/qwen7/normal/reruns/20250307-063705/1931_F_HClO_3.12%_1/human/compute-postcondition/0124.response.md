Output State: **`m` must be greater than 3, `a3` is an integer converted from the input, `l3` is a list of integers converted from the input, `val` is a list containing one tuple `(a3, l3)`**

Explanation: The code `a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer. The first element is assigned to `a3`, and the rest are collected into a list `l3`. The precondition that `m` must be greater than 3 remains unchanged. The `val` list, which initially contained a tuple `(a3, l3)`, now contains the updated values of `a3` and `l3` after conversion.
