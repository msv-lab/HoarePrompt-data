Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head is `for _ in range(m - 2):`. The only variable involved here is `m`.

2. **Determine Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   The loop will execute as long as `m - 2` is greater than 0. This means `m` must be at least 3 (since `m - 2 > 0` implies `m > 2`).

3. **List of Variables to Adjust:**
   - `m`: This is the only variable in the loop head that affects the loop execution.

4. **Other Variables:**
   - `t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l22`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `val`, and `l` are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Final State Adjustment:

Given the above analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `m` being greater than 2.

### Final Answer:

State: **`m` must be greater than 2**
