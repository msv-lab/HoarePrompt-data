Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the first integer input split from input().split(), `m` is 1, and an empty line is read from input()**.

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, and the state of reading an empty line remain unchanged.
