Output State: **`m` is 5, `idx1` is either 0 or -1, `idx2` is `i`, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 1 or 0, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1.**

Explanation: The variable `idx2` is assigned the value of `i`. The value of `i` is 1, so `idx2` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
