Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `idx2` is 0, the element at index `i + 1` in list `l1` is not equal to the element at index `i + p2` in list `l2`, and `l1[i + 1]` is not equal to `a2`, `p2` is 1**.

Explanation: The code `p2 = 1` assigns the value 1 to the variable `p2`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions. Specifically, `n` remains greater than or equal to 1, `i` remains 0, `idx2` remains 0, and the condition regarding the elements in lists `l1` and `l2` remains unchanged.
