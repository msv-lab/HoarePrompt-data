Output State: **After the loop executes all its iterations, `a3` will be a list of integers, each corresponding to an input from the user during each iteration of the loop, `l3` will also be a list of lists, where each sublist corresponds to the remaining elements of the input after converting the first element to an integer. `val` will be a list containing tuples, with each tuple consisting of an `a3` value and its corresponding `l3` list. The length of `val` will be `m-2`, and `m` must be greater than 3.**

This means that for each of the `m-2` iterations of the loop, the user inputs a series of space-separated integers. The first integer is stored as `a3`, and the rest are stored as a list `l3`. These pairs `(a3, l3)` are appended to the list `val`. After all iterations, `val` will contain `m-2` such tuples.
