Output State: **`idx1` is `i`, `n` is the first integer from the input split by spaces, `m` is 1, `a1` is the first integer from the input split by spaces, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input split by spaces excluding any occurrences of `a2`, `a2` is the second integer from the input split by spaces, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the input split by spaces, `l22` is a list of elements in `l2` excluding `a1`, `idx2` is either 2 or -1, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1.**

Explanation: The line `idx1 = i` assigns the value of `i` to `idx1`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged as per the initial state.
