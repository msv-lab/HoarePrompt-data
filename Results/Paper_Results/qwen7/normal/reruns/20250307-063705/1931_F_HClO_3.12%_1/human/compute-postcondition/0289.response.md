Output State: **`a3` is an integer converted from the first input, `l3` is a list of integers converted from the remaining inputs, `val` is a list containing two tuples where the first tuple is (`a3`, `l3`), and `m` must be greater than 3.**

Explanation: The code `val.append((a3, l3))` appends a new tuple `(a3, l3)` to the list `val`. Since `val` initially contained one tuple, after appending, it now contains two tuples. All other variables remain unchanged.
