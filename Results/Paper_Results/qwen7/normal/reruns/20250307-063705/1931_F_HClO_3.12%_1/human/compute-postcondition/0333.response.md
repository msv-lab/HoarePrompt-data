Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, the current value of `i` plus the maximum of `p1` and `p2` equals `n - 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block where the condition `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1` was being checked. The values of `n`, `i`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged, and the break indicates that we exit the loop or conditional block.
