Postcondition: `m` is 5, `idx1` is either 1 or 0 or -1, `idx2` is either 1 or 0 or -1, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 1 or 0, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and if `l1[1 + p1] == a2 and l2[1 + p2] == a1`, then `idx1` and `idx2` are both set to 1, otherwise `idx1` is set to 1 if `l1[1 + p1] == a2`, or `idx2` is set to 1 if `l2[1 + p2] == a1`.
