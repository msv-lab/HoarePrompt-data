Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, `idx1` is 2, and either `idx2` is set to 1 or `idx2` remains unchanged, depending on whether `l1[i + p1]` equals `l2[i + p2]`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `i` (which is 2) to `idx1`. The conditions for `idx2` remain unchanged because they depend on the comparison `l1[i + p1] == l2[i + p2]`, which is not altered by the given code. The precondition that `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1` leading to a break is also not affected by this assignment.
