Postcondition: `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0. If the element at index `i + p1` in list `l1` is equal to `a2` and the element at index `i + p2` in list `l2` is equal to `a1`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `p2` is 1, and either `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative indices leading to breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement, or the element at index `i + 1` in list `l1` is not equal to the element at index `i + p2` in list `l2`, and `l1[i + 1]` is not equal to `a2`.
