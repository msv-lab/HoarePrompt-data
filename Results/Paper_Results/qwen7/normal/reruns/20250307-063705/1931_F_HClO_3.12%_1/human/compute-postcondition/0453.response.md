Output State: **`m` must be greater than 3, `val` must contain exactly `m-4` tuples, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block defined in the given code snippet, the only effect is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. The values of `m`, `val`, `a3`, and `l3` remain unchanged.
