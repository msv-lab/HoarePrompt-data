State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the input split by spaces, `m` is 1, `a1` is the first integer from the input split by spaces, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input split by spaces excluding any occurrences of `a2`, `a2` is the second integer from the input split by spaces, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the input split by spaces, `l22` is a list of elements in `l2` excluding `a1`, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop variable `i` is initialized to 0 by default when using `range(n - 1)`.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be incremented to 1, making the condition `i < n - 1` true.
3. The value of `n` must be greater than 1 to ensure there is at least one iteration of the loop.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` to 1 and `n` to be greater than 1.
