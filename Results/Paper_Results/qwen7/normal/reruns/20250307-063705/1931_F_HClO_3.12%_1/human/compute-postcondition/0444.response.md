Postcondition: `m` must be greater than 3, `val` must contain exactly `m-2` tuples, and `l3` is a list that either does not contain any elements that are present in `l` except for `a3`, or there is no else part, meaning the condition `l3 != [i for i in l if i != a3]` did not change the state of `l3`.
