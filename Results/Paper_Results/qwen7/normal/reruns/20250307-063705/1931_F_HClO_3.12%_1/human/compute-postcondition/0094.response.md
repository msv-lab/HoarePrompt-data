Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the input split by spaces, `m` is 1, `a1` is the first integer from the input split by spaces, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input split by spaces excluding any occurrences of `a2`, `a2` is the second integer from the input split by spaces, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the input split by spaces, `l22` is a list of elements in `l2` excluding `a1`, `idx1` is 2, `idx2` is either 2 or -1, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `val` is an empty list, and `l2` has `a2` inserted at index `idx1`.**

Explanation: The code `l2.insert(idx1, a2)` inserts the value of `a2` into the list `l2` at the index specified by `idx1`, which is 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
