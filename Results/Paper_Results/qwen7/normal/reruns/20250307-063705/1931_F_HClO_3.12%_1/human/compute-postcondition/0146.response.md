Postcondition: `m` must be greater than 3, `a3` is the first element of the next tuple in `val`, `l3` is the second element of the next tuple in `val`. If `l3` is not equal to a list comprehension excluding `a3` from `l`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l3` is equal to the list comprehension, the postcondition remains unchanged.
