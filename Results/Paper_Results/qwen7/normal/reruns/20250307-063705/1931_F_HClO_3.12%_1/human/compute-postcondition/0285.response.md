Output State: **`a3` is an integer, `l3` is a list of integers, `val` is a list containing one tuple where the first element is `a3` and the second element is `l3`, `m` must be greater than 2.**

Explanation: The code `a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input from the user, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer. The first element is assigned to `a3`, and the rest are assigned to `l3` as a list. The value of `val` remains unchanged as it was defined previously. The condition for `m` to be greater than 2 is still valid.
