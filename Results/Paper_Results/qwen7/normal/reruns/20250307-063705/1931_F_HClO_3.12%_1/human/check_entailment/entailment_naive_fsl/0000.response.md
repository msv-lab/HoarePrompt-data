Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the order of participants in the screenshots is inconsistent with the given constraints. Specifically, the program assumes that if the first elements of two consecutive screenshots are different, then the orders must be adjusted accordingly. However, this assumption is not always valid.

Consider the following test case:

Input:
```
3 3
1 2 3
2 3 1
3 1 2
```

Expected Output:
```
YES
```

However, the program will output `NO` because it incorrectly checks the positions of the first elements and does not properly validate the entire order of participants across all screenshots.

To correctly solve this problem, the program needs to ensure that the order of participants in each screenshot matches the order in the final consistent order. This requires a more thorough validation of the order across all screenshots, not just the first elements.
