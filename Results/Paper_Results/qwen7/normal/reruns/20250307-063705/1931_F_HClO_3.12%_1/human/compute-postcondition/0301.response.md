Postcondition: `val` is a list containing at least one tuple (one less tuple than before), and its length is `m-3` where `m` is greater than 3; and if `l3` is not equal to a list comprehension that generates a list of elements `i` from `l` where `i` is not equal to `a3`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
