Output State: **`a3` is the first element of the input split and converted to an integer, `l3` is a list containing the rest of the elements from the input split and converted to integers, `i` is equal to `n-2`, `idx1` or `idx2` will be set to a value between 0 and `n-2`, inclusive, the values of `p1` and `p2` will be 0, `val` is an empty list, and `idx1` is greater than or equal to `idx2`; `l` now contains an additional element `a2` at index `idx1`.**

Explanation: The line `l = l2` simply assigns the value of `l2` to the variable `l`. This does not change the values of any other variables. The conditions and values of the other variables remain the same as they were in the initial state.
