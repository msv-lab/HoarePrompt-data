Output State: **`i` is equal to `n-2`, `idx1` is set to a value between 0 and `n-2`, inclusive, `p1` and `p2` are both 0, `val` is an empty list, and `l` is now equal to `l2`.**

Explanation: The line `l = l2` assigns the value of `l2` to the variable `l`. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the values of `i`, `idx1`, `p1`, `p2`, and `val` remain unchanged, while `l` now holds the same value as `l2`.
