Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `idx1` is 0, `idx2` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code `break` is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. Since there is no loop or conditional block specified in the given code snippet, the only effect is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we might be inside. The values of the variables `n`, `i`, `idx1`, and `idx2` remain unchanged.
