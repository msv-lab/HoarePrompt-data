Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the input split by spaces, `m` is 1, `a1` is the first integer from the input split by spaces, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input split by spaces excluding any occurrences of `a2`, `a2` is the second integer from the input split by spaces, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the input split by spaces, `l22` is a list of elements in `l2` excluding `a1`, `idx1` is 2, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, and `i` is 2.**

Explanation: The code `idx1 = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 2) to `idx1`. All other variables remain unchanged. The condition `(l1[i + p1] == a2)` being true before the code execution means that `l1[2 + 0] == a2` was true, which does not affect the final state since `i` is updated to 2.
