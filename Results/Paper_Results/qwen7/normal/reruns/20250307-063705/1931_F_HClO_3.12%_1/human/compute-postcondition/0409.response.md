Output State: **`i` is equal to `n-2`, either `idx1` or `idx2` will be set to a value between 0 and `n-2`, inclusive, the values of `p1` and `p2` will be 0, `val` is an empty list, and `idx1` is greater than or equal to `idx2`. Additionally, `m` is equal to 2, and we continue the loop or iteration we were in.**

The `continue` statement causes the flow of the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by the `continue` statement, their previous values remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the same conditions as the initial state, with the addition that the loop continues.
