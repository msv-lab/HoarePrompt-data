Output State: **`m` is 1, `idx1` is either 1 or 0 or -1 and is less than or equal to `idx2`, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 1 or 0, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 3, `val` is a list of tuples where the first tuple contains `a3` and `l3`, `a3` is the first element of the list obtained from the input split by spaces, `l3` is a list containing the rest of the elements, `a1` and `a2` are undefined in this context, `l` is unchanged.**

The value of `m` is decremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
