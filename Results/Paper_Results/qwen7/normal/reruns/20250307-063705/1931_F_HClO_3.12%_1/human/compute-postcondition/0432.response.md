Output State: **`m` must be greater than 3, `a3` is an integer from the input converted to int, `l3` is a list of integers from the input converted to int, `val` is a list containing one tuple `(a3, l3)`**

Explanation: The code `a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the first element to `a3` and the rest to `l3` as a list. The initial conditions for `m` and `val` remain unchanged. Therefore, `m` must still be greater than 3, `a3` now holds the first integer from the input converted to an integer, `l3` holds the remaining integers from the input converted to integers, and `val` remains a list containing one tuple `(a3, l3)`.
