Postcondition: `i` is `n-2` or `n-3`, `idx1` is greater than or equal to `idx2`, `p1` and `p2` are both 0, `val` is a list containing zero or one tuple. If `idx1` is greater than `idx2`, then `idx2` is updated to insert `a1` at its position, and `l` is now equal to `l1`. Otherwise, `a3` is the first element of the input split and converted to an integer, `l3` is a list containing the rest of the elements from the input split and converted to integers, and `val` is a list containing one tuple `(a3, l3)`.
