Based on the initial state provided:

- `m` must be greater than 3.
- `val` must contain exactly `m-2` tuples.
- `l3` is a list that does not contain any elements that are present in `l` except for `a3`.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print('no')
```

This `print` statement simply outputs the string `'no'` regardless of the values of `m`, `val`, and `l3`. Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **no**
