Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the input split by spaces, `m` is 2, `a1` is the first integer from the input split by spaces, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input split by spaces excluding any occurrences of `a2`, `a2` is the second integer from the input split by spaces, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the input split by spaces, `l22` is a list of elements in `l2` excluding `a1`, `idx1` is either 2 or -1, `idx2` is either 2 or -1, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is the third integer from the input split by spaces, and `l3` is a list containing the rest of the integers from the input split by spaces. Additionally, the index of `a1` in `l3` is greater than or equal to the index of `a2` in `l3`. `l2` now has the element `a2` inserted at the position specified by `idx1`, and `l` is now equal to `l2`.**

Explanation: The line `l = l2` assigns the value of `l2` to `l`. This does not change the values of any other variables but updates `l` to be the same as `l2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
