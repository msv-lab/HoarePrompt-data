Postcondition: `m` is 5 or 1, `idx1` is either 1 or 0 or -1, `idx2` is either 1 or 0 or -1, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 1 or 0, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 3, `val` is a list of tuples or an empty list, `a1` and `a2` are undefined, `l` is either a reference to `l1` or unchanged. If `idx1` is greater than `idx2`, `a1` is inserted at index `idx2` in `l1` and `l` is a reference to `l1`. Otherwise, `m` is set to 1, and `val` is a list of tuples where the first tuple contains `a3` and `l3`, with `a3` being the first element of the list obtained from the input split by spaces and `l3` being a list containing the rest of the elements.
