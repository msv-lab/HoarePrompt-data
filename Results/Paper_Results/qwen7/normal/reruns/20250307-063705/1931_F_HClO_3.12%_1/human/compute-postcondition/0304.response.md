Based on the initial state provided:

- `val` is a list containing at least one tuple.
- The length of `val` is `m-4`, where `m` is greater than 3.
- `a3` and `l3` are the values of the third tuple in `val`.

The code snippet is simply:
```python
print('no')
```

This `print` statement will output the string `'no'` regardless of the values of `val`, `a3`, and `l3`.

Output: **'no'**
