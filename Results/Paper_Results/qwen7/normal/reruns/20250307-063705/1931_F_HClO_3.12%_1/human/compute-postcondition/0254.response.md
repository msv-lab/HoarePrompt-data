Output State: **`m` is 5, `idx1` is either 1 or 0 or -1, `idx2` is either 1 or 0 or -1, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 1 or 0, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 3, `val` is an empty list, `a1` is inserted at index `idx2` in list `l1`, and `idx1` is greater than `idx2`.**

Explanation: The code `l1.insert(idx2, a1)` inserts the element `a1` into the list `l1` at the index specified by `idx2`. Since the exact value of `a1` is not provided, it remains as `a1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
