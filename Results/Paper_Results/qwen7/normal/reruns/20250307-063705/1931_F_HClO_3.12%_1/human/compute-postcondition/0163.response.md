Output State: **`m` must be greater than 2, `a3` is the third integer from the input, `l3` is the list of integers from the input starting from the fourth integer, `val` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer and a list of integers corresponding to the inputs provided during each iteration of the loop, `n` is the first integer from the input, `a1` is the second integer from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the input split and converted to an integer, `l11` is a list of integers from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding `a1`, an empty string is taken as input.**

The `input()` function is called without any arguments, which means it will take an input from the user and return it as a string. This string is not assigned to any variable, so the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The output state includes the fact that an empty string was taken as input.
