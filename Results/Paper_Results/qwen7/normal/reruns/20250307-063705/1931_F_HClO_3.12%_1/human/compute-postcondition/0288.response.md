Output State: **`a3` is an integer converted from the first input, `l3` is a list of integers converted from the remaining inputs, `val` is a list containing one tuple where the first element is `a3` and the second element is `l3`, and `m` must be greater than 3.**

Explanation: The code `a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts them to integers, and assigns the first element to `a3` and the rest to `l3` as a list. The variable `val` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. The condition for `m` being greater than 3 is still valid.
