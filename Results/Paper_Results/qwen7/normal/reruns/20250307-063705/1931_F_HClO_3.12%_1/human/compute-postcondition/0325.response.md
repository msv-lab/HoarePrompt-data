Output State: **An input is taken, `m` remains the same, 0 iterations left to run, input() function is called.**

Natural Language Description: After the loop has executed all its iterations, which is `m-2` times, the following conditions are met: an input is taken, the value of `m` remains unchanged from its initial value, there are no iterations left to run (since `m-2` iterations have been completed), and the `input()` function is called once more before the loop ends.
