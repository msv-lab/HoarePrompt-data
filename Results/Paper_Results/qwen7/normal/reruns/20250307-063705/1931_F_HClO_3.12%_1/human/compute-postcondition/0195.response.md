Postcondition: `m` is 5, `idx1` is either 0 or -1, `idx2` is either 0 or -1, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 1 or 0, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, and the value of `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to the value of `l2[i + p2]`. If `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2`, then `idx1` is 0, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 1, and `p2` is 0. Otherwise, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is 0, `p1` is 0, and `p2` is 1.
