Postcondition: `m` is 5, `idx1` is either 0 or -1, `idx2` is either 0 or -1, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 1 or 0, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, and either `idx1` is greater than or equal to 0 and `idx2` is greater than or equal to 0, leading to breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement, or there is no else part, thus no additional changes to the variables.
