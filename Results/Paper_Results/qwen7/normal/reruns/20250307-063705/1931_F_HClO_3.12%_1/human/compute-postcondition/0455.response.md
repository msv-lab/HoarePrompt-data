Postcondition: `m` must be greater than 3, `val` must contain exactly `m-4` tuples, and if `l3` is not equal to a list comprehension excluding `a3` from `l`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition `l3 != [i for i in l if i != a3]` is false, no changes occur to `val`, `m`, `a3`, and `l3`.
