Based on the initial state provided:

- `m` must be greater than 3.
- `val` must contain exactly `m-3` tuples.
- `l3` is a list that either does not contain any elements that are present in `l` except for `a3`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or there is no additional condition since there is no else part specified.

The print statement simply outputs the string `'no'`.

Output: **no**
