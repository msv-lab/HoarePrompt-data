Output State: **`a3` is the first element of the input split and converted to an integer, `l3` is a list containing the rest of the elements from the input split and converted to integers, `i` is equal to `n-3`, `m` is decreased by 1, `idx1` is greater than or equal to `idx2`, the values of `p1` and `p2` will be 0, `val` is a list containing one tuple `(a3, l3)`**.

Explanation: The variable `m` is decremented by 1, changing its value from `n-2` to `n-3`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
