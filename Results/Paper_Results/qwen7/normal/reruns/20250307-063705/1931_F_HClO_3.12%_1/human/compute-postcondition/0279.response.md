Postcondition: `m` is 5, `idx1` is either 1 or 0 or -1, `idx2` is either 1 or 0 or -1, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 1 or 0, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 3, `val` is an empty list. If `idx1` is less than `idx2`, `a2` is inserted at index `idx1` in list `l2`. Otherwise, `a1` is inserted at index `idx2` in list `l1`, or `m` is 1, `idx1` is either 1 or 0 or -1 and is less than or equal to `idx2`, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 1 or 0, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 3, `val` is a list of tuples where the first tuple contains `a3` and `l3`, `a3` is the first element of the list obtained from the input split by spaces, `l3` is a list containing the rest of the elements, `a1` and `a2` are undefined in this context, `l` is unchanged.
