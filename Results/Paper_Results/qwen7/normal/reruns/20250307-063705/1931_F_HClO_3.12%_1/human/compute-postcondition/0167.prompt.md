Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `m` is at least 5, `a3` is the third integer from the input, `l3` is the list of integers from the input starting from the fourth integer, `val` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer and a list of integers corresponding to the inputs provided during each iteration of the loop, `n` is the first integer from the input, `a1` is the second integer from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the input split and converted to an integer, `l11` is a list of integers from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding `a1`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m - 2):
    input()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `m` must be greater than 2, `a3` is the third integer from the input, `l3` is the list of integers from the input starting from the fourth integer, `val` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer and a list of integers corresponding to the inputs provided during each iteration of the loop, `n` is the first integer from the input, `a1` is the second integer from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the input split and converted to an integer, `l11` is a list of integers from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding `a1`, an input is taken.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `m` must be greater than 2, `a3` is the third integer from the input, `l3` is the list of integers from the input starting from the fourth integer, `val` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer and a list of integers corresponding to the inputs provided during each iteration of the loop, `n` is the first integer from the input, `a1` is the second integer from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the input split and converted to an integer, `l11` is a list of integers from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding `a1`, an empty string is taken as input.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `m` must be greater than 2, `a3` is the third integer from the input, `l3` is the list of integers from the input starting from the fourth integer, `val` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer and a list of integers corresponding to the inputs provided during each iteration of the loop, `n` is the first integer from the input, `a1` is the second integer from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the input split and converted to an integer, `l11` is a list of integers from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding `a1`, an empty string is taken as input, an empty string is inputted.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
