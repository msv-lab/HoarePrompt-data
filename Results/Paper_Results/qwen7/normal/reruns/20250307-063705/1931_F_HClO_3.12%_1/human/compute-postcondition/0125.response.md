Output State: **`m` must be greater than 3, `a3` is an integer converted from the input, `l3` is a list of integers converted from the input, `val` is a list containing two tuples, the first tuple is (`a3`, `l3`)**.

Explanation: The code `val.append((a3, l3))` appends a new tuple `(a3, l3)` to the list `val`. Initially, `val` contains one tuple `(a3, l3)`. After executing the code, `val` will contain two tuples: the original tuple and the newly appended tuple. All other variables remain unchanged.
