Output State: **`m` is 5, `idx1` is either 1 or 0 or -1, `idx2` is either 1 or 0 or -1, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 1 or 0, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 3, `val` is an empty list, `a1` is inserted at index `idx2` in list `l1`, and `idx1` is greater than `idx2`; `l` is now a reference to `l1`.**

Explanation: The line `l = l1` does not modify any variables but instead assigns `l1` to `l`. This means `l` now references the same list as `l1`, but the values of other variables remain unchanged.
