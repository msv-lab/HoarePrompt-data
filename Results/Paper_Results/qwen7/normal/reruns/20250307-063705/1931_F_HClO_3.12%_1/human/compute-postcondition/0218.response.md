Output State: **`m` is 5, `idx1` is either 1 or 0 or -1, `idx2` is either `i` or 0 or -1, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 1 or 0, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it breaks out of the loop or conditional block where `idx1` and `idx2` are being assigned based on the condition `l1[i + p1] == a2`. Since the `break` statement does not modify any variable values, the values of `m`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged. We also note that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
