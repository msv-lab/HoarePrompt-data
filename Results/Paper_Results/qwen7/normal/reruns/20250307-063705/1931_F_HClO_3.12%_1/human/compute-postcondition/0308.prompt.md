Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `a3` will be a list of integers, each corresponding to an input from the user during each iteration of the loop, `l3` will also be a list of lists, where each sublist corresponds to the remaining elements of the input after converting the first element to an integer. `val` will be a list containing tuples, with each tuple consisting of an `a3` value and its corresponding `l3` list. The length of `val` will be `m-2`, and `m` must be greater than 3.
Code of the loop:
for a3, l3 in val:
    if l3 != [i for i in l if i != a3]:
        print('no')
        break
else:
    print('yes')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `val` is a list containing at least one tuple, and its length is `m-2` where `m` is greater than 3; `l3` is not equal to a list comprehension that generates a list of elements `i` from `l` where `i` is not equal to `a3`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `val` is a list containing at least one tuple (one less tuple than before), and its length is `m-3` where `m` is greater than 3; and if `l3` is not equal to a list comprehension that generates a list of elements `i` from `l` where `i` is not equal to `a3`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `val` is a list containing at least one tuple, and its length is `m-4` where `m` is greater than 3; `a3` and `l3` are the values of the next tuple in `val`; if `l3` is not equal to the list comprehension `[i for i in l if i != a3]`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
