Output State: **`m` is 5, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1**

Explanation: The code initializes `idx1` and `idx2` to -1. No other changes are made to the variables, so the values of `m`, `a3`, `l3`, `val`, `n`, `a1`, `a2`, `l11`, `l22`, and the three empty strings remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated values of `idx1` and `idx2`, while keeping the rest of the variables in their initial or unchanged states.
