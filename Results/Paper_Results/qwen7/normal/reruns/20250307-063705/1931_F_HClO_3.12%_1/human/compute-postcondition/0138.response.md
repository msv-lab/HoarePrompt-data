Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head includes the variables `a3`, `l3`, and `val`.

2. **Understand the Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue as long as there are tuples in `val` that satisfy the condition `(a3, l3)`.

3. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `m` must be greater than 3.
   - `a3` is the third integer from the input.
   - `l3` is the list of the remaining integers from the input after the first three integers.
   - `val` must contain at least one tuple.
   - If the current value of `l3` is not equal to the list of all elements in `l` excluding `a3`, the conditions remain unchanged.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues as long as `val` contains tuples, we need to ensure that `val` still contains at least one tuple.
   - `a3` will be updated to the second element of the next tuple in `val`.
   - `l3` will be updated to the second element of the next tuple in `val`.
   - `m` does not change as it is not part of the loop head.

5. **New State for the Next Iteration**:
   - `m` remains greater than 3.
   - `a3` becomes the second element of the next tuple in `val`.
   - `l3` becomes the second element of the next tuple in `val`.
   - `val` must still contain at least one tuple.

Given these points, the new state for the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`m` must be greater than 3, `a3` is the second element of the next tuple in `val`, `l3` is the second element of the next tuple in `val`, and `val` must contain at least one tuple.**
