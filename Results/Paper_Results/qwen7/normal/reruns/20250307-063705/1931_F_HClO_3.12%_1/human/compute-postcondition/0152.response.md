Based on the initial state provided:

- `m` is at least 5.
- `a3` is the third integer from the input.
- `l3` is the list of integers from the input starting from the fourth integer.
- `val` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer and a list of integers corresponding to the inputs provided during each iteration of the loop.
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `m` is the second integer from the input.
- An empty line is read.

The code snippet simply prints the string `'yes'`.

Since no variables or objects within the print statement depend on the initial state provided, the output is straightforward.

Output: **yes**
