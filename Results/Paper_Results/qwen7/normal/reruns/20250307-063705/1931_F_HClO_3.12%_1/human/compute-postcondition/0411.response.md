Postcondition: `i` is equal to `n-2`, either `idx1` or `idx2` will be set to a value between 0 and `n-2`, inclusive, the values of `p1` and `p2` will be 0, `val` is an empty list, and `idx1` is greater than or equal to `idx2`. Additionally, if `m` is equal to 2, the loop or iteration continues as before.
