Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `x` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `y` is an input integer less than or equal to 0, and currently, `y = 0`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(math.ceil(x / 15))
   ```

3. **Analysis**:
   - The expression `x / 15` computes the division of `x` by 15.
   - Since `x` is a positive integer, `x / 15` will result in a floating-point number.
   - The `math.ceil()` function rounds this floating-point number up to the nearest integer.

4. **Value Calculation**:
   - Given that `x > 0`, the smallest possible value for `x` is 1.
   - If `x = 1`, then `x / 15 = 1 / 15 â‰ˆ 0.0667`, and `math.ceil(0.0667) = 1`.
   - For any other positive integer `x`, the result of `x / 15` will be a positive number, and `math.ceil()` will round it up to the next integer.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Since `x` is a positive integer and `y` does not affect the calculation, the output of `math.ceil(x / 15)` will always be 1 for any valid `x`.

Output: **1**
