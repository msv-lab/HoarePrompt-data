Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed for placing the icons. Specifically, the logic in `func_2` has several issues:

1. The calculation of `bxsfory` (which stands for "big x, small for y") is incorrect. It assumes that each 2x2 icon takes up 15 cells, which is not true since a 2x2 icon actually takes up 4 cells. This leads to an incorrect reduction of `x`.

2. The logic for calculating `bxsfory1` (which stands for "big x, small for y, 1") is also flawed. It incorrectly adds 1 to the result of `math.ceil(x / 15)`.

3. The overall logic for determining the minimum number of screens is incorrect. For instance, if there are 12 1x1 icons and 4 2x2 icons, the program incorrectly calculates the number of screens needed.

Here's an example where the program fails:
- Input: `12 4`
- Expected output: `2` (since we can fit 3 2x2 icons in one screen and the remaining 4 1x1 icons in another screen, making a total of 2 screens).
- Actual output: The program outputs a different value due to the incorrect logic.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
