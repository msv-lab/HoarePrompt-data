You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

The solution for the third test case can look as follows:

- Program:
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    return a if a < b else b

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    if x > 0 and y > 0:
        bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)
        x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4
        bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1
        print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)
    elif x == 0 and y > 0:
        print(math.ceil(y / 2))
    elif x > 0 and y == 0:
        print(math.ceil(x / 15))
    else:
        print(0)

#Function 3:
def func_3():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_2()



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 3 : The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it calls another function `func_2()` without any explicit return value. After processing all test cases, the function ensures that the variable `t` remains greater than 0.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed for placing the icons. Specifically, the logic in `func_2` has several issues:

1. The calculation of `bxsfory` (which stands for "big x, small for y") is incorrect. It assumes that each 2x2 icon takes up 15 cells, which is not true since a 2x2 icon actually takes up 4 cells. This leads to an incorrect reduction of `x`.

2. The logic for calculating `bxsfory1` (which stands for "big x, small for y, 1") is also flawed. It incorrectly adds 1 to the result of `math.ceil(x / 15)`.

3. The overall logic for determining the minimum number of screens is incorrect. For instance, if there are 12 1x1 icons and 4 2x2 icons, the program incorrectly calculates the number of screens needed.

Here's an example where the program fails:
- Input: `12 4`
- Expected output: `2` (since we can fit 3 2x2 icons in one screen and the remaining 4 1x1 icons in another screen, making a total of 2 screens).
- Actual output: The program outputs a different value due to the incorrect logic.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
