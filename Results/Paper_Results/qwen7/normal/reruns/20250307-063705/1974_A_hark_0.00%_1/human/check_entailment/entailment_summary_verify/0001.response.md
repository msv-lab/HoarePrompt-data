### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identified the logic in the program and verified it against the provided examples. Let's break down the key points and ensure there are no discrepancies:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is not used in the main logic of the program and can be considered unnecessary. However, its absence does not affect the correctness of the program since it is not referenced anywhere.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function handles different cases based on the presence of 1x1 and 2x2 icons.
   - The logic for calculating the number of screens needed is correct:
     - For both `x` and `y` being positive, it correctly adjusts the number of 1x1 icons after placing 2x2 icons.
     - For only `y` being positive, it correctly calculates the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons.
     - For only `x` being positive, it correctly calculates the number of screens needed for 1x1 icons.
     - For both `x` and `y` being zero, it correctly outputs 0.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases and calls `func_2` for each test case, ensuring the program processes multiple test cases correctly.

Given the detailed verification of the examples provided, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of screens needed for each test case.

### Final Evaluation

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly calculates the minimum number of screens needed for each test case based on the given logic.

Final: **True**
