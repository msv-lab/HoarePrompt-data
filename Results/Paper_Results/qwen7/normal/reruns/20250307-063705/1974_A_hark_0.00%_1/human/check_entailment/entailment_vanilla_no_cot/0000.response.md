Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Let's analyze why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation for `bxsfory`**:
   - The formula `bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)` is used to calculate the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons. However, this calculation is flawed because it doesn't account for the fact that each 2x2 icon takes up 4 cells, and there are 15 cells available per screen (5x3).

2. **Incorrect Handling of Remaining Icons (`x`)**:
   - After calculating the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons, the remaining icons (`x`) should be placed on the next screen. The current logic subtracts `bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` from `x`, which is incorrect. Instead, you should calculate how many 1x1 icons fit into the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons.

3. **Incorrect Calculation for Remaining Space**:
   - The logic `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is incorrect. It should be something like `remaining_cells = 15 * bxsfory + 4 * y` and then calculate how many 1x1 icons fit into the remaining cells.

4. **Incorrect Calculation for Final Screens**:
   - The final number of screens is calculated incorrectly. It should be the sum of the screens needed for 2x2 icons and the screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.

Here is a corrected version of the function `func_2`:

```python
def func_2():
    (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    total_cells = 5 * 3  # Total cells per screen
    screens_for_2x2 = math.ceil(y / 2)
    remaining_cells = total_cells * screens_for_2x2 - y * 4
    screens_for_1x1 = math.ceil((x + remaining_cells) / 15)
    print(screens_for_2x2 + screens_for_1x1)
```

This corrected function properly calculates the number of screens needed for both 2x2 and 1x1 icons.
