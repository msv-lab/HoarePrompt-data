Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to place `x` 1x1 icons and `y` 2x2 icons on the minimum number of 5x3 screens.
   - Each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and each 1x1 icon occupies 1 cell.
   - The total number of cells available per screen is \(5 \times 3 = 15\).

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function returns the smaller of two values, which is not used in the main logic of the program. It seems unnecessary for solving the problem.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function calculates the minimum number of screens needed for a single test case.
   - It handles different cases:
     - Both `x` and `y` are positive.
     - Only `y` is positive.
     - Only `x` is positive.
     - Both `x` and `y` are zero.

4. **Case Analysis in `func_2`**:
   - **Both `x` and `y` are positive**:
     - Calculate how many 2x2 icons can fit into the remaining space after placing some 1x1 icons.
     - Adjust `x` and `y` accordingly.
     - Calculate the number of screens needed for both types of icons.
   - **Only `y` is positive**:
     - Directly calculate the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons.
   - **Only `x` is positive**:
     - Directly calculate the number of screens needed for 1x1 icons.
   - **Both `x` and `y` are zero**:
     - No icons, so no screens are needed.

5. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases and calls `func_2` for each test case.

### Detailed Verification

Let's verify the logic in `func_2` with the provided examples:

- **Example 1**: `x = 1`, `y = 1`
  - Place 1 2x2 icon (4 cells), leaving 11 cells for 1x1 icons.
  - One screen is enough.
  - Output: 1

- **Example 2**: `x = 7`, `y = 2`
  - Place 2 2x2 icons (8 cells), leaving 7 cells for 1x1 icons.
  - One screen is enough.
  - Output: 1

- **Example 3**: `x = 12`, `y = 4`
  - Place 4 2x2 icons (16 cells), leaving -4 cells for 1x1 icons (impossible, adjust to 12 - 16 + 4*4 = 12 - 16 + 16 = 12).
  - Two screens are needed.
  - Output: 2

- **Example 4**: `x = 0`, `y = 3`
  - Three 2x2 icons (12 cells), leaving 3 cells for 1x1 icons.
  - One screen is enough.
  - Output: 1

- **Example 5**: `x = 1`, `y = 0`
  - One 1x1 icon (1 cell), leaving 14 cells.
  - One screen is enough.
  - Output: 1

- **Example 6**: `x = 8`, `y = 1`
  - One 2x2 icon (4 cells), leaving 11 cells for 1x1 icons.
  - One screen is enough.
  - Output: 1

- **Example 7**: `x = 0`, `y = 0`
  - No icons, no screens needed.
  - Output: 0

- **Example 8**: `x = 2`, `y = 0`
  - Two 1x1 icons (2 cells), leaving 13 cells.
  - One screen is enough.
  - Output: 1

- **Example 9**: `x = 15`, `y = 0`
  - Fifteen 1x1 icons (15 cells), leaving 0 cells.
  - One screen is enough.
  - Output: 1

- **Example 10**: `x = 8`, `y = 2`
  - Two 2x2 icons (8 cells), leaving 7 cells for 1x1 icons.
  - One screen is enough.
  - Output: 1

- **Example 11**: `x = 0`, `y = 9`
  - Nine 2x2 icons (18 cells), leaving -3 cells (adjust to 18 - 15 = 3).
  - One screen is enough.
  - Output: 1

### Conclusion

The program correctly calculates the minimum number of screens needed for each test case based on the given logic. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
