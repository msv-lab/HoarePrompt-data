Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. This input represents the number of test cases. The initial values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged as they are not involved in this line of code.
