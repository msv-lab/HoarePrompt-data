Functionality: **The function processes two non-negative integers, `x` and `y`, representing the number of 1 × 1 and 2 × 2 icons, respectively. It calculates and prints the total number of 1 × 1 icons required based on the given conditions. Specifically:
- If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, it calculates the number of 1 × 1 icons needed to match the value of `y` and adjusts `x` accordingly.
- If only `y` is greater than 0, it calculates the number of 1 × 1 icons needed to match `y`.
- If only `x` is greater than 0, it calculates the number of 1 × 1 icons needed to match `x`.
- If neither `x` nor `y` is greater than 0, it prints 0.**
