Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable involved here is `t`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `t` is greater than 0.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: `t` must be greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0. Since no other variables are involved in the loop head, we only need to ensure that `t` remains greater than 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
