Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns the total number of 1 × 1 and 2 × 2 icons combined.**

Given that the function does not accept any parameters (as indicated by the function signature `def func_2():`), the functionality must involve calculating and returning a value based on some internal or external state or logic that is not provided in the given information. However, based on the context provided, it seems the function might be intended to calculate the total number of icons (both 1 × 1 and 2 × 2) but since no parameters are provided, the description focuses on the general intent rather than specific inputs and outputs.
