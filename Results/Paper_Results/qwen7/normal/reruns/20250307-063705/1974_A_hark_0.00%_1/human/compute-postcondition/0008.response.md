Output State: `t` must be greater than 0.

Natural Language Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since the loop runs for all iterations as long as this condition holds true, the final output state after all iterations will still require that `t` must be greater than 0. There are no changes made inside the loop that would affect the value of `t`, so its initial condition remains the same.
