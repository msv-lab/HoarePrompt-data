Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the minimum number of screens needed to place a given number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons on a grid where each screen is 5x3.
2. We have three functions:
   - `func_1`: This function returns the smaller of two integers. It's not used in the main logic but could be part of a larger algorithm.
   - `func_2`: This function processes the input for a single test case and calculates the minimum number of screens required. It correctly handles different scenarios based on the presence of 1x1 and 2x2 icons.
   - `func_3`: This function reads the number of test cases and calls `func_2` for each test case. It ensures that the input and output handling are correct.

Given the problem statement and the execution summaries, let's verify the correctness of the functions:
- `func_1` is not directly used in the solution but could be useful in some parts of the logic.
- `func_2` correctly calculates the number of screens needed based on the given conditions:
  - If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, it calculates the number of 1x1 icons needed to match the value of `y` and adjusts `x` accordingly.
  - If only `y` is greater than 0, it calculates the number of 1x1 icons needed to match `y`.
  - If only `x` is greater than 0, it calculates the number of 1x1 icons needed to match `x`.
  - If neither `x` nor `y` is greater than 0, it prints 0.
- `func_3` correctly processes multiple test cases by calling `func_2` for each test case.

Since all functions together meet the requirements of the problem, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
