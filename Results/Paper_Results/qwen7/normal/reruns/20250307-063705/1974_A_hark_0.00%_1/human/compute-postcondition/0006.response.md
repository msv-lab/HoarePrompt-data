Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0**

Explanation: The function `func_2()` is called, but since no specific implementation of `func_2()` is provided, we cannot determine any changes to the variables. The only precondition that remains valid is that `t` must be greater than 0. All other variables remain in their initial state.
