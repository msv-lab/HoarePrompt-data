Postcondition: `x` is an input integer and `y` is an input integer. If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is greater than 0, and additionally `x` is greater than `bxsfory` * 15 + `y` * 4 where `bxsfory` is the ceiling value of `y` divided by 2, then specific conditions related to `x` and `y` are met as per the if part. Otherwise, either `x` is less than or equal to 0 or `y` is greater than 0.
