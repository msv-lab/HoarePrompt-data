Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

    2 0
    
    15 0
    
    8 2
    
    0 9

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

The solution for the third test case can look as follows:

# Annotated Functions:
import math

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_3()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative integers representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.
def func_1(a, b):
    return a if a < b else b
    #The program returns the smaller value between 'a' and 'b', where 'a' represents the number of 1x1 icons and 'b' represents the number of 2x2 icons.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two non-negative integer parameters, `a` and `b`, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively. It returns the smaller of the two values. If `a` is less than `b`, it returns `a`; otherwise, it returns `b`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are non-negative integers representing the number of 1 × 1 and 2 × 2 icons, respectively.
def func_2():
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    if (x > 0 and y > 0) :
        bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)
        x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4
        bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1
        print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)
        #This is printed: 1 + (y // 2)
    else :
        if (x == 0 and y > 0) :
            print(math.ceil(y / 2))
            #This is printed: math.ceil(y / 2) (where math.ceil() rounds up y / 2 to the nearest integer)
        else :
            if (x > 0 and y == 0) :
                print(math.ceil(x / 15))
                #This is printed: 1
            else :
                print(0)
                #This is printed: 0
            #State: Postcondition: `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer. If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, then `y` remains 0. Otherwise, `x` is less than or equal to 0 or `y` is greater than 0.
        #State: Postcondition: `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer. If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, then `y` remains greater than 0. Otherwise, `x` is less than or equal to 0 or `y` is greater than 0.
    #State: Postcondition: `x` is an input integer and `y` is an input integer. If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is greater than 0, and additionally `x` is greater than `bxsfory` * 15 + `y` * 4 where `bxsfory` is the ceiling value of `y` divided by 2, then specific conditions related to `x` and `y` are met as per the if part. Otherwise, either `x` is less than or equal to 0 or `y` is greater than 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes two non-negative integers, `x` and `y`, representing the number of 1 × 1 and 2 × 2 icons, respectively. It calculates and prints the total number of 1 × 1 icons required based on the given conditions. Specifically:
- If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, it calculates the number of 1 × 1 icons needed to match the value of `y` and adjusts `x` accordingly.
- If only `y` is greater than 0, it calculates the number of 1 × 1 icons needed to match `y`.
- If only `x` is greater than 0, it calculates the number of 1 × 1 icons needed to match `x`.
- If neither `x` nor `y` is greater than 0, it prints 0.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, x and y are integers representing the number of applications with a 1 × 1 icon and the number of applications with a 2 × 2 icon, respectively.
def func_3():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_2()
        
    #State: Output State: `t` must be greater than 0.
    #
    #Natural Language Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since the loop runs for all iterations as long as this condition holds true, the final output state after all iterations will still require that `t` must be greater than 0. There are no changes made inside the loop that would affect the value of `t`, so its initial condition remains the same.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it calls another function `func_2()` without any explicit return value. After processing all test cases, the function ensures that the variable `t` remains greater than 0.
