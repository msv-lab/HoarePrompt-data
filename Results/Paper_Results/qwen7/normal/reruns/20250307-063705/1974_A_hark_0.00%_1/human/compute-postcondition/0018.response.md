Postcondition: `x` is an input integer and `y` is an input integer. If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is greater than 0, then `x` is greater than 0 - `bxsfory` * 15 + `y` * 4 and `y` is greater than 0, where `bxsfory` is the ceiling value of `y` divided by 2. Otherwise, `x` is less than or equal to 0 or `y` is greater than 0.
