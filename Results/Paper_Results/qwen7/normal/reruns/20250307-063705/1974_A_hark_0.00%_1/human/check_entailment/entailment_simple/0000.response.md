Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly returns the smaller value between `a` and `b`. However, it is not used in the main logic of the program, so it is irrelevant to the correctness of the overall solution.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function is designed to calculate the minimum number of screens needed to place the icons. Let's break down the logic:
   - If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, it calculates the number of screens needed considering the placement of 2x2 icons first and then the remaining 1x1 icons.
   - If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, it calculates the number of screens needed just for 2x2 icons.
   - If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, it calculates the number of screens needed just for 1x1 icons.
   - If both `x` and `y` are 0, it prints 0, which is correct since no screens are needed.

3. **Function `func_3`**: This function reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by calling `func_2`. It correctly handles the input and output for multiple test cases.

Given the problem statement and the provided examples, the logic in `func_2` appears to be correct. The function correctly calculates the minimum number of screens needed for different combinations of 1x1 and 2x2 icons. The overall structure of the program, including the use of `func_3` to handle multiple test cases, is also correct.

Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description and the provided examples.

Correctness: **True**
