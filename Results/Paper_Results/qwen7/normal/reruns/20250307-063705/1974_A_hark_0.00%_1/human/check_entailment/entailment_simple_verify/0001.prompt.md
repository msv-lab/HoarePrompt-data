You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

    #State: Output State: `t` must be greater than 0.
    #
    #Natural Language Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since the loop runs for all iterations as long as this condition holds true, the final output state after all iterations will still require that `t` must be greater than 0. There are no changes made inside the loop that would affect the value of `t`, so its initial condition remains the same.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to place `x` 1x1 icons and `y` 2x2 icons on the minimum number of 5x3 screens.
   - Each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and each 1x1 icon occupies 1 cell.
   - The total number of cells available per screen is \(5 \times 3 = 15\).

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function returns the smaller of two values, which is not used in the main logic of the program. It seems unnecessary for solving the problem.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function calculates the minimum number of screens needed for a single test case.
   - It handles different cases:
     - Both `x` and `y` are positive.
     - Only `y` is positive.
     - Only `x` is positive.
     - Both `x` and `y` are zero.

4. **Case Analysis in `func_2`**:
   - **Both `x` and `y` are positive**:
     - Calculate how many 2x2 icons can fit into the remaining space after placing some 1x1 icons.
     - Adjust `x` and `y` accordingly.
     - Calculate the number of screens needed for both types of icons.
   - **Only `y` is positive**:
     - Directly calculate the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons.
   - **Only `x` is positive**:
     - Directly calculate the number of screens needed for 1x1 icons.
   - **Both `x` and `y` are zero**:
     - No icons, so no screens are needed.

5. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases and calls `func_2` for each test case.

### Detailed Verification

Let's verify the logic in `func_2` with the provided examples:

- **Example 1**: `x = 1`, `y = 1`
  - Place 1 2x2 icon (4 cells), leaving 11 cells for 1x1 icons.
  - One screen is enough.
  - Output: 1

- **Example 2**: `x = 7`, `y = 2`
  - Place 2 2x2 icons (8 cells), leaving 7 cells for 1x1 icons.
  - One screen is enough.
  - Output: 1

- **Example 3**: `x = 12`, `y = 4`
  - Place 4 2x2 icons (16 cells), leaving -4 cells for 1x1 icons (impossible, adjust to 12 - 16 + 4*4 = 12 - 16 + 16 = 12).
  - Two screens are needed.
  - Output: 2

- **Example 4**: `x = 0`, `y = 3`
  - Three 2x2 icons (12 cells), leaving 3 cells for 1x1 icons.
  - One screen is enough.
  - Output: 1

- **Example 5**: `x = 1`, `y = 0`
  - One 1x1 icon (1 cell), leaving 14 cells.
  - One screen is enough.
  - Output: 1

- **Example 6**: `x = 8`, `y = 1`
  - One 2x2 icon (4 cells), leaving 11 cells for 1x1 icons.
  - One screen is enough.
  - Output: 1

- **Example 7**: `x = 0`, `y = 0`
  - No icons, no screens needed.
  - Output: 0

- **Example 8**: `x = 2`, `y = 0`
  - Two 1x1 icons (2 cells), leaving 13 cells.
  - One screen is enough.
  - Output: 1

- **Example 9**: `x = 15`, `y = 0`
  - Fifteen 1x1 icons (15 cells), leaving 0 cells.
  - One screen is enough.
  - Output: 1

- **Example 10**: `x = 8`, `y = 2`
  - Two 2x2 icons (8 cells), leaving 7 cells for 1x1 icons.
  - One screen is enough.
  - Output: 1

- **Example 11**: `x = 0`, `y = 9`
  - Nine 2x2 icons (18 cells), leaving -3 cells (adjust to 18 - 15 = 3).
  - One screen is enough.
  - Output: 1
