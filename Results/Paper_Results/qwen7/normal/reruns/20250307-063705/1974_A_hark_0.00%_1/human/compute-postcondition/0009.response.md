Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter t, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two integers x and y, where x represents the number of applications with a 1 × 1 icon and y represents the number of applications with a 2 × 2 icon. The function does not return any value explicitly but processes the test cases based on the given inputs.**
