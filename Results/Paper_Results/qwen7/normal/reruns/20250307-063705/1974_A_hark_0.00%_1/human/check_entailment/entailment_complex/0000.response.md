### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1(a, b)`**:
   - This function simply returns the smaller value between `a` and `b`. However, this function is not used anywhere in the main logic of the program. Therefore, it is not relevant to the correctness of the overall solution.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - This function processes the input values `x` and `y` (representing the number of 1×1 and 2×2 icons, respectively) and calculates the minimum number of screens required.
   - The logic in `func_2()` is designed to handle different scenarios:
     - If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, it calculates the number of 1×1 icons needed to match the value of `y` and adjusts `x` accordingly.
     - If only `y` is greater than 0, it calculates the number of 1×1 icons needed to match `y`.
     - If only `x` is greater than 0, it calculates the number of 1×1 icons needed to match `x`.
     - If neither `x` nor `y` is greater than 0, it prints 0.
   - The calculations in `func_2()` seem to be correct for determining the minimum number of screens required based on the problem statement.

3. **Function `func_3()`**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by calling `func_2()` for each test case.
   - The logic in `func_3()` is correct and ensures that the number of test cases `t` is processed correctly.

Given the problem statement and the provided functions, the overall logic appears to be correct. The function `func_2()` correctly calculates the minimum number of screens required for each test case, and `func_3()` processes all test cases as expected.

### Conclusion:

The given program meets the requirements of the problem statement and the logic within the functions is correct.

**Correctness: True**
