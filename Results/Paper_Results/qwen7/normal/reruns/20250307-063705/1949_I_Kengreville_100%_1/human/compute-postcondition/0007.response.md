Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `x[0]`, `y[0]`, `r[0]` are integers assigned the values from the input split.**

Explanation: The code `x[i], y[i], r[i] = map(int, input().split())` takes an input from the user, splits it into three parts, and converts each part into an integer. These integers are then assigned to `x[i]`, `y[i]`, and `r[i]` respectively, where `i` is 0 based on the initial state. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged, but now `x[0]`, `y[0]`, and `r[0]` hold the integer values from the input.
