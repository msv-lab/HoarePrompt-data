Output State: **`i` is an integer and i is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `bipartite` remains unchanged, `visited[i]` is marked as True, `coef[0]` is 1, `tot` is 0, `ok` is True, `coef[i]` is 1**.

Explanation: The code `coef[i] = 1` assigns the value 1 to `coef[i]`. Since `i` is 1, `coef[1]` is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
