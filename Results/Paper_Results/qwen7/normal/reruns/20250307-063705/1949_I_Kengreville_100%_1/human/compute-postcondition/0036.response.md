Output State: **`i` is an integer and i is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `bipartite` is True, `visited[i]` is marked as True, `coef[0]` is 1, `tot` is 0, `ok` is True, `coef[i]` is 1**

Explanation: The `dfs(i)` function is called with `i` as the argument. However, without knowing the implementation details of the `dfs` function, we cannot determine changes to the variables. Since no changes to the variables are explicitly mentioned in the given code snippet, all the variables retain their initial states.
