Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of length `n` filled with `None`, `y` is a list of length `n` filled with `None`, `r` is a list of length `n` filled with `None`, `visited` is a list of boolean values of length `n` all set to `False`, and `coef` is a list of length `n` all set to `None`. `visited` is now a list of `False` values of length `n`.**

Explanation: The code `visited = [False] * n` updates the `visited` list to contain `n` elements, all set to `False`. All other variables remain unchanged.
