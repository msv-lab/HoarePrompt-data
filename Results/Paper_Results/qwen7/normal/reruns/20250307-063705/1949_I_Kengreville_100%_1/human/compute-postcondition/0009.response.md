Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `x[1]`, `y[1]`, `r[1]` are integers assigned the values from the input split.**

Explanation: The code `x[i], y[i], r[i] = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `x[i]`, `y[i]`, and `r[i]` respectively. Since `i` was initially 1, after the assignment, `i` becomes 2. The values of `n` and the initial elements of the lists `x`, `y`, and `r` remain unchanged.
