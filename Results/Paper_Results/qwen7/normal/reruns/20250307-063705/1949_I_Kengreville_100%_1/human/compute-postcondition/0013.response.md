Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` is equal to `n`, `n` is an input integer, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` where each element `x[j]`, `y[j]`, and `r[j]` (for `j` in range `n`) are integers assigned the values from the input split during the respective iteration of the loop. The `visited` list remains a list of boolean values of length `n` all set to `False`, and the `coef` list remains a list of length `n` filled with `None`.

This means that after the loop completes, the variable `i` will have the value `n`, indicating that the loop has executed `n` times. Each of the lists `x`, `y`, and `r` will contain `n` elements, each populated with integer values provided by the user through the `input()` function during each iteration of the loop. The `visited` and `coef` lists remain unchanged as they were not modified within the loop.
