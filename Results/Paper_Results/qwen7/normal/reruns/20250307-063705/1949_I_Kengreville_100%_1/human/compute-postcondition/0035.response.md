Output State: **`i` is an integer and i is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `bipartite` is True, `visited[i]` is marked as True, `coef[0]` is 1, `tot` is 0, `ok` is True, `coef[i]` is 1**

Explanation: The code sets `bipartite` to `True`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `i` is still an integer and equal to 1, `n` is still greater than 1, `visited[i]` is still marked as True, `coef[0]` is still 1, `tot` is still 0, `ok` is still True, and `coef[i]` is still 1.
