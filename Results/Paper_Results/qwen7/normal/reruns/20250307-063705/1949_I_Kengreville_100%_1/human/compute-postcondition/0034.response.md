Output State: **`i` is an integer and i is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `bipartite` remains unchanged, `visited[i]` is marked as True, `coef[0]` is 1, `tot` is 0, `ok` is True, `coef[i]` is 1**

Explanation: The line `tot = 0` sets the variable `tot` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
