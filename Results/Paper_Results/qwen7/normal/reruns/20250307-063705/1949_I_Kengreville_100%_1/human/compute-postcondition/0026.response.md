Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `bipartite` remains unchanged, `visited[0]` is False, `coef[0]` is 1, `tot` is 0, `ok` is True, `coef[1]` is 1**.

Explanation: The code `coef[i] = 1` assigns the value 1 to `coef[i]`. Given that `i` is initially 1, `coef[1]` is updated to 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
