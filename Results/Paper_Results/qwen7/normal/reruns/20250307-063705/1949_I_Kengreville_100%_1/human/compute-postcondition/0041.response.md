Output State: All elements in the `visited` list are marked as `True`, `coef` list has exactly one element set to `1` (at index `i` where `i` is the last index processed by the loop), all other elements in `coef` are `None`, `tot` is `0`, `bipartite` remains `True`, `ok` is `True`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, every vertex (index) in the graph represented by the lists `x`, `y`, and `r` will have been visited (`visited` list will have all `True` values). The `coef` list will contain exactly one `1` (set during the first visit of any unvisited node) and all other elements will remain `None`. The variable `tot` will be `0` as it is reset to `0` at the start of each iteration and never incremented. Since the loop ensures `bipartite` remains `True` unless a contradiction is found, and no contradictions were found, `bipartite` stays `True`. Finally, `ok` remains `True` because it is updated only when `bipartite` is `True` and `tot` is not `0`, which did not happen in any iteration.
