Output State: **`i` is an integer and i is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `bipartite` is True, `visited[i]` is marked as True, `coef[0]` is 1, `tot` is 0, `ok` is True, `coef[i]` is 1, `ok` is `True or (True and tot != 0)`**

Explanation: The variable `ok` is updated to `ok or bipartite and tot != 0`. Given that `bipartite` is `True` and `tot` is `0`, the condition `bipartite and tot != 0` evaluates to `False`. Therefore, `ok` remains `True` because `True or False` is `True`. All other variables remain unchanged.
