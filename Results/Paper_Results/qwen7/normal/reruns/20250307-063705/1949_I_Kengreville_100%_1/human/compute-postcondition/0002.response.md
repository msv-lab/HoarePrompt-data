Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of length `n` filled with `None`, `y` is a list of length `n` filled with `None`, `r` is a list of length `n`, `visited` is a list of boolean values of length `n` all set to `False`, and `coef` is a list of length `n` all set to `None`.**

Explanation: The code `y = [None] * n` creates a new list `y` of length `n` filled with `None` values. This changes the value of `y` but does not affect the other variables. Therefore, the lengths and initial values of `x`, `r`, `visited`, and `coef` remain unchanged.
