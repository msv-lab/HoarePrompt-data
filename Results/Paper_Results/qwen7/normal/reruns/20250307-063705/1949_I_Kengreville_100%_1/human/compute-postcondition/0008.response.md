Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `n` is an input integer
   - `x[0]`, `y[0]`, `r[0]` are integers assigned the values from the input split

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n`.
   - After the previous iteration, `i` was 0, so for the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 0, after the next iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged because it is an input integer and does not change within the loop.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` will be 1.
   - `n` remains the same (an input integer).
   - `x[0]`, `y[0]`, `r[0]` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `x[0]`, `y[0]`, `r[0]` are integers assigned the values from the input split**
