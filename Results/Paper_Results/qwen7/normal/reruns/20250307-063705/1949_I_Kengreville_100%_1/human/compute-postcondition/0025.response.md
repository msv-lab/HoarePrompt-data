Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `bipartite` remains unchanged
   - `visited[0]` is False
   - `coef[0]` is 1
   - `tot` is 0
   - `ok` is True

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration. Therefore, `i` will be 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than 1 (since `i` is now 1).

5. **States to be adjusted**:
   - `i` will be 1.
   - `n` must remain greater than 1.

6. **Other states**:
   - `bipartite` remains unchanged.
   - `visited[0]` remains False.
   - `coef[0]` remains 1.
   - `tot` remains 0.
   - `ok` remains True.

Therefore, the updated state for the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `bipartite` remains unchanged, `visited[0]` is False, `coef[0]` is 1, `tot` is 0, `ok` is True**
