Output State: **`tot` is 0; `bipartite` is True; `dfs(i)` has been called with parameter `i`.**

Explanation: The function `dfs(i)` is called with the parameter `i`, but since no specific changes to `tot` or `bipartite` are mentioned within the function call, their values remain unchanged. The function call itself does not return a value or modify the given variables directly.
