Postcondition: `i` is an integer and i is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `bipartite` remains unchanged, `visited[i]` is marked as True, `coef[0]` is 1, `tot` is 0, `ok` is True. If `visited[i]` is False, then `coef[i]` is 1 and `ok` is `True or (True and tot != 0)`. If `visited[i]` is already True, the values of `bipartite`, `visited[i]`, `coef[0]`, `tot`, and `ok` remain unchanged.
