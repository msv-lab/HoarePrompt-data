Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `bipartite` is True, `tot` is 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `n` is an input integer, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` where each element `x[j]`, `y[j]`, and `r[j]` (for `j` in range `n`) are integers assigned the values from the input split during the respective iteration of the loop, the `visited` list remains a list of boolean values of length `n` all set to `False`, and the `coef` list remains a list of length `n` filled with `None`, `ok` is False.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if not visited[i]:
        coef[i] = 1
        tot = 0
        bipartite = True
        dfs(i)
        ok = ok or bipartite and tot != 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `bipartite` remains unchanged, `visited[0]` is False, `coef[0]` is 1, `tot` is 0, `ok` is True. If `not visited[i]` is True, then `bipartite` is True.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is an integer, `n` is greater than 1, `bipartite` remains unchanged, `visited[i]` is marked as True, `coef[0]` is 1, `tot` is 0, `ok` is True because `ok or (True and 0 != 0)` evaluates to True.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is an integer and i is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `bipartite` remains True, `visited[i]` is marked as True, `coef[0]` is 1, `tot` is 0, `ok` is True. If `visited[i]` was not already True, then `coef[i]` is set to 1 and `ok` is set to `True or (True and tot != 0)`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
