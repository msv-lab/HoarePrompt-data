Output State: **`bipartite` is True, `tot` is 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `n` is an input integer, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` where each element `x[j]`, `y[j]`, and `r[j]` (for `j` in range `n`) are integers assigned the values from the input split during the respective iteration of the loop, the `visited` list remains a list of boolean values of length `n` all set to `False`, and the `coef` list remains a list of length `n` filled with `None`.**

The code simply assigns the boolean value `True` to the variable `bipartite`. No other changes are made to the other variables or their values. Therefore, the values of `tot`, `i`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, and `coef` remain unchanged from their initial states.
