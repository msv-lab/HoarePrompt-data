Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is an input integer, `x[1]`, `y[1]`, `r[1]` are integers assigned the values from the input split, and the values of `x[1]`, `y[1]`, `r[1]` are specific integers based on user input.**

Explanation: The code updates the values of `x[1]`, `y[1]`, and `r[1]` by taking three integers as input using `input().split()` and converting them to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states. The specific values of `x[1]`, `y[1]`, and `r[1]` depend on the user's input.
