Output State: **After executing `tot = 0`, the value of `tot` is 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `n` is an input integer, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` where each element `x[j]`, `y[j]`, and `r[j]` (for `j` in range `n`) are integers assigned the values from the input split during the respective iteration of the loop. The `visited` list remains a list of boolean values of length `n` all set to `False`, and the `coef` list remains a list of length `n` filled with `None`.**

Explanation: The line `tot = 0` initializes the variable `tot` to 0. This does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, or `coef`. Therefore, the output state retains the same conditions as the initial state except for the new value of `tot`.
