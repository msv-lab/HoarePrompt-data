Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is equal to `n`.
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. If `n` is 0, the loop will not execute because `range(0)` results in an empty sequence.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `i` is equal to `n`, and the loop will only execute if `n` is at least 1, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0.
   - The value of `i` should be adjusted to start the loop correctly. Initially, `i` should be 0.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` and `i`.

Therefore, the final state before the loop starts should be:

**State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
