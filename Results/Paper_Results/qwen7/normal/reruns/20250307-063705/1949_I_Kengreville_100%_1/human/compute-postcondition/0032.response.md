Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the state changes based on the loop head**:
   - `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 at each iteration.
   - `n` remains unchanged within the loop.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is an integer.
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `bipartite` remains unchanged.
   - `visited[i]` is marked as True.
   - `coef[0]` is 1.
   - `tot` is 0.
   - `ok` is True because `ok or (True and 0 != 0)` evaluates to True.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `bipartite`, `coef[0]`, `tot`, and `ok` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - `n` remains greater than 1.
   - `bipartite` remains unchanged.
   - `visited[i]` is marked as True (this will change in the loop body but is not part of the initial state adjustment).
   - `coef[0]` remains 1.
   - `tot` remains 0.
   - `ok` remains True.

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is an integer and i is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `bipartite` remains unchanged, `visited[i]` is marked as True, `coef[0]` is 1, `tot` is 0, `ok` is True**.
