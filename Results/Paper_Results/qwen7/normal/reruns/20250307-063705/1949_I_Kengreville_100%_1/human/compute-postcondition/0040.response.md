Output State: All elements in the `visited` list are marked as `True`, `coef` list is filled with `1`s for all indices where `visited` was `False` initially, `tot` is `0`, `bipartite` remains `True`, `ok` is `True`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, every node (`i` from `0` to `n-1`) will have been processed since the loop continues until all nodes are visited (`visited[i]` becomes `True`). The `dfs(i)` function marks nodes as visited and updates the `coef` list to `1` for unvisited nodes. Since the condition `bipartite and tot != 0` is checked but `tot` starts at `0` and is not incremented unless there's a change in bipartiteness which isn't specified to happen, `tot` remains `0`. `ok` stays `True` because it gets updated only when `bipartite` is `True` and `tot` is non-zero, which doesn't occur here.
