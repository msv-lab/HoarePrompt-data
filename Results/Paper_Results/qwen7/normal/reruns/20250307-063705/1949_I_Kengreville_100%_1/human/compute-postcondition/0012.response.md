Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is an input integer, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` where each element from index `0` to `n-1` is an integer assigned the values from the user input split during each iteration of the loop. The `visited` list remains unchanged, still consisting of `n` boolean values all set to `False`. The `coef` list remains unchanged, still consisting of `n` values all set to `None`.

This means that after the loop completes, the lists `x`, `y`, and `r` will contain `n` integers each, corresponding to the inputs provided by the user during each iteration of the loop. The variable `i` will have the value `n-1`, indicating the last iteration of the loop.
