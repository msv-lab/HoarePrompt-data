Output State: **`bipartite` is True; `i` is 1; `n` must be greater than 0; `visited[0]` is False; `coef[0]` is 1; `tot` is 0**

Explanation: The `dfs(i)` function call starts a depth-first search from the current value of `i`, which is 0. The function updates the value of `i` to 1 (assuming the typical behavior of a DFS function that increments the index or visits the next node). The other variables (`bipartite`, `n`, `visited[0]`, `coef[0]`, and `tot`) remain unchanged as no operations affecting them are specified within the given code snippet.
