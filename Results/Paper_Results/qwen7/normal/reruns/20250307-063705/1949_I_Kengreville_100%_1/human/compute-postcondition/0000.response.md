Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n`, `visited` is a list of boolean values of length `n` all set to `False`, and `coef` is a list of length `n` all set to `None`.**

The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The lengths and initial states of the lists `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, and `coef` remain unchanged.
