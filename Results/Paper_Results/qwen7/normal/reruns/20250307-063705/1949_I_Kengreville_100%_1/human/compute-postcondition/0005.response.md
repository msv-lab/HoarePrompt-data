Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of length `n` filled with `None`, `y` is a list of length `n` filled with `None`, `r` is a list of length `n` filled with `None`, `visited` is a list of boolean values of length `n` all set to `False`, and `coef` is a list of length `n` filled with `None`.**

Explanation: The code `coef = [None] * n` initializes the list `coef` with `n` elements, each set to `None`. This operation does not affect the values of the other variables (`x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`). Therefore, their states remain unchanged.
