Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and the input `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is the loop counter, and it starts from 0 in a typical `range(n)` loop.
   - `n` is an input integer, and its value is already given.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and the loop will continue until `i < n`, `i` should be set to 0 initially.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is an input integer and its value is already provided.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` should be 0.
- `n` remains as an input integer.

Therefore, the final state before the loop starts should be:

**State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer**.
