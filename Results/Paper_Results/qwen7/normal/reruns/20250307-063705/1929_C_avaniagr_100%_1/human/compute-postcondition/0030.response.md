Output State: **`k` is set to the first value in the input stream split by spaces, `x` is set to the second value in the input stream split by spaces, `i` is set to the previous value of `i` + 2, and `z` is increased by `z // (k - 1) + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` updates the value of `z` by adding to it the result of `z // (k - 1) + 1`. However, since the initial values of `k` and `z` are not specified in the initial state, we cannot provide a numerical value for `z`. We only know that `z` has been updated according to the given formula. The values of `k`, `x`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
