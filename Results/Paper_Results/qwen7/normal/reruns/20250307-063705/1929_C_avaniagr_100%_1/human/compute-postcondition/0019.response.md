Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is set to the first value in the input stream split by spaces, `x` is set to the second value in the input stream split by spaces, `a` is set to the third value in the input stream split by spaces, and the current value of `x` is equal to `k - 1`, with the additional condition that `a` is less than `x + 2`.
