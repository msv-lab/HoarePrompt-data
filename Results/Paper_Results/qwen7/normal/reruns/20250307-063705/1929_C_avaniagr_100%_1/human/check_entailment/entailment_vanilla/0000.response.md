### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads input from standard input, which is correctly handled using `[*open(0)][1:]` to skip the first line and process each subsequent line.

2. **Variable Assignment**: The variables `k`, `x`, and `a` are correctly assigned from the split input.

3. **Condition Checking**:
   - **Case 1**: If `x < k - 1`, the program checks if `a >= x + 1`. This condition ensures that Sasha can cover the cost of losing up to `x` times consecutively and still have enough coins to start again. If this condition holds, Sasha can achieve any number of coins, so the program prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
   - **Case 2**: If `x == k - 1`, the program checks if `a >= x + 2`. This condition ensures that Sasha can cover the cost of losing `k-1` times consecutively and still have enough coins to start again. If this condition holds, Sasha can achieve any number of coins, so the program prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
   - **Case 3**: For all other cases (`x > k - 1`), the program calculates a value `z` which represents the minimum number of coins required to ensure Sasha can keep betting without running out of coins after `x` consecutive losses. The formula used is `z = k - 2` and then iteratively updating `z` based on the recurrence relation `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` for `x - k + 3` iterations. If `a >= z`, Sasha can achieve any number of coins, so the program prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

4. **Recurrence Relation Analysis**:
   - The recurrence relation `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` is derived from the fact that Sasha needs to cover the cost of losing `x` times consecutively and still have enough coins to start again. This relation ensures that Sasha can always find a way to cover the costs and continue betting.
   - The logic for calculating `z` is sound and correctly reflects the problem constraints.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to determine if Sasha can achieve any number of coins based on the given constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct according to the problem description.
