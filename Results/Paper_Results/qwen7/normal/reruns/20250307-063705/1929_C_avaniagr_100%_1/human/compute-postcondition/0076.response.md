Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `k` is the first integer from the input stream, `x` is the second integer from the input stream, `a` is the third integer from the input stream, `z` is `k - 2`, `a` is the third integer from the input stream, `s` is the next line from the input stream.**

Explanation: The code `z = k - 2` simply assigns the value of `k - 2` to `z`. The other variables (`t`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `s`) remain unchanged.
