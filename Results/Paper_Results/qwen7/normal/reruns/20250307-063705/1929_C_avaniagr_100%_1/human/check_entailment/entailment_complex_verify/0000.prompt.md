You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend the best handbag, but unfortunately for
Sasha, it is very expensive. Therefore, Sasha wants to earn it. After looking
at earning tips on the internet, he decided to go to the casino.

Sasha knows that the casino operates under the following rules. If Sasha
places a bet of y coins (where y is a positive integer), then in case of
winning, he will receive y \cdot k coins (i.e., his number of coins will
increase by y \cdot (k - 1) ). And in case of losing, he will lose the entire
bet amount (i.e., his number of coins will decrease by y ).

Note that the bet amount must always be a positive (> 0 ) integer and cannot
exceed Sasha's current number of coins.

Sasha also knows that there is a promotion at the casino: he cannot lose more
than x times in a row.

Initially, Sasha has a coins. He wonders whether he can place bets such that
he is guaranteed to win any number of coins. In other words, is it true that
for any integer n , Sasha can make bets so that for any outcome that does not
contradict the rules described above, at some moment of time he will have at
least n coins.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The single line of each test case contains three integers k, x and a (2 \leq k
\leq 30 , 1 \leq x \leq 100 , 1 \leq a \leq 10^9 ) — the number of times the
bet is increased in case of a win, the maximum number of consecutive losses,
and the initial number of coins Sasha has.

Output

For each test case, output "YES" (without quotes) if Sasha can achieve it and
"NO" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, the strings "yEs",
"yes" and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Note

In the first test case, Sasha can proceed as follows:

  * If Sasha places a bet for the first time or if he won the previous bet, then he places 1 coin.
  * If Sasha lost the previous bet, then he places 2 coins.

Note that Sasha cannot lose more than once in a row.

It can be proven that with this strategy, Sasha can obtain as many coins as he
wants.

In the second test case, Sasha can only place 1 coin for the first time. But
in case of a loss, he will not be able to place any more bets, so he will not
be able to guarantee having as many coins as he wants.

    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `t` remains a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\). The variables `k`, `x`, and `a` retain their final values after the last iteration of the loop. The variable `z` is calculated based on the conditions provided within the loop:
    #
    #- If `x < k - 1` and `a >= x + 1`, `z` is increased by `z // (k - 1) + 1` for each iteration from 0 to `x - k + 2`.
    #- If `x == k - 1` and `a >= x + 2`, `z` is increased by `z // (k - 1) + 1` for each iteration from 0 to `x - k + 2`.
    #- If `x >= k - 1`, `z` is increased by `z // (k - 1) + 1` for each iteration from 0 to `x - k + 2`.
    #
    #If `a` is greater than or equal to `z` after all iterations, `z` is updated to `3 * (z + z // (k - 1) + 1)`. Otherwise, `z` retains its value after the last iteration.
    #
    #In summary, the final state of `z` will depend on the specific values of `k`, `x`, and `a` after all iterations, with `z` being updated according to the rules defined within the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input values for `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a` from standard input. It then iterates through these values, performing calculations based on the given conditions. Specifically, it calculates a value `z` based on the relationship between `x` and `k`, and checks if `a` is greater than or equal to `z`. If so, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value but prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each set of input values.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases according to the problem description. Specifically, the logic for determining whether Sasha can achieve his goal is flawed.

Consider the following test case:
- \( k = 3 \)
- \( x = 2 \)
- \( a = 1 \)

According to the problem description, Sasha can lose up to \( x \) times in a row. Here, \( x = 2 \), so Sasha can lose twice in a row. However, if Sasha loses the first two bets, he will have \( 1 - 1 - 1 = -1 \) coins, which is not possible. The program does not account for this scenario and incorrectly prints 'YES' in this case.

To correctly solve this problem, Sasha needs a strategy that ensures he can recover from consecutive losses without going into negative coins. The provided solution does not ensure this recovery mechanism, leading to incorrect results for certain inputs.
