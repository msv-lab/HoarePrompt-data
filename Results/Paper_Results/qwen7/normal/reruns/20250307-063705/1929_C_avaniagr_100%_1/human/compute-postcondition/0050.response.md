Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `k` is the first integer from the input stream minus 2, `x` is the second integer from the input stream, `a` is the third integer from the input stream.**

Explanation: The variable `z` is assigned the value `k - 2`. The value of `t`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, `t` is still a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `k` is now the original value of `k` minus 2, `x` remains the second integer from the input stream, and `a` remains the third integer from the input stream.
