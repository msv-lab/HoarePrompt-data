Output State: **`k` is set to the first value in the input stream split by spaces, `x` is set to the second value in the input stream split by spaces, `i` is set to the previous value of `i` + 1, and `z` is increased by `z // (k - 1) + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` updates the value of `z` by adding to it the result of `z // (k - 1) + 1`. Here, `k` and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states, `i` is incremented by 1, and `z` is updated according to the given formula.
