Output State: **`z` is increased by `z // (k - 1) + 1` twice, `i` is `initial_i + 3`, `x - k + 3` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` is executed twice, which means `z` is increased by `z // (k - 1) + 1` each time. The value of `i` is updated to `initial_i + 3`, and the value of `x - k + 3` remains unchanged.
