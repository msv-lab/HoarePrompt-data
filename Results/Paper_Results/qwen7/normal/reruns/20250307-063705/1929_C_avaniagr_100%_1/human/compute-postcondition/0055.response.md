Output State: **`z` is increased by `z // (k - 1) + 1` and then further increased by `z // (k - 1) + 1`, `i` is `initial_i + 2`, `x - k + 3` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` increments `z` by its current value divided by `(k - 1)` (integer division), plus 1. This operation is performed twice because the initial state already mentions that `z` is increased by `z // (k - 1) + 1`. After the first increment, `i` is incremented by 1, making it `initial_i + 1`. The second increment is applied to the new value of `z`, and `i` is incremented again, making it `initial_i + 2`. The value of `x - k + 3` remains unchanged as no operations are performed on it.
