Postcondition: **`z` is an integer. If `x == k - 1`, then `z` is increased by `z // (k - 1) + 1` a total of `x - k + 3` times if `x != k - 1` and `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`. Otherwise, if `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, then `z` is updated to `3 * (z + z // (k - 1) + 1)`. In both cases, the value of `i` remains `x - k + 3`.**
