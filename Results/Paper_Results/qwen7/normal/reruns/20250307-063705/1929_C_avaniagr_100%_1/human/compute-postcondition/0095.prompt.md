You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, k is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 30, x is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 100, and a is an integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^9.
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        k, x, a = map(int, s.split())
        
        if x < k - 1:
            if a >= x + 1:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        elif x == k - 1:
            if a >= x + 2:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        else:
            z = k - 2
            for i in range(x - k + 3):
                z += z // (k - 1) + 1
            if a >= z:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `t` remains a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\). The variables `k`, `x`, and `a` retain their final values after the last iteration of the loop. The variable `z` is calculated based on the conditions provided within the loop:
    #
    #- If `x < k - 1` and `a >= x + 1`, `z` is increased by `z // (k - 1) + 1` for each iteration from 0 to `x - k + 2`.
    #- If `x == k - 1` and `a >= x + 2`, `z` is increased by `z // (k - 1) + 1` for each iteration from 0 to `x - k + 2`.
    #- If `x >= k - 1`, `z` is increased by `z // (k - 1) + 1` for each iteration from 0 to `x - k + 2`.
    #
    #If `a` is greater than or equal to `z` after all iterations, `z` is updated to `3 * (z + z // (k - 1) + 1)`. Otherwise, `z` retains its value after the last iteration.
    #
    #In summary, the final state of `z` will depend on the specific values of `k`, `x`, and `a` after all iterations, with `z` being updated according to the rules defined within the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters. It checks if the integer `t` is within the range of 1 to 1000, if `k` is within the range of 2 to 30, if `x` is within the range of 1 to 100, and if `a` is within the range of 1 to 10^9. Depending on these conditions, it returns either True or False.

The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
