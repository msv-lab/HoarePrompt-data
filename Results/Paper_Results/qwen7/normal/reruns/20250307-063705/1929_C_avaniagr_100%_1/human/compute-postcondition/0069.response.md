Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `k` is the first integer from the input stream, `x` is the second integer from the input stream, `a` is the third integer from the input stream, `z` is increased by `z // (k - 1) + 1` a total of `x - k + 3` times if `x != k - 1` and `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`, `s` is the next line from the input stream.**

Explanation: The code `k, x, a = map(int, s.split())` splits the string `s` into three integers and assigns them to `k`, `x`, and `a` respectively. This does not affect the values of `t` and `z`, nor does it change the condition under which `z` is updated. The value of `s` is updated to the next line from the input stream.
