Output: **YES**

Explanation: The initial state provides us with the following information:
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `k` is set to the first value in the input stream split by spaces.
- `x` is set to the second value in the input stream split by spaces.
- `a` is set to the third value in the input stream split by spaces.
- The current value of `x` is less than `k - 1`.
- The current value of `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`.

The `print('YES')` statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`. Since no conditions or calculations are performed within the print statement itself, it directly prints the string `'YES'` as specified.
