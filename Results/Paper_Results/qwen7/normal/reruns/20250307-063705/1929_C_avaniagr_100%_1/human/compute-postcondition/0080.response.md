Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`; `z` is `z + z // (k - 1) + 1`**

Explanation: The value of `i` remains unchanged as it was initially set to `n + 1`. The variable `z` is updated by adding to its current value the result of `z // (k - 1) + 1`. Since the initial value of `z` is not specified, it is represented as `z` in the output state.
