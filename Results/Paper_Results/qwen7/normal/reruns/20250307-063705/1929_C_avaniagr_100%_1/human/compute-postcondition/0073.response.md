Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `k` is the first integer from the input stream.
- `x` is the second integer from the input stream.
- `a` is the third integer from the input stream.
- `z` is increased by `z // (k - 1) + 1` a total of `x - k + 3` times if `x != k - 1` and `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`.
- `s` is the next line from the input stream.

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('YES')
```

This statement will print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of the other variables. Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **YES**
