Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `x - k + 3`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `x - k + 3`.

3. **Analyze the given information**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, the value of `z` was updated by `z // (k - 1) + 1`.
   - The loop variable `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration.

4. **Calculate the new state**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - The value of `x - k + 3` remains unchanged because it is a constant expression based on `x` and `k`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - The only variable in the loop head that changes is `i`. Therefore, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - The value of `z` is updated outside the loop, so it remains unchanged for the loop condition check.

Given that `i` started from some initial value and is incremented by 1, let's denote the initial value of `i` as `initial_i`. After the previous iteration, `i` is `initial_i`. For the next iteration, `i` will be `initial_i + 1`.

Since the exact initial value of `i` is not provided, we can represent it symbolically. However, the key point is that `i` will be incremented by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`z` is increased by `z // (k - 1) + 1`, `i` is `initial_i + 1`, `x - k + 3` remains unchanged**.

If we need to provide a specific numerical example, we would need the initial value of `i` and the values of `x` and `k`. Without those, we can generalize the answer as follows:

State: **`z` is increased by `z // (k - 1) + 1`, `i` is `initial_i + 1`, `x - k + 3` remains unchanged**.
