Output State: **`z` is increased by `z // (k - 1) + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` updates the value of `z` by adding to it the result of `z // (k - 1) + 1`. Here, `//` denotes integer division. The exact value of `z` after this operation depends on its initial value and the value of `k`. However, since the initial values of `z` and `k` are not specified, we can only say that `z` is updated to its original value plus `z // (k - 1) + 1`.
