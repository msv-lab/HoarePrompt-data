Let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `k` is set to the first value in the input stream split by spaces.
   - `x` is set to the second value in the input stream split by spaces.
   - `i` is equal to `x - k + 2`.
   - `z` is increased by `z // (k - 1) + 1` for each iteration from 0 to `x - k + 2`.
   - The value of `a` is less than `z`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('NO')
   ```

Given the code snippet, it directly prints the string `'NO'`. The values of `k`, `x`, `i`, `z`, and `a` do not affect this print statement because the statement is simply printing a hardcoded string.

Therefore, the output is:
Output: **NO**
