Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(x - k + 3)`. The only variable mentioned here is `i`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `x - k + 3`.

3. **Understand the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - The state is not explicitly given, but we know that `z` was increased by `z // (k - 1) + 1` at some point before the loop started.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is controlled by `i`, and `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - Therefore, if `i` was `n` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `n + 1`.

5. **Determine the new state**:
   - The only variable that needs adjustment is `i`, which will be `i + 1`.
   - The variable `z` is not part of the loop head and its value does not change within the loop head itself, so it remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is `n + 1`**, where `n` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration**.
