Based on the initial state provided:

- The value of `z` is given by the formula `3 * (z + z // (k - 1) + 1)`.
- `a` is less than `z`.
- The value of `i` is equal to `x - k + 3`.

However, the print statement simply outputs the string `'NO'`.

Since the print statement does not reference any of the variables `z`, `a`, or `i`, and only outputs a fixed string, the output will be:

Output: **'NO'**
