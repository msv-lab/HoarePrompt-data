Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `k` is set to the first value in the input stream split by spaces.
   - `x` is set to the second value in the input stream split by spaces.
   - `i` is equal to `x - k + 2`.
   - `z` is increased by `z // (k - 1) + 1` for each iteration from 0 to `x - k + 2`.
   - `a` is greater than or equal to `z`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('YES')
   ```

From the initial state, we know:
- `k` and `x` are integers derived from the input stream.
- `i` is calculated as `x - k + 2`.
- `z` is incremented by `z // (k - 1) + 1` for each iteration from 0 to `x - k + 2`. This means `z` is incremented multiple times depending on the value of `x - k + 2`.
- `a` is greater than or equal to the final value of `z`.

However, the `print` statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`. The values of `k`, `x`, `i`, `z`, and `a` do not affect this print statement directly.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **YES**
