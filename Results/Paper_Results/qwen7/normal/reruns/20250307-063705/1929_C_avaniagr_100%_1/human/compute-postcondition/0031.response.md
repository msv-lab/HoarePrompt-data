Output State: `k` is set to the first value in the input stream split by spaces, `x` is set to the second value in the input stream split by spaces, `i` is set to `x - k + 2`, and `z` is increased by `z // (k - 1) + 1` for each iteration from 0 to `x - k + 2`.

In this final state, `k` and `x` retain their initial values, `i` will be equal to `x - k + 2` after the loop completes, and `z` will have been updated in each iteration of the loop according to the rule `z += z // (k - 1) + 1`.
