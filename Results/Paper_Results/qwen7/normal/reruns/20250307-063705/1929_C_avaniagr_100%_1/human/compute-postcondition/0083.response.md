Output State: The value of `z` will be the result of applying the operation `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` three times consecutively, starting with the initial value of `z = k - 2`.

To break it down step-by-step:
1. After the first iteration, `z` becomes `z + z // (k - 1) + 1`.
2. After the second iteration, `z` becomes `(z + z // (k - 1) + 1) + (z + z // (k - 1) + 1) // (k - 1) + 1`.
3. After the third iteration, `z` becomes the result of the second iteration plus its value divided by `(k - 1)` plus one.

So, the final output state after the loop executes all its iterations is:
Output State: `z` is equal to the result of performing the operation `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` three consecutive times starting from `z = k - 2`.
