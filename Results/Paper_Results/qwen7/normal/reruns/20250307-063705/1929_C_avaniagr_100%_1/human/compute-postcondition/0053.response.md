Output State: **`z` is increased by `z // (k - 1) + 1`.**

Explanation: The variable `z` is updated by adding the value of `z // (k - 1) + 1` to its current value. Since the initial values of `z` and `k` are not specified, we express the new value of `z` in terms of these variables. The state of `k` remains unchanged.
