Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `k` is the first integer from the input stream, `x` is the second integer from the input stream, `a` is the third integer from the input stream**.

Explanation: The code snippet `k, x, a = map(int, s.split())` takes the input stream `s`, splits it by spaces, and assigns the resulting integers to `k`, `x`, and `a`. The initial value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation.
