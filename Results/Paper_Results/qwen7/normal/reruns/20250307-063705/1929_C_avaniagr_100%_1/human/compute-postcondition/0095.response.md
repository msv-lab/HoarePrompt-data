Functionality: **The function reads input values for `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a` from standard input. It then iterates through these values, performing calculations based on the given conditions. Specifically, it calculates a value `z` based on the relationship between `x` and `k`, and checks if `a` is greater than or equal to `z`. If so, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value but prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each set of input values.**
