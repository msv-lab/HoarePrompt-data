Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `k` is set to the first value in the input stream split by spaces.
- `x` is set to the second value in the input stream split by spaces.
- `a` is set to the third value in the input stream split by spaces.
- The current value of `x` is equal to `k - 1`.
- The current value of `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 2`.

The `print('YES')` statement will simply print the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
