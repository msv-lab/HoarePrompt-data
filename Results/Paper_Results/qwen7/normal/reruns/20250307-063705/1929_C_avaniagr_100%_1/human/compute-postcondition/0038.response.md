Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is set to the first value in the input stream split by spaces, `x` is set to the second value in the input stream split by spaces, `a` is set to the third value in the input stream split by spaces, and either:

- The current value of `x` is equal to `k - 1`, and `a` is either greater than or equal to `x + 2` or less than `x + 2`.
- Alternatively, `k` is set to the first value in the input stream split by spaces, `x` is set to the second value in the input stream split by spaces, `i` is equal to `x - k + 2`, and `z` is increased by `z // (k - 1) + 1` for each iteration from 0 to `x - k + 2`. Whether `a` is greater than or equal to `z` or less than `z`, the final values of `k`, `x`, `i`, and `z` remain the same as described above.
