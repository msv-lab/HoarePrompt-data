Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `k` is the first integer from the input stream, `x` is the second integer from the input stream, `a` is the third integer from the input stream. If `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`, no change is made. Otherwise, no change is made.**
