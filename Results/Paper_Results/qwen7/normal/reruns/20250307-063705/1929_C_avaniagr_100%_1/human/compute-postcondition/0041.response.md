Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is set to the first value in the input stream split by spaces, `x` is set to the second value in the input stream split by spaces, `a` is set to the third value in the input stream split by spaces. 

- If `x < k - 1` and `a >= x + 1`, then `a` remains unchanged and `x` is less than `k - 1`. If `a < x + 1`, then `x` is less than or equal to `k - 2`.
- If `x >= k - 1`, then `i` is equal to `x - k + 2`. Additionally, `z` is increased by `z // (k - 1) + 1` for each iteration from 0 to `x - k + 2`. The final values of `k`, `x`, `i`, and `z` remain the same as described above.
