Output State: **`z` is increased by `z // (k - 1) + 1` a total of `x - k + 3` times.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `z` will have been incremented by the value of `z // (k - 1) + 1` for each iteration of the loop. Since the loop runs `x - k + 3` times, `z` will be increased by this amount a total of `x - k + 3` times. The values of `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a` will remain unchanged from their initial states.
