Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `z` is increased by `z // (k - 1) + 1` a total of `x - k + 3` times.
   - `a` is less than `z`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The statement to be executed is `print('NO')`.

Given the print statement `print('NO')`, it is clear that the output will be the string `'NO'` regardless of the values of `z`, `k`, `x`, and `a`.

Therefore, the output is:

Output: **'NO'**
