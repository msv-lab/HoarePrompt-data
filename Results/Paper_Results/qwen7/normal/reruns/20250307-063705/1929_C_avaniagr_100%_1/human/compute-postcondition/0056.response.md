Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies `i` and the range is defined as `range(x - k + 3)`. Therefore, the variables `i` and `x - k + 3` are the ones that need to be considered.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `z` is increased by `z // (k - 1) + 1` and then further increased by `z // (k - 1) + 1`.
   - `i` is `initial_i + 2`.
   - `x - k + 3` remains unchanged.

3. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from `initial_i + 2` and the loop increments `i` by 1 each time, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would be `initial_i + 2 + (number of iterations - 1)`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1, so it becomes `initial_i + 3 + (number of iterations - 1)`.
   - The value of `x - k + 3` remains unchanged.

Given that the loop is iterating over `range(x - k + 3)`, the value of `x - k + 3` does not change within the loop. It is the same as the value at the start of the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `z` is increased by `z // (k - 1) + 1` and then further increased by `z // (k - 1) + 1`.
- `i` is `initial_i + 3` (since it was `initial_i + 2` at the end of the previous iteration and now it needs to be incremented by 1).
- `x - k + 3` remains unchanged.

So, the final state is:
State: **`z` is increased by `z // (k - 1) + 1` and then further increased by `z // (k - 1) + 1`, `i` is `initial_i + 3`, `x - k + 3` remains unchanged**.
