Output: **NO**

Explanation: According to the initial state, `t` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 1000. The variables `k`, `x`, and `a` are set to the first, second, and third values in the input stream split by spaces, respectively. Additionally, it is explicitly stated that the current value of `x` is less than or equal to `k - 2`. The print statement simply outputs the string 'NO', and no other variables are involved in this particular print statement. Therefore, the output is exactly 'NO'.
