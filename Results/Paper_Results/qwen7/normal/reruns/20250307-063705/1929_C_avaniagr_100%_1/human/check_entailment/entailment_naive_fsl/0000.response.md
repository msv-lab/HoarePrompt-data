Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases according to the problem description. Specifically, the logic for determining whether Sasha can achieve his goal is flawed.

Consider the following test case:
- \( k = 3 \)
- \( x = 2 \)
- \( a = 1 \)

According to the problem description, Sasha can lose up to \( x \) times in a row. Here, \( x = 2 \), so Sasha can lose twice in a row. However, if Sasha loses the first two bets, he will have \( 1 - 1 - 1 = -1 \) coins, which is not possible. The program does not account for this scenario and incorrectly prints 'YES' in this case.

To correctly solve this problem, Sasha needs a strategy that ensures he can recover from consecutive losses without going into negative coins. The provided solution does not ensure this recovery mechanism, leading to incorrect results for certain inputs.
