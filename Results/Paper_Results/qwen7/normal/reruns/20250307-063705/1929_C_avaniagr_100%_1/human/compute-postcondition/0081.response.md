Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `x - k + 3`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < x - k + 3`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `n + 1`
   - `z` is `z + z // (k - 1) + 1`

4. **Determine the new value of `i` for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from `n + 1` and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` will be `n + 2`.

5. **Check if the loop should continue**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `x - k + 3`.
   - Given `i = n + 2`, the loop will continue if `n + 2 < x - k + 3`.

6. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be updated to `n + 2`.
   - The value of `z` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is `n + 2`, `z` is `z + z // (k - 1) + 1`**
