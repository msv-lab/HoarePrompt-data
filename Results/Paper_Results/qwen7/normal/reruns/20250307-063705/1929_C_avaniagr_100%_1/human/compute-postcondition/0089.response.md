Postcondition: **`z` is an integer, `a` is a value, and `i` is an integer equal to `x - k + 3`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, then `z` is updated to `3 * (z + z // (k - 1) + 1)`. If `a` is less than `z`, then `z` is also updated to `3 * (z + z // (k - 1) + 1)`. In both cases, the value of `i` remains `x - k + 3`.**
