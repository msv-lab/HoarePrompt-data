Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `k` is set to the first value in the input stream split by spaces.
- `x` is set to the second value in the input stream split by spaces.
- `a` is set to the third value in the input stream split by spaces.
- The current value of `x` is equal to `k - 1`.
- The additional condition is that `a` is less than `x + 2`.

The print statement is simply `print('NO')`.

Since the print statement does not depend on the values of `k`, `x`, `a`, or `t`, it will always print the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
