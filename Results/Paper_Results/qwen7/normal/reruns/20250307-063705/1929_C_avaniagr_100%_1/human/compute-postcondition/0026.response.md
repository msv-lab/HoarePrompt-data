Output State: **`k` is set to the first value in the input stream split by spaces, `x` is set to the second value in the input stream split by spaces, and `z` is increased by `z // (k - 1) + 1`.**

Explanation: The variable `z` is updated by adding to its current value the integer division of `z` by `(k - 1)` plus 1. The initial values of `k` and `x` remain unchanged, and the condition that `x` must be greater than or equal to `k - 2` still holds.
