Based on the initial state provided:

- `z` is increased by `z // (k - 1) + 1` a total of `x - k + 3` times.
- The current value of `a` is greater than or equal to `z`.

The print statement is simply `print('YES')`.

Since the print statement does not depend on any variable or object other than a hardcoded string, the output will be exactly as written.

Output: **YES**
