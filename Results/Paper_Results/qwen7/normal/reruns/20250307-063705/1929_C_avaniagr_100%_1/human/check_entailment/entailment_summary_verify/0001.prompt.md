You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend the best handbag, but unfortunately for
Sasha, it is very expensive. Therefore, Sasha wants to earn it. After looking
at earning tips on the internet, he decided to go to the casino.

Sasha knows that the casino operates under the following rules. If Sasha
places a bet of y coins (where y is a positive integer), then in case of
winning, he will receive y \cdot k coins (i.e., his number of coins will
increase by y \cdot (k - 1) ). And in case of losing, he will lose the entire
bet amount (i.e., his number of coins will decrease by y ).

Note that the bet amount must always be a positive (> 0 ) integer and cannot
exceed Sasha's current number of coins.

Sasha also knows that there is a promotion at the casino: he cannot lose more
than x times in a row.

Initially, Sasha has a coins. He wonders whether he can place bets such that
he is guaranteed to win any number of coins. In other words, is it true that
for any integer n , Sasha can make bets so that for any outcome that does not
contradict the rules described above, at some moment of time he will have at
least n coins.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The single line of each test case contains three integers k, x and a (2 \leq k
\leq 30 , 1 \leq x \leq 100 , 1 \leq a \leq 10^9 ) — the number of times the
bet is increased in case of a win, the maximum number of consecutive losses,
and the initial number of coins Sasha has.

Output

For each test case, output "YES" (without quotes) if Sasha can achieve it and
"NO" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, the strings "yEs",
"yes" and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Note

In the first test case, Sasha can proceed as follows:

  * If Sasha places a bet for the first time or if he won the previous bet, then he places 1 coin.
  * If Sasha lost the previous bet, then he places 2 coins.

Note that Sasha cannot lose more than once in a row.

It can be proven that with this strategy, Sasha can obtain as many coins as he
wants.

In the second test case, Sasha can only place 1 coin for the first time. But
in case of a loss, he will not be able to place any more bets, so he will not
be able to guarantee having as many coins as he wants.

- Program:
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (k, x, a) = map(int, s.split())
        if x < k - 1:
            if a >= x + 1:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        elif x == k - 1:
            if a >= x + 2:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        else:
            z = k - 2
            for i in range(x - k + 3):
                z += z // (k - 1) + 1
            if a >= z:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads input values for `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a` from standard input. It then iterates through these values, performing calculations based on the given conditions. Specifically, it calculates a value `z` based on the relationship between `x` and `k`, and checks if `a` is greater than or equal to `z`. If so, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value but prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each set of input values.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Sasha needs to ensure he can win any number of coins by placing bets.
   - The bet amount must be a positive integer and cannot exceed Sasha's current number of coins.
   - Sasha can lose no more than `x` times in a row.
   - If Sasha wins, his coins increase by `y * (k - 1)` where `y` is the bet amount.
   - If Sasha loses, he loses the entire bet amount.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The function `func()` reads input from standard input and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it extracts `k`, `x`, and `a` from the input string.
   - The logic in the code checks different conditions to determine if Sasha can achieve his goal.

3. **Conditions in the Code:**
   - **Case 1:** `x < k - 1`
     - If Sasha can lose fewer than `k - 1` times in a row, he can always place a bet of 1 coin and win enough to cover any number of coins.
     - This condition is checked by ensuring `a >= x + 1`.
   - **Case 2:** `x == k - 1`
     - If Sasha can lose exactly `k - 1` times in a row, he needs at least `x + 2` coins to start.
     - This condition is checked by ensuring `a >= x + 2`.
   - **Case 3:** `x > k - 1`
     - Sasha needs to calculate the minimum number of coins required to ensure he can recover after losing `x` times in a row.
     - This is done using a loop that calculates `z` iteratively, which represents the minimum number of coins needed.
     - The condition is checked by comparing `a` with `z`.

4. **Verification:**
   - The code correctly handles the different scenarios based on the values of `x` and `k`.
   - The logic for calculating `z` ensures that Sasha can recover from losing `x` times in a row.
   - The conditions for `x < k - 1` and `x == k - 1` are correctly implemented.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The code accurately determines whether Sasha can achieve his goal based on the given constraints.
   - The examples provided in the problem statement are correctly handled by the code.
