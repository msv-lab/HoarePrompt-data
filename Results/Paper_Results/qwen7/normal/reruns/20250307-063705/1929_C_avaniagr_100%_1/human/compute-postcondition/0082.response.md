Output State: **`i` is `n + 2`, `z` is `2 * (z + z // (k - 1) + 1)`**

Explanation: Initially, `i` is set to `n + 2` and `z` is set to `z + z // (k - 1) + 1`. The code then updates `z` by adding `z // (k - 1) + 1` to its current value. Since the initial value of `z` was `z + z // (k - 1) + 1`, the new value of `z` becomes `2 * (z + z // (k - 1) + 1)`. The value of `i` remains unchanged.
