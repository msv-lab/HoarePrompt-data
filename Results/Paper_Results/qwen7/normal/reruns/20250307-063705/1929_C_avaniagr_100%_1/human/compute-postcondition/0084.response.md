Output State: The value of `z` will be `3 * (z + z // (k - 1) + 1)`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `x - k + 3`. For each iteration, `z` is updated by adding `z // (k - 1) + 1` to its current value. Since the loop runs `x - k + 3` times, the final value of `z` will be the initial value of `z` plus the sum of `z // (k - 1) + 1` added three times (as per the given pattern for the first three iterations). This can be generalized to `3 * (z + z // (k - 1) + 1)`.
