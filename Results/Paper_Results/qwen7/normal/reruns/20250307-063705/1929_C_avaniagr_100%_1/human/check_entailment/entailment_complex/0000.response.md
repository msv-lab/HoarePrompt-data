Reasoning:
Let's analyze the logic of the provided program step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the solution to the problem.

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case. This part is correct and aligns with the problem statement.

2. **Conditions and Calculations**:
   - For each test case, the program reads `k`, `x`, and `a`.
   - The program checks different conditions based on the values of `x` relative to `k - 1`:
     - If `x < k - 1`, it checks if `a >= x + 1`. If true, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
     - If `x == k - 1`, it checks if `a >= x + 2`. If true, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
     - If `x > k - 1`, it performs a more complex calculation involving the variable `z`:
       - `z` is initialized to `k - 2`.
       - A loop runs from `0` to `x - k + 2`, updating `z` based on the formula `z += z // (k - 1) + 1`.
       - After the loop, it checks if `a >= z`. If true, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

3. **Complexity and Logic**:
   - The logic for calculating `z` when `x > k - 1` seems to be designed to ensure that Sasha can eventually accumulate enough coins to reach any desired amount `n`.
   - The formula `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` is used to simulate the growth of Sasha's potential winnings, considering the constraints of the game.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where `x` is less than `k - 1` or equal to `k - 1` correctly.
   - The more complex case where `x > k - 1` is handled by ensuring that `z` grows sufficiently large to cover the required number of wins and losses.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on the conditions checked, which matches the problem requirements.

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if Sasha can achieve any number of coins given the constraints. The program handles all specified cases and outputs the correct results.

Correctness: **True**
