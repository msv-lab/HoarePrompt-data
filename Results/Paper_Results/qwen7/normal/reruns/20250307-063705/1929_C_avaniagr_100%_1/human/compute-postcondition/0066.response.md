Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `k` is the first integer from the input stream, `x` is the second integer from the input stream, `a` is the third integer from the input stream, and `z` is increased by `z // (k - 1) + 1` a total of `x - k + 3` times if `x != k - 1`. If `x == k - 1`, no changes are made to `z`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`, no change is made to `z`.
