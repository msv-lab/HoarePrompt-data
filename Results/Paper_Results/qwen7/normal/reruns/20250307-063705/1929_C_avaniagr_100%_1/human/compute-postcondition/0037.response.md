Postcondition: **`k` is set to the first value in the input stream split by spaces, `x` is set to the second value in the input stream split by spaces, `i` is equal to `x - k + 2`, and `z` is increased by `z // (k - 1) + 1` for each iteration from 0 to `x - k + 2`. Whether `a` is greater than or equal to `z` or less than `z`, the final values of `k`, `x`, `i`, and `z` remain the same as described above.**
