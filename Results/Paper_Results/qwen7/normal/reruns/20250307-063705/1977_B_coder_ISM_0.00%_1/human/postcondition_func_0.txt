The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case involves reading a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and another positive integer `x` (1 ≤ x < 2^30). For each test case, it converts `x` into its binary representation, manipulates this binary string according to specific rules, and prints the modified binary string along with its length. The function ensures that the final binary string adheres to certain conditions and outputs the length and the modified string for each test case.
