Output State: **`i` is 1; `flag` is 0; `s[1]` is '1'**

Explanation: The variable `flag` is reassigned the value `0`. The initial value of `i` is `1`, and `s[1]` is `'1'`, which determines the initial value of `flag`. Since `s[1]` is `'1'`, `flag` was initially `1`. After executing `flag = 0`, the value of `flag` changes to `0`. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
