Postcondition: `i` is 0, `flag` is 0, `s[i]` is not '1', or `s[i]` is '1' but `flag` is not 0, or `s[i]` is '1' and `s[i]` is equal to `s[i + 1]`. If `flag` is 1, then `i` is 0, `flag` is 1, and `s[i]` is '0'. Otherwise, `i` is 0 and `flag` remains as 0, `s[i]` is not '1', or `s[i]` is '1' but `flag` is not 0, or `s[i]` is '1' and `s[i]` is equal to `s[i + 1]`.
