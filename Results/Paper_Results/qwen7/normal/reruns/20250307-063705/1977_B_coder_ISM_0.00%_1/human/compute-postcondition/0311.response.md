Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 31.
- `length` is greater than 31.
- The value of `s[30]` is `-1`.
- The value of `s[31]` does not exist or is unchanged from its initial state, which was a list of 30 elements.

When the `print(*s)` statement is executed, it will print the elements of the list `s`. Since `s` is a list of 30 elements and `s[31]` does not exist, the list `s` will only contain the first 30 elements.

Therefore, the output will be the elements of the list `s` up to index 29, followed by `-1` at index 30.

Output: **-1**
