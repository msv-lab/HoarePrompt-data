Output State: **`i` is 28, `flag` is True, `s` is ['0', '1']**

The code `s.append('1')` adds the string `'1'` to the list `s`. Initially, `s[29]` is `'0'`, which means the list `s` has at least 30 elements. After appending `'1'` to `s`, the list `s` becomes `['0', '1']`. The values of `i` and `flag` remain unchanged.
