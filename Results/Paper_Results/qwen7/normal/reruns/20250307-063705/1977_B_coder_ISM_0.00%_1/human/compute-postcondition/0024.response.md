Output State: `t` must be greater than 0, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list of length 30. The list `s` will contain 30 elements, each being either '1' or '0', based on whether the corresponding bit in the integer `x` is set. Specifically, `s[0]` corresponds to the least significant bit of `x`, and `s[29]` corresponds to the most significant bit of `x` that is checked within the loop (since the loop runs from `i=0` to `i=29`).

This means that after the loop completes all 30 iterations, the list `s` will represent the binary representation of the integer `x`, with the least significant bit (rightmost bit) at index 0 and the most significant bit (leftmost bit) at index 29.
