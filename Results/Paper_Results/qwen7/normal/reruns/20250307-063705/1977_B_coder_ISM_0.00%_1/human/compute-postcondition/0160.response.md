Postcondition: `flag` remains 0, and the character at index `i + 1` of string `s` is either '0' or '1'. Either the character at index `i + 2` is not '1', or the character at index `i + 1` is not equal to the character at index `i + 2`. If `flag` is 1, the character at index `i + 1` of string `s` is now '-1'.
