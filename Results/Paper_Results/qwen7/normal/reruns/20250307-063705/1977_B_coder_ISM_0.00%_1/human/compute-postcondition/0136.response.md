Postcondition: `flag` is a boolean and `s[i]` is a character in the string `s`. If `flag` is true and the character at index `i` of string `s` is '0', then no change is made to the variables. If `flag` is false or the character at index `i` of string `s` is not '0', then no change is made to the variables.
