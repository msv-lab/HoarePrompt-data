Output State: `i` is 29, `x` is an integer, and `s` is a list of 30 elements. Each element in `s` is either '1' or '0', depending on whether `x` has the corresponding bit set (i.e., if `x & pow(2, i)` is true for each `i` from 0 to 29). The list `s` is constructed such that `s[i]` is '1' if the \(i\)-th bit of `x` is set, and '0' otherwise.
