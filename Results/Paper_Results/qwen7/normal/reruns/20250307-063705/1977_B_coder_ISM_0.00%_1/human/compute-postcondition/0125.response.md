Output State: **`i` is 29, `length` is 30, `nalla` is 28, `s` is a list containing ['0', '0', '0']**.

Explanation: Initially, `s` is a list of two elements. The code snippet appends the string `'0'` to the list `s`. Since `s` originally contained `['0', '1']` (based on the condition `x & pow(2, 28)` is not 0) or `['1', '0']` or `['0', '0']` (if the condition is 0), appending `'0'` results in `['0', '0', '0']`. All other variables remain unchanged.
