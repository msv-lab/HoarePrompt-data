Output State: **`s` is updated such that the element at index `i` is now '1', `flag` is 0.**

The variable `flag` is initialized to 0, but no changes are made to the variable `s` other than its specific element at index `i` being set to '1'. Therefore, the state of `s` remains as initially described, and `flag` is simply set to 0.
