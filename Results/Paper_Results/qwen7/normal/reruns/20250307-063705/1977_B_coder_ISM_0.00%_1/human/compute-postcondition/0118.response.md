Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`. However, since `n` is not explicitly mentioned in the state, we infer that the loop runs based on the condition `i < n`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 27
   - `length` is 30
   - `nalla` is 28
   - `s` is either `['1']` or `['0']` depending on the condition `x & pow(2, i)`

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - The loop condition is `i < n`. Since `n` is not explicitly given, we assume it is `length` (30) based on the context.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n` (30).
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 27. Therefore, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 to become 28.
   - The condition `i < n` must still hold true, so `i` should be 28 and `n` (which is `length`) should remain 30.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` needs to be updated to 28.
   - `length` remains 30.
   - `nalla` remains 28.
   - `s` remains either `['1']` or `['0']` depending on the condition `x & pow(2, i)`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 28, `length` is 30, `nalla` is 28, `s` is either `['1']` or `['0']` depending on whether `x & pow(2, i)` is not 0 or 0 respectively.**
