Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list of length 32, and `i` is 2. If `x` has the bit corresponding to `i` (which is 2) set, then no change is made to `t`, `x`, `s`, or `i`. If `x` does not have the bit corresponding to `i` set, then no change is made to `t`, `x`, `s`, or `i`.
