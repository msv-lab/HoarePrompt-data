Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `x` is an input integer.
   - `s` is a list of length 30 or 31.
   - `i` is 1.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `i` in `range(30)`, meaning `i` starts from 0 and goes up to 29.

3. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will become 2.

5. **Condition for Appending to List `s`:**
   - If the `i`-th bit of `x` is set, then '1' is appended to the list `s`.
   - Since `i` is now 2, we need to check if the 2nd bit of `x` is set.

6. **Possible States After the Next Iteration:**
   - `t` remains greater than 0 because it is not modified within the loop.
   - `x` remains the same because it is not modified within the loop.
   - `s` remains a list of length 30 or 31 because the list is not modified unless the 2nd bit of `x` is set, but we don't know the value of `x` yet.
   - `i` is incremented to 2.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list of length 30 or 31, and `i` is 2**.
