Output State: **`i` is 29, `length` is 30, `nalla` is 28, `s` is a list containing ['0', '1', '1'].**

Explanation: The code `s.append('1')` adds the string `'1'` to the end of the list `s`. Initially, `s` is a list containing two elements, which are `['0', '1']`. After appending `'1'` to `s`, the list `s` becomes `['0', '1', '1']`. The values of the other variables (`i`, `length`, and `nalla`) remain unchanged.
