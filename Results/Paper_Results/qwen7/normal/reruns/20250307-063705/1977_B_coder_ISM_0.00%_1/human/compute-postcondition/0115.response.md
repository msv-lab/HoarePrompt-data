Output State: **`i` is 27, `length` is 30, `s` is ['0'], `nalla` is 28, `(x & pow(2, i))` is False**

The code `s.append('0')` adds the string '0' to the list `s`. Since `s` was initially an empty list, after appending '0', `s` becomes `['0']`. The values of the other variables (`i`, `length`, `nalla`, and the condition involving `x`) remain unchanged.
