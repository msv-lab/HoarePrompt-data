Postcondition: `s` is a string, and `flag` remains 0. If the character at index `i` in `s` is '0' and `flag` is true, then the character at index `i` is updated to '1'. If the condition `flag == 0 and s[i] == s[i + 1] and (s[i] == '1')` is true, the character at index `i` in `s` is updated to '-1'. Otherwise, `s` remains unchanged.
