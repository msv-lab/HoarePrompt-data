Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies the variable `i` and the range `range(30)`. Therefore, the only variable that can be adjusted is `i`.

2. **Determine the current value of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is within the range `[1, 30]`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than 30.

4. **Adjust the state**: Since the loop will execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value. Therefore, if `i` was previously within the range `[1, 29]`, it will now be within the range `[2, 30]`.

5. **Postcondition adjustment**: The postcondition for the loop remains the same, but the value of `i` changes.

Given these points, we can now state the modified state:

**State: **`i` is within the range [2, 30], `x` is an integer, and `s` is a list containing either '1' or '0'. If `x & pow(2, i)` is true, then an additional '1' is appended to `s`. Otherwise, an additional '0' is appended to `s`.**
