Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list of length 30 with '1' appended to it, `i` is 1**

Explanation: The code `s.append('1')` appends the string `'1'` to the list `s`. Since `s` was initially a list of length 30, after appending `'1'`, its length becomes 31. All other variables (`t`, `x`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
