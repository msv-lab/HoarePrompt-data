Output State: **`i` must be within the range [0, 29]; `x` is such that when bitwise AND operation is performed with \(2^i\), the result is non-zero; `s` is a list containing '1'.**

The code `s.append('1')` adds the string `'1'` to the list `s`. Since the conditions on `i` and `x` remain unchanged, they are included in the output state.
