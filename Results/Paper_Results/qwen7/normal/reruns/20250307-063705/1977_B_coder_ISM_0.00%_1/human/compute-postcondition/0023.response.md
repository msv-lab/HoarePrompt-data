Output State: `t` must be greater than 0, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list of length 30. The list `s` contains 30 elements, each being either '0' or '1', based on the binary representation of `x`. Specifically, `s[29]` corresponds to the least significant bit of `x`, and `s[0]` corresponds to the most significant bit of `x` that fits within the first 30 bits of `x`.

This means that after the loop completes all 30 iterations, the list `s` will represent the binary form of the integer `x` in reverse order, with the least significant bit at the end of the list.
