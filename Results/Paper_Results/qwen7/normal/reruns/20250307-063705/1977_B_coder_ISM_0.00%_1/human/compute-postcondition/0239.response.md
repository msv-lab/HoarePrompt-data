Postcondition: `i` is 0, `x` is an integer, `s` is a list containing 30 elements, each being either '1' or '0', and `flag` is 0. If the current value of `s[i]` is '1', the condition in the if statement is false, so the value of `s[i]` remains unchanged. Since there is no else part, the value of `s[i]` remains as it was initially, which is either '1' or '0'.
