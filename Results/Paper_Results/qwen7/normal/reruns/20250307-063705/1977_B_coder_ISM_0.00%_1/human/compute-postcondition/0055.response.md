Output State: **`i` is 1, `flag` is 1**.

The value of `i` remains unchanged at 1. The value of `flag` is explicitly set to 1, regardless of its previous value which was determined by `s[1]`. Since `s[1]` is now known to be '-1', the condition for `flag` being 0 is no longer met, thus `flag` is updated to 1.
