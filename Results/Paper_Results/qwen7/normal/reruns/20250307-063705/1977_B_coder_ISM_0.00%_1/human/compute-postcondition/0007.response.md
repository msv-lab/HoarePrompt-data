Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list containing '1', `i` is 0, length is 30, the current value of `x` satisfies the condition of being such that when bitwise ANDed with 2 raised to the power of `i`, the result is non-zero**.

Explanation: The code snippet `s.append('1')` appends the string `'1'` to the list `s`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
