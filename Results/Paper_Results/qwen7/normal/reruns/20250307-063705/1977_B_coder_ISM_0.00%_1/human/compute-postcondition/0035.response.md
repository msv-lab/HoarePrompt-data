Output State: **`i` is 0, `flag` is 0, `s[i]` is '-1', `s[i]` is equal to `s[i + 1]'.**

Explanation: The code changes the value of `s[i]` from '1' to '-1'. Since `i` is 0, `s[i]` which was originally '1' is now '-1'. The values of `i` and `flag` remain unchanged, and the condition `s[i]` is equal to `s[i + 1]` still holds true because `s[0]` is now '-1' and assuming `s[1]` is also '-1'.
