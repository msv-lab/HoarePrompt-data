Output State: **`i` is 1, `flag` remains either 0 or 1 depending on the value of `s[1]`, `s[1]` is now '-1'**.

Explanation: The code `s[i] = '-1'` changes the value of `s[1]` to '-1'. The values of `i` and `flag` remain unchanged from their initial states. The flag's value depends on the initial value of `s[1]`: if `s[1]` was '0', the flag remains 0; otherwise, it remains 1.
