Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and `n`. However, since the initial value of `n` is not provided, we focus on `i`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `0` to `29`, so the loop continues as long as `i < 29`.

3. **Analyze the postconditions**:
   - `flag` remains `0`.
   - The character at index `i + 1` of string `s` is either `'0'` or `'1'`.
   - Either the character at index `i + 2` is not `'1'` or `s[i + 1]` is not equal to `s[i + 2]`.
   - If `flag` is `1`, the character at index `i + 1` of string `s` is now `'-'`.

4. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from `0` and increments by `1` each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would be `28`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `29`. Therefore, `i` should be set to `29` at the start of the next iteration.

5. **Adjust the other states**:
   - `flag` remains `0` as per the postcondition.
   - The character at index `i + 1` (which is `29 + 1 = 30`) does not exist in the string `s`, but this does not affect the loop continuation condition.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`flag` is 0, and the character at index `i + 1` of string `s` is either '0' or '1', and either the character at index `i + 2` is not '1' or `s[i + 1]` is not equal to `s[i + 2]`, and `i` is 29**.
