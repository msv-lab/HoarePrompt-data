Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, length)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `length`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `length`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 30.
   - `length` must be greater than 30.
   - If `s[29]` is '-1' and `s[28]` is '1', no changes are made to the variables.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 from its current value of 30.
   - Therefore, `i` will be 31.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must still be less than `length`. Since `length` is greater than 30, `i` being 31 is still valid as long as `length` is greater than 31.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be 31.
   - `length` must still be greater than 31 (since `i` is now 31 and the loop condition is `i < length`).

6. **Consider the Postcondition**:
   - The postcondition about `s[29]` and `s[28]` does not affect the loop itself but might affect the loop body. However, since we are only concerned with adjusting the loop head variables, this postcondition does not change the loop head state directly.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is 31, `length` must be greater than 31**.
