Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 29.
   - `x` is an integer.
   - `s` is a list containing 30 elements, each being either '1' or '0'.
   - Each element in `s` is determined by the result of the bitwise AND operation between `x` and \(2^i\), where `i` ranges from 0 to 29.

2. **Bitwise AND Operation:**
   - For each `i` in the range [0, 29], the value of \(2^i\) is a power of 2 with a single bit set to 1 at position `i`.
   - The bitwise AND operation `x & 2^i` will result in a non-zero value ('1') if the `i`-th bit of `x` is set to 1, and zero ('0') otherwise.

3. **Constructing List `s`:**
   - Since `i` is 29, the loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = 29`.
   - For each `i`, the value of `2^i` will have a single bit set to 1 at position `i`.
   - Therefore, `x & 2^i` will be '1' if the `i`-th bit of `x` is set to 1, and '0' otherwise.
   - This means that the list `s` will contain '1' at positions corresponding to the bits that are set to 1 in the binary representation of `x`, and '0' at all other positions.

4. **Printing the List `s`:**
   - The `print(*s)` statement will print the list `s` without any spaces between the elements.
   - Since `s` contains 30 elements, and each element is either '1' or '0', the printed output will be a sequence of 30 characters, where each character is either '1' or '0'.

Given the above reasoning, the output will be a sequence of 30 characters, where each character is either '1' or '0', depending on the bits of `x`.

Output: **'000...0001' (30 zeros followed by a single '1')**
