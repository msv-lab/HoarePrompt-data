Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `length`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop runs as long as `i` is within the range from 1 to `length - 1`. This means `i` should be incremented by 1 each time the loop runs.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 29
   - `length` is greater than 29

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 30.
   - The condition for the loop to continue (`i < length`) still needs to hold true. Since `length` is greater than 29, it will still be true when `i` becomes 30.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be 30.
   - `length` remains unchanged and must still be greater than 30.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 30, `length` must be greater than 30**
