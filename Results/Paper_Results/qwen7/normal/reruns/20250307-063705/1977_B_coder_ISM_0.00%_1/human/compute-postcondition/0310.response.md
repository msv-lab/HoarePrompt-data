Output: **length (where length is a value greater than 31)**

Explanation:
- The variable `i` is explicitly given as 31.
- The variable `length` is described as being greater than 31, but no specific value is provided.
- The list `s` is described as having 30 elements, with `s[30]` being explicitly set to '-1', and `s[31]` not existing or being unchanged from its initial state (which was a list of 30 elements).

Since the `print(length)` statement only outputs the value of `length`, and `length` is stated to be greater than 31, the output will be `length` where `length` is a value greater than 31.
