Output State: **`i` is within the range [2, 30], `x` is an integer, `s` is a list containing '1' as its last element.**

Explanation: The code snippet `s.append('1')` appends the string `'1'` to the list `s`. The values of `i` and `x` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `i` is still within the range [2, 30], `x` remains an integer, and `s` now contains `'1'` as its last element.
