Output State: **`flag` is 0, the character at index 29 of string `s` is '0', the character at index 30 of string `s` is '1', and the length of string `s` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `s.append('1')` adds the character '1' to the end of the string `s`. Since the initial state of the character at index 29 of string `s` is '0' and the character at index 30 is either '0' or '1', appending '1' to the end of the string means the new character at the last index (which was index 29 before) is now '1'. The `flag` remains unchanged at 0, and the length of the string `s` increases by 1.
