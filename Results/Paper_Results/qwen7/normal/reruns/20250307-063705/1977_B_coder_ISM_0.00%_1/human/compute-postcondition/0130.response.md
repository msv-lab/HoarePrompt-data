Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 29.
- `length` is 30.
- `nalla` is 28.
- `s` is a list of 30 elements where each element is either `'0'` or `'1'`. The value of each element in `s` depends on the expression `x & pow(2, i)` for each `i` from 0 to 29. Specifically, if `x & pow(2, i)` is not 0, the corresponding element in `s` is `'1'`, otherwise it is `'0'`.

The expression `x & pow(2, i)` checks if the `i`-th bit of `x` is set. Since `i` is 29, we need to check the 29th bit of `x` for each `i` from 0 to 29. However, the exact value of `x` is not provided, so we cannot determine the exact contents of the list `s`.

Given this, the print statement `print(*s)` will print the list `s` with 30 elements, each being either `'0'` or `'1'` based on the 29th bit of `x` for each `i` from 0 to 29.

Output: **'0' '0' '0' ... '0' '1' '0' '0' ... '0' (30 elements, 29 of which are '0' and the last one is '1' if the 29th bit of x is set, otherwise all are '0')**
