Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list of length 30 or 31, and `i` is 1. If `x` has the `i`-th bit set (where `i` is 1), then '1' is appended to the list `s`. Otherwise, `s` remains a list of length 30 or becomes a list of length 31 depending on the original state.
