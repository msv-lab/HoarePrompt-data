Output State: **`flag` is 0, the length of string `s` is increased by 2, the character at index 29 of string `s` is '0', the character at index 30 of string `s` is '1'**.

Explanation: The code `length += 1` increases the value of `length` by 1. Initially, the length of string `s` was increased by 1, so now it is increased by 2. The values of `flag`, the characters at indices 29 and 30 of string `s` remain unchanged.
