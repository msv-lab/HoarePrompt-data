Postcondition: `flag` is 0, and the character at index 29 of string `s` is '1', and either the character at index 31 of string `s` is not '1' or `s[30]` is not equal to `s[30]`. This is because the else part of the if-else block does not change these conditions, regardless of whether the if condition is met or not.
