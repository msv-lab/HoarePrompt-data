Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list of length 31, `i` is 1**

Explanation: The code `s.append('0')` adds the string `'0'` to the end of the list `s`. Since `s` initially has a length of 30, after appending `'0'`, its length becomes 31. The values of `t`, `x`, and `i` remain unchanged.
