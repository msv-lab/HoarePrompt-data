Output State: **`i` is 1; `x` is an integer; `s` is a list containing 30 elements, each being either '1' or '0'; `s[1]` is '-1'; `flag` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `s[i] = '-1'` updates the element at index `i` in the list `s` to '-1'. Given that the initial state of `i` is 1, the element `s[1]` is updated to '-1'. The values of `x`, `s` (with the updated element), and `flag` remain unchanged from their initial states.
