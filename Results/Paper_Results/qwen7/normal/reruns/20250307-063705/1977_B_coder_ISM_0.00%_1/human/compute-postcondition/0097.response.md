Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables and conditions:**
   - The loop variable is `i`.
   - The loop runs from `1` to `length - 1` (inclusive).
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than `length`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration:**
   - `i` is 2.
   - `length` is greater than 28.
   - No changes are made to the variables if `s[i-1]` is '-1' and `s[i]` is '0'.

3. **Determine the next value of `i`:**
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` would be `3`.

4. **Check the condition for the next iteration:**
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `length`.
   - Given that `length` is greater than 28, `i = 3` is indeed less than `length`.

5. **Adjust the states:**
   - `i` will be incremented to 3.
   - `length` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is 3, `length` is greater than 28**
