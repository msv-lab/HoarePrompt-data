Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `length`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop starts with `i = 1` and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration.
   - The loop continues as long as `i < length`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `flag` is 0
   - `i` is 3
   - `length` is greater than 1

4. **Check if the loop can continue**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `length`.
   - Given `i` is currently 3, `length` must be greater than 3 for the loop to execute one more time.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 from 3 to 4.
   - `length` must remain greater than 3.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`flag` is 0, `i` is 4, `length` is greater than 3**
