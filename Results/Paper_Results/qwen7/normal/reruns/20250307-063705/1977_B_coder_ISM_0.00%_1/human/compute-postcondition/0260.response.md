Output State: **`i` is 1; `x` is an integer; `s` is a list containing 30 elements, each being either '1' or '0'; `s[1]` is '-1'; `flag` is 1.**

The code `flag = 1` simply reassigns the value of `flag` to 1, which was its original value. Therefore, the values of the other variables remain unchanged.
