Output State: **`i` is 28, `length` is 30, `nalla` is 28, `s` is either `['1', '0']` or `['0', '0']` depending on whether `x & pow(2, i)` is not 0 or 0 respectively.**

Explanation: The code appends `'0'` to the list `s`. Initially, `s` is either `['1']` or `['0']` depending on the condition `x & pow(2, i)`. After appending `'0'`, `s` becomes either `['1', '0']` or `['0', '0']` based on the same condition. The values of `i`, `length`, and `nalla` remain unchanged.
