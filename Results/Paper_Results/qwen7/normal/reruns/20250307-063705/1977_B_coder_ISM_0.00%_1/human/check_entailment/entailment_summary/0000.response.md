Reasoning:
1. **Binary Representation**: The program correctly converts the integer `x` into its binary representation using a loop that checks each bit position from 0 to 29.
2. **Modification Rules**: The program then modifies the binary string according to the specified rules:
   - If a '1' is found, it sets the previous bit to '-1' if it is '1'.
   - It ensures no consecutive non-zero bits ('1' or '-1').
   - It handles edge cases where the last bit is '0' or '1' by adjusting the string and length accordingly.
3. **Output**: The program outputs the length of the modified array and the array itself, which should satisfy the problem's requirements.

Given the execution summary and the provided example, the program appears to follow the rules and constraints correctly. The modifications ensure that the binary representation meets the criteria of having no consecutive non-zero bits and adheres to the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
