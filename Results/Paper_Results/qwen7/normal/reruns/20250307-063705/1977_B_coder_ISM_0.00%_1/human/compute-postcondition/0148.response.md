Postcondition: `flag` is 0, the character at index `i` of string `s` is '1', and either the character at index `i+1` of string `s` is not '1' or `s[i]` is not equal to `s[i+1]`. If `flag` is 1, the character at index `i` of string `s` changes to '0', and either the character at index `i+1` is not '1' or `s[i]` is not equal to `s[i+1]`.
