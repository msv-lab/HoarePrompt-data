Output State: **`t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and all other variables remain unchanged.**

This means that the variable `t` now holds the value entered by the user, converted to an integer, while `x` and any other variables remain in their initial or unchanged state.
