Output State: **`i` is 30; `length` must be greater than 30; `s[29]` is '-1'**

The code `s[i - 1] = '-1'` updates the character at index `i - 1` in the string `s` to be `'-'1'`. Given that `i` is 30, `i - 1` is 29, so `s[29]` is now `'-'1'`. The other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
