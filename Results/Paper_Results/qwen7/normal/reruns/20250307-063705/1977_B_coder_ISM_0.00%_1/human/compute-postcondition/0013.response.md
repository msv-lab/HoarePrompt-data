Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in the given for loop is `i`. The loop runs from `0` to `29`, inclusive.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `30`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `x` is an input integer.
   - `s` is a list of length 30.
   - If the bitwise AND of `x` and \(2^i\) is non-zero, then `s[i]` contains '1'. Otherwise, `s[i]` contains '0'.

4. **Analyze the loop head**:
   - The loop head involves the variable `i`.

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 at each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value `k` (where \(0 \leq k < 29\)).
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to `k + 1`.
   - Therefore, `i` should be set to `k + 1`.

6. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will continue if `i` is still less than `30`.
   - After incrementing `i` to `k + 1`, `i` will be `k + 1`, which is still less than `30` since `k < 29`.

7. **Update the state**:
   - `t` remains unchanged because it is not involved in the loop head.
   - `x` remains unchanged because it is not involved in the loop head.
   - `s` remains unchanged because it is not involved in the loop head.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list of length 30, `i` is 1** (since `i` was `0` at the start and is incremented by 1).
