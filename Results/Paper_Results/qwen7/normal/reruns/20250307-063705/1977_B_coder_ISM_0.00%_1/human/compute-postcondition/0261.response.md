Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is an integer, `s` is a list containing 30 elements where the second element is '0' and all other elements remain either '1' or '0', and `flag` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `s[i] = '0'` changes the value of the element at index `i` in the list `s` to '0'. Given that `i` is 1, the second element of the list `s` (index 1) is now '0'. All other elements in the list remain unchanged, and the values of `x` and `flag` remain the same as the initial state.
