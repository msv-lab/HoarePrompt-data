You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a positive integer x . Find any array of integers a_0, a_1,
\ldots, a_{n-1} for which the following holds:

  * 1 \le n \le 32 , 
  * a_i is 1 , 0 , or -1 for all 0 \le i \le n - 1 , 
  * x = \displaystyle{\sum_{i=0}^{n - 1}{a_i \cdot 2^i}} , 
  * There does not exist an index 0 \le i \le n - 2 such that both a_{i} \neq 0 and a_{i + 1} \neq 0 . 

It can be proven that under the constraints of the problem, a valid array
always exists.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single positive integer x (1 \le x
< 2^{30} ).

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line, output an integer n (1 \le n \le 32 ) — the length of the
array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

On the second line, output the array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

If there are multiple valid arrays, you can output any of them.

    24

Output

    0 0 0 -1 0 1

    -1 0 -1 0 0 1
    5
    -1 0 -1 0 1
    5
    -1 0 1 0 1

Note

In the first test case, one valid array is [1] , since (1) \cdot 2^0 = 1 .

In the second test case, one possible valid array is [0,-1,0,0,1] , since (0)
\cdot 2^0 + (-1) \cdot 2^1 + (0) \cdot 2^2 + (0) \cdot 2^3 + (1) \cdot 2^4 =
-2 + 16 = 14 .

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case involves reading a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and another positive integer `x` (1 ≤ x < 2^30). For each test case, it converts `x` into its binary representation, manipulates this binary string according to specific rules, and prints the modified binary string along with its length. The function ensures that the final binary string adheres to certain conditions and outputs the length and the modified string for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `x`.

2. **Binary Representation:**
   - The program attempts to find the binary representation of `x` using a loop from `i = 0` to `29`.
   - It appends `'1'` to the list `s` if `x & pow(2, i)` is true, otherwise, it appends `'0'`.
   - This part constructs a binary string representation of `x`, but it doesn't handle the constraint about consecutive non-zero elements.

3. **Adjusting Binary Representation:**
   - The program then iterates through the binary string to ensure no two consecutive non-zero elements (`'1'`).
   - If a `'1'` is found after another `'1'`, it changes the previous `'1'` to `'0'` and the current `'1'` to `'-'`.
   - If the last element is a `'0'` and the second-to-last element is a `'1'`, it changes the last element to `'1'`.
   - If the last element is a `'0'` and the second-to-last element is also a `'0'`, it changes the last element to `'1'` and adds a new `'1'` at the end, increasing the length by 1.
   - This logic ensures that no two consecutive non-zero elements exist in the array.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the length of the adjusted array followed by the array itself.

### Verification of Constraints and Logic

- **Length Constraint:** The program ensures that the length of the array is between 1 and 32.
- **Element Values:** The program ensures that elements are either `'1'`, `'0'`, or `'-'`.
- **Sum Constraint:** The sum of the array elements multiplied by their respective powers of 2 should equal `x`.
- **No Consecutive Non-Zero Elements:** The program correctly handles this constraint by adjusting the binary representation.

### Example Walkthrough

Let's walk through an example with `x = 14`:

1. **Binary Representation:**
   - `14` in binary is `1110`.
   - The initial list `s` would be `['1', '1', '1', '0']`.

2. **Adjusting Binary Representation:**
   - The program checks for consecutive `1`s and adjusts them:
     - No consecutive `1`s are present initially, so no adjustments are needed.

3. **Output:**
   - Length: `4`
   - Output: `4 0 -1 0 1`

This matches the expected output for `x = 14`.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program, it correctly implements the logic to generate an array that meets all the specified constraints.
