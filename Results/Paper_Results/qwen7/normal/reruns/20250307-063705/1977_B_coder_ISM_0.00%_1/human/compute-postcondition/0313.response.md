Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing multiple test cases where each test case consists of a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and another positive integer `x` (1 ≤ x < 2^30). For each test case, it returns either a specific value or an error message based on the relationship between `t` and `x`.**
