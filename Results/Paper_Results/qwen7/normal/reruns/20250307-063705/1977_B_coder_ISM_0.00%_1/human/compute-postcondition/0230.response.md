Output State: `i` is 29, `x` is an integer, and `s` is a list containing 30 elements, each being either '1' or '0'. The list `s` is constructed based on the bitwise AND operation between `x` and \(2^i\) for each `i` in the range [0, 29]. If `x & pow(2, i)` is true, then '1' is appended to `s`; otherwise, '0' is appended to `s`.
