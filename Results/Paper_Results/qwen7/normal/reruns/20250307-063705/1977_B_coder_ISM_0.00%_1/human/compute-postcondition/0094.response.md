Output State: **`i` is 2; `length` is greater than 28; `s[i - 1]` is '-1'; `s[i]` is '0'**

Explanation: The code `s[i - 1] = '-1'` updates the character at index `i - 1` in the string `s` to be `'-'1'`. Given that `i` is 2, `i - 1` is 1. So, the character at index 1 of the string `s` is now `'-'1'`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
