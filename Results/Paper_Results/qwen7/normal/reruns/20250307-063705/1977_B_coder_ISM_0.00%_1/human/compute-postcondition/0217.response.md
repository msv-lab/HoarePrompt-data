Postcondition: `i` is within the range [0, 29], `x` is an integer, and `s` is a list containing either '1' or '0'. If the bitwise AND operation between `x` and \(2^i\) results in a non-zero value, then `s` is a list containing '1'. Otherwise, if the bitwise AND operation results in zero, `s` is a list containing '0'.
