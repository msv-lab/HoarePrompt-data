Postcondition: **`flag` is 0, and the character at index 29 of string `s` is '1', and either the character at index 31 of string `s` is not '1' or `s[30]` is not equal to `s[30]`.**

This postcondition remains unchanged because the if part and the else part both maintain the same conditions for `flag`, the characters at indices 29 and 31 of string `s`, and the relationship between `s[30]`.
