Postcondition: **`flag` is 0, the character at index 29 of string `s` is '1', and the character at index 30 of string `s` is either '0' or '1'.** 

This postcondition reflects the fact that the `if` condition is never met (since `flag` is 0), and thus the `else` part of the statement is executed. As a result, the length of string `s` is increased by 2, making `s[29]` and `s[30]` the new characters added to the string, which are '0' and '1', respectively. The value of `flag` remains 0, and the state of `s[30]` (which was either '0' or '1' before the operation) remains unchanged because the `else` part does not modify it.
