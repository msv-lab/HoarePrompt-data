Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and all other variables remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for nalla in range(t):
    x = int(input())
    s = []
    length = 30
    for i in range(30):
        if x & pow(2, i):
            s.append('1')
        else:
            s.append('0')
    print(*s)
    flag = 0
    for i in range(0, 29):
        if flag and s[i] == '0':
            s[i] = '1'
            flag = 0
        if flag == 0 and s[i] == s[i + 1] and s[i] == '1':
            s[i] = '-1'
            flag = 1
        elif flag == 1:
            s[i] = '0'
        else:
            pass
    if flag and s[29] == '0':
        s[29] = '1'
    elif flag:
        s[29] = '0'
        s.append('1')
        length += 1
    for i in range(1, length):
        if (s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1'):
            s[i] = '0'
            s[i - 1] = '-1'
    print(length)
    print(*s)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `i` is 27, `length` is greater than 28, and `s` is a list where each element from index 1 to 27 follows the rule that if `s[i-1]` is '-1' and `s[i]` is '0', then `s[i]` is changed to '0'. All other elements in the list remain unchanged or follow the rules applied during the iterations.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will have reached the end of the list (27), `length` will still be greater than 28, and the list `s` will have been modified according to the specified condition in the loop body. Specifically, wherever the condition `(s[i-1] == '-1') & (s[i] == '0')` was met during the iterations, the value of `s[i]` was changed to '0'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: The flag remains 0, the index `i` is now equal to `length`, `length` is greater than 3, and the string `s` has been modified according to the conditions inside the loop. Specifically, every occurrence where `s[i]` is '-1' and `s[i - 1]` is '1' has been changed to `s[i]` being '0' and `s[i - 1]` being '-1'. No further changes will occur since the loop condition `i < length` will fail when `i` equals `length`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: i is 31, length is greater than 31, and the value of s[30] is '-1'. The value of s[31] does not exist or is unchanged from its initial state, which was a list of 30 elements.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
