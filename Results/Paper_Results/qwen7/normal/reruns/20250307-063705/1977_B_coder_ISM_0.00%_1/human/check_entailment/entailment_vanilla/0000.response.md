Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `x`.

2. **Binary Representation:**
   - The program attempts to find the binary representation of `x` using a loop from `i = 0` to `29`.
   - It appends `'1'` to the list `s` if `x & pow(2, i)` is true, otherwise, it appends `'0'`.
   - This part constructs a binary string representation of `x`, but it doesn't handle the constraint about consecutive non-zero elements.

3. **Adjusting Binary Representation:**
   - The program then iterates through the binary string to ensure no two consecutive non-zero elements (`'1'`).
   - If a `'1'` is found after another `'1'`, it changes the previous `'1'` to `'0'` and the current `'1'` to `'-'`.
   - If the last element is a `'0'` and the second-to-last element is a `'1'`, it changes the last element to `'1'`.
   - If the last element is a `'0'` and the second-to-last element is also a `'0'`, it changes the last element to `'1'` and adds a new `'1'` at the end, increasing the length by 1.
   - This logic ensures that no two consecutive non-zero elements exist in the array.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the length of the adjusted array followed by the array itself.

### Verification of Constraints and Logic

- **Length Constraint:** The program ensures that the length of the array is between 1 and 32.
- **Element Values:** The program ensures that elements are either `'1'`, `'0'`, or `'-'`.
- **Sum Constraint:** The sum of the array elements multiplied by their respective powers of 2 should equal `x`.
- **No Consecutive Non-Zero Elements:** The program correctly handles this constraint by adjusting the binary representation.

### Example Walkthrough

Let's walk through an example with `x = 14`:

1. **Binary Representation:**
   - `14` in binary is `1110`.
   - The initial list `s` would be `['1', '1', '1', '0']`.

2. **Adjusting Binary Representation:**
   - The program checks for consecutive `1`s and adjusts them:
     - No consecutive `1`s are present initially, so no adjustments are needed.

3. **Output:**
   - Length: `4`
   - Output: `4 0 -1 0 1`

This matches the expected output for `x = 14`.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program, it correctly implements the logic to generate an array that meets all the specified constraints.
