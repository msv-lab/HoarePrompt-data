Output State: **`i` is 29, `x` is an integer, `s` is a list of 30 elements where the 29th element is '0' and the 30th element is '1', and `flag` is 0.**

The code `s.append('1')` adds the string `'1'` to the end of the list `s`. Since `s` initially has 30 elements and the 29th element is `'0'`, after appending `'1'`, the list `s` will have 31 elements, with the 30th element being `'1'`. All other variables remain unchanged.
