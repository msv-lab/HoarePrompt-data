Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list of length 32, and `i` is 2.**

The code `s.append('0')` adds the string `'0'` to the list `s`. Since `s` originally had a length of either 30 or 31, after appending `'0'`, its length becomes 31 + 1 = 32. All other variables remain unchanged.
