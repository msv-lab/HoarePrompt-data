Output State: **`i` is 28, `length` is 30, `nalla` is 28, `s` is `['0', '1']`**.

Explanation: The variable `s` originally contains either `['1']` or `['0']` based on the condition `x & pow(2, i)`. After executing `s.append('1')`, the list `s` will now contain `['0', '1']` (assuming it was initially `['0']` since appending `'1'` to `['0']` results in `['0', '1']`). The values of `i`, `length`, and `nalla` remain unchanged.
