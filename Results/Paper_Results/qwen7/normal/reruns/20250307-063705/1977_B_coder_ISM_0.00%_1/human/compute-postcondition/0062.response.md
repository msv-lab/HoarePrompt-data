Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(0, 29)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than 29.

4. **Calculate the new state**: Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented from 1 to 2.

5. **Adjust the state**: The only variable that needs to be adjusted is `i`. The postcondition does not mention any changes to `flag` or `s[1]` within the loop, so these remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 2**
