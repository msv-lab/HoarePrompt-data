Postcondition: `j` is 0; `i` is `n - 1 - j`; if the current value of `s[i]` is '<', then `idx_B` is updated to `[i]`. If the length of `idx_B` is 0, `B` contains the value `0`. Otherwise, `x` is updated to `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)` and then appended to `B`. If the current value of `s[i]` is not '<', then no changes are made to `B` or `idx_B`.
