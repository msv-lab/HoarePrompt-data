Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is `n-2`, `l` and `r` remain unchanged, `a` is recalculated based on `i = 2`, `b` is recalculated based on `i = 2`.**

Explanation: The code `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. Since `j` was initially `n-1`, and assuming `r` was equal to `j`, after decrementing `r`, `j` becomes `n-2`. All other variables (`i`, `l`, `r`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged.
