Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `i` is 3.
   - `j` is either `n-1` or `n-2`.
   - `l` remains unchanged (though `l` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, it is assumed to be a variable that does not change).
   - `r` is `r-1`.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The expression being printed is `n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2`.

To determine what will be printed, we need to understand the components of this expression:
- `n` is not explicitly defined, but it must be a variable that is used in the context of the problem.
- `i` is given as 3.
- `idx_A[l - 1]` is a term that depends on the value of `l`. Since `l` is not explicitly defined, we cannot determine its exact value, but we know it is an index into the list `idx_A`.

Given the information, we can substitute the known values into the expression:
- `n - i` becomes `n - 3`.
- `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2` becomes `(3 - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2`.

Therefore, the expression simplifies to:
\[ n - 3 + (3 - idx_A[l - 1]) \times 2 \]

Since `n` and `idx_A[l - 1]` are not explicitly defined, we can only describe the expression in terms of these variables.

Output: **n - 3 + (3 - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2**
