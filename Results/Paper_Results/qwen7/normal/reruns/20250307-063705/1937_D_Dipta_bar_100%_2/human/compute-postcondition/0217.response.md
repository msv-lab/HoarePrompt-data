Postcondition: `i` is 3, `j` is either `n-1` or `n-2`, and `l` and `r` remain unchanged. If `l < r`, then `a` is `A[l]` and `x` is `r - (l + 2)`, and `b` is `b + (idx_B[r - 1] - 3) * (l + 1)` if `x >= 0`, otherwise `b` remains unchanged. If `l >= r`, then `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - 3) * r` and `b` is `A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (3 - idx_A[l - 1]) * r` if `l - r` is greater than 0, otherwise `i`, `j`, `a`, and `b` remain as they were initially.
