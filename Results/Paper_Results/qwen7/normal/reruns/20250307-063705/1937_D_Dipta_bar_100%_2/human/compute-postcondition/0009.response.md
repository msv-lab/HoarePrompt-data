Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n`, `i` is 0, `x` is `A[len(A) - 1] + (0 - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`, `A` is `[x]` appended at the end.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `x` to the list `A`. The value of `x` remains unchanged as it is not redefined within the code snippet. Therefore, `A` now contains the element `x` appended at the end. All other variables (`s`, `i`, and `x`) retain their initial or calculated values from the initial state.
