Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 2.
   - `j` is `n-1`.
   - `a` is equal to `A[2]`.
   - `b` is equal to `B[r-1] - B[r-(l+2)] - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1) + (idx_B[r - 1] - 2) * (l + 1)`.
   - `x` is `r - (l + 2)`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Determine Values:**
   - `i` is explicitly given as 2.
   - `a` is `A[2]`, but the value of `A[2]` is not provided, so we keep it as `A[2]`.
   - `b` is more complex, but we need to simplify it:
     - `x` is `r - (l + 2)`, but the values of `r` and `l` are not provided, so we keep it as `x = r - (l + 2)`.
     - Therefore, `b` becomes:
       \[
       b = B[r-1] - B[r-(l+2)] - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1) + (idx_B[r - 1] - 2) * (l + 1)
       \]

4. **Expression Simplification:**
   - The expression `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1` simplifies to:
     \[
     2A[2] + 2b + 2 + 1 = 2A[2] + 2b + 3
     \]

5. **Final Output:**
   - Since `i` is 2, `a` is `A[2]`, and `b` is the complex expression involving `B` and `idx_B`, the final output will be:
     \[
     2A[2] + 2b + 3
     \]

Therefore, the output is:
Output: **2A[2] + 2b + 3 (where A[2] is the third element of the list A, b is the complex expression involving B and idx_B, and the rest of the terms are as described)**
