Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Variables:**
   - `i` is 0.
   - `j` is `n-1`.
   - `idx_B` is a list containing all indices where `s` has a '<'.
   - `B` is a list where each element is calculated based on the formula `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)` for each '<' encountered, starting with `0` if `idx_B` is initially empty.
   - `l` is `0`.
   - `r` is `r - 1`.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `s[i]` is not '>', and the current value of `l` is equal to 0.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(i + 1, end=' ')
   ```

Given the initial state:
- `i` is explicitly given as 0.
- The `end=' '` in the `print` function means that the output will be followed by a space instead of a newline.

Therefore, the expression `i + 1` evaluates to `0 + 1`, which is `1`.

Output: **1**
