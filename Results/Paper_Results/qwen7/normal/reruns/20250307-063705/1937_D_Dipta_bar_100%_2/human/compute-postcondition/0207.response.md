Output State: **`i` is 3; `j` is either `n-1` or `n-2`; `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - 3) * r`**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `a` based on the values of `B[r - 1]`, `idx_B[r - 1]`, and `r`. Since `i` and `j` are not affected by this line of code, their values remain unchanged. The value of `a` is calculated as `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - 3) * r`.
