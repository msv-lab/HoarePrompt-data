Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `i` is 0.
   - `j` is `n-1`.
   - `idx_B` is a list containing all indices where `s` has a '<'.
   - `B` is a list where each element is calculated based on the formula `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)` for each '<' encountered, starting with `0` if `idx_B` is initially empty.
   - `l` is `r - 1`.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `s[i]` is not '>'.
   - `(l > r)` is true, and currently, `r` is 0.

2. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   - The print statement is `print(n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2, end=' ')`.

3. **Variable Values:**
   - From the initial state, we know `i` is 0.
   - Since `r` is 0, `l` is also 0 (because `l = r - 1`).
   - `idx_A` is not mentioned in the initial state, but it is referenced in the print statement. Given the context, it seems like there might be a typo, and it should be `idx_B` instead of `idx_A`. Let's assume `idx_A` is meant to be `idx_B`.

4. **Substituting Values into the Print Statement:**
   - `n` is greater than 0, so let's assume `n = 1` for simplicity (since the exact value of `n` is not specified).
   - `i` is 0.
   - `l` is 0.
   - `idx_B` is a list of indices where `s` has a '<'. Since `s[i]` is not '>', and `i` is 0, `s[0]` must be '<'. Therefore, `idx_B` contains at least 0.

5. **Calculating the Expression:**
   - The expression inside the print statement is `n - i + (i - idx_B[l - 1]) * 2`.
   - Substituting the values: `n - 0 + (0 - idx_B[0 - 1]) * 2`.
   - Since `l` is 0, `l - 1` is -1. If `idx_B` is `[0]`, then `idx_B[-1]` is undefined, but assuming `idx_B` is at least `[0]`, we can consider the next valid index, which would be 0.
   - So, `idx_B[0 - 1]` is 0 (assuming `idx_B` is `[0]`).

6. **Final Calculation:**
   - The expression becomes `1 - 0 + (0 - 0) * 2 = 1 + 0 = 1`.

Therefore, the print statement will output `1`.

Output: **1**
