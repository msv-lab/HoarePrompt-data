Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is `n-1`, `idx_B` is a list containing all indices where `s` has a '<', `B` is a list where each element is calculated based on the formula `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)` for each '<' encountered, starting with `0` if `idx_B` is initially empty, and `l` is greater than 0; `r` is `r - 1`, `n` is greater than 0, and `s[i]` is not '>', and the current value of `l` is less than or equal to the current value of `r`; `a` is `A[l - 1]`.**

Explanation: The variable `a` is assigned the value of `A[l - 1]`. All other variables retain their initial conditions or relationships as described in the initial state.
