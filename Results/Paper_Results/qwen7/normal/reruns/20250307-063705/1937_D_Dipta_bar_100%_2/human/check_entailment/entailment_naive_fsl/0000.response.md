Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for all cases. Specifically, consider the input `"><>"`:

- For the first cell (`i=0`), the pinball starts at `>`, moves right to `<`, then left to `>`, and finally right out of the grid. This should take 4 seconds.
- However, the program incorrectly calculates this as 3 seconds.

The issue lies in the logic for calculating the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid. The program seems to use a more complex approach involving arrays `A` and `B`, but it does not accurately reflect the movement and inversion rules described in the problem statement. A simpler and more direct approach would be to simulate the movement step-by-step until the pinball leaves the grid, updating the position and direction accordingly.
