Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is `n-1`, `idx_B` is a list containing all indices where `s` has a '<', `B` is a list where each element is calculated based on the formula `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)` for each '<' encountered, starting with `0` if `idx_B` is initially empty, and `l` is `0`; `r` is the length of list `B`, `n` must be greater than 0, the current value of `s[i]` is '>', and `l` is less than `r`; `a` is `A[0]`; `x` is `r - (l + 2)`, the current value of `x` is greater than or equal to 0, `b` is `B[r - 1] - B[x]`**

Explanation: The code subtracts `B[x]` from `b`. Since `x` is defined as `r - (l + 2)`, and `b` was previously `B[r - 1]`, the new value of `b` is `B[r - 1] - B[x]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
