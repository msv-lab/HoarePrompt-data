Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is `n-2`, `a` is `A[1] + (2 - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, `b` is `B[r] - B[r - l]`, `l` and `r` remain unchanged**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b` by subtracting `B[r - l]` from its current value. Since `i`, `j`, `a`, `l`, and `r` are not affected by this operation, their values remain unchanged. The new value of `b` is expressed as `B[r] - B[r - l]`.
