Output State: **`j` is 0; `i` is `n - 1 - j`; the current value of `s[i]` is '<'; `idx_B` is `[i]`; if the length of `idx_B` is 0, then `B` contains the value `0`. Otherwise, `x` is updated to `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)` and then appended to `B`.**

Explanation: The code `idx_B.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` to the list `idx_B`. Since `i` is `n - 1 - j` and `j` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`. Therefore, `idx_B` becomes `[i]` which is `[n - 1]`. The rest of the conditions and values remain unchanged.
