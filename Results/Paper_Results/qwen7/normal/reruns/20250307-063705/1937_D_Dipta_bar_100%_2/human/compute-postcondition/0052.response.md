Output State: **`j` is 1, `i` is `n - 3`, `x` is `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`**

Explanation: The code assigns a new value to `x` based on the last elements of lists `B` and `idx_B`. The value of `i` is `n - 3`, and `j` remains unchanged as 1. The exact numerical value of `x` cannot be determined without knowing the specific values of `B` and `idx_B`, so it is left in its formulaic form.
