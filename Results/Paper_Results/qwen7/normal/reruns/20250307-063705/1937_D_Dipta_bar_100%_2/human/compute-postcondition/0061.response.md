Output State: **`j` is 2, `i` is `n - 4`, `idx_B` remains as it was, `B` now contains `[0]`**

Explanation: The code snippet `B.append(0)` appends the value `0` to the list `B`. The initial values of `j`, `i`, `idx_B`, and `B` remain unchanged. After executing the code, `B` will contain the element `0`.
