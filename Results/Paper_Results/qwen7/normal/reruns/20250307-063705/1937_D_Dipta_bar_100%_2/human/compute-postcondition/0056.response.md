Output State: **`j` is 1, `i` is `n - 3`, `idx_B` is `[i]`, `B` is `[0]` if `idx_B` was empty, otherwise `B` is `[B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)]`**.

Explanation: The code appends the current value of `i` to `idx_B`. Initially, `idx_B` is an empty list, so appending `i` to it makes `idx_B` contain `[i]`. Since `idx_B` was empty before the append operation, `B` remains as `[0]`. If `idx_B` was not empty, the value of `x` would be calculated as `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`, and `B` would be appended with this value. However, since `idx_B` was initially empty, no such calculation is performed.
