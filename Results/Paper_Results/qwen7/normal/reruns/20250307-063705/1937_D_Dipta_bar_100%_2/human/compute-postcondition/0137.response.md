Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is `n-1`, `idx_B` is a list containing all indices where `s` has a '<', `B` is a list where each element is calculated based on the formula `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)` for each '<' encountered, starting with `0` if `idx_B` is initially empty, and `l` is `r - 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is not '>', `a` is `B[r]`, `b` is `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)` if `l - r - 1 > 0`, otherwise `b` remains unchanged.**

This output state reflects that the variable `b` has been updated by adding `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)` to its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously described states.
