Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `j` is `n-1`, `i` is `0`, `idx_B` is a list containing all indices where `s` has a '<', `B` is a list where each element is calculated based on the formula `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)` for each '<' encountered, starting with `0` if `idx_B` is initially empty, and `l` is `0`; `r` is the length of list `B`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n):
    if s[i] == '>':
        if l < r:
            a = A[l]
            x = r - (l + 2)
            b = B[r - 1]
            if x >= 0:
                b = b - B[x]
                b = b - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)
            b = b + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)
            print(a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1, end=' ')
        elif r == 0:
            print(n - i, end=' ')
        else:
            a = B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r
            b = A[l - 1]
            if l - r > 0:
                b = b - A[l - r - 1]
                b = b - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)
            b = b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r
            print(a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i), end=' ')
        l += 1
    else:
        r -= 1
        if l <= r:
            if l == 0:
                print(i + 1, end=' ')
            else:
                a = A[l - 1]
                a = a + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l
                b = B[r]
                if r - l >= 0:
                    b = b - B[r - l]
                    b = b - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)
                b = b + (idx_B[r] - i) * l
                print(a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1, end=' ')
        elif r == 0:
            print(n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2, end=' ')
        else:
            a = B[r]
            b = A[l - 1]
            if l - r - 1 > 0:
                b = b - A[l - r - 2]
                b = b - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)
            b = b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)
            print(a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i), end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i`, `j`, `idx_B`, `B`, `l`, `r`, `n` are as follows: if `s[i]` is '>', then `i` is 1, `j` is `n-1`, `l` is 1, `r` is either `0` or the length of list `B`, and `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r` if `r` is greater than `0`, otherwise `a` is `0`. If `s[i]` is not '>', then `i` is 0, `l` is either `0` or `r - 1`, and `a` is `0` if `l` is `0`, otherwise `a` is `B[l - 1] + (i - idx_B[l - 1]) * l`. Also, `b` is calculated based on the value of `l` and `r`: if `l` is less than or equal to `r`, then `b` is `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l` if `r - l >= 0`, otherwise `b` remains unchanged. If `l` is greater than `r`, then `b` is `b + (i - idx_B[l - 1]) * (r + 1)` if `l - r - 1 > 0`, otherwise `b` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `j` is either `n-1` or `n-2`, `l` and `r` remain unchanged. If `s[i] == '>'`, then `l` is incremented by 1, and the conditions for `a` and `b` remain unchanged. If `s[i] != '>'` and `l` is 0, `a` is recalculated based on `i = 2`, and `b` is recalculated based on `i = 2`. If `s[i] != '>'` and `r` is 0, `a` is recalculated based on `i = 2`, and `b` is recalculated based on `i = 2`. Otherwise, depending on whether `l` is greater than 0, `a` is either `A[1] + (2 - idx_A[l - 1]) * l` or `B[r]`, and `b` is either `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - 2) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - 2) * l` or `A[l-1] - (idx_A[l-1] - idx_A[l-r-2]) * (l - r - 1) + (2 - idx_A[l-1]) * (r + 1)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 3, `j` is either `n-1` or `n-2`, `l` and `r` remain unchanged or update according to the conditions specified. If `s[i] == '>'` and `l < r`, then `a` is updated to `A[3]` and `b` is updated based on the condition `x >= 0`. If `l < r` is false, then if `r` is 0, `i`, `j`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged. Otherwise, `a` and `b` are updated based on specific conditions involving `r`. If `s[i] == '>'` and `l < r` is false, then if `r` is 0, `a` and `b` remain unchanged. Otherwise, `i`, `j`, `l`, and `r` change to `r-1`, and `a` and `b` are updated accordingly. If `s[i] != '>'` or `r` is 0, then `l` remains unchanged, `r` is updated to `r-1`, and `a` and `b` are updated based on the new value of `r`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
