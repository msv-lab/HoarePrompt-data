Output State: **`j` is 1, `i` is `n - 3`, `x` is `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`, `B` is appended with the value of `x`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `x` to the list `B`. The values of `j` and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `x` is calculated using the given formula, but since the actual values of `B`, `idx_B`, and `n` are not specified, `x` remains in its original form.
