Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is `n-2`, `a` is `A[1] + (2 - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, `b` is `B[r]`, `l` and `r` remain unchanged**.

In this case, the code `b = B[r]` assigns the value of `B[r]` to the variable `b`. All other variables (`i`, `j`, `a`, `l`, and `r`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
