Postcondition: `i` is 3, `j` is either `n-1` or `n-2`, `l` remains unchanged, `r` is `r-1`. If `l` is 0, then the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged. Otherwise, `a` is `A[l-1] + (i - idx_A[l-1]) * l`, and `b` is `B[r-1] - B[r-l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`. If `r` equals 0, then the values of `i`, `j`, `l`, and `r` remain as they are. Otherwise, `i`, `j`, `l`, and `r` change to `r-1`, and `a` is set to `r-1`, while `b` is calculated as `A[l - r - 3] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`.
