Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is `n-1`, `a` is equal to `A[2]`, `b` is equal to `B[r-1] - B[r-(l+2)]`, `x` is `r - (l + 2)`**

Explanation: The code `b = b - B[x]` updates the value of `b` by subtracting the value of `B[x]` from `b`. Given that `x` is defined as `r - (l + 2)`, the updated value of `b` is `B[r-1] - B[r-(l+2)]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
