Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n`, `i` is 3, `idx_A` is `[0, A[3] + 3]`, `x` is `A[3] + 3`.**

Explanation: The code `A.append(x)` appends the value of `x` to the list `A`. Initially, `x` is defined as `A[3] + (3 - 0) * 1`, which simplifies to `A[3] + 3`. After appending `x` to `A`, the list `A` now contains one additional element, which is `x`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `idx_A` is updated to include the new index of `x` in the list `A`, which is the length of `A` before the append operation (which was 1 since `A` initially only contained one element).
