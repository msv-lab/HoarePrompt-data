Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `j` is `n-1`.
   - `idx_B` is a list containing all indices where `s` has a '<'.
   - `B` is a list where each element is calculated based on the formula `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)` for each '<' encountered, starting with `0` if `idx_B` is initially empty.
   - `l` is `0`.
   - `r` is the length of list `B`.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - The current value of `s[i]` is '>'.
   - `r` is greater than 0.

2. **Calculating `a`:**
   - `a` is defined as `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`.
   - Since `r` is the length of `B` and `r > 0`, let's assume `B` has at least one element. Let's denote the last element of `B` as `B[-1]` (or `B[r-1]`).
   - `idx_B[r - 1]` is the last index in `idx_B` where there was a '<' in `s`.
   - Given `i = 1`, the term `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r` simplifies to `(idx_B[r - 1] - 1) * r`.

3. **Calculating `b`:**
   - `b` is defined as `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`.
   - Here, `A` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its exact values. However, since `l = 0`, the expression simplifies significantly.
   - With `l = 0`, the terms involving `A` become zero because `A[l - 1]` and `A[l - r - 1]` are undefined or zero.
   - Therefore, `b` simplifies to `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`, but since `l = 0`, `idx_A[l - 1]` is undefined, and thus `b` is also undefined or zero.

4. **Final Expression:**
   - The expression to be printed is `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)`.
   - Substituting the simplified values:
     - `a = B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - 1) * r`.
     - `b = 0` (since `l = 0` and `A` is not defined).
     - `n - i = n - 1` (since `i = 1`).

5. **Final Calculation:**
   - The expression becomes `2 * (B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - 1) * r) + 2 * 0 + (n - 1)`.
   - Simplifying further: `2 * B[r - 1] + 2 * (idx_B[r - 1] - 1) * r + n - 1`.

Given the complexity and the lack of specific values for `B` and `idx_B`, we can only express the result in terms of these variables.

**Output:** **2 * B[r - 1] + 2 * (idx_B[r - 1] - 1) * r + n - 1**
