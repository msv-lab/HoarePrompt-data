Postcondition: `i` is 2, `j` is `n-1`, `l` and `r` remain unchanged. If `l < r`, then `a` is equal to `A[2]`, and `b` is equal to `B[r-1] - B[r-(l+2)] - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1) + (idx_B[r - 1] - 2) * (l + 1)`, where `x` is `r - (l + 2)`. Otherwise, if `r` is 0, `a` and `b` remain unchanged. If `r` is not 0, `a` is set to `B[n-2] + (idx_B[n-2] - 2) * (n-1)`, and `b` is set to `A[l - r - 2] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (2 - idx_A[l - 1]) * r` if `l - r` is greater than 0. If `l - r` is not greater than 0, then the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged.
