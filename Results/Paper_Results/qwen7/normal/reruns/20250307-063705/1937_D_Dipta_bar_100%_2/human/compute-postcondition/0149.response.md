Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is `n-1`, `a` is equal to `A[2]`, `b` is equal to `B[r-1] - B[r-(l+2)] - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)`, `x` is `r - (l + 2)`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b` by subtracting `(idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)` from its current value. Since `x` is defined as `r - (l + 2)`, the updated value of `b` is the original value of `b` minus the specified expression. All other variables remain unchanged.
