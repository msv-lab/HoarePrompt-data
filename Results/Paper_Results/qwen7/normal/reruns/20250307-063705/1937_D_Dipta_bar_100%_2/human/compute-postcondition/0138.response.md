Let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `j` is `n-1`.
   - `idx_B` is a list containing all indices where `s` has a '<'.
   - `B` is a list where each element is calculated based on the formula `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)` for each '<' encountered, starting with `0` if `idx_B` is initially empty.
   - `l` is `r - 1`.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `s[i]` is not '>'.
   - `a` is `B[r]`.
   - `b` is `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)` if `l - r - 1 > 0`, otherwise `b` remains unchanged.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i), end=' ')
   ```

Given the initial state, let's analyze the variables involved in the expression `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)`:

- **`a`**: This is the last element of the list `B`, denoted as `B[r]`.
- **`b`**: The value of `b` depends on the condition `l - r - 1 > 0`. Since `l` is `r - 1`, `l - r - 1` simplifies to `-2`, which is not greater than 0. Therefore, `b` remains unchanged from its initial value.
- **`n`**: This is greater than 0, but its exact value is not specified.
- **`i`**: This is 0.

So, the expression simplifies to:
\[ a \times 2 + b \times 2 + (n - 0) = 2a + 2b + n \]

Since `b` remains unchanged and its exact value is not specified, we can only express it in terms of `b`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **2a + 2b + n (where a is B[r], b is the unchanged value of b, and n is greater than 0)**
