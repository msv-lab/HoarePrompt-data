Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is `n-2`, `l` and `r` remain unchanged, `a` is `B[r]`, `b` is `A[l-1] - (idx_A[l-1] - idx_A[l-r-2]) * (l - r - 1)`**

Explanation: The variable `b` is updated by subtracting the product of `(idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2])` and `(l - r - 1)` from its current value. Since `idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]` is a specific value or expression, we include it directly in the updated value of `b`. All other variables (`i`, `j`, `l`, `r`, `a`) remain unchanged.
