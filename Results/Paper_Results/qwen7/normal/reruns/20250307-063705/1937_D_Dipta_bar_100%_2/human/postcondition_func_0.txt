The function processes a string `s` consisting only of '<' and '>' characters. It calculates and prints a series of values based on the positions of these characters in the string. Specifically, it computes and outputs a formula involving the cumulative distances between '>' and '<' characters, adjusted by their respective counts and positions. The function does not return any value; instead, it prints the computed values directly.
