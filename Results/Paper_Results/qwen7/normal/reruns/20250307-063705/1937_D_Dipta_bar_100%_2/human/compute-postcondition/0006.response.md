Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n`, `i` is 0, the current value of `s[i]` is '>', `idx_A` is [0]**.

Explanation: The code `A.append(0)` appends the value `0` to the list `A`, which is referred to as `idx_A` in the initial state description. The values of `s`, `n`, `i`, and the current character `s[i]` remain unchanged.
