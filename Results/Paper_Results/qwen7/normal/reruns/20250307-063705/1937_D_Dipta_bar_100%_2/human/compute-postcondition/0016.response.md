Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n`, `i` is 1, `idx_A` is `[0, 0]`**

Explanation: The code `A.append(0)` appends the value `0` to the list `A`. Initially, `A` is equal to `[0]`. After appending `0` to `A`, `A` becomes `[0, 0]`. The values of `s`, `i`, and `idx_A` are updated accordingly, while the length of `s` (`n`) and the value of `i` remain unchanged.
