Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is `n-1`, `idx_B` is a list containing all indices where `s` has a '<', `B` is a list where each element is calculated based on the formula `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)` for each '<' encountered, starting with `0` if `idx_B` is initially empty, and `l` is greater than 0; `r` is `r - 1`, `n` is greater than 0, and `s[i]` is not '>', and the current value of `l` is less than or equal to the current value of `r`; `a` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, `b` is `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l` if `r - l >= 0`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b` by adding `(idx_B[r] - i) * l` to the previous value of `b`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The updated value of `b` is expressed in terms of the known and updated values.
