Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `s` is a string of length `n`.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `idx_A` is `[0, 1, 2]` if the character at index `i` in string `s` is `'>'`; otherwise, `i` remains 1 and `idx_A` remains `[0]`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` from `0` to `n-1`.

3. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 (since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration).
   - Therefore, `i` will become `3` in the next iteration.

5. **Condition for `idx_A`:**
   - The value of `idx_A` depends on the character at index `i` in the string `s`.
   - Since `i` is now `3`, we need to check the character at index `3` in `s`.
   - If the character at index `3` is `'>'`, then `idx_A` will be `[0, 1, 2, 3]`.
   - If the character at index `3` is not `'>'`, then `idx_A` will remain `[0]` and `i` will remain `1`.

6. **Final State for the Next Iteration:**
   - `i` will be `3`.
   - `idx_A` will either be `[0, 1, 2, 3]` or `[0]`, depending on the character at index `3` in `s`.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`s` is a string of length `n`, `i` is 3, and `idx_A` is `[0, 1, 2, 3]` if the character at index `3` in string `s` is `'>'; otherwise, `idx_A` remains `[0]`**.
