### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1(s)`**:
   - The function aims to compute the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid when placed at each cell.
   - It uses two lists, `A` and `B`, to store cumulative distances and indices of '>' and '<' characters, respectively.
   - The logic for calculating the time involves iterating through the string and using the precomputed values in `A` and `B`.

2. **Initialization and Iteration**:
   - The function correctly initializes `A` and `B` as empty lists.
   - It iterates through the string `s` twice: once from left to right and once from right to left.
   - For each '>', it calculates the distance to the previous '>' and stores the cumulative sum in `A`.
   - Similarly, for each '<', it calculates the distance to the previous '<' and stores the cumulative sum in `B`.

3. **Main Calculation Loop**:
   - The main loop iterates through the string again to compute the time for each cell.
   - It uses the precomputed values in `A` and `B` to calculate the time for the pinball to leave the grid.
   - The calculations involve adjusting the cumulative sums based on the position of the current character and the counts of '>' and '<'.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases such as when there are no '>' or '<' characters, or when the pinball starts at the boundary of the grid.
   - The logic correctly accounts for these scenarios by adjusting the calculations accordingly.

5. **Output**:
   - The function prints the computed times for each cell directly, which matches the expected output format.

Given the detailed analysis, the function appears to correctly implement the logic for calculating the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for each cell.

### Conclusion:
The function `func_1(s)` correctly implements the required logic to solve the problem. Therefore, the given program is correct.
