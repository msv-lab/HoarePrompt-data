Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Variables:**
   - `i` is 0.
   - `j` is `n-1`.
   - `idx_B` is a list containing all indices where `s` has a '<'.
   - `B` is a list where each element is calculated based on the formula `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)` for each '<' encountered, starting with `0` if `idx_B` is initially empty.
   - `l` is greater than 0.
   - `r` is `r - 1`.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `s[i]` is not '>'.
   - The current value of `l` is less than or equal to the current value of `r`.

2. **Variables Calculated in the Print Statement:**
   - `a` is calculated as `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`.
     - Since `i` is 0, this simplifies to `A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - 1] * l`.
   - `b` is calculated as `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l` if `r - l >= 0`.
     - Given `i` is 0, this simplifies to `B[r] - B[r - l] - idx_B[r - l] * (r - l) + idx_B[r] * l` if `r - l >= 0`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The expression to be printed is `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1`.

Given the initial conditions:
- `i` is 0.
- `a` is `A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - 1] * l`.
- `b` is `B[r] - B[r - l] - idx_B[r - l] * (r - l) + idx_B[r] * l` if `r - l >= 0`.

Since the exact values of `A`, `B`, `idx_A`, and `idx_B` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical values of `a` and `b`. However, we can describe the expression in terms of these variables.

Output: **2 * (A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - 1] * l) + 2 * (B[r] - B[r - l] - idx_B[r - l] * (r - l) + idx_B[r] * l) + 1**
