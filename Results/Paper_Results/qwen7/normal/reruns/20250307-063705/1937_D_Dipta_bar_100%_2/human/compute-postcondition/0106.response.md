Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is `n-1`, `idx_B` is a list containing all indices where `s` has a '<', `B` is a list where each element is calculated based on the formula `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)` for each '<' encountered, starting with `0` if `idx_B` is initially empty, and `l` is `0`; `r` is `r - 1`, `n` is greater than 0, and `s[i]` is not '>'**.

This means that the variable `r` has been decremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
