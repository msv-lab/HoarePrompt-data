Output State: **`j` is `n-1`, `i` is `0`, `idx_B` is a list containing all indices where `s` has a '<', `B` is a list where each element is calculated based on the formula `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)` for each '<' encountered, starting with `0` if `idx_B` is initially empty, and `l` is `0`; `r` is the length of list `B`.**

The code `r = len(B)` calculates the length of the list `B` and assigns it to the variable `r`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
