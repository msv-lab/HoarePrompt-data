Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n`, `i` is 3, `idx_A` is `[0]`, and `A` is `[0]`.**

Explanation: The code `A.append(0)` adds the value `0` to the list `A`. The initial state of `A` is an empty list, so after appending `0`, `A` becomes `[0]`. The values of `s`, `i`, and `idx_A` remain unchanged unless the condition for `idx_A` changes, which is not affected by the given code snippet. Therefore, `idx_A` remains `[0]` because the character at index `3` in `s` does not change the condition for `idx_A`.
