Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n`, `i` is `n`, `A` contains the cumulative sum of distances from the last '>' to the current '>', multiplied by the number of '>' seen so far, `idx_A` is a list of all indices where `s` has a '>', `idx_B` is an empty list.**

The code initializes `idx_B` as an empty list. This does not affect the values of `s`, `i`, `A`, or `idx_A`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
