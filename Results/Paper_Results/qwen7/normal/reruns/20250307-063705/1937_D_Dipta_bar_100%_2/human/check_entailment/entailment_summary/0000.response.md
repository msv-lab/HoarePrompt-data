Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by calculating the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell. However, upon closer inspection, the logic in the program does not correctly simulate the movement of the pinball and the inversion of directions. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Movement Time**:
   - The program tries to compute the time by considering the cumulative distances between '>' and '<' characters. This approach is flawed because it does not accurately reflect the actual movement of the pinball.
   - For example, the program should consider the net effect of moving left and right, and the inversion of directions after each move. Instead, it uses a complex formula that does not correctly simulate this behavior.

2. **Complexity and Incorrect Logic**:
   - The program uses several nested loops and conditional checks to adjust the calculated times. These adjustments are not necessary and do not correctly account for the pinball's movement and direction changes.
   - The logic for updating the indices and calculating the final times is overly complicated and does not match the expected behavior of the pinball.

3. **Lack of Simulation**:
   - The program lacks a proper simulation of the pinball's movement. It does not actually simulate the pinball moving through the grid and changing directions based on the current cell's character.
   - Instead, it relies on a series of formulas that do not correctly represent the pinball's path and the time taken to leave the grid.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the required functionality. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
