Output State: **`i` is 3, `j` is either `n-1` or `n-2`, `l` remains unchanged, `r` remains unchanged, `a` is `A[l]`, `x` is `r - (l + 2)`**.

This means that `i` retains its value of 3, `j` remains either `n-1` or `n-2`, `l` and `r` remain unchanged, `a` is still `A[l]`, and `x` is now calculated as `r - (l + 2)`.
