Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is `n-2`, `a` is `A[1] + (2 - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, `b` is `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - 2) * (r - l)`, `l` and `r` remain unchanged**

Explanation: The value of `b` is updated by subtracting `(idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)` from its original value. Given that `i` is 2, the expression simplifies to subtracting `(idx_B[r - l] - 2) * (r - l)` from `b`. The other variables (`i`, `j`, `a`, `l`, and `r`) remain unchanged.
