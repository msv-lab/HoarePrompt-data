Postcondition: `j` is 1, `i` is `n - 3`, and if `s[i] == '<'`, then `idx_B` is `[i]`, `B` is `[0]` if `idx_B` was empty, otherwise `B` is `[B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)]`. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains as described above if the condition `s[i] == '<'` is true.
