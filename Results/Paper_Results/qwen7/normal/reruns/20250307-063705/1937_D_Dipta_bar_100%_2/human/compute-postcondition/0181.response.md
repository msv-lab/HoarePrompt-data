Given the initial state:
- `i` is 2
- `j` is `n-2`
- `l` and `r` remain unchanged
- `a` is recalculated based on `i = 2`
- `b` is recalculated based on `i = 2`

We need to determine the value of the expression `n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2`.

However, the value of `idx_A[l - 1]` is not explicitly provided. Therefore, we can only express the result in terms of this unknown value.

Let's break down the expression:
1. `n - i`: Since `i` is 2, this becomes `n - 2`.
2. `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2`: Since `i` is 2, this becomes `(2 - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2`.

Combining these parts, the expression becomes:
\[ n - 2 + (2 - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2 \]

Simplifying further:
\[ n - 2 + 4 - 2 \cdot idx_A[l - 1] \]
\[ n + 2 - 2 \cdot idx_A[l - 1] \]

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **n + 2 - 2 * idx_A[l - 1]**
