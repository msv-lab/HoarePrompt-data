Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Variables:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `j` is `n-1`.
   - `idx_B` is a list containing all indices where `s` has a '<'.
   - `B` is a list where each element is calculated based on the formula `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)` for each '<' encountered, starting with `0` if `idx_B` is initially empty.
   - `l` is `0`.
   - `r` is `0`.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - The current value of `s[i]` is '>'.
   - `l` is greater than or equal to `r`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(n - i, end=' ')`.

Given these details:
- `i` is explicitly given as 1.
- `n` is greater than 0 but its exact value is not specified.
- The current value of `s[i]` is '>', which means `i` is at an index where `s` does not contain a '<'. This doesn't directly affect the calculation of `n - i`.

Since `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 0, the expression `n - i` will result in `n - 1`.

Therefore, the print statement will output the value of `n - 1`.

Output: **n - 1**
