Postcondition: `i` is 3, `j` is either `n-1` or `n-2`, and `l` and `r` remain unchanged. If `r` is 0, then the values of `i`, `j`, `l`, and `r` remain as they were initially. Otherwise, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - 3) * r`, and `b` is `A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (3 - idx_A[l - 1]) * r` if `l - r` is greater than 0. If `l - r` is not greater than 0, the values of `i`, `j`, `a`, and `b` remain as they were initially.
