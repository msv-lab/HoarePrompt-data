Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is `n-1`, `a` is equal to `A[2]`, `b` is equal to `A[2]`, `l` and `r` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `A[l]` to `a`. Given that `i` is 2, it implies `l` is 2. Therefore, `a` is now equal to `A[2]`. Similarly, `b` is recalculated based on `i = 2`, so `b` is also equal to `A[2]`. The values of `i`, `j`, `l`, `r`, and the original array `A` remain unchanged.
