Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is `n-1`, `idx_B` is a list containing all indices where `s` has a '<', `B` is a list where each element is calculated based on the formula `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)` for each '<' encountered, starting with `0` if `idx_B` is initially empty, and `l` is `0`; `r` is the length of list `B`, `n` must be greater than 0, the current value of `s[i]` is '>', and `r` is greater than 0; `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b` by subtracting `A[l - r - 1]` from `b`. Since `l` is `0`, `l - r - 1` simplifies to `-r - 1`. Given that `r` is greater than 0, `-r - 1` is a negative number, indicating that `A[-r - 1]` is an index that is out of bounds for the list `A` (assuming `A` is zero-indexed). However, since the problem does not specify handling out-of-bound indices, we assume the operation is valid within the context provided. Thus, `b` is updated to `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
