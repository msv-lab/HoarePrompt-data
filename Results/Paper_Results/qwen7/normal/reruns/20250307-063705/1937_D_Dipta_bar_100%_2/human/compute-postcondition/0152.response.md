Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is `n-1`, `a` is equal to `A[2]`, `b` is equal to `B[r-1] - B[r-(l+2)] - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1) + (idx_B[r - 1] - 2) * (l + 1)`, `x` is `r - (l + 2)`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b` by adding `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`, which translates to `(idx_B[r - 1] - 2) * (l + 1)` since `i` is 2. This adjustment is applied to the previously defined value of `b`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states.
