Postcondition: `i` is 2, `j` is `n-2`, `l` and `r` remain unchanged. If `l` is 0, then `a` is recalculated based on `i = 2`, `b` is recalculated based on `i = 2`. Otherwise, `a` is `A[1] + (2 - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, `b` is `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - 2) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - 2) * l`, and `l` and `r` remain unchanged.
