Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n`, `i` is 2, `idx_A` is `[0, 1]`, `x` is `len(idx_A)`**

Explanation:
- Initially, `i` is 1.
- The code updates `i` to `A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`.
- Since `idx_A` is initially `[0]`, `len(idx_A)` is 1.
- `A[len(A) - 1]` is the last element of `idx_A`, which is 0.
- So, `i` becomes `0 + (1 - 0) * 1 = 1 + 1 = 2`.
- `idx_A` is appended with the new value of `i - 1`, which is `2 - 1 = 1`. Thus, `idx_A` becomes `[0, 1]`.
- The values of `s` and `n` remain unchanged.
