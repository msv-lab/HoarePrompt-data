### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves simulating the movement of a pinball on a one-dimensional grid.
   - The pinball starts at each cell and moves according to the direction specified by the character in that cell ('<' or '>').
   - After each move, the direction of the cell is reversed.
   - The pinball stops when it moves out of the grid boundaries.

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the grid size `n` and the grid configuration `s`.
   - The function `func_1(s)` is designed to compute the time taken for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell.

3. **Function `func_1(s)` Breakdown:**
   - **Left-to-Right Calculation (`A` array):**
     - This part calculates the time taken for a pinball to leave the grid when starting from the leftmost cell and moving towards the right.
     - It uses a list `A` to store cumulative times and indices where the direction changes.
   - **Right-to-Left Calculation (`B` array):**
     - This part calculates the time taken for a pinball to leave the grid when starting from the rightmost cell and moving towards the left.
     - It uses a list `B` to store cumulative times and indices where the direction changes.
   - **Combining Results:**
     - The main loop combines the results from the left-to-right and right-to-left calculations to determine the time taken for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell.

4. **Verification:**
   - The code handles the boundary conditions correctly.
   - The logic for calculating the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid is sound.
   - The code correctly accounts for the reversal of directions after each move.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles edge cases such as when the pinball starts at the boundary cells or when the entire grid is moving in the same direction.

However, upon closer inspection of the annotated code and the logic, there are several issues with the implementation:

- **Incorrect Calculation of Time:**
  - The formulas used to calculate the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid are overly complex and do not accurately reflect the actual movement of the pinball.
  - Specifically, the calculations involving `A` and `B` arrays do not correctly account for the cumulative distances and the reversals of directions.

- **Complexity and Readability:**
  - The code is highly complex and difficult to follow, making it prone to errors.
  - The use of multiple nested loops and conditional checks makes it hard to verify the correctness of each step.

- **Boundary Conditions:**
  - While the code handles some boundary conditions, it does not handle all possible edge cases, such as when the pinball starts at the boundary cells and the grid is entirely moving in the same direction.

### Conclusion:
Based on the detailed analysis, the provided code does not correctly implement the solution for the problem statement. The calculations for the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid are incorrect, and the logic is overly complex and difficult to verify.
