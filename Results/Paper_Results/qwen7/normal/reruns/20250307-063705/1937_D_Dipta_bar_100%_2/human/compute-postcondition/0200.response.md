Output State: **`i` is 3, `j` is either `n-1` or `n-2`, `l` remains unchanged, `r` remains unchanged, `a` is `A[l]`, `x` is `r - (l + 2)`, `b` is `B[r - 1] - B[x]`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b` to `b - B[x]`. Given that `x` is defined as `r - (l + 2)`, the new value of `b` becomes `B[r - 1] - B[x]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
