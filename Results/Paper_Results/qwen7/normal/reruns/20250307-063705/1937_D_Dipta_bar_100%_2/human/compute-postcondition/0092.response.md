Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is `n-1`, `idx_B` is a list containing all indices where `s` has a '<', `B` is a list where each element is calculated based on the formula `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)` for each '<' encountered, starting with `0` if `idx_B` is initially empty, and `l` is `0`; `r` is the length of list `B`, `n` must be greater than 0, the current value of `s[i]` is '>', and `r` is greater than 0; `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`**.

Explanation: The code calculates the value of `a` based on the last element of list `B` and the corresponding index from `idx_B`. Given the initial conditions, the value of `i` remains 1, `j` remains `n-1`, `idx_B` and `B` remain unchanged except for the calculation of `a`. Since `r` is the length of `B` and is greater than 0, `a` is computed as `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`.
