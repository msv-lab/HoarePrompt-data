Output State: **`i` is 3, `j` is either `n-1` or `n-2`, `l` remains unchanged, `r` remains unchanged, `a` is `A[l]`, `x` is `r - (l + 2)`, `b` is `b + (idx_B[r - 1] - 3) * (l + 1)` if `x >= 0`, otherwise `b` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b` by adding `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)` to the current value of `b`. Given that `i` is 3 and `l` is unchanged, the new value of `b` is `b + (idx_B[r - 1] - 3) * (l + 1)`. The other variables remain unchanged.
