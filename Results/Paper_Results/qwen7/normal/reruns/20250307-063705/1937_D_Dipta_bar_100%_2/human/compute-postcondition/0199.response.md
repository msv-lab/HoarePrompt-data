Output State: **`i` is 3, `j` is either `n-1` or `n-2`, `l` remains unchanged, `r` remains unchanged, `a` is `A[l]`, `x` is `r - (l + 2)`, `b` is `B[r - 1]`**

The code assigns the value of `B[r - 1]` to the variable `b`. Since the initial values of the other variables remain unchanged, they are listed as they were initially.
