Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 2.
   - `j` is `n-2`.
   - `l` and `r` remain unchanged (their values are not specified, but they are assumed to be constants).
   - `a` is `B[r]`.
   - `b` is `A[l-1] - (idx_A[l-1] - idx_A[l-r-2]) * (l - r - 1) + (2 - idx_A[l-1]) * (r + 1)`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i), end=' ')
   ```

3. **Substitute Known Values:**
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n - i` becomes `n - 2`.

4. **Calculate `a` and `b`:**
   - `a` is `B[r]`.
   - `b` is more complex, but we need to evaluate it based on the given formula:
     - `A[l-1]` is the element at index `l-1` in list `A`.
     - `idx_A[l-1]` and `idx_A[l-r-2]` are indices in another list `idx_A`.
     - The expression `(idx_A[l-1] - idx_A[l-r-2]) * (l - r - 1)` is a product of the difference between two indices and the difference in the indices of `l` and `r`.
     - `(2 - idx_A[l-1]) * (r + 1)` is a product of the difference between 2 and the index of `l-1` and the value `r+1`.

5. **Simplified Expression for `b`:**
   - Since the exact values of `A`, `idx_A`, `l`, and `r` are not provided, we cannot simplify `b` further without those values. However, we know that `b` is a combination of these elements.

6. **Final Expression:**
   - The print statement evaluates to `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - 2)`.
   - Substituting the known values: `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - 2)`.

Given the complexity and the lack of specific values for `A`, `idx_A`, `l`, and `r`, we can only express the result in terms of these variables.

**Output:**
Output: **2*B[r] + 2*(A[l-1] - (idx_A[l-1] - idx_A[l-r-2]) * (l - r - 1) + (2 - idx_A[l-1]) * (r + 1)) + (n - 2)**
