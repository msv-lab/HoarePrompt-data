Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is `n-1`, `l` is `l + 1`, `r` remains unchanged, and the conditions for `a` and `b` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `l += 1` increments the value of `l` by 1. Since `l` was initially `2`, after executing this line, `l` becomes `3`. The values of `i`, `j`, `r`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged according to the initial postconditions. Therefore, the updated state includes the incremented value of `l` and the unchanged values of `i`, `j`, `r`, `a`, and `b`.
