Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(0, n):`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of These Variables**:
   - `i` is currently `0`.
   - `n` is not explicitly given, but it can be derived from the initial value of `j`, which is `n-1`. Therefore, `n` must be `j + 1`.

3. **Check the Conditions for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.
   - Initially, `i` is `0`, so the loop will execute as long as `0 < n`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `i` is `0`, the loop will start executing as long as `n > 0`.
   - We don't need to change the state of `i` because it will increment within the loop.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n` to ensure the loop can execute.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `j` is `n-1`, `idx_B` is a list containing all indices where `s` has a '<', `B` is a list where each element is calculated based on the formula `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)` for each '<' encountered, starting with `0` if `idx_B` is initially empty, and `l` is `0`; `r` is the length of list `B`, `n` must be greater than 0**.
