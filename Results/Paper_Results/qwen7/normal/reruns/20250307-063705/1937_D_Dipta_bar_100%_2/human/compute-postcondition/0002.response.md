Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n`, `n` is the length of the string `s`, consisting only of the characters '<' and '>', `A` is an empty list, `idx_A` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list `idx_A`. This does not affect the values of `s`, `n`, or `A`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions of these variables while noting the new state of `idx_A`.
