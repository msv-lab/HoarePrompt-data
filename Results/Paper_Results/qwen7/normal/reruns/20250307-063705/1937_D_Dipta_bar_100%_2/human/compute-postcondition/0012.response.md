Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n`, `i` is 1, `idx_A` is `[0]`**.

Explanation: The code `idx_A.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` (which is 0 initially) to the list `idx_A`. After appending, `i` is incremented by 1. Since `idx_A` was initially empty, appending `i` (which is 0) results in `idx_A` being `[0]`. The length of the string `s` and the value of `i` before the increment are preserved.
