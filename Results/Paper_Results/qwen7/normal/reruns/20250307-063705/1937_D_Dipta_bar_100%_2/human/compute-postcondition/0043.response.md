Output State: **`j` is 0; `i` is `n - 1 - j`; `x` is updated to `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)` and then appended to `B`; the current value of `s[i]` is '<'; `len(idx_B)` is not 0**

Explanation: The code `B.append(x)` appends the value of `x` to the list `B`. The value of `x` remains the same as before the append operation, which is `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
