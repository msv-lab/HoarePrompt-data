Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `j` is 1
- `i` is `n - 3`

### Loop Head
The loop is defined as:
```python
for j in range(0, n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Loop Variable**: The loop variable is `j`.
2. **Loop Range**: The loop runs from `0` to `n-1`.

### Current State
- `j` is currently 1.
- For the loop to continue, `j` must be less than `n`.

### Next Iteration
- If the loop continues, `j` will be incremented by 1.
- Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `2`.

### Adjusting the States
- The only variable in the loop head that changes with each iteration is `j`.
- All other variables (`i`, `idx_B`, `B`) remain unchanged unless modified within the loop body, but since the loop body is omitted, these variables retain their current values.

### Updated State
- `j` will be 2.
- `i` remains `n - 3`.
- `idx_B` remains as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
- `B` remains as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

### Final Answer
State: **`j` is 2, `i` is `n - 3`, `idx_B` remains as it was, `B` remains as it was**.
