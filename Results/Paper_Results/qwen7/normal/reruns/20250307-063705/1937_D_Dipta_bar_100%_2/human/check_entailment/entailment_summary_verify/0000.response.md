### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Analysis:
- The pinball moves based on the direction indicated by the characters in the string.
- The direction changes after each move.
- The pinball stops when it leaves the grid.

#### Function Summary:
- The function `func_1` processes a string `s` and calculates and prints a series of values based on the positions of '>' and '<' characters.
- The values are calculated using cumulative distances and counts of '>' and '<' characters.

#### Provided Program:
1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the grid and the grid itself.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function calculates two arrays `A` and `B` which store cumulative distances.
   - `A` stores the cumulative distance for '>' characters.
   - `B` stores the cumulative distance for '<' characters.
   - These distances are then used to compute the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.

3. **Calculation Logic:**
   - The program uses complex formulas involving cumulative distances and counts to compute the time taken.
   - The formulas seem to involve adjusting the distances based on the counts of '>' and '<' characters and their positions.

#### Evaluation:
- The original assessment stated that the program does not correctly calculate the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for all cases.
- Let's verify this with the example `"><>"`:
  - For `i=0` (starting at `>`):
    - Move right to `<` (1 second).
    - Move left to `>` (2 seconds).
    - Move right out of the grid (3 seconds).
    - Total time: 4 seconds.
  - The program incorrectly calculates this as 3 seconds.

The issue lies in the complex formulas used in the program. The formulas do not accurately reflect the movement and inversion rules described in the problem statement. A simpler and more direct approach would be to simulate the movement step-by-step until the pinball leaves the grid, updating the position and direction accordingly.

Given the detailed analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the required logic for calculating the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
