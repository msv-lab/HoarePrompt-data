Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n`, `n` is the length of the string `s`, consisting only of the characters '<' and '>'**.

The code calculates the length of the string `s` and assigns it to the variable `n`. The string `s` remains unchanged, and its length is stored in `n`. Therefore, the length of `s` is now known and stored in `n`, while `s` itself retains its original value and properties.
