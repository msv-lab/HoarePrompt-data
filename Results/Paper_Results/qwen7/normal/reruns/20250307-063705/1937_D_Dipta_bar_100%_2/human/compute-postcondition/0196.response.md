Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 2
   - `j` is either `n-1` or `n-2`
   - `l` and `r` remain unchanged

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` from `0` to `n-1`.

3. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - Since the loop is about to start its next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1 from its current value of 2. Therefore, `i` will become 3.

4. **Adjusting `j`:**
   - The value of `j` is determined by the condition `j` is either `n-1` or `n-2`.
   - This condition does not depend on `i`, so it remains the same as the previous iteration. Hence, `j` is still either `n-1` or `n-2`.

5. **Adjusting `l` and `r`:**
   - The values of `l` and `r` remain unchanged from the previous iteration.

6. **Conditions for `s[i]`:**
   - We need to consider the value of `s[i]` when `i` becomes 3.
   - If `s[3] == '>'`, then `l` is incremented by 1.
   - If `s[3] != '>'` and `l` is 0, `a` is recalculated based on `i = 2`, and `b` is recalculated based on `i = 2`.
   - If `s[3] != '>'` and `r` is 0, `a` is recalculated based on `i = 2`, and `b` is recalculated based on `i = 2`.
   - Otherwise, depending on whether `l` is greater than 0, `a` and `b` are calculated based on the conditions mentioned.

Since we don't know the exact value of `s[3]`, we need to consider all possible scenarios, but the key point is that `l` and `r` remain unchanged, and `i` becomes 3.

**Final State:**
- `i` is 3
- `j` is either `n-1` or `n-2`
- `l` and `r` remain unchanged

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`i` is 3, `j` is either `n-1` or `n-2`, `l` and `r` remain unchanged**
