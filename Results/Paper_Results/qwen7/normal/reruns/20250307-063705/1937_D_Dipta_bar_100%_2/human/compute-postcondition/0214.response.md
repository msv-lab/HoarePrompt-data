Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 3.
   - `j` is either `n-1` or `n-2`.
   - `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - 3) * r`.
   - `b` is `A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (3 - idx_A[l - 1]) * r` if `l - r > 0`. Otherwise, the values of `i`, `j`, `a`, and `b` remain as they were initially.

2. **Expression to Evaluate:**
   ```python
   print(a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i), end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analyze the Expression:**
   - We need to determine the values of `a` and `b`.
   - Since the exact values of `B[r - 1]`, `idx_B[r - 1]`, `A[l - r - 1]`, `idx_A[l - 1]`, `idx_A[l - r - 1]`, `l`, and `r` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical values of `a` and `b`.
   - However, we know that `i` is 3, so `(n - i)` simplifies to `n - 3`.

4. **Final Expression Simplification:**
   - The expression to print is `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - 3)`.
   - Since `a` and `b` depend on unknown values, we can only express the final result in terms of these variables.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **2*a + 2*b + (n - 3)**
