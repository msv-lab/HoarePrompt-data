Output: **4**

Explanation: 
- The initial state tells us that `i` is 3.
- `j` is either `n-1` or `n-2`, but these values are not needed to determine the output of the print statement.
- `l` remains unchanged, but it is not used in the print statement.
- `r` is `r-1`, but again, this is not used in the print statement.

The print statement `print(i + 1, end=' ')` adds 1 to the value of `i` and prints the result. Since `i` is 3, `i + 1` is 4. Therefore, the output is **4**.
