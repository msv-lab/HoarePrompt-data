Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is `n-1`, `idx_B` is a list containing all indices where `s` has a '<', `B` is a list where each element is calculated based on the formula `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)` for each '<' encountered, starting with `0` if `idx_B` is initially empty, and `l` is `0`; `r` is the length of list `B`, `n` must be greater than 0, the current value of `s[i]` is '>', and `l` is less than `r`; `a` is `A[0]`; `x` is `r - (l + 2)`**.

Explanation: The code `x = r - (l + 2)` calculates the value of `x` based on the current values of `r`, `l`, and the constant `2`. Since `l` is `0` and `r` is the length of list `B`, `x` is set to `r - (0 + 2)`, which simplifies to `r - 2`. The values of `i`, `j`, `idx_B`, `B`, `l`, `n`, `s[i]`, `l` being less than `r`, and `a` remain unchanged.
