Output State: **`j` is 0; `i` is `n - 1 - j`; `x` is `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`; the current value of `s[i]` is '<'; `len(idx_B)` is not 0**

Explanation: The value of `i` remains unchanged as it is directly referenced from the initial state. The variable `x` is assigned the value of `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`. All other variables and their conditions remain the same as the initial state.
