Postcondition: `i` is 1, `j` is `n-1`, `idx_B` is a list containing all indices where `s` has a '<', `B` is a list where each element is calculated based on the formula `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)` for each '<' encountered, starting with `0` if `idx_B` is initially empty, and `l` is `0`; `r` is either `0` or the length of list `B`, `n` must be greater than 0, the current value of `s[i]` is '>', and `l` is greater than or equal to `r`. If `r` is `0`, then `a` and `b` are not defined; otherwise, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, and `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`.
