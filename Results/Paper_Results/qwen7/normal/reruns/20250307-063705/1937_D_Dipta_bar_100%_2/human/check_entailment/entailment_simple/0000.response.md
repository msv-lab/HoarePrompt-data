### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic of the provided program step-by-step to ensure it correctly calculates the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for each query.

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the grid and the string `s` representing the grid.
   - The function `func_1(s)` is called to process the string `s`.

2. **Processing the String `s`:**
   - The function `func_1(s)` processes the string `s` to calculate two arrays `A` and `B`:
     - `A` stores the cumulative sum of distances between `>` characters, starting from the last occurrence of `>` in `idx_A` and multiplied by the count of occurrences so far, plus the index difference.
     - `B` is similar but for `<` characters, processed from the end of the string.

3. **Calculating the Time to Leave the Grid:**
   - The main loop iterates through each position `i` in the string `s` and calculates the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid.
   - Depending on whether the character at position `i` is `>` or `<`, different formulas are used to compute the time:
     - If the character is `>`, the time is calculated using the values from array `A` and `B`.
     - If the character is `<`, the time is calculated similarly using the values from array `B` and `A`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases where the pinball starts at the boundary of the grid (`i == 0` or `i == n-1`).

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Array `A`:**
  - This array accumulates the distance traveled by the pinball when it encounters a `>` character.
  - The calculation ensures that the pinball's movement is correctly tracked and reversed when the direction changes.

- **Array `B`:**
  - Similar to `A`, this array accumulates the distance traveled by the pinball when it encounters a `<` character, but from the end of the string.

- **Main Loop:**
  - The main loop correctly calculates the time for each position `i` by considering the accumulated distances and reversing the direction when necessary.
  - The logic handles both forward and backward movements accurately.

### Conclusion:

After analyzing the provided code, the logic appears to be sound and correctly implements the rules for calculating the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for each position. The program handles all edge cases and computes the results as expected.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
