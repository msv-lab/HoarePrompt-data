Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `i` is 1 (since `s[i]` is '>')
- `j` is `n-1`
- `l` is 1
- `r` is either `0` or the length of list `B`
- `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r` if `r` is greater than `0`, otherwise `a` is `0`
- `b` is calculated based on the value of `l` and `r`

Given `i` is 1, `s[i]` is '>', so:
- `j` is `n-1`
- `l` is 1
- `r` is either `0` or the length of list `B`
- `a` is `0` (since `r` is `0`)
- `b` is calculated based on `l` and `r`

### Loop Head
The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(0, n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Determine the new value of `i`:**
   - The loop starts with `i = 0` and increments by 1 each iteration.
   - Since the loop just ended with `i = 1`, the next value of `i` will be `2`.

2. **Check the condition for the next iteration:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.
   - Given `i` is now `2`, the loop will continue if `2 < n`.

3. **Adjust the other variables:**
   - `j` remains `n-1`.
   - `l` and `r` remain unchanged unless the loop body changes them, but since the loop body is omitted, they stay the same.
   - `a` and `b` are recalculated based on the new value of `i`.

### New State Calculation
- `i` becomes `2`.
- `j` remains `n-1`.
- `l` and `r` remain unchanged.
- Recalculate `a` and `b` based on the new value of `i`.

Since the loop body is omitted, we assume no changes to `l` and `r`. Therefore, `a` and `b` are recalculated based on `i = 2`.

### Final State
- `i` is `2`
- `j` is `n-1`
- `l` and `r` remain unchanged
- `a` is recalculated based on the new value of `i`
- `b` is recalculated based on the new value of `i`

### State at the Start of the Next Iteration
State: **`i` is 2, `j` is `n-1`, `l` and `r` remain unchanged, `a` is recalculated based on `i = 2`, `b` is recalculated based on `i = 2`**
