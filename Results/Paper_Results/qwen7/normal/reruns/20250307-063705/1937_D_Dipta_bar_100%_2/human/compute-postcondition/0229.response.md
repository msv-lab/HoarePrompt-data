Output State: **`i` is 3, `j` is either `n-1` or `n-2`, `l` remains unchanged, `r` is `r-1`, `a` is `A[l-1] + (i - idx_A[l-1]) * l`, `b` is `B[r-1] - B[r-l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b` by adding `(idx_B[r] - i) * l` to its current value. Given the initial conditions, `b` was originally `B[r-1] - B[r-l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)`. After the addition, the new value of `b` becomes `B[r-1] - B[r-l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`. All other variables remain unchanged.
