Output State: **`j` is 2, `i` is `n - 4`, `idx_B` remains as it was, `B` remains as it was, `x` is `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - (n - 4)) * len(idx_B)`**

Explanation: The variable `x` is assigned the value of `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`. Given that `i` is `n - 4`, the expression for `x` simplifies to `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - (n - 4)) * len(idx_B)`. The values of `j`, `i`, `idx_B`, and `B` remain unchanged from their initial states.
