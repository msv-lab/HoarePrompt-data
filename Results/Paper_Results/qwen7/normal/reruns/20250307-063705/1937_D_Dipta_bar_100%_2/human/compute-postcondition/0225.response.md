Output State: **`i` is 3, `j` is either `n-1` or `n-2`, `l` remains unchanged, `r` is `r-1`, `a` is `A[l-1] + (i - idx_A[l-1]) * l`, `b` is `B[r-1] - B[r-l]`**

Explanation: The variable `b` is updated by subtracting `B[r - l]` from its current value. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `b` now holds the value of its previous value minus `B[r - l]`.
