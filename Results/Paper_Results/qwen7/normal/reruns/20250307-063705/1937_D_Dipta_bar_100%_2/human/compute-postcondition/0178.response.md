Let's break down the initial state and the expression to be printed step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 2.
   - `j` is `n-2`.
   - `a` is `A[1] + (2 - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`.
   - `b` is `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - 2) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - 2) * l`.
   - `l` and `r` remain unchanged.

2. **Expression to be Printed:**
   - `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1`

Given the initial state:
- `i` is explicitly given as 2.
- `a` is defined as `A[1] + (2 - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`. Here, `A[1]` is the second element of the list `A`, and `idx_A[l - 1]` is the index of the element at position `l - 1` in the list `A`.
- `b` is defined as `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - 2) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - 2) * l`. Here, `B[r]` is the element at position `r` in the list `B`, `B[r - l]` is the element at position `r - l` in the list `B`, and `idx_B[r - l]` and `idx_B[r]` are the indices of the elements at positions `r - l` and `r` in the list `B`.

Since the exact values of `A`, `B`, `idx_A`, and `idx_B` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical values of `a` and `b`. However, we can express them in terms of the given information.

Therefore, the expression to be printed is:
\[ a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1 \]

Substituting the known value of `i`:
\[ a * 2 + b * 2 + 2 + 1 = a * 2 + b * 2 + 3 \]

So, the output will be:
Output: **a * 2 + b * 2 + 3 (where a and b are defined as per the given formulas)**
