Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable `j` is defined in the range `0` to `n-1`.
   - The loop head does not explicitly define `s`, `i`, `A`, `idx_A`, or `idx_B`, but these are used within the loop body.

2. **Determine Which States Need Adjustment:**
   - Since the loop runs based on the value of `j`, and `j` ranges from `0` to `n-1`, the initial value of `j` should be set to `0` to start the loop.
   - The variable `n` (which is the length of the string `s`) is crucial because the loop will run `n` times if `j` starts from `0` and increments until it reaches `n-1`.

3. **Adjust the States:**
   - We need to ensure that `j` starts at `0` and that the loop will run `n` times. This means `j` should be `0` initially.
   - The value of `n` (the length of the string `s`) should be such that the loop will run `n` times.

4. **Consider the Other Variables:**
   - The variables `s`, `i`, `A`, `idx_A`, and `idx_B` are not directly involved in the loop condition but might be modified within the loop body. However, since the question asks to adjust the states for the loop to execute, we focus on the loop head variables.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `j` and `n`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`j` is 0, `n` is the length of the string `s`**
