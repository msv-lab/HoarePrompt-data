Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop runs from `0` to `n-1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is either `1` (if `s[0]` is '>', in which case `idx_A` is `[0]`) or `0` (if `s[0]` is not '>', in which case `idx_A` remains `[0]`).

3. **Check the current value of `i`**:
   - If `i` is `0`, the loop will not execute because `i` starts from `0` and goes up to `n-1`. Since `i` is `0`, it will not increment to `1` in the first iteration.
   - If `i` is `1`, the loop will execute because `i` is within the range `0` to `n-1`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - If `i` was `0` at the end of the previous iteration, then `i` will be incremented to `1` in the next iteration.
   - If `i` was `1` at the end of the previous iteration, then `i` will be incremented to `2` in the next iteration.

5. **Maintain the condition for `n`**:
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is the upper limit of the loop.

6. **Update the state**:
   - If `i` was `0` at the end of the previous iteration, then `i` will be `1` in the next iteration.
   - If `i` was `1` at the end of the previous iteration, then `i` will be `2` in the next iteration.
   - The value of `s` and `idx_A` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Given the above reasoning, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`s` is a string of length `n`, `i` is 1 (since `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration), `idx_A` is `[0]`**. 

If `i` was `1` at the end of the previous iteration, then:

**State: **`s` is a string of length `n`, `i` is 2, `idx_A` is `[0]`**.

Since we don't know the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, we provide both possible states:

**State: **`s` is a string of length `n`, `i` is 1, `idx_A` is `[0]`** or **`s` is a string of length `n`, `i` is 2, `idx_A` is `[0]`**.
