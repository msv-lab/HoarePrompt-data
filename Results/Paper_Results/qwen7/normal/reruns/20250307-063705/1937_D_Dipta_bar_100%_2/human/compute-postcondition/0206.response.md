Output: **n - 3, end=' '**

Explanation: 
- `i` is explicitly given as 3.
- `j` is either `n-1` or `n-2`, but this value is not needed to determine the output of the print statement.
- The print statement is `print(n - i, end=' ')`.

Given `i` is 3, the expression `n - i` evaluates to `n - 3`. The `end=' '` parameter ensures that there is a space after the printed value, but it does not affect what is printed. Therefore, the output is `n - 3` followed by a space.
