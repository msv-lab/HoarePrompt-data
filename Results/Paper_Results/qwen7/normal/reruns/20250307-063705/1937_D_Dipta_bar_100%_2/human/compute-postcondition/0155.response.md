Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is `n-1`, `l` and `r` remain unchanged, `a` is `B[n-2] + (idx_B[n-2] - 2) * (n-1)`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `a` based on the formula `a = B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`. Given that `i` is 2 and `r` is `n-1`, `a` is calculated as `B[n-2] + (idx_B[n-2] - 2) * (n-1)`. The values of `j`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged, and `i` stays as 2.
