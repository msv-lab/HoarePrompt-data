Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is `n-2`, `a` is `A[1] + (2 - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, `l` and `r` remain unchanged**.

Explanation: The variable `a` is updated to its previous value plus `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`. Given that `i` is 2, the expression simplifies to `a = A[1] + (2 - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`. The other variables (`j`, `l`, and `r`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
