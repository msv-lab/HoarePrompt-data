Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is `n-1`, `a` is equal to `A[2]`, `b` is equal to `A[2]`, `x` is `r - (l + 2)`, `l` and `r` remain unchanged.**

In this scenario, the code calculates the value of `x` as `r - (l + 2)`. Since `l` and `r` remain unchanged, the value of `x` is determined by subtracting `l + 2` from `r`. All other variables (`i`, `j`, `a`, `b`) are not affected by this operation.
