Postcondition: `i` is 0, `j` is `n-1`, `idx_B` is a list containing all indices where `s` has a '<', `B` is a list where each element is calculated based on the formula `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)` for each '<' encountered, starting with `0` if `idx_B` is initially empty, and `l` is `r - 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is not '>', `a` is `B[r]`, and if `l - r - 1 > 0`, then `b` is decreased by `(idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)`.
