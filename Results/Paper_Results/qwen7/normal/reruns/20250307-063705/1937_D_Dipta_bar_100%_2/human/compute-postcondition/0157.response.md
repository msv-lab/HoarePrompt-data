Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is `n-1`, `l` and `r` remain unchanged, `a` is `B[n-2] + (idx_B[n-2] - 2) * (n-1)`, `b` is `A[l - r - 2]`**

Explanation: The code `b = b - A[l - r - 1]` updates the value of `b`. Initially, `b` is equal to `A[l - 1]`. After executing the code, `b` is updated to `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1]`. Therefore, `b` is now `A[l - r - 2]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
