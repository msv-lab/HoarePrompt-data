Postcondition: `i` is 3, `j` is either `n-1` or `n-2`, `l` remains unchanged, `r` is `r-1`, `a` is `A[l-1] + (i - idx_A[l-1]) * l`, `b` is `B[r-1] - B[r-l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)`, and these conditions hold whether `r - l` is greater than or equal to 0 or not, since there is no else part provided.
