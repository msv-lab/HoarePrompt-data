Output State: The final output state after the loop executes all its iterations will be as follows:

- `s` is a string of length `n`.
- `i` will be equal to `n` because the loop runs from `0` to `n-1` and increments `i` each time.
- `A` will contain the cumulative sum of distances between '>' characters, starting from the last occurrence of '>' in `idx_A` and multiplied by the count of occurrences so far, plus the index difference.
- `idx_A` will be a list containing all indices where the character in `s` is '>', in the order they appear in the string.

In simpler terms, `A` will store the sum of distances from the last '>' to the current '>', multiplied by the number of '>' seen so far, and `idx_A` will be a list of all indices where `s` has a '>'.
