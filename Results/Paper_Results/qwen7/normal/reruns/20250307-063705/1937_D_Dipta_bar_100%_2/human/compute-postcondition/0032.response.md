Output State: The final output state after the loop executes all its iterations is as follows: `s` is a string of length `n`, `i` is equal to `n` (since the loop runs from `0` to `n-1` and increments `i` each time), `A` is a list containing the cumulative values calculated based on the positions of '>' characters in `s`, and `idx_A` is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in `s`.

In more detail, for each position `i` where `s[i]` is '>', the value appended to `A` is determined by the formula `(i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`, starting with `A.append(0)` when `idx_A` is initially empty. The list `idx_A` accumulates all indices where `s[i]` is '>'.
