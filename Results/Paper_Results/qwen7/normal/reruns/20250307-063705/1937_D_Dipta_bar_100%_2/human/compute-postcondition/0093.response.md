Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is `n-1`, `idx_B` is a list containing all indices where `s` has a '<', `B` is a list where each element is calculated based on the formula `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)` for each '<' encountered, starting with `0` if `idx_B` is initially empty, and `l` is `0`; `r` is the length of list `B`, `n` must be greater than 0, the current value of `s[i]` is '>', and `r` is greater than 0; `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, `b` is `A[l - 1]`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `A[l - 1]` to `b`. Since `l` is `0`, `A[l - 1]` refers to `A[-1]`, which is undefined in Python lists (it would raise an IndexError if directly accessed). However, since the problem specifies to use the specific values or expressions, we assume `A[-1]` is not directly used and instead `b` is assigned the value of `A[0 - 1]` which is `A[-1]` but considering the context, it's more appropriate to say `b` is undefined or not directly accessible without additional information. Given the constraints and the format, we state that `b` is assigned the value of `A[l - 1]`, which is undefined in this case.
