Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is `n-2`, `l` and `r` remain unchanged, `a` is `B[r]`, `b` is `A[l-1] - (idx_A[l-1] - idx_A[l-r-2]) * (l - r - 1) + (2 - idx_A[l-1]) * (r + 1)**.

Explanation: The variable `b` was previously defined as `A[l-1] - (idx_A[l-1] - idx_A[l-r-2]) * (l - r - 1)`. After executing the line `b = b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`, `b` gets updated by adding `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)` to its previous value. Given that `i` is 2, the expression `(i - idx_A[l - 1])` simplifies to `(2 - idx_A[l - 1])`. Therefore, `b` is now `A[l-1] - (idx_A[l-1] - idx_A[l-r-2]) * (l - r - 1) + (2 - idx_A[l-1]) * (r + 1)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
