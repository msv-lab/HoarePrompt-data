Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n`, `i` is 3, `idx_A` is `[0]`, `x` is `A[3] + (3 - 0) * 1`**.

Explanation: Given the initial state, `idx_A` is `[0, 1, 2, 3]` because the character at index `3` in string `s` is `'>'`. However, the code changes `idx_A` to `[0]` since the character at index `3` is not `'>'`. The value of `x` is calculated as `A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`, which simplifies to `A[3] + (3 - 0) * 1` because `len(A)` is `1` (since `idx_A` now has only one element), `i` is `3`, and `idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]` is `0`. All other variables remain unchanged.
