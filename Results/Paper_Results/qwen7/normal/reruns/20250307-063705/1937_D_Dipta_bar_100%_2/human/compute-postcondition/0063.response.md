Output State: **`j` is 2, `i` is `n - 4`, `idx_B` remains as it was, `B` is updated with `x + [x]`, `x` is `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - (n - 4)) * len(idx_B)**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `x` to the list `B`. The value of `x` is defined as `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - (n - 4)) * len(idx_B)`. Since `B` and `idx_B` are unchanged except for the new element added, `x` remains the same as its previous definition. Therefore, `B` is updated with the new element `x`, and `x` retains its original value.
