Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `j` is `n-1`, `idx_B` is a list containing all indices where `s` has a '<', `B` is a list where each element is calculated based on the formula `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)` for each '<' encountered, starting with `0` if `idx_B` is initially empty, and `l` is `0`; `r` is either `0` or the length of list `B`, `n` must be greater than 0, the current value of `s[i]` is '>', and if `r` is greater than 0, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, `b` is `B[r - 1] - B[x] - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)` if `x` is greater than or equal to `0`, otherwise `b` remains unchanged.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after executing the if-else block. It covers both scenarios: when `l < r` and when `l >= r`, providing the final values of the relevant variables based on the conditions and operations performed within the if-else block.
