Postcondition: **`i` is 3, `j` is either `n-1` or `n-2`, `l` and `r` remain unchanged or update according to the conditions specified. If `s[i] == '>'` and `l < r`, then `a` is updated to `A[3]` and `b` is updated based on the condition `x >= 0`. If `l < r` is false, then if `r` is 0, `i`, `j`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged. Otherwise, `a` and `b` are updated based on specific conditions involving `r`. If `s[i] == '>'` and `l < r` is false, then if `r` is 0, `a` and `b` remain unchanged. Otherwise, `i`, `j`, `l`, and `r` change to `r-1`, and `a` and `b` are updated accordingly. If `s[i] != '>'` or `r` is 0, then `l` remains unchanged, `r` is updated to `r-1`, and `a` and `b` are updated based on the new value of `r`.**
