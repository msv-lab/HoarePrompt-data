Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is `n-1`, `idx_B` is a list containing all indices where `s` has a '<', `B` is a list where each element is calculated based on the formula `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)` for each '<' encountered, starting with `0` if `idx_B` is initially empty, and `l` is `r - 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is not '>', `a` is `B[r]`, `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 2]`.**

Explanation: The code subtracts `A[l - r - 2]` from `A[l - 1]`, updating the value of `b` to `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 2]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
