Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is `n-1`, `idx_B` is a list containing all indices where `s` has a '<', `B` is a list where each element is calculated based on the formula `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)` for each '<' encountered, starting with `0` if `idx_B` is initially empty, and `l` is greater than 0; `r` is `r - 1`, `n` is greater than 0, and `s[i]` is not '>', and the current value of `l` is less than or equal to the current value of `r`; `a` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, `b` is `B[r] - B[r - l]`.**

Explanation: The code `b = b - B[r - l]` subtracts the value of `B[r - l]` from `b`. Since `B` is a list where each element is calculated based on the given formula, and `r` is decremented by 1, the new value of `b` is the old value of `b` minus `B[r - l]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
