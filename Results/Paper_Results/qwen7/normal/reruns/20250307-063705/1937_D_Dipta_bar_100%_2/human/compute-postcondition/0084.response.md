Let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `j` is `n-1`.
   - `idx_B` is a list containing all indices where `s` has a '<'.
   - `B` is a list where each element is calculated based on the formula `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)` for each '<' encountered, starting with `0` if `idx_B` is initially empty.
   - `l` is `0`.
   - `r` is the length of list `B`.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - The current value of `s[i]` is '>'.
   - `l` is less than `r`.
   - `a` is `A[0]`.
   - `x` is `r - (l + 2)`.
   - If `x` is greater than or equal to 0, then `b` is `B[r - 1] - B[x] - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1); otherwise, `b` remains unchanged.
   - `b` is `b + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1, end=' ')
   ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Value of `i`:**
   - Given: `i = 1`.

2. **Value of `a`:**
   - `a` is `A[0]`. Since `A` is not explicitly defined, we cannot determine the exact value of `a`. We'll keep it as `A[0]`.

3. **Value of `b`:**
   - `b` is determined based on the conditions involving `x`, `B`, and `idx_B`.
   - `x` is `r - (l + 2)`.
     - `r` is the length of `B`.
     - `l` is `0`.
     - Therefore, `x = r - 2`.
   - If `x` is greater than or equal to 0, then `b` is calculated as follows:
     - `b = B[r - 1] - B[x] - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)`.
   - Otherwise, `b` remains unchanged.
   - Since `l` is `0`, `x = r - 2`. For `b` to be defined, `r` must be at least 2. If `r` is 2, then `x = 0` and `b` would be calculated as above. If `r` is greater than 2, `x` would be positive and `b` would be calculated similarly.

4. **Value of `b` Calculation:**
   - Assuming `r` is at least 2 (since `l` is `0` and `l < r`), let's assume `r = 2` for simplicity (the exact value of `r` isn't specified, but it must be at least 2).
   - `x = 2 - 2 = 0`.
   - `b = B[1] - B[0] - (idx_B[0] - idx_B[1]) * (0 + 1)`.
   - Simplifying, `b = B[1] - B[0] - (idx_B[0] - idx_B[1])`.

5. **Final Expression:**
   - The expression to print is `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1`.
   - Substituting the values:
     - `a = A[0]`.
     - `b = B[1] - B[0] - (idx_B[0] - idx_B[1])`.
     - `i = 1`.
   - Therefore, the expression becomes: `2 * A[0] + 2 * (B[1] - B[0] - (idx_B[0] - idx_B[1])) + 1 + 1`.

### Final Output:
Given the steps and the initial state, the final output is:
Output: **2 * A[0] + 2 * (B[1] - B[0] - (idx_B[0] - idx_B[1])) + 2**
