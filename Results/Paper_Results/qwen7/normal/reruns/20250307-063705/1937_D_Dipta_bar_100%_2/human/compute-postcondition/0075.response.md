Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is `n-1`, `idx_B` is a list containing all indices where `s` has a '<', `B` is a list where each element is calculated based on the formula `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)` for each '<' encountered, starting with `0` if `idx_B` is initially empty, and `l` is `0`; `r` is the length of list `B`, `n` must be greater than 0, the current value of `s[i]` is '>', and `l` is less than `r`; `a` is `A[0]`.**

Explanation: The code `a = A[l]` assigns the value of `A[0]` to `a`. Since `l` is `0`, `a` is set to the first element of list `A`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
