Output State: **Postcondition: `j` is `n-1`, `i` is `0`. `idx_B` is a list containing all indices where `s` has a '<', and `B` is a list where each element is calculated based on the formula `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)` for each '<' encountered, starting with `0` if `idx_B` is initially empty.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `j` will be `n-1` because the loop runs from `0` to `n-1`. The variable `i` starts at `n-1` and decreases by `1` in each iteration until it reaches `0`. For each index `i` where `s[i]` is '<', `idx_B` is updated with the current index, and `B` is updated according to the specified formula. The final state of `B` will contain the cumulative sums as described, starting from `0` if `idx_B` was initially empty.
