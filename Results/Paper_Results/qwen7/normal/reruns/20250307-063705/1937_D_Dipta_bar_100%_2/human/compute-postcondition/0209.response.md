Output State: **`i` is 3, `j` is either `n-1` or `n-2`, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - 3) * r`, `b` is `A[l - r - 1]`**

Explanation: The code `b = b - A[l - r - 1]` updates the value of `b`. Initially, `b` is equal to `A[l - 1]`. After executing the code, `b` becomes `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1]`. The values of `i`, `j`, `a`, and `n` remain unchanged.
