Output State: **`j` is 2, `i` is `n - 4`, `idx_B` is `[idx_B[0], n - 4]`, and `B` is updated according to the conditions provided.**

Explanation:
- The initial state includes `j` being 2, `i` being `n - 4`, `idx_B` remaining unchanged, and `B` being updated based on certain conditions.
- The code snippet `idx_B.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is `n - 4`) to the list `idx_B`.
- Since `idx_B` was initially `[idx_B[0]]` (from the initial state), after appending `n - 4`, `idx_B` becomes `[idx_B[0], n - 4]`.
- The values of `j` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
- The value of `B` is updated according to the conditions provided in the initial state, but since no new operations are performed on `B` in this snippet, its updated state remains as per the initial conditions given.
