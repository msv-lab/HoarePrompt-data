Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 3.
   - `j` is either `n-1` or `n-2`.
   - `l` remains unchanged (its value is not specified, so let's assume it is some value `L`).
   - `r` is `r-1`. Since `r` is not initially defined, we need to infer its value. Given that `r` is updated to `r-1`, if `r` was initially undefined or zero, it would become `-1` or `-2` respectively, but typically in such contexts, `r` might be initialized to a positive value. For simplicity, let's assume `r` was initially 1, so now `r` is 0.
   - `a` is `r-1`, so `a` is `0-1 = -1`.
   - `b` is defined as `A[l - r - 3] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`.
     - `A[l - r - 3]`: Since `r` is 0, this becomes `A[L - 0 - 3] = A[L - 3]`.
     - `(idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)`: This part depends on the values of `idx_A`. Assuming `l` is `L`, then `l - r - 2` is `L - 0 - 2 = L - 2`, so this term becomes `(idx_A[L - 1] - idx_A[L - 2]) * (L - 0 - 1) = (idx_A[L - 1] - idx_A[L - 2]) * (L - 1)`.
     - `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`: This term becomes `(3 - idx_A[L - 1]) * (0 + 1) = (3 - idx_A[L - 1])`.

So, `b` simplifies to:
\[ b = A[L - 3] - (idx_A[L - 1] - idx_A[L - 2]) \cdot (L - 1) + (3 - idx_A[L - 1]) \]

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i), end=' ')`.
   - Substituting the values of `a` and `b`:
     - `a * 2` is `-1 * 2 = -2`.
     - `b * 2` is `2 \cdot (A[L - 3] - (idx_A[L - 1] - idx_A[L - 2]) \cdot (L - 1) + (3 - idx_A[L - 1]))`.
     - `(n - i)` is `n - 3`.

Therefore, the expression inside the print statement becomes:
\[ -2 + 2 \cdot (A[L - 3] - (idx_A[L - 1] - idx_A[L - 2]) \cdot (L - 1) + (3 - idx_A[L - 1])) + (n - 3) \]

Since the exact values of `A[L - 3]`, `idx_A[L - 1]`, and `idx_A[L - 2]` are not provided, we cannot simplify further. However, we can describe the output in a general form.

Output: **-2 + 2 \cdot (A[L - 3] - (idx_A[L - 1] - idx_A[L - 2]) \cdot (L - 1) + (3 - idx_A[L - 1])) + (n - 3)**
