Output State: **`j` is `n-1`, `i` is `0`, `idx_B` is a list containing all indices where `s` has a '<', `B` is a list where each element is calculated based on the formula `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)` for each '<' encountered, starting with `0` if `idx_B` is initially empty, and `l` is `0`.**

Explanation: The variable `l` is assigned the value `0`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain as they were in the initial state.
