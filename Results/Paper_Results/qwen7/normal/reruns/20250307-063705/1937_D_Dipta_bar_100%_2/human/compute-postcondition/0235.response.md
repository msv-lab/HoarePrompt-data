Output State: **`i` is 3, `j` is either `n-1` or `n-2`, `l` remains unchanged, `r` is `r-1`, `a` is `r-1`, `b` is `A[l - r - 3]`**

Explanation: The code `b = b - A[l - r - 2]` updates the value of `b`. Given the initial state, `b` is `A[l - 1]`. After the operation, `b` becomes `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 2]`, which simplifies to `A[l - r - 3]` since `l - r - 2` is equivalent to `l - (r + 2)` and `l - 1` is one less than `l - 0`, thus `l - r - 3` is the correct index for `b`. All other variables remain unchanged.
