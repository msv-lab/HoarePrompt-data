Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n`, `i` is `n`, `A` contains the cumulative sum of distances from the last '>' to the current '>', multiplied by the number of '>' seen so far, and `idx_A` is a list of all indices where `s` has a '>', `B` is an empty list.**

Explanation:
- The initial state of `s` is a string of length `n`.
- The variable `i` is set to `n` because the loop runs from `0` to `n-1` and increments `i` each time, reaching `n` at the end of the loop.
- The variable `A` contains the cumulative sum of distances from the last `>` to the current `>`, multiplied by the number of `>` seen so far, as described.
- The variable `idx_A` is a list of all indices where `s` has a `>`, as described.
- The variable `B` is initialized as an empty list by the line `B = []`.
