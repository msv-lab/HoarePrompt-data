Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is `n-2`, `a` is `A[1]`, `l` and `r` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `a = A[l - 1]` assigns the value of the element at index `l - 1` of the list `A` to the variable `a`. Given that `i` is 2, and assuming `l` is also 2 (since `i = 2` and `l` and `r` remain unchanged), `l - 1` would be 1. Therefore, `a` is set to `A[1]`. The values of `j`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged.
