Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `j` is `n-1`, `idx_B` is a list containing all indices where `s` has a '<', `B` is a list where each element is calculated based on the formula `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)` for each '<' encountered, starting with `0` if `idx_B` is initially empty, and `l` is either `0` or greater than `0`; `r` is `r - 1`, `n` is greater than 0, and `s[i]` is not '>', and the current value of `l` is less than or equal to the current value of `r`; if `l` is `0`, then `a` is `0`, otherwise `a` is `A[l - 1] + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, and `b` is `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l` if `r - l >= 0`.**
