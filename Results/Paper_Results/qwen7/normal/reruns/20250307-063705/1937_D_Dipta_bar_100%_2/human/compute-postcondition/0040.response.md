Output State: **`j` is 0; `i` is `n - 1 - j`; the current value of `s[i]` is '<'; the length of `idx_B` is 0; `B` contains the value `0`.**

Explanation: The code `B.append(0)` appends the value `0` to the list `B`. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, `j` is still `0`, `i` is still `n - 1 - j`, the value of `s[i]` is still `<`, the length of `idx_B` is still `0`, and `B` now contains the value `0`.
