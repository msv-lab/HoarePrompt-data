Output State: **`j` is 1, `i` is `n - 3`, `B` is a list containing 0**

Explanation: The code `B.append(0)` adds the value `0` to the list `B`. Since `j` and `i` were not affected by this operation, their values remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes the new element in the list `B`.
