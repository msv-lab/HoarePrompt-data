Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is `n-1`, `l` and `r` remain unchanged, `a` is `B[n-2] + (idx_B[n-2] - 2) * (n-1)`, `b` is `A[l - 1]`**

The code assigns the value of `A[l - 1]` to the variable `b`. Given the initial state, `l` remains unchanged, so `b` is now set to the value of `A[l - 1]`. The other variables (`i`, `j`, `a`, `l`, `r`) are not affected by this assignment.
