Output State: **`i` is 3, `j` is either `n-1` or `n-2`, `l` remains unchanged, `r` remains unchanged, `a` is `A[l]`, `x` is `r - (l + 2)`, `b` is `B[r - 1] - B[x] - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)**

Explanation: The variable `b` is updated by subtracting `(idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)` from its original value. All other variables remain unchanged. The new value of `b` is expressed in terms of the original values and the changes made.
