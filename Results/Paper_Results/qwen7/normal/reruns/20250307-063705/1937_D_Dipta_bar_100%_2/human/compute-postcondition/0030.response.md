Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n`, `i` is 3, `idx_A` is `[3]`, and `A` is `[0]`**.

Explanation: The code `idx_A.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 3) to the list `idx_A`. Initially, `idx_A` is either `[0]` or `[0, A[3] + 3]` depending on the condition. Since the condition is not met (the character at index 3 in `s` is not `'>'`), `idx_A` remains `[0]`. After appending `i` (which is 3), `idx_A` becomes `[3]`. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 3, and `A` remains `[0]` because no changes were made to it.
