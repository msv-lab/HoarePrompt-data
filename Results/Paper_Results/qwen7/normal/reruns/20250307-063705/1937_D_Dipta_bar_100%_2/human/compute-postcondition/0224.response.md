Output State: **`i` is 3, `j` is either `n-1` or `n-2`, `l` remains unchanged, `r` is `r-1`, `a` is `A[l-1] + (i - idx_A[l-1]) * l`, `b` is `B[r-1]`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `B[r]` to `b`. Since `r` was previously `r-1`, the new value of `b` is `B[r-1]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states.
