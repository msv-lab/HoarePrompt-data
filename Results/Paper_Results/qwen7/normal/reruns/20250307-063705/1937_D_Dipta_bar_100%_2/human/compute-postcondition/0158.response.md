Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is `n-1`, `l` and `r` remain unchanged, `a` is `B[n-2] + (idx_B[n-2] - 2) * (n-1)`, `b` is `A[l - r - 2] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)**.

Explanation: The variable `b` is updated by subtracting `(idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)` from its current value. The other variables (`i`, `j`, `l`, `r`, `a`) remain unchanged. The new value of `b` is expressed as the original value of `b` minus the specified calculation.
