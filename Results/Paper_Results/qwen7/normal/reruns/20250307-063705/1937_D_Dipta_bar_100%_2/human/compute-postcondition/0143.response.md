Postcondition: **`i`, `j`, `idx_B`, `B`, `l`, `r`, `n` are as follows: if `s[i]` is '>', then `i` is 1, `j` is `n-1`, `l` is 1, `r` is either `0` or the length of list `B`, and `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r` if `r` is greater than `0`, otherwise `a` is `0`. If `s[i]` is not '>', then `i` is 0, `l` is either `0` or `r - 1`, and `a` is `0` if `l` is `0`, otherwise `a` is `B[l - 1] + (i - idx_B[l - 1]) * l`. Also, `b` is calculated based on the value of `l` and `r`: if `l` is less than or equal to `r`, then `b` is `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l` if `r - l >= 0`, otherwise `b` remains unchanged. If `l` is greater than `r`, then `b` is `b + (i - idx_B[l - 1]) * (r + 1)` if `l - r - 1 > 0`, otherwise `b` remains unchanged.**
