Output State: **`i` is 3, `j` is either `n-1` or `n-2`, `l` remains unchanged, `r` is `r-1`, `a` is `r-1`, `b` is `A[l - r - 3] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)`**

Explanation: The value of `b` is updated by subtracting `(idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)` from its current value. Since the exact values of `idx_A[l - 1]`, `idx_A[l - r - 2]`, `l`, `r`, and `A[l - r - 3]` are not specified, we express the new value of `b` in terms of these variables. All other variables remain unchanged.
