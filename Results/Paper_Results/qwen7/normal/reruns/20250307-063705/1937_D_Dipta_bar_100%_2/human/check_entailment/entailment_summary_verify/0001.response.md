### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves simulating the movement of a pinball on a one-dimensional grid.
   - The pinball starts at each cell and moves according to the direction specified by the character in that cell ('<' or '>').
   - After each move, the direction of the cell is reversed.
   - The pinball stops when it moves out of the grid boundaries.

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the grid size `n` and the grid configuration `s`.
   - The function `func_1(s)` is designed to compute the time taken for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell.

3. **Function `func_1(s)` Breakdown:**
   - **Left-to-Right Calculation (`A` array):**
     - This part calculates the time taken for a pinball to leave the grid when starting from the leftmost cell and moving towards the right.
     - It uses a list `A` to store cumulative times and indices where the direction changes.
   - **Right-to-Left Calculation (`B` array):**
     - This part calculates the time taken for a pinball to leave the grid when starting from the rightmost cell and moving towards the left.
     - It uses a list `B` to store cumulative times and indices where the direction changes.
   - **Combining Results:**
     - The main loop combines the results from the left-to-right and right-to-left calculations to determine the time taken for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell.

4. **Verification:**
   - The code handles the boundary conditions correctly.
   - The logic for calculating the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid is sound.
   - The code correctly accounts for the reversal of directions after each move.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles edge cases such as when the pinball starts at the boundary cells or when the entire grid is moving in the same direction.

However, upon closer inspection, there are several issues with the implementation:

- **Incorrect Calculation of Time:**
  - The calculation of the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid is overly complex and does not accurately reflect the movement rules described in the problem statement.
  - The formulas used in the `func_1` function do not correctly simulate the pinball's movement and the reversal of directions.

- **Incorrect Handling of Directions:**
  - The function `func_1` does not properly handle the reversal of directions after each move. Instead, it seems to be attempting to precompute some values that do not align with the problem requirements.

- **Complexity and Readability:**
  - The code is highly complex and difficult to follow, making it prone to errors and hard to verify correctness.

Given these issues, the provided code does not correctly implement the solution for the problem statement.
