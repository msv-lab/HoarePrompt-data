Postcondition: `i` is 2, `j` is either `n-1` or `n-2`, `l` and `r` remain unchanged. If `s[i] == '>'`, then `l` is incremented by 1, and the conditions for `a` and `b` remain unchanged. If `s[i] != '>'` and `l` is 0, `a` is recalculated based on `i = 2`, and `b` is recalculated based on `i = 2`. If `s[i] != '>'` and `r` is 0, `a` is recalculated based on `i = 2`, and `b` is recalculated based on `i = 2`. Otherwise, depending on whether `l` is greater than 0, `a` is either `A[1] + (2 - idx_A[l - 1]) * l` or `B[r]`, and `b` is either `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - 2) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - 2) * l` or `A[l-1] - (idx_A[l-1] - idx_A[l-r-2]) * (l - r - 1) + (2 - idx_A[l-1]) * (r + 1)`.
