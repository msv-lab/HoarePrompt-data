Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is `n-2`, `a` is `A[1] + (2 - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, `b` is `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - 2) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - 2) * l`, `l` and `r` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The variable `b` was previously defined as `B[r] - B[r - l] - (idx_B[r - l] - 2) * (r - l)`. After executing the line `b = b + (idx_B[r] - i) * l`, `b` is updated to include the additional term `(idx_B[r] - 2) * l` since `i` is 2. All other variables (`i`, `j`, `a`, `l`, and `r`) remain unchanged.
