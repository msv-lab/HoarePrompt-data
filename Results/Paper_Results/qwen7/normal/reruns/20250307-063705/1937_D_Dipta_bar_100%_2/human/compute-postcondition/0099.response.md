Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is `n-1`, `idx_B` is a list containing all indices where `s` has a '<', `B` is a list where each element is calculated based on the formula `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)` for each '<' encountered, starting with `0` if `idx_B` is initially empty, and `l` is `0`; `r` is the length of list `B`, `n` must be greater than 0, the current value of `s[i]` is '>', and `r` is greater than 0; `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b` by adding `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r` to its previous value. Since `i` is 1 and `l` is 0, `idx_A[l - 1]` is `idx_A[-1]`, which is undefined, but since `l` is 0, the term `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r` simplifies to just `1 * r` because `idx_A[-1]` is considered as 0 in this context. Therefore, `b` is updated to its previous value plus `r`.
