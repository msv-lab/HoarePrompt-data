Output State: **`i` is 3, `j` is either `n-1` or `n-2`, `l` remains unchanged, `r` is `r-1`, `a` is `A[l-1] + (i - idx_A[l-1]) * l`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `a` by adding `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l` to its current value. Given the initial state, `i` is 3, `l` remains unchanged, `r` is `r-1`, `a` is `A[l-1]`, and `j` is either `n-1` or `n-2`. Since `idx_A[l - 1]` is not specified, it remains as part of the expression for `a`.
