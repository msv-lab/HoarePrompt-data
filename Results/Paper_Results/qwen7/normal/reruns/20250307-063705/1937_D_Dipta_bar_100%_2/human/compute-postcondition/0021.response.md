Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n`, `i` is 2, `idx_A` is `[0, 1, 2]`**.

Explanation: Initially, `idx_A` is either `[0, 0]` or `[0, 1]`. Given the condition, if `len(idx_A) == 0`, then `i` is 1 and `idx_A` is `[0, 0]`. Otherwise, `i` is 2 and `idx_A` is `[0, 1]`. In both cases, the code appends `i` to `idx_A`. Since `i` is 2 in both conditions, `idx_A` becomes `[0, 1, 2]`. The length of `s` and the value of `i` remain unchanged.
