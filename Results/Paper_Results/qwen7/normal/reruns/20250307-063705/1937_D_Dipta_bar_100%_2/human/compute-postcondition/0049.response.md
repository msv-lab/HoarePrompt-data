Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `j = 0` to `j < n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is 0
   - `i` is `n - 1 - j`
   - `idx_B` is updated based on certain conditions involving `s[i]`
   - `B` is updated based on `idx_B` and `x`

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `j` will be `1`.
   - Calculate `i` for the next iteration: `i = n - 1 - 1 = n - 2`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `j` will be incremented to 1.
   - `i` will be updated to `n - 2`.

6. **Other states remain unchanged**:
   - The values of `idx_B` and `B` are determined within the loop body and depend on the specific operations performed inside the loop. We cannot predict their exact values without seeing the loop body, but they will be updated accordingly during the loop execution.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the next iteration are `j` and `i`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`j` is 1, `i` is `n - 2`**.
