Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is `n-1`, `a` is equal to `A[2]`, `b` is equal to `B[r-1]`, `x` is `r - (l + 2)`**

Explanation: The code snippet `b = B[r - 1]` assigns the value of `B[r - 1]` to the variable `b`. The values of the other variables (`i`, `j`, `a`, `x`, `l`, and `r`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
