Output State: **i is 3, j is n-1, l is 3, r is 0, B is [0, 6, 18], idx_B is [1, 3, 5], a is 0, b is 0, n is n.**

To understand this output state:

- The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = 3` because the loop condition is `for i in range(0, n)`. After three iterations, `i` becomes 3.
- Since the loop condition checks `s[i]`, and no further characters are processed beyond `i = 3`, `j` remains `n-1` or `n-2` (depending on the exact string `s` and its last character).
- `l` is incremented with each iteration when `s[i] == '>'` and `l < r`, which happens until `l` reaches 3.
- `r` is decremented with each iteration when `s[i] != '>'` and `r` is greater than 0, but it becomes 0 after the third iteration.
- `B` and `idx_B` are updated based on the loop's conditions and calculations. After three iterations, `B` contains `[0, 6, 18]` and `idx_B` contains `[1, 3, 5]`.
- Variables `a` and `b` are recalculated during each iteration based on the conditions provided, but they remain 0 after the third iteration since no further updates are made once `r` becomes 0.
- `n` remains unchanged as it is an input parameter to the loop.
