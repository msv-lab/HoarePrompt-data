Given the initial state:
- `i` is 2
- `j` is `n-1`

The code snippet to analyze is:
```python
print(n - i, end=' ')
```

Let's break it down step-by-step:
1. We know `i` is explicitly given as 2.
2. `j` is defined as `n-1`, but `j` itself is not needed for the calculation in the print statement.
3. The expression `n - i` will be evaluated with `i` being 2. So, `n - i` simplifies to `n - 2`.

Therefore, the print statement will output the value of `n - 2`.

Output: **n - 2**
