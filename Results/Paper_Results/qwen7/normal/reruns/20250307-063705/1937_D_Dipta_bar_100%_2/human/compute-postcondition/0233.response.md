Output State: **`i` is 3, `j` is either `n-1` or `n-2`, `l` remains unchanged, `r` is `r-1`, `a` is `r-1`**

Explanation: The code `a = B[r]` assigns the value of `B[r]` to the variable `a`. Since `r` is `r-1`, `a` is assigned the value of `B[r-1]`. The other variables (`i`, `j`, `l`) remain unchanged.
