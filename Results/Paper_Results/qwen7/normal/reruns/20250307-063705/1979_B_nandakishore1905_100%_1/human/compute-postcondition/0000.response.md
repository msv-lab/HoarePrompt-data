Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `int(input())`.
   - Therefore, the loop will execute if `int(input())` is at least 1.

3. **Initial State of Variables:**
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - For each test case, `x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq x, y \leq 10^9\).

4. **Adjusting the State:**
   - Since the loop depends on `int(input())`, we need to ensure that `int(input())` is at least 1.
   - The value of `t` is already given as a positive integer within the specified range, so no adjustment is needed for `t`.

5. **Final State Adjustment:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `int(input())` is at least 1. Given that `t` is a positive integer, `int(input())` will always be at least 1 when the input is valid.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and `int(input())` must be at least 1**.
