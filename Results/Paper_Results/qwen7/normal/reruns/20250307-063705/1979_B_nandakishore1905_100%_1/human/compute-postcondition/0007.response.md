Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the first integer entered by the user, `m` is the second integer entered by the user, and `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. The absolute difference `k` is not a power of 2, and the current value of `k` is odd.**
