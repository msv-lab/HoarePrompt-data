Output State: **`p` is the length of the string representation of the binary form of the integer value of `f - 2` with '0b' prefix removed; `q` is 2; `l` is the binary representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix.**

Explanation:
- The initial state defines that `p` is the length of the string representation of the binary form of the integer value of `f - 2` with '0b' prefix removed. This means `p` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `f - 2`.
- The initial state also defines that `q` is 2.
- The code `l = bin(f).replace('0b', '')` converts the integer `f` to its binary representation with the '0b' prefix, removes the '0b' prefix, and assigns the resulting string to `l`. Therefore, `l` now holds the binary representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix.

Since the code does not change the values of `p` and `q`, they remain as defined in the initial state. The new variable `l` is introduced with the value being the binary representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix.
