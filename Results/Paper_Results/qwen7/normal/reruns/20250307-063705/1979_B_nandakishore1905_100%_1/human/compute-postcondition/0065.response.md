Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer entered by the user, `m` is an integer entered by the user, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `i` is 3.**

The code calculates the absolute difference between `n` and `m` and assigns it to `k`. The values of `t`, `i`, and the user input for `n` and `m` remain unchanged. Therefore, `t` remains a positive integer within the specified range, `n` and `m` are the integers entered by the user, and `k` is the absolute difference between these two integers. The value of `i` remains 3.
