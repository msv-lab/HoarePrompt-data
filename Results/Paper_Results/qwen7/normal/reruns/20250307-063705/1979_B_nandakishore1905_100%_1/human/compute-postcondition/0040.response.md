Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the first integer entered by the user, `m` is the second integer entered by the user, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `i` is 2, `l` is a binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the length of the binary string representation of the absolute difference between `n` and `m` (stored in `k`). This length is stored in `p`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
