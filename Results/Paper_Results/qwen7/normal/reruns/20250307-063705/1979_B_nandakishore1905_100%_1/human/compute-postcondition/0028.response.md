Output State: **`p` is the length of the binary string representation of `f-2` without the '0b' prefix; `l` is the binary string representation of `f-2` without the '0b' prefix; `q` is 2**.

Explanation: The value of `f` is decreased by `q` (which is 2), so both `p` and `l` are updated to reflect the new value of `f-2`. The value of `q` remains unchanged.
