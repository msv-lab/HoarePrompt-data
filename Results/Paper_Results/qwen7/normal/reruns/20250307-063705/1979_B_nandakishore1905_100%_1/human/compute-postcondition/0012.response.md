Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the first integer entered by the user, `m` is the second integer entered by the user, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m` (and `k` is even), `l` is a binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`, `q` is \(2^{(p - 1)}\)**.

Explanation: The code assigns `q` the value of \(2^{(p - 1)}\), where `p` is the length of the binary string `l`. The length `p` of `l` is derived from the binary representation of `k`, which is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
