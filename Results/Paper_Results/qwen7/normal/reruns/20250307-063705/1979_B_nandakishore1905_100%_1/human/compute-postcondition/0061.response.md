Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the first integer entered by the user, `m` is the second integer entered by the user, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `i` is 2, `k` is updated to be the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. If `k` is odd, `k` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `k` is updated to 0, and `l` is an empty string, `p` is 0, `q` is 1, `f` is 0.**
