Output State: **`l` is a string representing the binary form of the integer value of `f`, without the '0b' prefix.**

Explanation: The code `l = bin(f).replace('0b', '')` converts the integer value of `f` to its binary representation using the `bin()` function, which prefixes the result with '0b'. The `replace('0b', '')` method removes this prefix, leaving `l` as a string containing only the binary digits. No other variables are affected by this code.
