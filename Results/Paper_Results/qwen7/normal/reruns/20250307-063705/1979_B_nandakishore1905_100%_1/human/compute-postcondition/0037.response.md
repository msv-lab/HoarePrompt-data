Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is the first integer entered by the user.
- `m` is the second integer entered by the user.
- `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.
- `i` is 2.
- `k` is updated to be the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.

The `print(k)` statement will print the value of `k`, which is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.

Output: **the absolute difference between n and m**
