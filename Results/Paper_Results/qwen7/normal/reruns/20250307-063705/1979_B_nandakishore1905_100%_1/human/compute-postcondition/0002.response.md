Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the first integer entered by the user, `m` is the second integer entered by the user, and `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.**

This means that the variable `k` is now assigned the value of the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged from their initial states.
