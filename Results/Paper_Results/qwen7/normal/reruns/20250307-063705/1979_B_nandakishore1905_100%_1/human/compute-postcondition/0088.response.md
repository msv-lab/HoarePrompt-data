Output State: `l` is an empty string; `p` is 0; `q` is 2.

Explanation: The loop continues to subtract \(2^{(p-1)}\) from `f` until `f` becomes 1. After each iteration, `f` is updated to `f - q`, where `q` is always 2. Since `q` is 2, `f` is effectively being halved in each iteration (ignoring the remainder). Given that `f` starts as a positive integer and is reduced by 2 each time, eventually `f` will reach 1. When `f` is 1, `q` remains 2 but `f - q` becomes -1. The binary representation of -1 is not applicable in this context because the loop condition checks `f & (f - 1) != 0`, which is false for `f = 1`. Therefore, the loop terminates when `f` is 1. At this point, `l` would be the binary representation of `f - 2`, which is `-1` in binary (though not typically represented as a binary string for negative numbers in this context), making `l` an empty string since we're dealing with positive integers and their binary representations. `p` is the length of `l`, which is 0, and `q` remains 2.
