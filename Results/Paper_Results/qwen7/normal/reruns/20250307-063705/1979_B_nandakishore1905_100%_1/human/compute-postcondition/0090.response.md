Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` and `m` are integers entered by the user, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `i` is 3, `l` is an empty string, `p` is 0, and `q` is 2.**

Explanation: If the condition `k % 2 != 0` is true, the program does not perform any operations on the variables `l`, `p`, and `q`. As a result, `l` remains an empty string, `p` remains 0, and `q` remains 2. If the condition `k % 2 != 0` is false, the program enters the else part, where `l` is set to an empty string, `p` is set to 0, and `q` is set to 2. Therefore, regardless of whether the condition is true or false, the final values of `l`, `p`, and `q` are the same.
