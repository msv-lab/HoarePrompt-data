Output State: **`p` is the length of the string representation of the binary form of the integer value of `f - 2` with '0b' prefix removed; `q` is 2**.

Explanation: The value of `f` is decreased by 2, so `f` becomes `f - 2`. The value of `p` is determined by the length of the binary representation of `f - 2` without the '0b' prefix. The value of `q` remains unchanged.
