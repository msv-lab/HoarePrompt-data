Output State: **`p` is the length of the binary representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix, `q` is 2 ** (p - 1), and `l` is the binary representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix.**

Explanation: The value of `q` is updated to `2 ** (p - 1)`. The values of `p` and `l` remain unchanged from their initial state.
