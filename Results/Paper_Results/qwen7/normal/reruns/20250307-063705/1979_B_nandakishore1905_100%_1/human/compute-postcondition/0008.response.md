Output: **1**

Explanation: The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k`. However, the specific values of `n` and `m` are not explicitly given, only that `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, and it is specified that `k` is odd and not a power of 2. The print statement simply outputs the integer `1`, regardless of the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`. Therefore, the output will always be `1`.
