Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the first integer entered by the user, `m` is the second integer entered by the user, and `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. The absolute difference `k` is even; `l` is a binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix.**

Explanation: The code converts the even number `k` into its binary representation using the `bin()` function and removes the '0b' prefix using the `replace()` method. The resulting binary string is stored in the variable `l`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
