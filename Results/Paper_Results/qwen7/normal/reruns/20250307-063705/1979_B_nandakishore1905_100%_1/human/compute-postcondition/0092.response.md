Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). For each test case, `i` will be equal to the total number of test cases specified by the user (`t`). The variables `n` and `m` will hold the last pair of integers entered by the user before the loop terminates. The variable `k` will be the absolute difference between `n` and `m` for the last iteration. Depending on the value of `k`, the output for the last iteration will either be `k` itself, `1`, or `0`. If `k` is a power of 2, it will be reduced to 0. If `k` is odd, it will remain 1. If `k` is even but not a power of 2, it will be processed through the while loop until it becomes 0, resulting in the output being 0.
