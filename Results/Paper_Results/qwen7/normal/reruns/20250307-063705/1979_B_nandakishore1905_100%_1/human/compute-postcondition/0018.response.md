Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the first integer entered by the user, `m` is the second integer entered by the user, `k` is 14, `l` is "1110", `p` is 3, `q` is 8, `f` is 2.**

Explanation: The value of `f` is updated to `f - q`, which means `f` is decreased by 8. Initially, `f` was 6, so after the operation, `f` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
