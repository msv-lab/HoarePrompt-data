Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the first integer entered by the user, `m` is the second integer entered by the user, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `i` is 2**.

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers entered by the user and assigns them to `n` and `m` respectively. It does not affect the values of `t` and `k`. Additionally, the value of `i` is incremented by 1, making it 2.
