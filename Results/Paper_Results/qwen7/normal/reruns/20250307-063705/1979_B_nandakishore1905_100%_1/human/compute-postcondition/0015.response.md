Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the first integer entered by the user, `m` is the second integer entered by the user, `k` is 14, `l` is "1110", `p` is 4, `q` is 8, `f` is 6, `l` is the binary string representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix.**

Explanation:
- Initially, `k` is given as 14, which is even.
- `l` is set to the binary representation of `f` using `bin(f)`. Since `f` is calculated as `k - q`, and `q` is \(2^{(p - 1)}\), we first need to find `q`.
- `p` is the length of `l`, which is the binary string representation of `k` (14). The binary representation of 14 is "1110", so `p` is 4.
- `q` is \(2^{(p - 1)} = 2^{(4 - 1)} = 2^3 = 8\).
- `f` is then calculated as `k - q = 14 - 8 = 6`.
- Finally, `l` is set to the binary representation of `f` (6) without the '0b' prefix, which is "110".

Thus, the updated values are as described in the Output State.
