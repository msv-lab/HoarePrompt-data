Output State: **`p` is the length of the binary string representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix, `q` is 2 ** (p - 1), `l` is a binary string representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix.**

Explanation: The code calculates `q` as `2 ** (p - 1)`. The value of `p` remains unchanged, and `q` is assigned the value of `2 ** (p - 1)`. The value of `l` also remains unchanged.
