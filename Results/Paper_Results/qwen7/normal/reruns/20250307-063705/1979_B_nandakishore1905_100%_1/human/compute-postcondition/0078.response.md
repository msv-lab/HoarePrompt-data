Output State: **`p` is the length of the binary representation of `f - 2` without the '0b' prefix, `q` is 2, and `l` is the binary representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix.**

Explanation: The code `l = bin(f).replace('0b', '')` converts the integer `f` to its binary representation using `bin(f)`, which includes the '0b' prefix. The `replace('0b', '')` method removes the '0b' prefix from the binary string. The value of `p` remains unchanged as it was defined before the code execution and represents the length of the binary representation of `f - 2` without the '0b' prefix. The value of `q` remains 2, and a new variable `l` is created with the binary representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix.
