Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the first integer entered by the user, `m` is the second integer entered by the user, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m` (and `k` is even), `l` is a binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`, `q` is \(2^{(p - 1)}\), `f` is `k - q`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `k - q` to `f`. Here, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, and `q` is \(2^{(p - 1)}\), where `p` is the length of the binary string representation of `k` (without the '0b' prefix). The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `l`, `p`, and `q` remain unchanged from their initial states.
