You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two distinct non-negative integers x and y . Consider two
infinite sequences a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots and b_1, b_2, b_3, \ldots , where

  * a_n = n \oplus x ; 
  * b_n = n \oplus y . 

Here, x \oplus y denotes the [bitwise
XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) operation of
integers x and y .

For example, with x = 6 , the first 8 elements of sequence a will look as
follows: [7, 4, 5, 2, 3, 0, 1, 14, \ldots] . Note that the indices of elements
start with 1 .

Your task is to find the length of the longest common subsegment^\dagger of
sequences a and b . In other words, find the maximum integer m such that a_i =
b_j, a_{i + 1} = b_{j + 1}, \ldots, a_{i + m - 1} = b_{j + m - 1} for some i,
j \ge 1 .

^\dagger A subsegment of sequence p is a sequence p_l,p_{l+1},\ldots,p_r ,
where 1 \le l \le r .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0 \le x, y \le
10^9, x \neq y ) — the parameters of the sequences.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the length of the longest common
subsegment.

Example

Input

    4
    
    0 1
    
    12 4
    
    57 37
    
    316560849 14570961

Output

    1
    8
    4
    33554432
    
Note

In the first test case, the first 7 elements of sequences a and b are as
follows:

a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,\ldots]

b = [0, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6,\ldots]

It can be shown that there isn't a positive integer k such that the sequence
[k, k + 1] occurs in b as a subsegment. So the answer is 1 .

In the third test case, the first 20 elements of sequences a and b are as
follows:

a = [56, 59, 58, 61, 60, 63, 62, 49, 48, 51, 50, 53, 52, 55, 54, \textbf{41,
40, 43, 42}, 45, \ldots]

b = [36, 39, 38, 33, 32, 35, 34, 45, 44, 47, 46, \textbf{41, 40, 43, 42}, 53,
52, 55, 54, 49, \ldots]

It can be shown that one of the longest common subsegments is the subsegment
[41, 40, 43, 42] with a length of 4 .

        if k & k - 1 == 0:

    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). For each test case, `n` and `m` are distinct non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq n, m \leq 10^9\), and `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.
    #
    #If `k` is a power of 2, it will be printed as is. If `k` is odd, it will also be printed as is. If `k` is even but not a power of 2, the loop will reduce `k` to 0 by subtracting the highest power of 2 less than `k` repeatedly until `k` becomes 0. In the end, the value of `k` printed will be 0.
    #
    #The variable `i` will be equal to the total number of iterations, which is `t`. The variables `l`, `p`, `q`, and `f` will be irrelevant to the final output since they are used during the reduction process and reset or become 0 after the loop completes.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two distinct non-negative integers \(n\) and \(m\). For each test case, it calculates the absolute difference \(k\) between \(n\) and \(m\). If \(k\) is a power of 2 or odd, it prints \(k\) directly. If \(k\) is even and not a power of 2, it repeatedly subtracts the highest power of 2 less than \(k\) until \(k\) becomes 0. Finally, it prints 0. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the length of the longest common subsegment of the sequences \(a\) and \(b\). The program instead attempts to calculate the greatest power of 2 that divides the absolute difference between \(x\) and \(y\), which is not relevant to the problem at hand.

To illustrate why this program is incorrect, consider the following test case:

- Input: `12 4`
- Expected Output: `8`

However, the program outputs `8` for this input, which is incorrect. The correct approach would involve iterating through the sequences and checking for the longest common subsegment directly. The program's logic does not align with the problem description, and it fails to handle the sequences as defined.

A correct implementation would involve generating the sequences and comparing them to find the longest common subsegment, rather than relying on the bitwise operations and absolute differences used in the provided code.
