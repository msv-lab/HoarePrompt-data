Output State: **`p` is the length of the binary representation of `f - 2` without the '0b' prefix; `q` is 2**.

Explanation: The value of `f` is decreased by `q`, which is `2`. The variable `p` is updated to be the length of the binary representation of the new value of `f` (which is `f - 2`) without the '0b' prefix. The value of `q` remains unchanged.
