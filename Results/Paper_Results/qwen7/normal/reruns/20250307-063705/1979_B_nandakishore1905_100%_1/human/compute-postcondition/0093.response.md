Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). For each test case, `n` and `m` are distinct non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq n, m \leq 10^9\), and `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.

If `k` is a power of 2, it will be printed as is. If `k` is odd, it will also be printed as is. If `k` is even but not a power of 2, the loop will reduce `k` to 0 by subtracting the highest power of 2 less than `k` repeatedly until `k` becomes 0. In the end, the value of `k` printed will be 0.

The variable `i` will be equal to the total number of iterations, which is `t`. The variables `l`, `p`, `q`, and `f` will be irrelevant to the final output since they are used during the reduction process and reset or become 0 after the loop completes.
