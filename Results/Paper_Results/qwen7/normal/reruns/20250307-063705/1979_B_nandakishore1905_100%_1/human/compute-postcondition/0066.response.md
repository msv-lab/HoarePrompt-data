Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an integer entered by the user.
- `m` is an integer entered by the user.
- `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.
- `i` is 3.

The code snippet `print(k)` will print the value of `k`, which is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.

Since the values of `n` and `m` are not explicitly given, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `k`. However, we know that `k` is calculated as the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.

Output: **k (where k is the absolute difference between n and m)**
