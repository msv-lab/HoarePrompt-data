Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the first integer entered by the user, `m` is the second integer entered by the user, `k` must have at least two bits set to 1, `i` is 2, `l` is a binary string representation of `k - 2^{(p - 1)}`, without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`, `q` is \(2^{(p - 1)}\), `f` is `k - q`, `l` is updated to the binary string representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of the new `l`.**

Explanation:
- The code calculates the length `p` of the binary string `l`.
- The value of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `i`, `l`, `q`, and `f` remain unchanged from their initial states.
- After executing `p = len(l)`, the value of `p` is updated to the length of the current `l`, which is the binary string representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix.
