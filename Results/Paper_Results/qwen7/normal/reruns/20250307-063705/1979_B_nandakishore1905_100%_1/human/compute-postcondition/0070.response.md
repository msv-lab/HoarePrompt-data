Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer entered by the user, `m` is an integer entered by the user, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `i` is 3, `l` is a binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`, `q` is \(2^{(p - 1)}\).**

Explanation: The code calculates the value of `q` as \(2^{(p - 1)}\), where `p` is the length of the binary string representation of `k`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
