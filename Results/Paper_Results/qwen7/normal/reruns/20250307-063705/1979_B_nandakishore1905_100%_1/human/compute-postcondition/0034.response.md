Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and the input value used to determine the number of iterations. In this case, the loop runs `int(input())` times.

2. **Determine the initial state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
   - `n` is the first integer entered by the user
   - `m` is the second integer entered by the user
   - `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`

3. **Conditions for the loop**: The loop runs `int(input())` times, where the input is the number of iterations for the loop.

4. **Adjusting the state**: For the loop to execute one more time, the loop counter `i` needs to be incremented by 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `k`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

5. **New state after the loop starts**: After the loop starts, `i` will be set to 1 (since it starts from 0 and is incremented by 1).

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the first integer entered by the user, `m` is the second integer entered by the user, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `i` is 1**
