Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the first integer entered by the user, `m` is the second integer entered by the user, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m` (and `k` is even), `l` is a binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`**.

Explanation: The code calculates the absolute difference `k` between `n` and `m`, which is given to be even. It then converts `k` into its binary string representation `l` and removes the '0b' prefix. The variable `p` is assigned the length of this binary string `l`. All other variables retain their initial or previously calculated states.
