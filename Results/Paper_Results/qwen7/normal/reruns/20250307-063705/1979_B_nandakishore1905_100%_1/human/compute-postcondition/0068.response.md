Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer entered by the user, `m` is an integer entered by the user, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `i` is 3, `l` is a binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix.**

Explanation: The code converts the integer `k` (which is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`) into its binary representation using the `bin()` function, which returns a string prefixed with '0b'. The `replace('0b', '')` method removes this prefix, leaving only the binary digits. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
