Output State: **`p` is the length of the string representation of the binary form of the integer value of `f` with '0b' prefix removed; `q` is 2 ** (`p` - 1)**.

Explanation: The variable `q` is assigned the value of \(2^{(p - 1)}\), where `p` is the length of the string representation of the binary form of the integer value of `f` without the '0b' prefix. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.
