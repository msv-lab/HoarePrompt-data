Output State: **`p` is the length of the binary string representation of `f - 2` without the '0b' prefix, `q` is 2**.

Explanation: The value of `f` is decreased by 2, which affects the calculation of `p`. The length `p` is now the length of the binary string representation of `f - 2` without the '0b' prefix. The value of `q` remains unchanged at 2.
