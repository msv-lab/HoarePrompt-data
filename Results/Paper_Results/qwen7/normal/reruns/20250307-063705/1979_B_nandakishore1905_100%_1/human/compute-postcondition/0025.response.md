Output State: **`p` is the length of the binary string representation of `f - 2` without the '0b' prefix; `l` is the binary string representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix.**

Explanation: The code converts the integer `f` to its binary representation using `bin(f)`, which returns a string prefixed with '0b'. The `replace('0b', '')` method removes the '0b' prefix from this string, assigning the resulting binary string to `l`. The value of `p` remains unchanged as it was defined as the length of the binary string representation of `f - 2` without the '0b' prefix.
