Output State: **`p` is the length of the binary string representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is a binary string representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix.**

Explanation: The code calculates the length of the binary string representation of `f` (without the '0b' prefix) and assigns it to `p`. The value of `l` remains unchanged as it was just used to get its length.
