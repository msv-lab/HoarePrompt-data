Output State: **`l` is a string representing the binary form of the integer value of `f-2`, without the '0b' prefix; `p` is the length of `l`; `q` is 2.**

Explanation: The value of `f` is decreased by 2, so now `f` is `f-2`. The string `l` and its length `p` are updated to represent the binary form of the new value of `f` without the '0b' prefix. The value of `q` remains unchanged.
