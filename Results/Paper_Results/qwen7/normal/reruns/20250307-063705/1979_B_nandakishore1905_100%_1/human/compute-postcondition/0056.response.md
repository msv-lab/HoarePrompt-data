Output State: **`p` is the length of the binary representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix, `q` is 2 ** (p - 1), `l` is the binary representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix, and `p` is equal to the length of `l`.**

Explanation: The value of `q` is updated to `2 ** (p - 1)`, which means `q` is now calculated based on the value of `p`. The other variables (`p`, `q`, `l`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
