Output State: **`p` is the length of the binary string representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix; `l` is the binary string representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix; `q` is 2 ** (p - 1)**.

This means that `q` is calculated as \(2^{(p - 1)}\), while `p` and `l` retain their original values from the initial state.
