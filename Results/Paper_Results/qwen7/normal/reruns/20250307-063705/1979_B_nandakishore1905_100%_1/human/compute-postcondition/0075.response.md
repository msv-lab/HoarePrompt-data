Output State: **`p` is the length of the binary representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix; `q` is 2 ** (`p` - 1)**.

Explanation: The variable `q` is assigned the value of \(2^{(p-1)}\), where `p` is the length of the binary representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix. The states of the other variables are not affected.
