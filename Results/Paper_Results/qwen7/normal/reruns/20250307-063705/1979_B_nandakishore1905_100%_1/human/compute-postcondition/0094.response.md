Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes a test case where t is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 10^4. For each test case, it takes two distinct non-negative integers x and y within the range of 0 to 10^9, and returns a value based on these inputs.**

Note: The actual processing logic and return value are not described here as per the given constraints and output format.
