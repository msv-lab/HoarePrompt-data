You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two distinct non-negative integers x and y . Consider two
infinite sequences a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots and b_1, b_2, b_3, \ldots , where

  * a_n = n \oplus x ; 
  * b_n = n \oplus y . 

Here, x \oplus y denotes the [bitwise
XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) operation of
integers x and y .

For example, with x = 6 , the first 8 elements of sequence a will look as
follows: [7, 4, 5, 2, 3, 0, 1, 14, \ldots] . Note that the indices of elements
start with 1 .

Your task is to find the length of the longest common subsegment^\dagger of
sequences a and b . In other words, find the maximum integer m such that a_i =
b_j, a_{i + 1} = b_{j + 1}, \ldots, a_{i + m - 1} = b_{j + m - 1} for some i,
j \ge 1 .

^\dagger A subsegment of sequence p is a sequence p_l,p_{l+1},\ldots,p_r ,
where 1 \le l \le r .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0 \le x, y \le
10^9, x \neq y ) — the parameters of the sequences.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the length of the longest common
subsegment.

Example

Input

    4
    
    0 1
    
    12 4
    
    57 37
    
    316560849 14570961

Output

    1
    8
    4
    33554432
    
Note

In the first test case, the first 7 elements of sequences a and b are as
follows:

a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,\ldots]

b = [0, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6,\ldots]

It can be shown that there isn't a positive integer k such that the sequence
[k, k + 1] occurs in b as a subsegment. So the answer is 1 .

In the third test case, the first 20 elements of sequences a and b are as
follows:

a = [56, 59, 58, 61, 60, 63, 62, 49, 48, 51, 50, 53, 52, 55, 54, \textbf{41,
40, 43, 42}, 45, \ldots]

b = [36, 39, 38, 33, 32, 35, 34, 45, 44, 47, 46, \textbf{41, 40, 43, 42}, 53,
52, 55, 54, 49, \ldots]

It can be shown that one of the longest common subsegments is the subsegment
[41, 40, 43, 42] with a length of 4 .

    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). For each test case, `n` and `m` are distinct non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq n, m \leq 10^9\), and `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.
    #
    #If `k` is a power of 2, it will be printed as is. If `k` is odd, it will also be printed as is. If `k` is even but not a power of 2, the loop will reduce `k` to 0 by subtracting the highest power of 2 less than `k` repeatedly until `k` becomes 0. In the end, the value of `k` printed will be 0.
    #
    #The variable `i` will be equal to the total number of iterations, which is `t`. The variables `l`, `p`, `q`, and `f` will be irrelevant to the final output since they are used during the reduction process and reset or become 0 after the loop completes.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two distinct non-negative integers \(n\) and \(m\). For each test case, it calculates the absolute difference \(k\) between \(n\) and \(m\). If \(k\) is a power of 2 or odd, it prints \(k\) directly. If \(k\) is even and not a power of 2, it repeatedly subtracts the highest power of 2 less than \(k\) until \(k\) becomes 0. Finally, it prints 0. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the length of the longest common subsegment between two sequences \(a_n = n \oplus x\) and \(b_n = n \oplus y\).
   - The key observation here is that the XOR operation has a periodicity property related to the binary representation of the difference between \(x\) and \(y\).

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The function `func()` takes an integer `t` as input, which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\) (which are actually \(x\) and \(y\)).
   - It calculates \(k = |n - m|\), which is the absolute difference between \(x\) and \(y\).
   - The code then checks several conditions to determine the length of the longest common subsegment:
     - If \(k\) is a power of 2 (i.e., \(k & (k - 1) == 0\)), it prints \(k\).
     - If \(k\) is odd, it prints 1.
     - Otherwise, it converts \(k\) to its binary representation and iteratively finds the highest power of 2 that divides \(k\).

3. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The logic in the code is based on the fact that the XOR operation between consecutive numbers will repeat every \(2^p\) steps if \(k\) is a power of 2.
   - The code correctly identifies when \(k\) is a power of 2 and prints \(k\).
   - When \(k\) is not a power of 2, the code correctly finds the highest power of 2 that divides \(k\) and prints this value.
   - The handling of odd \(k\) values (printing 1) is also correct because the XOR sequences will never have a common subsegment of length greater than 1 if \(k\) is odd.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles all edge cases appropriately:
     - If \(k\) is a power of 2, it correctly prints \(k\).
     - If \(k\) is odd, it correctly prints 1.
     - If \(k\) is neither a power of 2 nor odd, it correctly finds the highest power of 2 that divides \(k\).

### Conclusion:
The given code correctly implements the solution to the problem as described. Therefore, the program is correct.
