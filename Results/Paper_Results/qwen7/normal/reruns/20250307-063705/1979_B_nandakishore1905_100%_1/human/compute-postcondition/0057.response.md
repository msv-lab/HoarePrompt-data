Output State: **`p` is the length of the binary representation of `f - 2` without the '0b' prefix, `q` is 2**.

Explanation: The value of `f` is decreased by `q` (which is 2), so `f` becomes `f - 2`. The value of `p` is updated to be the length of the binary representation of the new value of `f` without the '0b' prefix. The value of `q` remains unchanged.
