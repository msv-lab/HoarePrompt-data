Output State: **`p` is the length of the string representation of the binary form of the integer value of `f` with '0b' prefix removed.**

This means that `p` is assigned the length of the string `l`, which is the binary representation of the integer `f` without the '0b' prefix. The initial state of `l` being a string representation of the binary form of `f` with '0b' removed remains unchanged, and now `p` holds the length of this string.
