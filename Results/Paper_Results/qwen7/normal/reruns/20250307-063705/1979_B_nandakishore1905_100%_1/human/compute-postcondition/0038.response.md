Output: **1**

Explanation: The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `i`. However, the `print(1)` statement itself does not depend on the values of these variables. It simply prints the integer 1. Therefore, regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `i`, the output will be **1**.
