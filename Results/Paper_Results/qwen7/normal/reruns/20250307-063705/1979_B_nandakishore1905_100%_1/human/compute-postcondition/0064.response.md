Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the first integer entered by the user, `m` is the second integer entered by the user, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `i` is 3, the values of `n` and `m` are updated to integers based on user input.**

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers from the user input and assigns them to `n` and `m`. It does not change the values of `t`, `k`, or `i`. The values of `n` and `m` are now specific integers based on user input, and `k` will be recalculated as the absolute difference between these new values of `n` and `m` if needed later in the program.
