Output State: `l` is an empty string, `p` is 0, `q` is 2.

Explanation: The loop continues to subtract \(2^{(p - 1)}\) from `f` until `f` becomes 1 or 0. After three iterations, `f` has been reduced to 2 (since each iteration subtracts 2, and 2 - 2 = 0, which breaks the condition `f & f - 1 != 0`). When `f` is 2, its binary representation is "10", so `p` is 2, and `q` is \(2^{(2 - 1)} = 2\). Subtracting `q` (which is 2) from `f` (which is 2) results in `f` becoming 0. At this point, `f & f - 1` equals `0 & -1`, which is 0, breaking the loop condition. Since `f` is now 0, its binary representation is an empty string (no bits set), so `p` is 0.
