Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is the first integer entered by the user.
- `m` is the second integer entered by the user.
- `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, and `k` is a power of 2.

The `print(k)` statement will print the value of `k`, which is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, and it is specified to be a power of 2.

Since the exact values of `n` and `m` are not provided, we know that `k` is a power of 2 but cannot determine the exact numerical value without knowing `n` and `m`.

Output: **k (where k is a power of 2 and is the absolute difference between n and m)**
