The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two distinct non-negative integers \(n\) and \(m\). For each test case, it calculates the absolute difference \(k\) between \(n\) and \(m\). If \(k\) is a power of 2 or odd, it prints \(k\) directly. If \(k\) is even and not a power of 2, it repeatedly subtracts the highest power of 2 less than \(k\) until \(k\) becomes 0. Finally, it prints 0. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.
