Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the first integer entered by the user, `m` is the second integer entered by the user, and `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. If `k` is a power of 2, no changes are made to `k`. If `k` is odd, `k` remains unchanged. If `k` is even, `k` becomes 2, `l` is "10", `p` is 2, `q` is 2, and `f` is 0.**
