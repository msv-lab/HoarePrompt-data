Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the first integer entered by the user, `m` is the second integer entered by the user, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `i` is 2, `l` is a binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix.**

Explanation: The code `l = bin(k).replace('0b', '')` converts the integer `k` (which is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`) into its binary representation and removes the '0b' prefix. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `i`, and `k` remain unchanged.
