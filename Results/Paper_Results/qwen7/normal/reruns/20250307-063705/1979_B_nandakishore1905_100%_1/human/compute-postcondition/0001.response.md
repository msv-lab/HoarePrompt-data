Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the first integer entered by the user, and `m` is the second integer entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code splits the input into two integers using `map(int, input().split())` and assigns them to `n` and `m`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
