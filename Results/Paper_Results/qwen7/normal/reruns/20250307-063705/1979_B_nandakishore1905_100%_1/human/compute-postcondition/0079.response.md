Output State: **`p` is the length of the binary representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix, `q` is 2, and `l` is the binary representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `p` to be the length of the binary representation of `f` (stored in `l`) without the '0b' prefix. The values of `q` and `l` remain unchanged. Therefore, `p` now represents the length of the binary representation of `f`, while `q` remains 2 and `l` remains the binary representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix.
