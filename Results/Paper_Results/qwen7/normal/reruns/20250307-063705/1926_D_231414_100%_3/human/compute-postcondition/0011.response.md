Output State: **`data` must contain at least one element; `s` is the bitwise XOR of `i` and `check`; `dic[i]` is decreased by 1.**

In this output state, the precondition that `data` must contain at least one element and `s` is the bitwise XOR of `i` and `check` remains unchanged. The only change is that the value of `dic[i]` is decreased by 1.
