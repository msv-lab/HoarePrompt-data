Output State: **`data` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `n` is an input integer, `dic` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is 0.**

The code simply initializes the variable `ans` to 0. This does not affect the values of `data` or `dic`. Therefore, the output state remains as described in the initial state with `ans` being set to 0.
