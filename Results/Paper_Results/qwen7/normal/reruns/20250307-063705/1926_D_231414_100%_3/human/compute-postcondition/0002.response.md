Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and the variable `times`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `times` is given as an input integer, and it is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq \text{times} \leq 10^4\).
   - `check` is initially set to 2147483647.

3. **Understand the condition for loop execution**: The loop will execute as long as `times` is greater than 0. Since `times` is a positive integer, it will always be greater than 0 when the loop starts.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**: We need to ensure that the loop can start executing, which means `times` should be greater than 0. The value of `check` does not affect the loop's execution, so it doesn't need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `times` being greater than 0.

**State:**
**`times` must be greater than 0**
