Output State: **`data` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `data = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input, splits it into individual strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer, and stores them in a list called `data`. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
