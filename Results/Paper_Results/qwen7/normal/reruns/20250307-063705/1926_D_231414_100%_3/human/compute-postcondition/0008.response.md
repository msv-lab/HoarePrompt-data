Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in data:`. The variables involved here are `i` and `data`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: In each iteration of the loop, `i` takes on the value of one element from the list `data`. Since the loop has not started yet, `i` is not assigned any specific value.

3. **Determine the Initial State of `data`**: The problem states that `data` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces. For the loop to execute, `data` must contain at least one element because the loop iterates over each element in the list.

4. **Adjust the States**: Based on the above points, we need to ensure that `data` contains at least one element. The initial values of `i`, `n`, `dic`, `ans`, and `check` do not affect whether the loop can execute, as they are not used in the loop head.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is that `data` must contain at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`data` must contain at least one element**
