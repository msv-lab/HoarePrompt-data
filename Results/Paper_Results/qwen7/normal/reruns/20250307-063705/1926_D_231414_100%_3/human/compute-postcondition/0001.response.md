Output State: **`times` is an input integer, and it is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `times` ≤ 10^4; `check` is 2147483647**

Explanation: The code sets `check` to the value of \(2^{31} - 1\), which is 2147483647. This does not affect the value of `times`. Therefore, the initial state of `times` remains unchanged, and `check` is now set to 2147483647.
