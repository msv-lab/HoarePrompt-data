Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50000, `n` is `n - (n + 1) // 2`, `k` is an input integer, `L` is a list containing three elements `[0, 0, (n + 1) // 2]`, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`.**

Explanation: 
- The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is within the range of 0 to 50000.
- The value of `n` is updated to `n - (n + 1) // 2`. This simplifies to `n - n // 2 - 1 // 2`, which further simplifies to `-1 // 2` or simply `-0.5` since `n // 2` is an integer division.
- The value of `k` remains unchanged as it is an input integer.
- The list `L` is updated by appending `m` to it. Since `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`, and `n` is now `-0.5`, `m` becomes `(-0.5 + 1) // 2` which is `0.5 // 2` or `0`. Therefore, `L` now contains `[0, 0, 0]`.
- The value of `m` is updated to `(n + 1) // 2`, which is `0` as calculated above.
