Output State: **`a` is 8, `L` is [8, 3, 1], `tot` is 23, `k` is 15, `pow` is 2, `m` is 1, `n` is 0**.

Explanation: The code `tot += a` increments the value of `tot` by the value of `a`. Initially, `tot` is 15 and `a` is 8. Therefore, `tot` becomes 15 + 8 = 23. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
