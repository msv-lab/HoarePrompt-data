Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50000, `n` is `n - (n + 1) // 2`, `k` is an input integer, `L` is a list containing two elements `[0, 0]`, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`.**

Explanation: The value of `n` is updated to `n - (n + 1) // 2`. Since `m` is defined as `(n + 1) // 2`, the new value of `n` simplifies to `n - m`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
