Output State: **`a` is 16, `L` is [7], `tot` is 5, `k` is 15, `pow` is 256, `m` is 7, `n` is 14**

Explanation: The code `L.append(m)` appends the value of `m` to the list `L`. Given that `m` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2` and `n` is 14, `m` evaluates to 7. After appending 7 to the list `L`, which was initially empty, `L` becomes `[7]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
