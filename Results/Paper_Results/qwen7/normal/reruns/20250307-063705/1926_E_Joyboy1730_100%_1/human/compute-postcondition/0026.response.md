Output State: **`L` must contain at least one element, `tot` is now `tot + a`, `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a`, `pow` is multiplied by 2.**

Explanation: The variable `pow` is multiplied by 2, making it `pow * 2`. The values of `L`, `tot`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial conditions. The updated value of `tot` is `tot + a`, and since `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a`, this condition still holds true.
