Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50000, `n` must be non-zero, `k` is an input integer, `L` is a list containing two elements `[0, 0]`, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`**.

This means that the value of `m` is now the integer division of `(n + 1)` by 2, while all other variables retain their initial conditions or constraints.
