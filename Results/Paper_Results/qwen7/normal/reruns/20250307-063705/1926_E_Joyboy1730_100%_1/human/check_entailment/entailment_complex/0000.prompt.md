Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Vladislav has n cards numbered 1, 2, \dots, n . He wants to lay them down in a
row as follows:

  * First, he lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest. 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 2 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 3 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 3 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 4 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 4 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * And so on, until all cards are laid down. 

What is the k -th card he lays down in this process? Once Vladislav puts a
card down, he cannot use that card again.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n
\leq 10^9 ) — the number of cards Vlad has, and the position of the card you
need to output.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the k -th card Vladislav lays
down.

Note

In the first seven test cases, n=7 . Vladislav lays down the cards as follows:

  * First — all the odd-numbered cards in the order 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . 
  * Next — all cards that are twice an odd number in the order 2 , 6 . 
  * Next, there are no remaining cards that are 3 times an odd number. (Vladislav has only one of each card.) 
  * Next — all cards that are 4 times an odd number, and there is only one such card: 4 . 
  * There are no more cards left, so Vladislav stops. 

Thus the order of cards is 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 2 , 6 , 4 .

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        L = []
        
        while n:
            m = (n + 1) // 2
            n -= m
            L.append(m)
        
        tot = 0
        
        pow = 1
        
        for a in L:
            if tot < k and k <= tot + a:
                print(pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1))
            tot += a
            pow *= 2
        
    #State: Output State: `a` is 1, `L` is [], `tot` is 31, `k` is 15, `pow` is 32, `m` is 1, `n` is 0.
    #
    #Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the list `L` will be empty because all elements have been processed. The variable `tot` will sum up all elements in `L` during the iterations, which results in 31 (1 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16). The variable `k` remains 15 as it did not change throughout the loop. The variable `pow` doubles with each iteration, starting from 1, and after 5 iterations, `pow` is 32. The variables `m` and `n` are not affected by the loop and remain unchanged at 1 and 0 respectively.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two positive integers \( n \) and \( k \), where \( 1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^9 \). For each test case, it calculates a value based on the sequence generated by repeatedly dividing \( n \) by 2 and appending the result to a list until \( n \) becomes 0. It then determines and prints a specific value derived from the list and the given \( k \). The function does not return any value but outputs the calculated value for each test case.
