Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 5â‹…10^4, `n` is `n - (n + 1) // 2`, `k` is an input integer, `L` is a list containing one element which is `(n + 1) // 2`, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` is updated to `n - (n + 1) // 2`. Since `(n + 1) // 2` is the integer division of `n + 1` by 2, `n` is effectively reduced by half (rounded down).
- `m` is assigned the value of `(n + 1) // 2`.
- `L` is an empty list before the code execution, and after executing `L.append(m)`, `L` contains one element, which is `m`.
- The initial conditions for `t` and `k` remain unchanged.
