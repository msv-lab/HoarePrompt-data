State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 5 â‹… 10^4**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop uses `range(t)` to determine the number of iterations.
2. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer because `range(t)` requires a non-negative integer as its argument.
3. Additionally, `t` is constrained by the condition \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\).
4. No other variables or states outside the loop head (like `_`) need adjustment since they are not used in the loop head and do not affect the loop's execution based on the given information.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t`, ensuring it meets the specified range for the loop to execute.
