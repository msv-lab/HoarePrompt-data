Output State: **`a` is 16, `L` is [7, 8, 3], `tot` is 5, `k` is 15, `pow` is 256, `m` is 3, `n` is 3**

Explanation: The code `L.append(m)` appends the value of `m`, which is 3, to the list `L`. Initially, `L` is `[7, 8]`. After appending 3, `L` becomes `[7, 8, 3]`. The values of the other variables (`a`, `tot`, `k`, `pow`, `m`, and `n`) remain unchanged.
