Output State: **`L` is [1], `n` is `n - (n + 1) // 2`, `k` is the second integer input, `tot` is 0, `pow` is 1, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `m` to the list `L`. Given that `m` is defined as `(n + 1) // 2`, `L` becomes `[1]`. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `tot`, `pow`, and `m`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
