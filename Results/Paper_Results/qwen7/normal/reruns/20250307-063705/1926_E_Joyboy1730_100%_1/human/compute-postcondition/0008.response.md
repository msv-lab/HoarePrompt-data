Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States:
- `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(5 \times 10^4\).
- `n` is updated to `n - (n + 1) // 2`.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `L` is a list containing one element which is `(n + 1) // 2`.
- `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`.

### Loop Condition:
The loop condition is `while n:`. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be non-zero.

### Current State After Previous Iteration:
- `n` is updated to `n - (n + 1) // 2`.
- For `n` to be non-zero in the next iteration, `n` must be greater than 0.

### Adjusting the State:
- The only variable in the loop head is `n`, so we need to ensure `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

### Final State:
- `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(5 \times 10^4\).
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `k` remains unchanged as it is an input integer.
- `L` is a list containing one element which is `(n + 1) // 2`.
- `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`.

### Answer:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50000, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `L` is a list containing one element which is `(n + 1) // 2`, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`**
