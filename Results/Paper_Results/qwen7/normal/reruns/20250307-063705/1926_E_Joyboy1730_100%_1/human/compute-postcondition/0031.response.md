Output State: **`L` must contain at least one element, `tot` is now `tot + a`, `k` must be less than or equal to `tot + a`, `pow` is now `pow * 2 * 2`**.

This means that the value of `pow` has been updated to its current value multiplied by 2 twice (or equivalently, multiplied by 4). The other variables (`L`, `tot`, and `k`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
