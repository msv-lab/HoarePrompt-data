You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n cards numbered 1, 2, \dots, n . He wants to lay them down in a
row as follows:

  * First, he lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest. 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 2 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 3 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 3 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 4 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 4 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * And so on, until all cards are laid down. 

What is the k -th card he lays down in this process? Once Vladislav puts a
card down, he cannot use that card again.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n
\leq 10^9 ) — the number of cards Vlad has, and the position of the card you
need to output.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the k -th card Vladislav lays
down.

Note

In the first seven test cases, n=7 . Vladislav lays down the cards as follows:

  * First — all the odd-numbered cards in the order 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . 
  * Next — all cards that are twice an odd number in the order 2 , 6 . 
  * Next, there are no remaining cards that are 3 times an odd number. (Vladislav has only one of each card.) 
  * Next — all cards that are 4 times an odd number, and there is only one such card: 4 . 
  * There are no more cards left, so Vladislav stops. 

Thus the order of cards is 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 2 , 6 , 4 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        L = []
        while n:
            m = (n + 1) // 2
            n -= m
            L.append(m)
        tot = 0
        pow = 1
        for a in L:
            if tot < k and k <= tot + a:
                print(pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1))
            tot += a
            pow *= 2



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two positive integers \( n \) and \( k \), where \( 1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^9 \). For each test case, it calculates a value based on the sequence generated by repeatedly dividing \( n \) by 2 and appending the result to a list until \( n \) becomes 0. It then determines and prints a specific value derived from the list and the given \( k \). The function does not return any value but outputs the calculated value for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to simulate the process of laying down cards according to specific rules and determine the k-th card laid down.
2. **Process Breakdown**:
   - First, we need to understand how many odd-numbered cards can be laid down initially.
   - Then, we need to count how many cards are multiples of 2, 3, 4, etc., where each multiple is derived from an odd number.
   - We continue this process until we have determined the k-th card.

3. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - It initializes an empty list `L` to store the counts of cards that can be laid down at each step.
   - The loop `while n:` calculates the number of odd-numbered cards that can be laid down (`m = (n + 1) // 2`) and updates `n` accordingly.
   - After determining the counts, it uses another loop to find the k-th card by checking the cumulative sum of counts stored in `L`.

4. **Key Points**:
   - The logic for counting and laying down cards seems correct.
   - The code handles the test cases and outputs the correct k-th card based on the described process.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the edge case where `n` might be small enough to fit within the constraints.
   - It correctly identifies when to stop adding to the list `L` and starts calculating the k-th card.

6. **Output Validation**:
   - The output matches the expected results provided in the example.

### Conclusion:
The given code correctly implements the logic to determine the k-th card laid down according to the specified rules. Therefore, the code is correct.
