The only variable in the loop head is `n`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is non-zero, the loop can execute.

Right before the loop, `n` is an input integer. For the loop to execute the first time, `n` must be non-zero.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `n` is non-zero.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 5 â‹… 10^4, `n` must be non-zero, `k` is an input integer, `L` is an empty list**
