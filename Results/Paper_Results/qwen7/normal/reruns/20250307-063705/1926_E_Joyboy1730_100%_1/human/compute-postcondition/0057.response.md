Output State: **`L` is [1, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16], `n` is 0, `k` is the second integer input, `tot` is 0, `pow` is 1.**

The code simply reassigns the value of `pow` to 1, which does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the values of `L`, `n`, `k`, `tot`, and `pow` remain unchanged from their initial states.
