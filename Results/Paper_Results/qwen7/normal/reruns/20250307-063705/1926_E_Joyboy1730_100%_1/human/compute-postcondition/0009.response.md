Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50000, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `L` is a list containing one element which is `(n + 1) // 2`, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`**.

Explanation: The code `m = (n + 1) // 2` assigns the value of `(n + 1) // 2` to the variable `m`. Since `n` is already defined, `m` is updated to reflect this calculation. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `L`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
