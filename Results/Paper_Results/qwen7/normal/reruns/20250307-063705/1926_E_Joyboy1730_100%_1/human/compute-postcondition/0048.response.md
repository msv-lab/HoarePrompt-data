Output State: **`L` is [1], `n` is `n - (n + 1) // 2 - ((n + 1) // 2)`, `k` is the second integer input, `tot` is 0, `pow` is 1, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`**.

Explanation: The code `n -= m` subtracts the value of `m` from `n`. Given that `m` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`, the new value of `n` becomes `n - (n + 1) // 2 - ((n + 1) // 2)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
