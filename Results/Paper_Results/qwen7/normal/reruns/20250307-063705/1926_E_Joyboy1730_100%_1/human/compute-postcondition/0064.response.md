Output State: **`a` is 1, `L` is [1, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16], `tot` is `tot` + 1 and `k` is less than or equal to the sum of `tot` and `a`.**

Explanation: The variable `tot` is incremented by the value of `a`, which is 1. Therefore, `tot` becomes `tot` + 1. The values of `a` and `L` remain unchanged. The condition for `k` remains the same, i.e., `k` is less than or equal to the sum of `tot` and `a`.
