Output State: **`L` must contain at least one element, `tot` is now `tot + a + next_a`, `k` must be less than or equal to `tot + next_a`, `pow` is now `pow * 4`, and if `tot < k` and `k <= tot + a`, then `k` remains unchanged; otherwise, the condition `tot < k` and `k <= tot + a` does not hold.**

Explanation: The code `tot += a` increments the value of `tot` by the value of `a`. Since `tot` was previously `tot + a + next_a`, after this operation, `tot` becomes `tot + a + next_a + a`, which simplifies to `tot + a + next_a`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged as per the initial postconditions.
