The loop condition is `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be non-zero (i.e., `n != 0`). At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is 14. Since 14 is non-zero, no adjustment is necessary for `n` to allow the loop to execute again.

No other states need to be adjusted because they are not part of the loop head condition.

State: **`a` is 16, `L` is [7], `tot` is 5, `k` is 15, `pow` is 256, `m` is 7, `n` is 14**
