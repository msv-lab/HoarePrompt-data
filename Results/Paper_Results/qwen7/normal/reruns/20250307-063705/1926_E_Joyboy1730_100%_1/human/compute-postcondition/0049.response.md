Output State: **`L` is [1, 1], `n` is `n - (n + 1) // 2 - ((n + 1) // 2)`, `k` is the second integer input, `tot` is 0, `pow` is 1, `m` is 1**

Explanation: 
- The list `L` originally contains the value `[1]`. After executing `L.append(m)`, `m` is appended to the list `L`, making `L` become `[1, 1]`.
- The value of `n` remains unchanged as the code does not modify it directly. It is defined as `n - (n + 1) // 2 - ((n + 1) // 2)`, which simplifies to `-1` for any integer `n`.
- The variable `k` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code.
- The variable `tot` remains `0` as it is not modified by the code.
- The variable `pow` remains `1` as it is not modified by the code.
- The variable `m` is set to `(n + 1) // 2`, which is `1` for any integer `n`.
