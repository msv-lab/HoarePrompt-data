Output State: **`a` is 3, `L` is [3, 1], `tot` is 26, `k` is 15, `pow` is 4, `m` is 1, `n` is 0**

Explanation: The code `tot += a` increments the value of `tot` by the value of `a`. Given that `a` is 3 and `tot` is initially 23, the new value of `tot` becomes 26. The values of the other variables (`L`, `k`, `pow`, `m`, and `n`) remain unchanged.
