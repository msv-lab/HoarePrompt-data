Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50000, `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `L` is a list containing two elements `[0, 0]`, `m` is 0**.

Explanation: 
- Initially, `n` is set to `n - (n + 1) // 2`. Given that `n` is an integer, `(n + 1) // 2` results in the integer division of `n + 1` by 2, which means `n` is being reduced by its half rounded down. Since `n` is initially `n - (n + 1) // 2`, it effectively becomes `0`.
- `L.append(m)` appends the value of `m` to the list `L`. Since `m` is `(n + 1) // 2` and `n` is now `0`, `(n + 1) // 2` equals `0`, so `L` becomes `[0]` and then `[0, 0]` after appending `0`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
