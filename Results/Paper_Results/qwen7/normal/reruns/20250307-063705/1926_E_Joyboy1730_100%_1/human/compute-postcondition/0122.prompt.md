You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        L = []
        
        while n:
            m = (n + 1) // 2
            n -= m
            L.append(m)
        
        tot = 0
        
        pow = 1
        
        for a in L:
            if tot < k and k <= tot + a:
                print(pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1))
            tot += a
            pow *= 2
        
    #State: Output State: `a` is 1, `L` is [], `tot` is 31, `k` is 15, `pow` is 32, `m` is 1, `n` is 0.
    #
    #Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the list `L` will be empty because all elements have been processed. The variable `tot` will sum up all elements in `L` during the iterations, which results in 31 (1 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16). The variable `k` remains 15 as it did not change throughout the loop. The variable `pow` doubles with each iteration, starting from 1, and after 5 iterations, `pow` is 32. The variables `m` and `n` are not affected by the loop and remain unchanged at 1 and 0 respectively.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it receives test cases through its constraints where t represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it takes two parameters n and k, both positive integers with 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and returns either "valid" if the condition is met or does not return anything if the condition is not met.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
