Reasoning:
1. The program correctly processes multiple test cases.
2. It calculates the necessary values to determine the \( k \)-th card in the sequence as described.
3. The logic for determining the sequence and the \( k \)-th card is sound:
   - It correctly identifies how many cards are placed at each step by calculating \( m = \frac{n+1}{2} \).
   - It subtracts these cards from \( n \) and appends \( m \) to the list \( L \).
   - It then iterates over the list \( L \) to find the correct segment that contains the \( k \)-th card.
   - The formula \( \text{pow} \times (2 \times (\text{k} - \text{tot}) - 1) \) correctly computes the \( k \)-th card based on the current power of 2 and the position within that segment.
4. The program handles the constraints and examples provided in the problem statement accurately.

Given the above points, the program appears to be correct based on the problem description and the execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
