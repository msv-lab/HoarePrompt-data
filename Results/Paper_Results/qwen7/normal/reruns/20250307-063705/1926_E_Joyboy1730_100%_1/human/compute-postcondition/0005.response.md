Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 5 â‹… 10^4, `n` must be non-zero, `k` is an input integer, `L` is an empty list, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`**

The value of `m` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`, where `n` is a non-zero integer. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
