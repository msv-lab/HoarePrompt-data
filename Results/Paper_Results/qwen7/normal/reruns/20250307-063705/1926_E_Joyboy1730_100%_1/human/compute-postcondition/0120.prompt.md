Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer, and it is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    L = []
    while n:
        m = (n + 1) // 2
        n -= m
        L.append(m)
    tot = 0
    pow = 1
    for a in L:
        if tot < k and k <= tot + a:
            print(pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1))
        tot += a
        pow *= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After all iterations of the loop, the list `L` must still contain at least one element, `tot` will be the sum of all elements in `L`, `k` must be less than or equal to `tot`, `pow` will be `2 raised to the power of the length of `L`, and if `tot < k` and `k <= tot + a` holds true for any element `a` in `L`, then `k` remains unchanged; otherwise, the condition `tot < k` and `k <= tot + a` does not hold for any element in `L`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `a` is 16, `L` is [1, 2, 4, 8], `tot` is 15, `k` is 15, `pow` is 16.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `a` will take the last value from the list `L`, which is 16. The list `L` will be reduced to [1, 2, 4, 8] as each element is removed upon iteration. The variable `tot` will sum up all elements in `L`, which is 1 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 32, but since the loop stops before processing the full list, `tot` will be 1 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 = 15. The variable `k` will be equal to `tot` because it meets the condition `tot < k and k <= tot + a` with `a` being the last element of the list, making `k` 15. The variable `pow` will be multiplied by 2 for each iteration, resulting in `2^5` or 32, but since the loop stops before the final multiplication, `pow` will be 16.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `a` is 1, `L` is [1], `tot` is 27, `k` is 15, `pow` is 16, `m` is 1, `n` is 0.

Explanation: The loop iterates over each element in the list `L`. After the first iteration, `a` becomes 7 and `tot` becomes 15. In the second iteration, `a` becomes 8 and `tot` becomes 23. In the third iteration, `a` becomes 3 and `tot` becomes 26. Finally, in the fourth iteration, `a` becomes 1 and `tot` becomes 27. The value of `k` remains 15 throughout the loop. The variable `pow` doubles with each iteration, starting from 1, so after 4 iterations, `pow` is 16. The other variables (`m` and `n`) are not affected by the loop and remain unchanged at 1 and 0 respectively.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
