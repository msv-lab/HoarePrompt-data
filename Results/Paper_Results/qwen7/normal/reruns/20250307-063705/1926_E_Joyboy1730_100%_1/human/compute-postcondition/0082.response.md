The only variable in the loop head is `n`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is non-zero (i.e., `n` is truthy), the loop can execute.

Right before the loop, `n` is an input integer. For the loop to execute the first time, `n` must be non-zero.

State: **`a` is 16, `L` is [], `tot` is 5, `k` is 15, `pow` is 256, `n` must be non-zero**
