Output State: **`L` must contain at least one element, `tot` is now `tot + a + next_a`, `k` must be less than or equal to `tot + next_a`, `pow` is now `pow * 8`, and if `tot < k` and `k <= tot + a`, then `k` remains unchanged; otherwise, the condition `tot < k` and `k <= tot + a` does not hold.**

Explanation: The code snippet `pow *= 2` doubles the value of `pow`. Initially, `pow` was set to `pow * 4`, so after this operation, `pow` becomes `pow * 8`. All other conditions and constraints remain the same.
