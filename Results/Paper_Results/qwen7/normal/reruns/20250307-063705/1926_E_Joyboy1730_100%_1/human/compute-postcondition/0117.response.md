Output State: `a` is 1, `L` is [1], `tot` is 27, `k` is 15, `pow` is 16, `m` is 1, `n` is 0.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `a` will be set to the last element of list `L`, which is 1. The list `L` will be reduced to just `[1]` as all other elements have been removed during the loop iterations. The total sum `tot` will be the sum of all elements in the original list plus the last element, which is 27. The variable `k` remains unchanged at 15. The variable `pow` doubles with each iteration of the loop, so after 4 iterations, it becomes 16. The variables `m` and `n` remain unchanged at 1 and 0 respectively.
