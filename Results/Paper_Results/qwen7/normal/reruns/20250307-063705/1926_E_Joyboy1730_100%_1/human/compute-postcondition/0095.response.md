Output State: `a` is 16, `L` is [7, 8, 3, 1], `tot` is 5, `k` is 15, `pow` is 256, `m` is 1, `n` is 0.

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `n` is non-zero. From the given information, we can see that the loop processes `n` until it becomes zero. After the first iteration, `n` is 14; after the second iteration, `n` is 6; and after the third iteration, `n` is 3. Following the pattern, the next value of `m` will be calculated as `(3 + 1) // 2 = 2`, but since `n` is now 3, `m` will be `3 - 2 = 1`. Therefore, `L` will append `1`, making `L` equal to `[7, 8, 3, 1]`. Since `n` is now 0, the loop terminates. All other variables (`a`, `tot`, `k`, `pow`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
