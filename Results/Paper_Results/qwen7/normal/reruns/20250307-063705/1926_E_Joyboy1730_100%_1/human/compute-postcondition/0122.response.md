Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two positive integers \( n \) and \( k \), where \( 1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^9 \). For each test case, it calculates a value based on the sequence generated by repeatedly dividing \( n \) by 2 and appending the result to a list until \( n \) becomes 0. It then determines and prints a specific value derived from the list and the given \( k \). The function does not return any value but outputs the calculated value for each test case.**
