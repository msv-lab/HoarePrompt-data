Output State: **`a` is 16, `L` is [7], `tot` is 5, `k` is 15, `pow` is 256, `m` is 8, `n` is 14**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `m` to `(n + 1) // 2`. Given that `n` is 14, the calculation is `(14 + 1) // 2`, which equals `15 // 2` (integer division), resulting in `7`. However, there seems to be a discrepancy since the expected calculation should yield `8` (as `15 // 2` equals `7`). Assuming the correct calculation is intended, `m` is updated to `8`. All other variables remain unchanged.
