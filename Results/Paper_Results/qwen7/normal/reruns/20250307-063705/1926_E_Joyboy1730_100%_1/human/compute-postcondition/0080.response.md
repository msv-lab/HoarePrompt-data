Output State: **`a` is 16, `L` is [], `tot` is 5, `k` is 15, `pow` is 256, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two inputs from the user, splits them by space, and converts them to integers. These values are then assigned to `n` and `k`. The values of `a`, `L`, `tot`, and `pow` remain unchanged. Since the actual input values are not provided, they are represented as "an input integer".
