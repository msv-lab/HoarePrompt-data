Output State: **`L` is [1, 1], `n` is 1, `k` is the second integer input, `tot` is 0, `pow` is 1, `m` is 2**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `m` to `(n + 1) // 2`. Given that `n` is 1, the calculation becomes `(1 + 1) // 2`, which results in 1 // 2, and since both operands are integers, the result is 1. However, integer division in Python 3 returns the floor value, so `m` becomes 1. But since the code uses `//` for integer division, the result is actually 1. Therefore, `m` is updated to 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
