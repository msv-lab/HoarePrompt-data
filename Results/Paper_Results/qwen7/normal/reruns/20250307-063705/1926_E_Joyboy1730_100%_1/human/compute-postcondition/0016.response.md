Output State: `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50000, `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `L` is a list containing up to 50000 elements where each element is 0, `m` is 0.

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `n` is non-zero. Each iteration reduces `n` by half (rounded down), and appends the value of `m` (which is also half of `n` rounded down) to the list `L`. Since `n` starts from a value between 1 and 50000 and is reduced by half each time, it will eventually reach 0 after a maximum of 16 iterations (since \(2^{16} = 65536 > 50000\)). After the loop finishes, `n` will be 0, and `L` will contain up to 16 zeros (depending on the initial value of `n`). The variable `t` remains unchanged and is still within the range of 0 to 50000, and `k` remains an input integer, unaffected by the loop.
