Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50000, `n` is now `n - (n + 1) // 2`, `k` is an input integer, `L` is a list containing one element which is `(n + 1) // 2`, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2**.

Explanation: The variable `n` is updated to `n - (n + 1) // 2`. Since `m` is defined as `(n + 1) // 2`, `n` is now reduced by `m`. All other variables remain unchanged.
