Output State: **`L` is an empty list, `n` is `n - (n + 1) // 2`, `k` is the second integer input, `tot` is 0, `pow` is 1, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`.**

Explanation: The value of `n` is updated by subtracting `m` from it. Since `m` is defined as `(n + 1) // 2`, the new value of `n` becomes `n - (n + 1) // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
