Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `L` contains at least one element.
   - `tot` is now `tot + a`, where `a` is the first element of `L`.
   - `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a`.
   - `pow` is multiplied by 2 (though the initial value of `pow` is not specified, it doesn't affect the calculation since it is only used in the formula).

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1))
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Calculation**:
   - Since `L` contains at least one element, let's denote the first element of `L` as `a`.
   - Therefore, `tot` becomes `tot + a`.
   - `k` is less than or equal to `tot + a`, so we know `k <= tot + a`.
   - `pow` is multiplied by 2, but since the initial value of `pow` is not specified, we'll keep it as `2 * pow`.

4. **Expression Breakdown**:
   - The expression inside the print statement is `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)`.
   - We need to evaluate `2 * (k - tot) - 1`:
     - Since `k <= tot + a`, we have `k - tot <= a`.
     - Therefore, `2 * (k - tot) - 1` will be `2 * (some value between 0 and a) - 1`.
   - Let's denote `k - tot` as `delta`, where `0 <= delta <= a`.
   - So, `2 * (k - tot) - 1 = 2 * delta - 1`.

5. **Final Expression**:
   - The expression simplifies to `pow * (2 * delta - 1)`.
   - Since `delta` is a value between 0 and `a`, `2 * delta - 1` will range from `-1` to `2*a - 1`.

6. **Output**:
   - Given the above, the exact value of `2 * delta - 1` depends on the specific value of `k` and `tot`, but it will be a value within the range `-1` to `2*a - 1`.
   - The final expression is `pow * (2 * delta - 1)`.

Since the exact values of `k`, `tot`, and `pow` are not specified, we can't determine a precise numerical value, but we can describe the form of the output.

Output: **pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1) (where k - tot is a value between 0 and a, and pow is the result of multiplying the initial value of pow by 2)**
