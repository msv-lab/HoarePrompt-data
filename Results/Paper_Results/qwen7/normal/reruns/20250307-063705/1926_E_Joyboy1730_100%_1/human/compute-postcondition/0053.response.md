Output State: **`L` is [1, 1, 2], `n` is -1, `k` is the second integer input, `tot` is 0, `pow` is 1, `m` is 2**

Explanation: The code `L.append(m)` appends the value of `m` (which is 2) to the list `L`. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `tot`, `pow`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, `L` changes from `[1, 1]` to `[1, 1, 2]`, while the other variables retain their original values.
