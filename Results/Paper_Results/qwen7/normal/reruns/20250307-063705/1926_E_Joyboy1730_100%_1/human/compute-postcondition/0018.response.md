Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50000, `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `L` is a list containing up to 33334 elements, all of which are 0, `m` is 0, `tot` is 0**.

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `tot` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `L`, or `m`. The initial state of these variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions plus the new initialization of `tot` to 0.
