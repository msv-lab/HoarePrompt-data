Output State: **`L` must contain at least one element, `tot` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `tot` plus the value of `a`, `tot` is now `tot + a`.**

Explanation: The code `tot += a` increments the value of `tot` by `a`. The conditions on `L`, `tot`, and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, `L` still must contain at least one element, `tot` is still less than `k` and `k` is still less than or equal to `tot + a`, but now `tot` is updated to `tot + a`.
