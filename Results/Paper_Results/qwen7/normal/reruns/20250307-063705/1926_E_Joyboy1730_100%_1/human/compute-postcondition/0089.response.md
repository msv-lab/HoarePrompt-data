Output State: **`a` is 16, `L` is [7, 8], `tot` is 5, `k` is 15, `pow` is 256, `m` is 8, `n` is 6**

Explanation: The code `L.append(m)` appends the value of `m` (which is 8) to the list `L`. Initially, `L` is `[7]`. After appending 8, `L` becomes `[7, 8]`. The values of the other variables (`a`, `tot`, `k`, `pow`, `m`, and `n`) remain unchanged.
