Output State: `L` is [1, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16], `n` is 0, `k` is the second integer input, `tot` is 0, `pow` is 1.

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `n` is non-zero. In each iteration, `m` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`, and `n` is updated by subtracting `m`. The value of `m` doubles with each iteration until `n` becomes zero. After 6 iterations, `n` becomes 0, and the loop terminates. The list `L` contains the sequence of values that `m` took in each iteration: [1, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16]. The variables `k`, `tot`, and `pow` remain unchanged because they are not affected by the loop's body.
