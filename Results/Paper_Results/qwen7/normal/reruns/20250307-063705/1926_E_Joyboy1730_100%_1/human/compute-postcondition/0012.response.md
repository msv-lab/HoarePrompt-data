Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `while n:`. This means the loop will continue as long as `n` is truthy (non-zero).

2. **Current State**: 
   - `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50000.
   - `n` is 0.
   - `k` is an input integer.
   - `L` is a list containing two elements `[0, 0]`.
   - `m` is 0.

3. **Determine What Needs to Change**: For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be non-zero. Since `n` is currently 0, we need to change it to a non-zero value.

4. **Adjust the State**: We only need to adjust the state of `n` to make it non-zero.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `n` is non-zero.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50000, `n` must be non-zero, `k` is an input integer, `L` is a list containing two elements `[0, 0]`, `m` is 0**
