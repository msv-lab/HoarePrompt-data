Output State: `a` is 1, `L` is [], `tot` is 31, `k` is 15, `pow` is 32.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the list `L` will be empty because all elements have been processed. The variable `tot` will be the sum of all elements in `L` during the iterations, which is 1 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 31. The variable `k` remains 15 as it did not change during the loop iterations. The variable `pow` doubles with each iteration, starting from 1, and after 5 iterations, `pow` will be \(2^5\) or 32. The variables `m` and `n` are not affected by the loop and remain unchanged at 1 and 0 respectively.
