Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it receives test cases through its constraints where t represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it takes two parameters n and k, both positive integers with 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and returns either "valid" if the condition is met or does not return anything if the condition is not met.**

This means the function processes multiple test cases defined by the variable `t`. For each test case, it checks if `k` is less than or equal to `n` and if `n` is less than or equal to 10^9. If both conditions are true, it returns "valid"; otherwise, it does not return anything for that specific test case.
