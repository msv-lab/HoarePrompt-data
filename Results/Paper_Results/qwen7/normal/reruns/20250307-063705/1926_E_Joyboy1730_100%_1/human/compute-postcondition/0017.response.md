Output State: `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50000, `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `L` is a list containing up to 33334 elements, all of which are 0, `m` is 0.

Explanation: The loop continues to run as long as `n` is non-zero. Each iteration reduces `n` by half (rounded down), and appends the value of `m` (which is also half of `n` rounded down) to the list `L`. Once `n` becomes 0, the loop terminates. Given the maximum initial value of `n` is \(5 \times 10^4\), it takes up to 15 iterations for `n` to become 0 (since \(2^{15} = 32768\) and \(2^{16} = 65536 > 50000\)). However, since the problem specifies the output after the first 3 iterations and the pattern, we can infer that after all iterations, `n` will be 0, and `L` will contain a series of zeros depending on how many iterations occurred. In this case, with the given constraints and the described behavior, `L` would contain up to 33334 zeros.
