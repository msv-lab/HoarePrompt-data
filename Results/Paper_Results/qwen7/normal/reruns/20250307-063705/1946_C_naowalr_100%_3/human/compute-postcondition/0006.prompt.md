Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, each set of input data consists of two integers n and k such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5, and each of the next n - 1 lines contains two integers v and u such that 1 ≤ v, u ≤ n representing an edge in the tree. Additionally, the sum of the values of n for all sets of input data does not exceed 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(sys.stdin.readline())):
    solve()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The function `solve()` has been called.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The function `solve()` has been called, and `num_iterations` is greater than 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The function `solve()` was called, but no specific changes to variables were made within the provided code snippet.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
