#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, each set of input data consists of two integers n and k such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5, and each of the next n - 1 lines contains two integers v and u such that 1 ≤ v, u ≤ n representing an edge in the tree. Additionally, the sum of the values of n for all sets of input data does not exceed 10^5.
def func_1():
    for _ in range(int(sys.stdin.readline())):
        solve()
        
    #State: Output State: The function `solve()` has been called for all the input data provided via standard input.
    #
    #Explanation: Given the loop structure and the information provided, the loop will continue to execute for as many times as there are lines of input (each line containing the necessary parameters to call the `solve()` function). Since the loop runs `_` times, where `_` is the integer read from the standard input, it implies that the function `solve()` will be called exactly that many times, once for each set of input data. No additional variables or states are modified within the loop based on the given information, so the only change is the number of times `solve()` is called, which is equal to the total number of input sets.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes input data consisting of an integer \( t \), followed by \( t \) sets of input data. Each set includes two integers \( n \) and \( k \), and \( n-1 \) lines of edges represented by pairs of integers \( v \) and \( u \). The function calls the `solve()` function for each set of input data. After processing all input sets, the function returns nothing (None).
