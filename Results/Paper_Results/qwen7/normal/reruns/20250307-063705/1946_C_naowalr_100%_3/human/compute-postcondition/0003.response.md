Output State: **The function `solve()` has been called, and `num_iterations` is greater than 0.**

The code `solve()` is called, which does not assign any new values to existing variables or create new ones. It simply calls the function. Therefore, the precondition remains the same, and `num_iterations` is still greater than 0.
