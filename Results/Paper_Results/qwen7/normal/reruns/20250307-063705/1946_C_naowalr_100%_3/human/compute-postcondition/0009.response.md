Functionality: **The function processes input data consisting of an integer \( t \), followed by \( t \) sets of input data. Each set includes two integers \( n \) and \( k \), and \( n-1 \) lines of edges represented by pairs of integers \( v \) and \( u \). The function calls the `solve()` function for each set of input data. After processing all input sets, the function returns nothing (None).**
