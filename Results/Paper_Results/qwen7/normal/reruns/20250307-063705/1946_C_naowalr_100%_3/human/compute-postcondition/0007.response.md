Output State: The function `solve()` has been called for all the input data provided via standard input.

Explanation: Given the loop structure and the information provided, the loop will continue to execute for as many times as there are lines of input (each line containing the necessary parameters to call the `solve()` function). Since the loop runs `_` times, where `_` is the integer read from the standard input, it implies that the function `solve()` will be called exactly that many times, once for each set of input data. No additional variables or states are modified within the loop based on the given information, so the only change is the number of times `solve()` is called, which is equal to the total number of input sets.
