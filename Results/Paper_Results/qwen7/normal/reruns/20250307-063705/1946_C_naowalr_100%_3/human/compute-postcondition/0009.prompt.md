You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, each set of input data consists of two integers n and k such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5, and each of the next n - 1 lines contains two integers v and u such that 1 ≤ v, u ≤ n representing an edge in the tree. Additionally, the sum of the values of n for all sets of input data does not exceed 10^5.
def func_1():
    for _ in range(int(sys.stdin.readline())):
        solve()
        
    #State: Output State: The function `solve()` has been called for all the input data provided via standard input.
    #
    #Explanation: Given the loop structure and the information provided, the loop will continue to execute for as many times as there are lines of input (each line containing the necessary parameters to call the `solve()` function). Since the loop runs `_` times, where `_` is the integer read from the standard input, it implies that the function `solve()` will be called exactly that many times, once for each set of input data. No additional variables or states are modified within the loop based on the given information, so the only change is the number of times `solve()` is called, which is equal to the total number of input sets.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input data consisting of an integer t, followed by t sets of input data. Each set includes two integers n and k, and n-1 lines of edges represented by pairs of integers v and u. The function returns nothing (None) but processes the input to analyze a tree structure defined by the edges and the values of n and k.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
