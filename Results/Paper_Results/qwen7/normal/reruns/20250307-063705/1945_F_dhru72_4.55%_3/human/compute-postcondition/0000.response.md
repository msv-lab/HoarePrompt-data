Output State: **`T` is a type variable, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `v` is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ v_i ≤ 10^9, and `p` is a permutation of numbers from 1 to n.**

The line `T = TypeVar('T')` defines a type variable `T` but does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the initial conditions for `t`, `n`, `v`, and `p` remain unchanged.
