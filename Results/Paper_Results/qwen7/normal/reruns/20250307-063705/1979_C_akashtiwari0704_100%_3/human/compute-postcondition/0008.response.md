Output State: **`g` is `l[0] * l[1] // gcd(l[0], l[1]) * l[3] // gcd(l[0] * l[1] // gcd(l[0], l[1]) * l[3], l[3])`, `t` must be greater than 0, `T` is 0, `i` is 3**.

Explanation: The initial value of `g` is `l[0] * l[1] // gcd(l[0], l[1])`. After executing the line `g = g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`, `g` is updated to its previous value multiplied by `l[i]` (which is `l[3]`) divided by the greatest common divisor of `g` and `l[3]`. The values of `t`, `T`, and `i` remain unchanged.
