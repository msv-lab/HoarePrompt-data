Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `i`. The loop iterates over the range of `len(l)`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `g` is updated as `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`.
   - `i` is set to `len(l) - 1`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `i` is within the range of `len(l)`. Since `i` is currently `len(l) - 1`, the loop will not execute again because `i` will no longer be in the range of `len(l)` (which is from `0` to `len(l) - 1`).

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: Since the loop will not execute again, we do not need to change the value of `i`. However, we should ensure that the state reflects the final values of the variables after the loop has completed.

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration (which is actually outside the loop since the loop will not execute again) remains the same as the state at the end of the previous iteration.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`g` is `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`, `i` is `len(l) - 1`**
