Output State: **`i` is 2; `ans` is equal to the string representation of `a[1]` followed by a space and then the string representation of `a[2]`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += str(a[i]) + ' '` appends the string representation of `a[i]` (where `i` is currently 1) to `ans`, followed by a space. Since `i` was initially 1, after executing the line of code, `i` is incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2. The updated `ans` now includes the string representation of `a[1]` followed by a space and then the string representation of `a[2]`.
