Output State: **`i` is 0; `ans` is equal to the string representation of `a[0]` followed by a space.**

Explanation: The code `ans += str(a[i]) + ' '` appends the string representation of `a[i]` (where `i` is 0) to the variable `ans` followed by a space. Since `i` is 0, `a[0]` is converted to its string form and concatenated with a space. The initial state of `i` remains unchanged, and `ans` now holds the concatenated string.
