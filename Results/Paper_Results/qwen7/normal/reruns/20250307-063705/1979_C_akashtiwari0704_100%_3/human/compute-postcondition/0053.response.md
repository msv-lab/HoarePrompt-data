Output State: **The program returns the product of all elements in list `l` after each element has been reduced by their greatest common divisor with `g`, and `i` is set to -1.**

This means that after processing all elements in the list `l` by continuously reducing them with their greatest common divisor (gcd) with `g`, the final value of `g` is returned. Additionally, `i` is set to `-1` after the loop completes its iterations.
