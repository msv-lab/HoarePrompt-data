Output State: **`g` is `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`, `i` is `len(l) - 1`**.

Explanation: The variable `g` is updated to the value of `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`, where `i` is set to `len(l) - 1`. The length of the list `l` remains unchanged, and the value of `i` is specifically `len(l) - 1`. The value of `g` is now the result of multiplying its original value by the element at index `i` of list `l`, and then performing integer division by the greatest common divisor of `g` and `l[i]`.
