Output State: **`i` is 1, `sumo` is increased by `a[0]`, `a[i]` is equal to `prod // a[i]`, `bets` must be greater than 0**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `a[i]` to be the integer division of `prod` by `a[i]`. Since `i` is initially 1, `a[i]` becomes `prod // a[0]`. The other variables (`sumo` and `bets`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
