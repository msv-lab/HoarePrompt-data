Output State: **`i` is 2, `sumo` is increased by `a[0]` + `int(a[i])`, `a[i]` is equal to `prod // a[i]`, `bets` must be greater than 0**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `a[i]` to `prod // a[i]`. Given that `i` is 2, `a[i]` is updated to `prod // a[2]`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
