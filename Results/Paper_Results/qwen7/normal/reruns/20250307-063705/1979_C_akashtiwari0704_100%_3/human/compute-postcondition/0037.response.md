Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `bets`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ans` is now `ans` + 'a[len_l - 1]' + str(a[len_l - 1]) + ' ';
   - `i` is `len_l - 2`;
   - `bets` must be greater than `len_l - 1`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 0 to `bets - 1`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `len_l - 2`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `len_l - 1`.
   - The value of `bets` must remain the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration because the loop condition does not change based on the loop variable `i`.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `ans` remains unchanged.
   - `i` is incremented to `len_l - 1`.
   - `bets` must still be greater than `len_l - 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`ans` is now `ans` + 'a[len_l - 1]' + str(a[len_l - 1]) + ' '; `i` is `len_l - 1`; `bets` must be greater than `len_l - 1`**
