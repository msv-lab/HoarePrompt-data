Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `bets` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, `t` must be greater than 0, `T` is 0, `i` is equal to the length of list `l`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of all integers in list `a`, `sumo` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(bets):
    a[i] = prod // a[i]
    sumo += int(a[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `bets` must be a positive integer, `i` is equal to the length of list `l` minus 1, `a[i]` is updated to `prod // a[i]`, and `sumo` is increased by the integer value of `a[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `bets` is a positive integer decremented by 1, `i` is equal to the length of list `l` minus 1, `sumo` is increased by the integer value of `a[i]`, and `sumo` is now the sum of its previous value and the integer value of `a[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `bets` is a positive integer decremented by 2, `i` is equal to the length of list `l` minus 1, `sumo` is the sum of its previous value and the integer value of `a[i]`, and `sumo` is incremented by the integer value of `a[i]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
