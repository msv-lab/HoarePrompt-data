Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the variable `i` and the range `range(len(l))`. Therefore, the only variables that can be adjusted are `i` and `len(l)`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `g` is updated to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`.
   - `i` is equal to `bets`.
   - `bets` must be greater than 0.
   - `len(l)` must be greater than or equal to 1.

3. **Determine the Next Values**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to `bets`. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become `bets + 1`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `len(l)` must be greater than or equal to 1. Since `len(l)` does not change within the loop, it remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `g` will be updated again based on the new value of `i` (which is `bets + 1`).
   - `i` will be `bets + 1`.
   - `bets` must still be greater than 0.
   - `len(l)` must still be greater than or equal to 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`g` is updated to `g * l[bets + 1] // gcd(g, l[bets + 1])`, `i` is `bets + 1`, `bets` must be greater than 0, `len(l)` must be greater than or equal to 1**
