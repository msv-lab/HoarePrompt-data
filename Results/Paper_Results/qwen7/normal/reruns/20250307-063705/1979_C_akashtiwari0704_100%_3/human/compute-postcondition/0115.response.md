Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `bets`. These are the only variables that can be adjusted according to the rules.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: The initial value of `i` is given as `bets - 1`.

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `bets`. Therefore, the initial value of `i` should be such that it satisfies this condition.

4. **Adjust the State**: Since `i` starts at `bets - 1`, it will decrement in each iteration until it reaches 0. For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be at least 0 initially. However, since `i` starts at `bets - 1`, it will always be non-negative as long as `bets` is a positive integer.

5. **Ensure the Loop Can Execute**: To ensure the loop can execute at least once, `i` should be set to 0 or a value less than `bets` but still within the valid range. Given that `i` starts at `bets - 1`, the loop will execute if `bets` is at least 1.

6. **Adjust Other States**: The other states (`sumo`, `a`, and `ans`) do not affect the loop's ability to execute and can remain as they are.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `bets` must be greater than 0**.
