Output State: **`bets` is the value entered by the user, `i` is -1, `g` remains unchanged, `l` is the length of the list entered by the user, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `len_l` remains unchanged, `prod` remains unchanged, `T` remains unchanged, and `ans` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of input split by spaces and converts each element to an integer, storing the result in the list `a`. The values of `bets`, `i`, `g`, `len_l`, `prod`, `T`, and `ans` are not affected by this operation. The variable `l` is set to the length of the list `a`, which is the number of elements entered by the user.
