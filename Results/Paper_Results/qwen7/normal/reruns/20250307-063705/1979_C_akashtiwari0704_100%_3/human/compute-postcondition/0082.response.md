Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is set to `bets`.
- `bets` must be greater than 0.
- `sumo` is the sum of the integer division of `prod` by each element in the list `a`.
- `ans` is the concatenation of the string representations of all elements in the list `a` separated by spaces.

The `print(ans)` statement will print the concatenated string of all elements in the list `a` separated by spaces.

Output: **"a[0] a[1] a[2] ... a[bets-1]" (where "a[0] a[1] a[2] ... a[bets-1]" represents the space-separated string of all elements in the list `a`)**
