Output State: `ans` is now `ans` + 'a[len_l - 1]' + str(a[len_l - 1]) + ' ' * (bets - 1); `i` is `-1`; `bets` must be equal to `len_l - 1`.

In natural language: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `ans` will contain a string that starts with 'a[len_l - 1]' followed by `len_l - 1` repetitions of `str(a[len_l - 1]) + ' '`. The value of `i` will be `-1` because it is decremented by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `-1`. The variable `bets` will be equal to `len_l - 1`, as it is used as the upper limit for the loop and is reduced by the total number of iterations.
