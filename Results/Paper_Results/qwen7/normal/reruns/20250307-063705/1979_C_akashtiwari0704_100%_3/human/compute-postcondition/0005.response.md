Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is defined by the `for i in range(len(l)):` statement. The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `len(l)`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `g` is `l[0]`
   - `t` must be greater than 0
   - `T` is 0
   - `i` is 0

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(l)`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 1.
   - The length of the list `l` remains unchanged, so `len(l)` is still the same.

5. **Update the other variables**:
   - `g` is still `l[0]` because it does not depend on `i`.
   - `t` must remain greater than 0 because it is not affected by the loop.
   - `T` remains 0 because it is not updated within the loop body.

Based on these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`g` is `l[0]`, `t` must be greater than 0, `T` is 0, `i` is 1**
