Output State: **`ans` is now `ans` + 'a[len_l - 1]' + str(a[len_l - 1]) + ' ' + str(a[i]) + ' '; `i` is `i - 1`; `bets` must be greater than `len_l - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += str(a[i]) + ' '` appends the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space to `ans`. Initially, `i` is set to `len_l - 1`, so `a[i]` refers to `a[len_l - 1]`. After appending, `i` is decremented by 1 (i.e., `i -= 1`). The condition that `bets` must be greater than `len_l - 1` remains unchanged.
