Output State: **`i` is 0; `sumo` is increased by `a[0]`; `bets` must be greater than 0**

Explanation: The code `sumo += int(a[i])` increments `sumo` by the integer value of `a[i]`. Given that `i` is initially 0, `a[0]` is added to `sumo`. The other variables (`i` and `bets`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
