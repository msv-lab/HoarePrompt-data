Output State: `ans` is now `ans` + 'a[len_l - 1]' + str(a[len_l - 1]) + ' ' * (bets - len_l + 1); `i` is `-1`; `bets` must be equal to or greater than `len_l - 1`.

In this final output state, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the string `ans` will contain the concatenation of the string representations of elements from the list `a` starting from the last element (`a[len_l - 1]`) up to `bets` times. The variable `i` will be set to `-1` because it starts from `len_l - 2` and decreases by 1 with each iteration until it reaches `-1`. The condition `bets` must be greater than or equal to `len_l - 1` ensures that the loop runs for the required number of times to include all necessary elements in `ans`.
