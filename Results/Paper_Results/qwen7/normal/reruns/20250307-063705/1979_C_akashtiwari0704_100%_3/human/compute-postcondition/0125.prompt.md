Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive)
Code of the loop:
for T in range(t):

    def lcm(l):
        g = 1
        for i in range(len(l)):
            g = g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])
        return g
    bets = int(input())
    a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    prod = lcm(a)
    sumo = 0
    for i in range(bets):
        a[i] = prod // a[i]
        sumo += int(a[i])
    if sumo >= prod:
        print(-1)
    else:
        ans = ''
        for i in range(bets):
            ans += str(a[i]) + ' '
        print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `bets` is a positive integer reduced by the total number of iterations, `i` is one less than the length of list `l`, and `sumo` is the total sum of the integer values of `a[i]` after being updated in each iteration of the loop. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, then `bets` remains unchanged, `i` is one less than the length of list `l`, and `sumo` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `ans` will contain the concatenation of the string representations of elements from the list `a` starting from the last element (`a[len_l - 1]`) up to `bets` times, `i` will be set to `-1`, and `bets` will be equal to or greater than `len_l - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is equal to `bets`, `bets` must be greater than 0, `sumo` is the sum of the integer division of `prod` by each element in the list `a`, and `ans` is the concatenation of the string representations of all elements in the list `a` separated by spaces.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After executing the if-else block, `i` is equal to 4, `sumo` is the sum of `prod // a[i]` for all `i` from 0 to 3, all elements in the list `a` are updated to `prod // a[i]` for their respective indices, and `ans` is a string containing the string representations of the updated values of `a[1]` through `a[3]`, each followed by a space.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
