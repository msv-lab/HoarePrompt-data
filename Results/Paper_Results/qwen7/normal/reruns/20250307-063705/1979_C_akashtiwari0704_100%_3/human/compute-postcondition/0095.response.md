Functionality: **The function accepts a list `l`. It returns the product of all elements in the list `l` after dividing each element by its greatest common divisor (GCD) with `g`. The length of the list `l` is stored in the variable `i`. The variables `bets`, `sumo`, `ans`, `T`, and `T_prev` remain unchanged.**
