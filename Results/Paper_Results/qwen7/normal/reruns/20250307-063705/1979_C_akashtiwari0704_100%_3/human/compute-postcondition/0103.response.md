Output State: **`i` is 0; `sumo` is increased by `int(a[0])`; `a[0]` is equal to `prod` // `a[0]`; `bets` must be a positive integer**

Explanation: The code `sumo += int(a[i])` increments `sumo` by the integer value of `a[i]`. Given that `i` is initially 0, `sumo` is increased by `int(a[0])`. The values of `a[0]` and `bets` remain unchanged, and `i` remains 0.
