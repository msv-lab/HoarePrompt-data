Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the initial state at the end of the previous iteration:**
   - `ans` is `ans` + 'a[len_l - 1]': This means that `ans` has been updated by appending `'a[len_l - 1]'` to it.
   - `i` is `len_l - 2`: This indicates the current value of `i`.

2. **Understand the loop structure:**
   - The loop is defined as `for i in range(bets):`. This means `i` will take values from `0` to `bets-1`.

3. **Determine the new state at the start of the next iteration:**
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time it iterates, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `len_l - 1`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `bets`.

Given these points, let's adjust the states accordingly:

- The variable `ans` remains unchanged because the loop body is omitted and no further operations on `ans` are specified.
- The variable `i` will be incremented by 1, so at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `len_l - 1`.
- For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `bets`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`ans` is `ans` + 'a[len_l - 1]', `i` is `len_l - 1`, `bets` must be greater than `len_l - 1`**
