Output State: **`g` is `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`, `i` is `len(l) - 1`**

Explanation: The code reassigns the value of `g` to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`. Given the initial state where `g` is `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])` and `i` is `len(l) - 1`, after executing the code, `g` will be updated to its own current value multiplied by `l[i]` and then divided by the greatest common divisor of `g` and `l[i]`. The value of `i` remains unchanged as the code does not modify it.
