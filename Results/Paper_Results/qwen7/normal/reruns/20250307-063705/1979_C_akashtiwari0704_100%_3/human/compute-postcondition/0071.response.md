Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `bets - 1`
- `sumo` is the sum of the integer division of `prod` by each element in the list `a`
- `bets` must be greater than 0
- The current value of `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`

The code snippet to execute is:
```python
print(-1)
```

This `print` statement simply outputs the integer `-1`. The values of `i`, `sumo`, `prod`, and `a` are not relevant to this particular print statement, as it does not reference any of these variables.

Output: **-1**
