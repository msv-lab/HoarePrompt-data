Output State: **`bets` is the integer value of the user's input and is greater than 0, `sumo`, `ans`, `T`, `T_prev`, `g`, `i`, and the list `l` remain unchanged, `a` is a list of integers obtained from user input split by spaces and converted to integers**.

Explanation: The code `a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]` takes a line of space-separated integers as input from the user, converts each integer to an int, and stores them in a list `a`. The other variables (`bets`, `sumo`, `ans`, `T`, `T_prev`, `g`, `i`, and the list `l`) remain unchanged as per the initial state.
