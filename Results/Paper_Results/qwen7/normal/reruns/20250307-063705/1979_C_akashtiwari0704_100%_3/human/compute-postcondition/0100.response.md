Output State: **`sumo` is 0, `bets` is the integer value of the user's input and is greater than 0, `sumo`, `ans`, `T`, `T_prev`, `g`, `i`, and the list `l` remain unchanged, `a` is a list of integers obtained from user input split by spaces and converted to integers, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of all integers in the list `a`.**

In this case, the code simply initializes `sumo` to 0. All other variables retain their initial states as described in the initial state.
