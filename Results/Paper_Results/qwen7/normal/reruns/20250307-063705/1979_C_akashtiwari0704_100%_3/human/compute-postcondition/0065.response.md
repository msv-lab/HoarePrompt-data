Output State: **`i` is 1, `sumo` is increased by `a[0]` + `int(a[i])`, `a[i]` is equal to `prod // a[i]`, `bets` must be greater than 0**

Explanation: The code `sumo += int(a[i])` increments `sumo` by the value of `int(a[i])`. Given that `i` is initially 1, `a[i]` refers to `a[1]`. Therefore, `sumo` is increased by the integer value of `a[1]`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
