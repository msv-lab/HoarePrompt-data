Output State: `bets` is a positive integer decremented by the total number of iterations, `i` is equal to the length of list `l` minus 1, and `sumo` is the cumulative sum of the integer values of `a[i]` after each iteration of the loop.

In simpler terms, after all the iterations of the loop have finished, `bets` will be a positive integer reduced by the total number of iterations, `i` will be one less than the length of list `l`, and `sumo` will be the total sum of the integer values of `a[i]` after being updated in each iteration of the loop.
