Output State: **`bets` is the value entered by the user, `i` is -1, `g` remains unchanged, `l` is the length of the list entered by the user, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `len_l` remains unchanged, `prod` is the least common multiple of all integers in the list `a`, `T` remains unchanged, and `ans` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of all integers in the list `a` and assigns it to the variable `prod`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
