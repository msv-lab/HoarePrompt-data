Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `bets`.
2. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**: The loop will continue if `i` is less than `bets`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `sumo` is increased by `a[0]` + `int(a[i])`
   - `a[i]` is equal to `prod // a[i]`
   - `bets` must be greater than 0

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `bets` must still be greater than 0 (since `i` is now 2 and needs to be less than `bets`).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 2, `sumo` is increased by `a[0]` + `int(a[i])`, `a[i]` is equal to `prod // a[i]`, `bets` must be greater than 0**
