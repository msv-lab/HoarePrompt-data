Output State: **`bets` is a positive integer decremented by 1, `i` is equal to the length of list `l` minus 1, `sumo` is increased by the integer value of `a[i]`, and `sumo` is now the sum of its previous value and the integer value of `a[i]`.**

Explanation: The code increments `sumo` by the integer value of `a[i]`. Since `a[i]` was previously updated to `prod // a[i]`, the new value of `sumo` is the sum of its previous value and the integer division of `prod` by `a[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
