Output State: **`i` is 2, `sumo` is increased by `int(a[i])` + `int(a[i])`, `a[i]` is equal to `prod // a[i]`, `bets` must be greater than 0**

Explanation: The code snippet `sumo += int(a[i])` increments `sumo` by the value of `int(a[i])`. Given that `a[i]` is equal to `prod // a[i]` from the initial state, and `i` is 2, the value of `a[i]` remains unchanged. Therefore, `sumo` is increased by `int(a[i])` twice, which means `sumo` is increased by `2 * int(a[i])`. The other variables remain in their initial conditions.
