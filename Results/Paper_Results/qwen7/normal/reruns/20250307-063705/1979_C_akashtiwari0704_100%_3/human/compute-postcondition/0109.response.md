Output State: **`i` is 2; `sumo` is increased by `a[2]`; `a[2]` is equal to `prod // a[2]`; `bets` must be greater than 1**

Explanation: The code `sumo += int(a[i])` updates the value of `sumo` by adding the integer value of `a[i]` to it. Given that `i` is 2, `sumo` is increased by `a[2]`. Additionally, `a[2]` is updated to be equal to `prod // a[2]`. The other variables (`bets`) remain unchanged and must still be greater than 1.
