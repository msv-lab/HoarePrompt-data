State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and `T` is 0** 

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variable `T` which is initialized in the `range(t)` function.
2. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer because `range(t)` will generate a sequence from 0 to `t-1`.
3. At the start of the loop, `T` will be set to 0 as it is the first iteration of the loop.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `t` must be greater than 0 and `T` is initialized to 0.
