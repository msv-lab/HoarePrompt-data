Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `l`, which is a list of integers. It calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of all elements in the list `l` by first finding their greatest common divisor (GCD) and then dividing the product of all elements in the list by this GCD. The function returns the calculated LCM.**
