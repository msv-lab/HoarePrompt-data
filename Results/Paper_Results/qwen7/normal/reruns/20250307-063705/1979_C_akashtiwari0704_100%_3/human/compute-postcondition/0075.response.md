Output State: **`i` is `bets - 1`, `bets` must be greater than 0, `sumo` is the sum of the integer division of `prod` by each element in the list `a`, `ans` is `a[i]` followed by a space.**

Explanation: The code appends the string representation of `a[i]` (where `i` is `bets - 1`) followed by a space to the string `ans`. Since `i` is `bets - 1`, the value of `ans` becomes the value of `a[bets - 1]` converted to a string and concatenated with a space. The values of `bets`, `sumo`, and `prod` remain unchanged.
