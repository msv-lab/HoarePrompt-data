Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `bets`.

2. **Understand the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `bets` is a positive integer decremented by 1.
   - `i` is equal to the length of list `l` minus 1.
   - `sumo` is increased by the integer value of `a[i]`, and it is now the sum of its previous value and the integer value of `a[i]`.

3. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `bets`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `bets` is a positive integer decremented by 1, it means `bets` was originally a positive integer and was decremented once.
   - `i` is the length of list `l` minus 1, and for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `bets`.
   - `sumo` is not directly involved in the loop condition but is updated within the loop.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `bets` will be decremented by 1 again, making it a positive integer decremented by 2.
   - `i` must be less than this new value of `bets`.
   - `sumo` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop condition.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`bets` is a positive integer decremented by 2, `i` is equal to the length of list `l` minus 1, and `sumo` is increased by the integer value of `a[i]`, and `sumo` is now the sum of its previous value and the integer value of `a[i]`**.
