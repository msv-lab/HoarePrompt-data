Output State: **`g` is `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`, `i` is `len(l) - 1`**

Explanation: The code reassigns the value of `g` by multiplying it with `l[i]` and then performing integer division by the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `g` and `l[i]`. Since `i` was initially set to `len(l) - 1`, it remains unchanged. Therefore, `g` is updated according to the given formula, and `i` stays as `len(l) - 1`.
