Functionality: **The function `lcm` accepts a list `l` and returns the product of all elements in the list after dividing each element by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of that element with a variable `g`. After processing all elements, the variable `i` is set to the length of the list `l`. The function ensures that variables `bets`, `sumo`, `ans`, `T`, and `T_prev` remain unchanged.**
