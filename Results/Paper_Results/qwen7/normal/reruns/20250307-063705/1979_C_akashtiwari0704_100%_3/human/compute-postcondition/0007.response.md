Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the list `l`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `g` is `l[0] * l[1] // gcd(l[0], l[1])`
   - `t` must be greater than 0
   - `T` is 0
   - `i` is 2

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over the range of the length of the list `l`. Therefore, the loop will continue as long as `i < len(l)`.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, for the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it `i = 3`.
   - The value of `g` remains unchanged because it is computed based on the values of `l[0]` and `l[1]` and does not depend on `i`.
   - `t` must still be greater than 0.
   - `T` remains 0 because there is no indication that it changes within the loop.
   - `len(l)` remains the same, but since `i` is now 3, the loop will check if `3 < len(l)` to decide if it should continue.

5. **Construct the new state**:
   - `g` remains `l[0] * l[1] // gcd(l[0], l[1])`
   - `t` must still be greater than 0
   - `T` remains 0
   - `i` is now 3

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`g` is `l[0] * l[1] // gcd(l[0], l[1])`, `t` must be greater than 0, `T` is 0, `i` is 3**
