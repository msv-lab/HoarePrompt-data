Output State: **`i` is `bets + 1`, `bets` must be greater than 0, `sumo` is the sum of the integer division of `prod` by each element in the list `a`, `ans` is `a[bets]` followed by ' ' and `a[i]` plus the string representation of `a[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += str(a[i]) + ' '` appends the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space to the variable `ans`. Given the initial state, `i` is `bets + 1`, and `ans` initially contains `a[bets]` followed by a space and `a[i]`. After executing the code, `ans` will now contain `a[bets]` followed by a space, then `a[i]`, and finally the string representation of `a[i]` concatenated together. All other variables remain unchanged.
