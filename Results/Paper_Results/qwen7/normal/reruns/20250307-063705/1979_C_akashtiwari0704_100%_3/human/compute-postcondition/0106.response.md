Output State: **`i` is 1; `bets` must be greater than 1; `sumo` is `sumo` + `a[i]`; `a[i]` is equal to `prod // a[i]`**

Explanation: The code `sumo += int(a[i])` increments the value of `sumo` by the integer value of `a[i]`. Since `a[i]` is initially equal to `prod // a[i]`, the value of `a[i]` remains unchanged. The other variables (`i` and `bets`) are not affected by this operation.
