Postcondition: **After executing the if-else block, `i` is equal to 4, `sumo` is the sum of `prod // a[i]` for all `i` from 0 to 3, all elements in the list `a` are updated to `prod // a[i]` for their respective indices, and `ans` is a string containing the string representations of the updated values of `a[1]` through `a[3]`, each followed by a space.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the if-else block executes, considering both the if and else parts.
