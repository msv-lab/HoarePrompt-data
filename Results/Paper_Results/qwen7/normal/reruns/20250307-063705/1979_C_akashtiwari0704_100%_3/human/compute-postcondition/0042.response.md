Postcondition: **`bets` is a positive integer reduced by the total number of iterations, `i` is one less than the length of list `l`, and `sumo` is the total sum of the integer values of `a[i]` after being updated in each iteration of the loop. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, then `bets` remains unchanged, `i` is one less than the length of list `l`, and `sumo` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `ans` will contain the concatenation of the string representations of elements from the list `a` starting from the last element (`a[len_l - 1]`) up to `bets` times, `i` will be set to `-1`, and `bets` will be equal to or greater than `len_l - 1`.**
