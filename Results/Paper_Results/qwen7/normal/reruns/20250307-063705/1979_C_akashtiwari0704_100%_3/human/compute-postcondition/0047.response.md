Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `len(l)`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the start of the loop**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `len(l) - 1`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for each `i` in the range from `0` to `len(l) - 1`. This means that if `i` is `len(l) - 1` at the end of the previous iteration, the loop will stop executing because there are no more values of `i` left in the range.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: Since the loop will not execute again (because `i` is already `len(l) - 1`), we do not need to change `i`. However, we need to ensure that the state reflects that the loop will not run again.

5. **State adjustment**: The only variable that needs to be adjusted is `i`, but since the loop will not run again, `i` remains `len(l) - 1`.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration (which won't happen) would be:

**State: **`g` is `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`, `i` is `len(l) - 1`**
