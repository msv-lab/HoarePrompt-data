Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(len(l))`.
   - The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `len(l)`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of These Variables:**
   - From the given state before the loop, we know that `i` is equal to `bets`.
   - We also know that `bets` must be greater than 0.
   - The variable `len(l)` is derived from the length of the list `l`.

3. **Ensure the Loop Can Execute:**
   - For the loop to execute, `len(l)` must be at least 1 because `range(len(l))` will generate a sequence starting from 0 up to `len(l) - 1`.
   - Therefore, `len(l)` must be greater than or equal to 1.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since `i` is already set to `bets`, we don't need to change it.
   - We need to ensure that `len(l)` is at least 1.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `bets` (which is `i`), and `len(l)`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is equal to `bets`, `bets` must be greater than 0, `len(l)` must be greater than or equal to 1**
