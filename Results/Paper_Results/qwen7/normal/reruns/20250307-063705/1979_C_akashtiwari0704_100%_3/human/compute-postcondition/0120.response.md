Output State: **`i` is 3; `ans` is equal to the string representation of `a[1]` followed by a space and then the string representation of `a[2]` plus the string representation of `a[3]` and a space.**

Explanation: The code `ans += str(a[i]) + ' '` appends the string representation of `a[i]` (where `i` is 3) to `ans`, followed by a space. Since `i` is 3, it appends `a[3]` to `ans`. The initial state of `ans` was the string representation of `a[1]` followed by a space and then the string representation of `a[2]`. Therefore, after executing the code, `ans` now includes `a[3]` at the end, preceded by a space.
