Output State: **`ans` is now `ans` + 'a[len_l - 1]' + str(a[len_l - 1]) + ' '; `i` is `len_l - 2`; `bets` must be greater than `len_l - 1`**

Explanation: The code `ans += str(a[i]) + ' '` updates the value of `ans` by appending the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space. Given that `i` is initially `len_l - 1`, after the operation, `i` is decremented to `len_l - 2`. The value of `bets` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code.
