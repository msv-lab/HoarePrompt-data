Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `bets`.
2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is currently `-1`.
   - `bets` is the value entered by the user.
3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute if `bets` is at least 1 (since `range(bets)` will generate numbers from 0 to `bets-1`).

Given this information, we need to adjust the state such that the loop can start executing. Specifically, we need to ensure that `i` is set to 0 (the starting point of the loop) and `bets` is at least 1.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `bets`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `bets` must be greater than 0**
