Output State: **`i` is equal to `bets` - 1, `sumo` is the sum of `prod // a[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `bets` - 1, all elements in the list `a` are updated to `prod // a[i]` for their respective indices, and `ans` is an empty string.**

Explanation: The line `ans = ''` initializes the variable `ans` as an empty string. No other changes are made to the existing variables or their values. Therefore, the values of `i`, `sumo`, and the list `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
