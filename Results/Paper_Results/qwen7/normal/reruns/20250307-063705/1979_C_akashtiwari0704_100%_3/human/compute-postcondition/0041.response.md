Based on the initial state provided:

- `ans` is constructed by appending the string representation of the last element of the list `a` (i.e., `a[len_l - 1]`), followed by the string representation of `a[len_l - 1]`, and then spaces. This process repeats `bets - len_l + 1` times.
- `i` is set to `-1`.
- `bets` is equal to or greater than `len_l - 1`.

Let's break down the construction of `ans`:

1. `ans` starts as an empty string.
2. It appends the string representation of `a[len_l - 1]` once.
3. It appends the string representation of `a[len_l - 1]` again.
4. It appends spaces `bets - len_l + 1` times.

Given these steps, the final `ans` will be:

```
a[len_l - 1] + str(a[len_l - 1]) + ' ' * (bets - len_l + 1)
```

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **a[len_l - 1] + str(a[len_l - 1]) + ' ' * (bets - len_l + 1)**
