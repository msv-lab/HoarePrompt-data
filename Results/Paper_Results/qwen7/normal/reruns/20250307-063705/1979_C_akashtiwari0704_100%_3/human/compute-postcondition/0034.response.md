Output State: **`ans` is `ans` + 'a[len_l - 1]' and `i` is `len_l - 2`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += str(a[i]) + ' '` updates the value of `ans` by appending `str(a[i]) + ' '` to its current value. Given the initial state where `i` must be `len_l - 1`, after executing the code, `i` is decremented by 1, making it `len_l - 2`. The value of `ans` is updated to include `str(a[i])`, which is `str(a[len_l - 1])`.
