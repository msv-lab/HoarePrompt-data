Output State: **`bets` is a positive integer decremented by 2, `i` is equal to the length of list `l` minus 1, `sumo` is the sum of its previous value and the integer value of `a[i]`, and `sumo` is incremented by the integer value of `a[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `sumo += int(a[i])` increments `sumo` by the integer value of `a[i]`. The other variables (`bets`, `i`, and `a[i]`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
