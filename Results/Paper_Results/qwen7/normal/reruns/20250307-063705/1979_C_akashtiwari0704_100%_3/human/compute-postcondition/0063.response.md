Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(bets)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `bets`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `sumo` is increased by `a[0]`
   - `bets` must be greater than 0

3. **Understand how the loop works**:
   - The loop starts with `i = 0`.
   - For each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.
   - The loop continues as long as `i < bets`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, after the first iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `bets` must still be greater than 0.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` will be 1.
   - `sumo` remains unchanged from the previous iteration (it was increased by `a[0]`).
   - `bets` must still be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 1, `sumo` is increased by `a[0]`, `bets` must be greater than 0**
