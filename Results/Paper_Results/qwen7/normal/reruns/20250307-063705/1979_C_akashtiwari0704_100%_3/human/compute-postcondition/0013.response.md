Functionality: **The function `lcm` accepts a list of integers `l` and returns the least common multiple (LCM) of all elements in the list. This is achieved by first calculating the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all elements in the list, then dividing the product of all elements by this GCD. The function ensures that the input list `l` contains at least one element and that the returned value `g` is the LCM of the elements in `l`.**
