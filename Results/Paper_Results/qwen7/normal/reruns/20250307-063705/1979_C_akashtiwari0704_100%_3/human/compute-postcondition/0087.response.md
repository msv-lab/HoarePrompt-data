Output State: **`g` is updated to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`, `i` is equal to `bets`, `bets` must be greater than 0, `len(l)` must be greater than or equal to 1**

Explanation: The variable `g` is updated by multiplying its current value with `l[i]` and then performing integer division by the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `g` and `l[i]`. The value of `i` remains unchanged and is still equal to `bets`. The conditions on `bets` and `l` remain the same as they were not affected by the code.
