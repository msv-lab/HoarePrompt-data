Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each set of input data, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5, and v and u are integers such that 1 ≤ v, u ≤ n. Additionally, the sum of the values of n across all sets of input data does not exceed 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(sys.stdin.readline())):
    solve()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The function `solve()` is called, but no specific changes to variables are observed since the function's content is not provided.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The function `solve()` is called, but no specific changes to variables are observed since the function's content is not provided. An integer value read from standard input is decremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The integer value read from standard input must be at least 1




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
