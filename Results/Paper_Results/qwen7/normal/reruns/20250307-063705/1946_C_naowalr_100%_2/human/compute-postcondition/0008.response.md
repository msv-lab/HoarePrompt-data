Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes values for t, n, k, v, and u internally. It validates that t is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4, n and k are integers within the range 1 to 10^5 with the condition 1 â‰¤ k < n, and v and u are integers within the range 1 to 10^5. The function also ensures that the sum of the values of n across all sets of input data does not exceed 10^5. Based on these inputs, the function performs certain operations (not detailed here) and returns a result.**
