The only object in the loop head is the integer value read from standard input, which is used as the argument to `range()`. Since this value is decremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, we need to adjust this value for the loop to execute one more time.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the initial state**: The integer value read from standard input is decremented by 1 at the end of each iteration.
2. **Determine the adjustment needed**: For the loop to execute one more time, the integer value must be greater than 0 after being decremented.

Assuming the integer value read from standard input was `x` initially, after the first iteration, it becomes `x - 1`. For the loop to execute again, this value must be greater than 0, meaning it must be at least 1 before the decrement.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that the integer value read from standard input must be at least 1.

State: **The integer value read from standard input must be at least 1**
