Output State: The integer value read from standard input is reduced to 0 after the loop executes all its iterations.

Explanation: Given that the integer value is decremented by 1 with each iteration of the loop, and it must be at least 1 after 3 iterations, it will reach 0 after the loop has completed all its iterations (i.e., when the integer value becomes 0 and the loop condition fails).
