Output State: The integer value read from standard input must be exactly 0.

Explanation: Given that the integer value is decremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop, and it must be at least 1 after 3 iterations, it will reach 0 after the loop has executed all its iterations (i.e., when the integer value becomes 0, which means it has been decremented from an initial value of at least 1, through the full range of iterations).
