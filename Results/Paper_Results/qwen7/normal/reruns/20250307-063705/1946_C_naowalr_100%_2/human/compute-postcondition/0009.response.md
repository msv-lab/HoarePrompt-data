Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` from standard input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it calls the `solve()` function. After processing all test cases, the integer `t` is reduced to 0. The function internally processes values for `n`, `k`, `v`, and `u` based on given constraints, performs certain operations, and does not return any value.**
