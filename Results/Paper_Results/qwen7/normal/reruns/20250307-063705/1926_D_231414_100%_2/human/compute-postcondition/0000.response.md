Output State: **`times` is an input integer, and all other variables are not yet defined.**

The code reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `times`. No other variables are defined or modified, so the initial conditions for `t` remain unchanged. The value of `times` is an integer obtained from the input, and no other variables are affected by this operation.
