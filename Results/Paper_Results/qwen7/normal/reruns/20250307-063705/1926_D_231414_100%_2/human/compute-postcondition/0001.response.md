Output State: **`times` is an input integer, `check` is 2147483647**

Explanation: The code sets `check` to the value of \(2^{31} - 1\), which is 2147483647. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `times` is still an input integer, and `check` is now explicitly set to 2147483647.
