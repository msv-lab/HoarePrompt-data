Output State: **`times` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `_` is 0, `data` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `data = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer using the `map` function. The resulting list of integers is stored in the variable `data`. The values of `times` and `n` remain unchanged, and `_` is still 0.
