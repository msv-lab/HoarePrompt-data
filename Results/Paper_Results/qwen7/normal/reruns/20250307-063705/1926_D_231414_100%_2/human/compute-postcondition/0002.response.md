State: **`times` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0** 

Explanation:
- The loop uses `range(times)` to determine how many iterations will occur.
- The variable `_` is a placeholder used in the loop, typically representing the current iteration index.
- For the loop to execute, `times` must be a positive integer (greater than 0).
- The value of `_` at the start of the loop is 0 because the loop hasn't started yet.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `times` must be greater than 0 and `_` is 0.
