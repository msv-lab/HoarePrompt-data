Output State: **`data` is a list of integers with at least one element, `i` is the first element of the list `data`, `s` is `i` XOR `check`, `i` is present in `dic`, and the value of `dic[i]` is decremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `dic[i] -= 1` decrements the value of `dic[i]` by 1. All other variables and their relationships remain unchanged. Therefore, `data` remains a list of integers with at least one element, `i` is still the first element of the list `data`, `s` is still `i` XOR `check`, and `i` is still present in `dic`. The only change is that the value of `dic[i]` is now one less than its original value.
