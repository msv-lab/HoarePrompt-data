Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`, which is iterating over the elements of the list `data`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: Since `i` is being assigned values from the list `data` during each iteration, we need to ensure that the list `data` is not empty and that `i` starts with the first element of the list.

3. **Check the List `data`**: The list `data` is obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer. For the loop to execute, `data` must contain at least one element.

4. **Initial Value of `i`**: When the loop starts, `i` will take the value of the first element in the list `data`.

5. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`times`, `n`, `_`, `dic`, `ans`, `check`) are not directly involved in the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

- `data` must have at least one element.
- `i` must be the first element of the list `data`.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`data` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `i` is the first element of the list `data`**.
