Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` is greater than `m`. If `a[i]` is in `b_freq`, then `matches` is decreased by `min(window_freq[a[i]], b_freq[a[i]])`, and `good_subarrays` is either 1 or remains unchanged. If `a[i]` is not in `b_freq`, then no changes occur to `matches` and `good_subarrays` remains unchanged.
