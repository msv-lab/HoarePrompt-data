Output State: **`good_subarrays` is 0, `a` is a list of integers with length n, `b` is a list of integers with length m, `b_freq` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each element in `b`.**

The code `b_freq = Counter(b)` creates a `Counter` object named `b_freq` which contains the frequency of each element in the list `b`. The other variables (`good_subarrays`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
