Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 0, `n` is equal to `t`, `m` is 0, `k` is `t`, `l` is a binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, and `p` is the length of `l`.**

Explanation: The code `p = len(l)` calculates the length of the binary string representation of `k` and assigns it to `p`. Since `k` is `t`, `l` is the binary string representation of `t` without the '0b' prefix, and `p` is the length of this binary string. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
