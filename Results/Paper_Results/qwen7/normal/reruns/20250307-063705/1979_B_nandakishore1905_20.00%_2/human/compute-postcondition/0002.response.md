Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 0, `n` is equal to `t`, `m` is 0, `k` is `abs(t - 0)` which simplifies to `t`.**

This means that the value of `k` is calculated as the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, which are both equal to `t`. Therefore, `k` is simply `t`.
