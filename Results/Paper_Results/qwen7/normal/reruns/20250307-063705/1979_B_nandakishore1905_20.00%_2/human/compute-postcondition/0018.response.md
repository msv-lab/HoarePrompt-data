Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 0, `n` is equal to `t`, `m` is 0, `k` is `t`, `l` is a binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`, `q` is \(2^{(\text{length of binary representation of } k - 1)}\).**

Explanation: The code calculates `q` as \(2\) raised to the power of one less than the length of the binary representation of `k`. Since `k` is equal to `t`, `p` is the length of the binary representation of `t`, and `q` is therefore \(2^{(p - 1)}\). All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
