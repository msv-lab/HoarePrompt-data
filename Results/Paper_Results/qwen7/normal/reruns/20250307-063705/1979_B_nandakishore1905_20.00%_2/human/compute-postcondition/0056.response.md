Output State: **Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is equal to `t-1`, `n` and `m` are the last two input integers processed in the loop, `k` is the absolute value of `n - m`. If `k` is a power of 2 (i.e., `k & k - 1 == 0`), then `l`, `p`, and `q` retain their original values from the last iteration. Otherwise, if `n` is 0 and `m` is odd, `l` is the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`, and `q` is 2.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `i` will be equal to `t-1` because the loop runs `t` times. The variables `n` and `m` will hold the values of the last pair of integers entered into the loop. The variable `k` will be the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. Depending on the value of `k`, the variables `l`, `p`, and `q` will either retain their values from the last iteration or be recalculated based on the conditions specified in the loop body.
