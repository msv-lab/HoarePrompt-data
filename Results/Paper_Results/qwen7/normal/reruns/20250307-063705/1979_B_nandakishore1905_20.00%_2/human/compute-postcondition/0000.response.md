Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `i`: This variable is initialized to 0 and incremented by 1 in each iteration.
   - `input()`: This function call reads an integer from the standard input.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: Since `i` is initialized to 0 in the loop head, we need to set `i` to 0.

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop continues as long as `i < int(input())`. Therefore, the value of `int(input())` must be greater than 0 (since `i` starts at 0).

4. **Adjust the State**: We need to ensure that the condition `i < int(input())` holds true for the loop to execute. This means that `int(input())` must be a positive integer.

Given the initial state where `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), we need to ensure that `int(input())` is equal to `t`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 0, and `int(input())` must be equal to `t`**.
