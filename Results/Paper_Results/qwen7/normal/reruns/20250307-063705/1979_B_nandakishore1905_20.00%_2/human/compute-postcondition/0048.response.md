Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is the absolute value of `n - m`, `l` is a binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`, `q` is 2 ** (`p` - 1)**.

Explanation: The variable `q` is assigned the value of `2 ** (p - 1)`. Since `p` is the length of the binary string representation of `k`, which is `abs(n - m)`, the value of `q` is calculated based on `p`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
