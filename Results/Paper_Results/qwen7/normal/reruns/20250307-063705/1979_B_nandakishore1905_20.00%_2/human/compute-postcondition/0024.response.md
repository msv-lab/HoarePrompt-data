Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is 0.
- `n` is either 0 or equal to `t`.
- `m` is either even or 0.
- `k` is `t`.
- If `n` is 0, then `m` is even.
- If `n` is equal to `t`, then `m` is 0.

### Loop Head
The loop head is defined as:
```python
for i in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Key Points to Consider
1. **Variable `i`:**
   - The loop starts with `i = 0` and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration.
   - Therefore, after the first iteration, `i` will be 1.

2. **Variable `n`:**
   - The value of `n` does not change within the loop itself; it is determined by the initial state.
   - Since `n` is either 0 or equal to `t`, it remains unchanged.

3. **Variable `m`:**
   - The value of `m` does not change within the loop itself; it is determined by the initial state.
   - Since `m` is either even or 0, it remains unchanged.

4. **Variable `k`:**
   - The value of `k` does not change within the loop itself; it is determined by the initial state.
   - Since `k` is `t`, it remains unchanged.

5. **Input for the Loop:**
   - The loop runs for the number of times specified by `int(input())`.
   - After the first iteration, the input will determine how many more iterations the loop will run.

### Adjusting the States
- After the first iteration, `i` will be 1.
- The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.

### Final State
Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration (second iteration) will be:
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is either 0 or equal to `t`.
- `m` is either even or 0.
- `k` is `t`.

Since the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` do not change, we only need to update `i`.

### Answer
State: **`i` is 1, `n` is either 0 or equal to `t`, `m` is either even or 0, `k` is `t`**
