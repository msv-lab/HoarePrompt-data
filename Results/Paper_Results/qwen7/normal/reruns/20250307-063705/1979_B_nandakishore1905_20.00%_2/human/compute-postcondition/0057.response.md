Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes a set of test cases where each case includes a positive integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) and two distinct non-negative integers `x` and `y` (0 <= x, y <= 10^9). For each test case, it returns a specific value based on the relationship between `x` and `y`.**

- If `x` is less than `y`, the function returns "x < y".
- If `x` is greater than `y`, the function returns "x > y".
- If `x` is equal to `y`, the function returns "x == y".

Note: The function does not explicitly take `x` and `y` as parameters but processes them within the context of each test case defined by `t`.
