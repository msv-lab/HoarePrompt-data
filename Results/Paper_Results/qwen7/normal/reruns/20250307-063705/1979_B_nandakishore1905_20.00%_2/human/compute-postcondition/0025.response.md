Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is `t`.**

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two inputs separated by a space and converts them to integers, assigning the first input to `n` and the second to `m`. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `k` is still equal to `t`, but since `t` is not defined in the initial state, we keep it as `k` is `t`.
