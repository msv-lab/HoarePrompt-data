Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is the absolute value of `n - m`.**

The code calculates the absolute difference between `n` and `m` and assigns it to `k`. Since `n` and `m` are input integers, their specific values are not known, but `k` is now the absolute value of their difference. The values of `i` and `m` remain unchanged.
