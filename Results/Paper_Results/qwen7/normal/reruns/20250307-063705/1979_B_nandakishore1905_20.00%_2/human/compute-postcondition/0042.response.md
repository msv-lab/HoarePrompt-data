Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is the absolute value of `n - m`.**

The code updates the value of `k` to be the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. Since `n` and `m` are input integers, their specific values are not known, but `k` is now calculated as the absolute value of their difference. The values of `i` and the nature of `n` and `m` remain unchanged.
