Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 0, `n` is either 0 or equal to `t`, `m` is either even or 0, `k` is `t`, and \(k \& (k - 1) \neq 0\). Additionally, if `n` is 0, then `m` is even. If `n` is equal to `t`, then `m` is 0, `l` is the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, and `p` is the length of `l`, `q` is \(2^{(\text{length of binary representation of } k - 1)}\).**
