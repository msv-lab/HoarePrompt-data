Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is the absolute value of `n - m`.**

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `m` respectively. It does not affect the values of `i` or `k`. Therefore, `i` remains 2, `n` and `m` take the values of the input integers, and `k` is updated to be the absolute value of `n - m`.
