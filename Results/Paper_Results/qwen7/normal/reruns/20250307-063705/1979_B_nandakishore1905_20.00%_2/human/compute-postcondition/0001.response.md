Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 0, `n` is equal to `t`, `m` is 0**

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and splits them by whitespace. Since the precondition states that `int(input())` must be equal to `t`, the first integer read (assigned to `n`) is equal to `t`. The second integer (assigned to `m`) is not specified, so it defaults to 0. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged.
