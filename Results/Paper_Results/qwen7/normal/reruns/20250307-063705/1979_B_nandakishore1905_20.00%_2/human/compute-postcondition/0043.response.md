Step-by-step reasoning:

1. We know that `i` is explicitly given as 2.
2. `n` is an input integer, but its value is not specified.
3. `m` is another input integer, also not specified.
4. `k` is defined as the absolute value of `n - m`.

When the `print(k)` statement is executed, it will print the value of `k`, which is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.

Output: **the absolute value of n - m**
