Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state defines that `i` is 1.
2. `n` is an input integer.
3. `m` is an input integer.
4. `k` is defined as the absolute value of `n - m`.

The code snippet to execute is:
```python
print(k)
```

To determine what will be printed, we need to focus on the value of `k`:
- `k` is calculated as the absolute value of `n - m`. This means `k` will be the non-negative difference between `n` and `m`.

Therefore, the print statement will output the value of `k`.

Output: **k (where k is the absolute value of n - m)**
