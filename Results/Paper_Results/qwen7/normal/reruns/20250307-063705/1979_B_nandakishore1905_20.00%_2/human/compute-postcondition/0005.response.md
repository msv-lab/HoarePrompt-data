Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is 0.
- `n` is equal to `t`.
- `m` is 0.
- `k` is `t` and is also a power of 2, meaning `k & k - 1` equals 0.

Since `k` is equal to `t` and `k` must be a power of 2, `t` itself must be a power of 2. Powers of 2 are numbers like 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. Given the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the possible values for `t` (and thus `k`) are limited to the powers of 2 within this range, which are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024.

However, since the exact value of `t` is not specified, we can only say that `k` is a specific power of 2 within the given range.

Output: **k (where k is a power of 2 within the range 1 to 10^4)**
