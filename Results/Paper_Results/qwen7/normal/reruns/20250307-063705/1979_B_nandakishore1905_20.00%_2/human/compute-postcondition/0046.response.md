Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is the absolute value of `n - m`, `l` is a binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix.**

Explanation: The code `l = bin(k).replace('0b', '')` converts the integer `k` (which is the absolute value of `n - m`) into its binary representation and removes the '0b' prefix. The values of `i`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.
