Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is an input integer
   - `m` is an input integer
   - `k` is the absolute value of `n - m`

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `int(input())` iterations.

3. **Loop Head Variables:**
   - The only variables in the loop head are `i`.

4. **State Adjustments:**
   - Since the loop condition depends on `i`, we need to adjust `i` for the next iteration.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.

5. **Other Variables:**
   - `n`, `m`, and `k` are not part of the loop head, so their values remain unchanged.

6. **Final State:**
   - `i` is now 2.
   - `n` remains the same as the initial input integer.
   - `m` remains the same as the initial input integer.
   - `k` remains the same as the initial absolute value of `n - m`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is the absolute value of `n - m`**
