Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is the absolute value of `n - m`. If `n` is 0 and `m` is odd, `l` is the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`, and `q` is 2. Otherwise, `l`, `p`, and `q` retain their original values as `k` is the absolute value of `n - m`.
