Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each containing two distinct non-negative integers \(n\) and \(m\). For each pair, it calculates the absolute difference \(k = |n - m|\) and then prints one of four possible values based on the properties of \(k\): if \(k\) is a power of 2, it prints \(k\); if \(n\) is 0 and \(m\) is odd, it prints 1; if \(n\) is 0 and \(m\) is even, it prints 2; otherwise, it prints \(k - 2^{p-1}\), where \(p\) is the number of bits in the binary representation of \(k\).**
