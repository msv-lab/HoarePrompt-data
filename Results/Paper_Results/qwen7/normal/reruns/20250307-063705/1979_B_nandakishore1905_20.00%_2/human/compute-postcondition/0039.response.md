Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is the absolute value of `n - m`. If `k` is a power of 2 (i.e., `k & k - 1 == 0`), then `l`, `p`, and `q` remain unchanged. Otherwise, if `n` is 0 and `m` is odd, then `l` is the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`, and `q` is 2.
