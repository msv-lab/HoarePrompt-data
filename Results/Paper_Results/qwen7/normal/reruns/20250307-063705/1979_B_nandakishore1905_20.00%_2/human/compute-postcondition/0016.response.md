Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 0, `n` is equal to `t`, `m` is 0, `k` is `t`, `l` is a binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, and \(k \& (k - 1) \neq 0\).**

Explanation: The code `l = bin(k).replace('0b', '')` converts the integer `k` to its binary representation using the `bin()` function, which returns a string prefixed with '0b'. The `replace('0b', '')` method removes this prefix, leaving only the binary digits. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states, and the additional condition \(k \& (k - 1) \neq 0\) is still valid since bitwise operations do not affect this condition.
