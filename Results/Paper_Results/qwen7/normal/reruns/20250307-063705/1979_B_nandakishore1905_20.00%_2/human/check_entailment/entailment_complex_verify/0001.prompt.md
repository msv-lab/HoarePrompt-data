You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two distinct non-negative integers x and y . Consider two
infinite sequences a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots and b_1, b_2, b_3, \ldots , where

  * a_n = n \oplus x ; 
  * b_n = n \oplus y . 

Here, x \oplus y denotes the [bitwise
XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) operation of
integers x and y .

For example, with x = 6 , the first 8 elements of sequence a will look as
follows: [7, 4, 5, 2, 3, 0, 1, 14, \ldots] . Note that the indices of elements
start with 1 .

Your task is to find the length of the longest common subsegment^\dagger of
sequences a and b . In other words, find the maximum integer m such that a_i =
b_j, a_{i + 1} = b_{j + 1}, \ldots, a_{i + m - 1} = b_{j + m - 1} for some i,
j \ge 1 .

^\dagger A subsegment of sequence p is a sequence p_l,p_{l+1},\ldots,p_r ,
where 1 \le l \le r .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0 \le x, y \le
10^9, x \neq y ) — the parameters of the sequences.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the length of the longest common
subsegment.

Example

Input

    4
    
    0 1
    
    12 4
    
    57 37
    
    316560849 14570961

Output

    1
    8
    4
    33554432
    
Note

In the first test case, the first 7 elements of sequences a and b are as
follows:

a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,\ldots]

b = [0, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6,\ldots]

It can be shown that there isn't a positive integer k such that the sequence
[k, k + 1] occurs in b as a subsegment. So the answer is 1 .

In the third test case, the first 20 elements of sequences a and b are as
follows:

a = [56, 59, 58, 61, 60, 63, 62, 49, 48, 51, 50, 53, 52, 55, 54, \textbf{41,
40, 43, 42}, 45, \ldots]

b = [36, 39, 38, 33, 32, 35, 34, 45, 44, 47, 46, \textbf{41, 40, 43, 42}, 53,
52, 55, 54, 49, \ldots]

It can be shown that one of the longest common subsegments is the subsegment
[41, 40, 43, 42] with a length of 4 .

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        k = abs(n - m)
        if k & k - 1 == 0:
            print(k)
        elif n == 0 and m % 2 != 0:
            print(1)
        elif n == 0 and m % 2 == 0:
            print(2)
        else:
            l = bin(k).replace('0b', '')
            p = len(l)
            q = 2 ** (p - 1)
            print(k - q)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, x and y are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        k = abs(n - m)
        
        if k & k - 1 == 0:
            print(k)
        elif n == 0 and m % 2 != 0:
            print(1)
        elif n == 0 and m % 2 == 0:
            print(2)
        else:
            l = bin(k).replace('0b', '')
            p = len(l)
            q = 2 ** (p - 1)
            print(k - q)
        
    #State: Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is equal to `t-1`, `n` and `m` are the last two input integers processed in the loop, `k` is the absolute value of `n - m`. If `k` is a power of 2 (i.e., `k & k - 1 == 0`), then `l`, `p`, and `q` retain their original values from the last iteration. Otherwise, if `n` is 0 and `m` is odd, `l` is the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`, and `q` is 2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each containing two distinct non-negative integers \(n\) and \(m\). For each pair, it calculates the absolute difference \(k = |n - m|\) and then prints one of four possible values based on the properties of \(k\): if \(k\) is a power of 2, it prints \(k\); if \(n\) is 0 and \(m\) is odd, it prints 1; if \(n\) is 0 and \(m\) is even, it prints 2; otherwise, it prints \(k - 2^{p-1}\), where \(p\) is the number of bits in the binary representation of \(k\).


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the length of the longest common subsegment between two sequences \(a_n\) and \(b_n\) defined by \(a_n = n \oplus x\) and \(b_n = n \oplus y\).

2. **Key Insight**: The key insight here is that the sequences \(a_n\) and \(b_n\) are essentially rotations of each other due to the properties of the XOR operation. Specifically, if we consider the binary representation of \(x\) and \(y\), the length of the longest common subsegment is related to the number of leading zeros in the binary representation of \(|x - y|\).

3. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each pair of \(x\) and \(y\), it calculates \(k = |x - y|\).
   - It then checks if \(k\) is a power of 2 using the condition `if k & k - 1 == 0`. If true, it prints \(k\).
   - If \(k\) is not a power of 2, it converts \(k\) to its binary representation and calculates the length of the longest common subsegment.
   
4. **Issues Identified**:
   - The code incorrectly handles the case where \(x = 0\) and \(y\) is odd. It should always print 1 in this case.
   - The logic for calculating the length of the longest common subsegment is flawed. The correct approach should be to count the number of leading zeros in the binary representation of \(k\).

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - Calculate \(k = |x - y|\).
   - Convert \(k\) to its binary representation.
   - Count the number of leading zeros in the binary representation of \(k\). This count gives the length of the longest common subsegment.

### Conclusion:
The given code does not correctly implement the solution. It has issues with handling specific edge cases and the logic for determining the length of the longest common subsegment is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
