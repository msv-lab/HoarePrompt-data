Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is the absolute value of `n - m`, `l` is a binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix.**

Explanation: The code converts the value of `k` (which is the absolute value of `n - m`) into its binary representation and removes the '0b' prefix. The variables `i`, `n`, `m`, and `k` retain their initial states, while a new variable `l` is created with the binary string representation of `k`.
