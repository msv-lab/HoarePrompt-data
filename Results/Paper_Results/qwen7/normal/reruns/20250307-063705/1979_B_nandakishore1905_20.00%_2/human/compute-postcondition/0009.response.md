Output: **1**

Explanation: The initial state provides us with the following information:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is initialized to 0.
- `n` is initialized to 0.
- `m` is an odd number.
- `k` is assigned the value of `t`.

The print statement simply outputs the integer `1`. Since no other operations are performed on `1` or any other variables before the print statement, the output remains `1`.
