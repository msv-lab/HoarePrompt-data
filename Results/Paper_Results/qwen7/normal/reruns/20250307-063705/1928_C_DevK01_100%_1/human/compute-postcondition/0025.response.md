Output State: **`i` must be less than `w`; if `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, then `M` is a list containing `i`; `M` is updated by adding `q // i` to it.**

Explanation: The code `M += [q // i]` appends the value of `q // i` (integer division of `q` by `i`) to the list `M`. The conditions for `i` and `M` remain the same as the initial state, but now `M` includes the new value `q // i`.
