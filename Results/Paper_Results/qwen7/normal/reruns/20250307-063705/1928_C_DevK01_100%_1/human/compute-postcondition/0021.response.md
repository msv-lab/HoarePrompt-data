Output State: **`i` is an integer greater than or equal to `x`, `q` is an integer representing the position in the line (1 ≤ q < n ≤ 10^9), `x` is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling (1 ≤ x < q), `M` is a list containing three elements `[w, i, q // i]` where `w` is the square root of `q` and must be greater than 1, and `q` is divisible by `i`. Additionally, the value of `q // i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, `i` is increased by 1.**

In this output state, the variable `i` has been incremented by 1 while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
