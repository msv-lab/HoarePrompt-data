Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the number of possible values for \( k \). Specifically, the function `func_1` and its usage do not align with the problem description.

Let's analyze the issue:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Possible \( k \)**:
   - The program attempts to calculate possible values of \( k \) using the function `func_1`, but the logic inside `func_1` does not correctly reflect the problem constraints.
   - The function `func_1` seems to be checking divisors of a calculated value, which does not directly relate to finding valid \( k \) values.

2. **Missing Key Logic**:
   - The key logic to determine the number of valid \( k \) values is missing. The program should consider the periodicity of the settling pattern and the position \( x \).
   - The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions, and the position \( x \) should be checked against this pattern to determine valid \( k \).

3. **Example Analysis**:
   - Consider the test case \( n = 10 \) and \( x = 2 \). The expected output is 4, but the program fails to correctly compute this.
   - The settling pattern for \( k = 2, 3, 5, 6 \) is correct, but the program does not correctly identify these values.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly determine the number of possible \( k \) values for the given constraints. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
