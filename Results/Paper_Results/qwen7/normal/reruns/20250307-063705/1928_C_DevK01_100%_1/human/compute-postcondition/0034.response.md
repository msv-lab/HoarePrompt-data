Output State: **`M` is a list containing the value of `i` plus the value of `q // i`, and `i` must be such that `i + 1 < w`; if `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, then `M` is a list containing the value of `i`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `q // i` to the list `M`. The condition `M += [q // i]` modifies the list `M` by adding the computed value to it. The other conditions and constraints on `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, `M` now includes the new value, and the other conditions regarding `i` are still valid.
