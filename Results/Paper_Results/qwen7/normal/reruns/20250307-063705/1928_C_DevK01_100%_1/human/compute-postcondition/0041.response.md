Output State: `i` is equal to `w`, `q` is an integer representing the position in the line (1 ≤ q < n ≤ 10^9), `x` is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling (1 ≤ x < q), `M` is a list containing all integers `j` such that `x - 1 ≤ j < w` and `q % j == 0` or `q // j ≥ x - 1`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `w`, as the loop continues to increment `i` until it reaches `w`. The list `M` will contain all integers `j` between `x - 1` and `w - 1` (inclusive) that either divide `q` exactly (`q % j == 0`) or whose corresponding quotient `q // j` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
