Output State: **`q` is an integer representing the position in the line (1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9), `x` is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling (1 ≤ x < q), `M` is a list containing one element which is `w`, `w` is the square root of `q`, and the current value of `w` is an integer greater than or equal to `x - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `M += [w]` appends the value of `w` to the list `M`. Since `w` is the square root of `q`, and `w` is an integer greater than or equal to `x - 1`, the list `M` now contains one element, which is `w`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
