Output State: **`q` is an integer representing the position in the line (1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9), `x` is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling (1 ≤ x < q), and `M` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list `M`. This does not affect the values of `q` or `x`. Therefore, their conditions remain the same as the initial state.
