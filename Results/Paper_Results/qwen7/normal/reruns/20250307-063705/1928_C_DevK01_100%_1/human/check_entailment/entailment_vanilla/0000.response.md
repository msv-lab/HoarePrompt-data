Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `x`, representing Vasya's position and the number he received, respectively.

2. **Calculation of `y`:**
   - It calculates `y = n + x`. If `y` is odd, the program prints `0` and continues to the next test case. Otherwise, it proceeds to further calculations.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1(q, x)` is defined to find all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
   - It uses a loop to check for divisors and adds them to the list `M`.

4. **Main Logic:**
   - The main logic involves calculating the number of possible values of `k` that satisfy the conditions.
   - It uses the value of `y` and checks if `n` is within certain ranges to determine the possible values of `k`.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Odd `y`:**
   - If `y` is odd, the settling pattern does not match the required conditions, hence the program correctly prints `0`.

2. **Even `y`:**
   - For even `y`, the program calculates the possible values of `k` using the function `func_1`.
   - The condition `n >= 3 * x - 2` is used to determine if additional values of `k` should be considered.
   - The function `func_1` finds divisors of `(y - 2) // 2` and `(n - x) // 2` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.

### Verification:

- The logic in `func_1` correctly identifies the divisors that meet the criteria.
- The main logic correctly handles the conditions for determining the number of valid `k` values.

### Edge Cases:

- The program handles the case where `y` is odd correctly by printing `0`.
- The program correctly considers the range conditions for `n` to include additional valid `k` values.

### Conclusion:

After analyzing the program, it appears that the logic is correct and handles all specified conditions accurately.

### Final Answer:
