Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves determining the number of possible values of \( k \) for which Vasya could have received his number \( x \) at position \( n \) in the "first-k-th" settling pattern. The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The settling pattern can be broken down into segments of length \( k \) and \( k-2 \).
   - The position \( n \) and the number \( x \) need to fit within these segments.

3. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code correctly calculates the total length of the segment where Vasya could be positioned, which is \( y = n + x \).
   - It checks if \( y \) is even, as only even lengths can fit the pattern.
   - It calls `func_1` with parameters derived from \( y \) and \( x \).

4. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` computes all divisors of \( q = \frac{y - 2}{2} \) that are greater than or equal to \( x - 1 \).
   - These divisors represent potential values of \( k \) because they must fit within the repeating segment of the settling pattern.

5. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The logic in `func_1` is sound: it finds all divisors of \( q \) that meet the criteria.
   - The main program correctly processes each test case and prints the number of valid \( k \) values.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the case where \( y \) is odd by printing 0 immediately.
   - It correctly processes the remaining cases by calling `func_1` and using the results.

Given the analysis, the provided code accurately implements the solution to the problem statement without any logical errors.

Correctness: **True**
