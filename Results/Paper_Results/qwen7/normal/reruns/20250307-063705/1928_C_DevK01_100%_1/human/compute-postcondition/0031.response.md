To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition and the given states.

### Loop Condition
The loop condition is:
```python
while i < w:
```

This means the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `w`.

### Given States
- `i` is `i + 1` (from the previous iteration)
- `w` is greater than `i`
- If `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, then `M` is a list containing `i` and `q // i`, otherwise `M` remains unchanged.

### Analysis
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < w`.
2. **Current Values**:
   - `i` is `i + 1` from the previous iteration.
   - `w` is greater than `i`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `i < w` must still hold true. Since `w` is already stated to be greater than `i` after the previous iteration, the only thing that could change is `i`.

### Adjusting the State
- `i` must be such that `i < w` holds true for the next iteration.
- `w` does not need adjustment because it is already greater than `i`.

Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1` from the previous iteration. For the loop to continue, `i + 1` must still be less than `w`.

### Conclusion
The only state that needs to be adjusted is `i` to ensure that `i + 1 < w` for the next iteration.

### Final Answer
State: **`i` must be such that `i + 1 < w`**
