Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `i < w`.

2. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The variables involved in the loop condition are `i` and `w`.

3. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `q` is an integer representing the position in the line (1 ≤ q < n ≤ 10^9).
   - `x` is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling (1 ≤ x < q).
   - `M` is a list containing one element which is `w` if `w` is an integer and greater than or equal to `x - 1`, and `w` is the square root of `q`.

4. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - `i` is currently 1.
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be less than `w`.
   - Since `i` is already 1, we need to ensure that `w` is greater than 1.

5. **Check the value of `w`**:
   - `w` is defined as the square root of `q`.
   - Given that `q` is an integer and 1 ≤ q < n ≤ 10^9, the square root of `q` (which is `w`) must be an integer and greater than or equal to `x - 1`.

6. **Ensure `w` is greater than 1**:
   - Since `w` is the square root of `q` and `q` is at least 1, the smallest possible value for `w` is 1 (when `q` is 1).
   - To ensure the loop executes, `w` must be greater than 1.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `w` must be greater than 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1, `q` is an integer representing the position in the line (1 ≤ q < n ≤ 10^9), `x` is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling (1 ≤ x < q), `M` is a list containing one element which is `w` if `w` is an integer and greater than or equal to `x - 1`, and `w` is the square root of `q` and must be greater than 1**.
