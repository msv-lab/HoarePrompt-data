You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `x`, representing Vasya's position and the number he received, respectively.

2. **Calculation of `y`:**
   - It calculates `y = n + x`. If `y` is odd, the program prints `0` and continues to the next test case. Otherwise, it proceeds to further calculations.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1(q, x)` is defined to find all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
   - It uses a loop to check for divisors and adds them to the list `M`.

4. **Main Logic:**
   - The main logic involves calculating the number of possible values of `k` that satisfy the conditions.
   - It uses the value of `y` and checks if `n` is within certain ranges to determine the possible values of `k`.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Odd `y`:**
   - If `y` is odd, the settling pattern does not match the required conditions, hence the program correctly prints `0`.

2. **Even `y`:**
   - For even `y`, the program calculates the possible values of `k` using the function `func_1`.
   - The condition `n >= 3 * x - 2` is used to determine if additional values of `k` should be considered.
   - The function `func_1` finds divisors of `(y - 2) // 2` and `(n - x) // 2` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.

### Verification:

- The logic in `func_1` correctly identifies the divisors that meet the criteria.
- The main logic correctly handles the conditions for determining the number of valid `k` values.

### Edge Cases:

- The program handles the case where `y` is odd correctly by printing `0`.
- The program correctly considers the range conditions for `n` to include additional valid `k` values.

### Conclusion:

After analyzing the program, it appears that the logic is correct and handles all specified conditions accurately.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
