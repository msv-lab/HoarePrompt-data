### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the given program step by step to ensure its correctness based on the problem description and the provided annotations.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `x`, representing Vasya's position and the number he received, respectively.

2. **Calculation of `y`:**
   - It calculates `y = n + x`. If `y` is odd, the program prints `0` and continues to the next test case. Otherwise, it proceeds to further calculations.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1(q, x)` is defined to find all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
   - It uses a loop to check for divisors and adds them to the list `M`.

4. **Main Logic:**
   - The main logic involves calculating the number of possible values of `k` that satisfy the conditions.
   - It uses the value of `y` and checks if `n` is within certain ranges to determine the possible values of `k`.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Odd `y`:**
   - If `y` is odd, the settling pattern does not match the required conditions, hence the program correctly prints `0`.

2. **Even `y`:**
   - For even `y`, the program calculates the possible values of `k` using the function `func_1`.
   - The condition `n >= 3 * x - 2` is used to determine if additional values of `k` should be considered.
   - The function `func_1` finds divisors of `(y - 2) // 2` and `(n - x) // 2` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.

### Verification:

- The logic in `func_1` correctly identifies the divisors that meet the criteria.
- The main logic correctly handles the conditions for determining the number of valid `k` values.
- The program correctly handles the case where `y` is odd by printing `0`.
- The program correctly considers the range conditions for `n` to include additional valid `k` values.

### Edge Cases:

- The program handles the case where `y` is odd correctly by printing `0`.
- The program correctly considers the range conditions for `n` to include additional valid `k` values.

### Annotations and State Analysis:

- **Initial State:**
  - `t` is read from input.
  - For each test case, `n` and `x` are read.
  - `y = n + x` is calculated.
  - If `y` is odd, `0` is printed and the loop continues.
  - If `y` is even, the function `func_1` is called with `(y - 2) // 2` and `x`.
  - If `n >= 3 * x - 2`, the function `func_1` is called again with `(n - x) // 2` and `x`.
  - The results are stored in `L1` and converted to a set to remove duplicates.
  - The length of the set is printed.

- **Function `func_1`:**
  - `q` is the input parameter.
  - `w` is the square root of `q`.
  - If `w` is an integer and greater than or equal to `x - 1`, `w` is added to `M`.
  - A loop iterates from `1` to `w` to find all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
  - The divisors are added to `M`.
  - The function returns the list `M`.

### Conclusion:

After re-analyzing the program and the annotations, it appears that the logic is correct and handles all specified conditions accurately. The program correctly identifies the number of valid `k` values based on the given constraints.
