Output State: `i` is equal to `w`, `q` is an integer representing the position in the line (1 ≤ q < n ≤ 10^9), `x` is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling (1 ≤ x < q), `M` is a list containing all integers `j` such that `x - 1 ≤ j < w` and `q % j == 0` or `q // j ≥ x - 1`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `w` because the loop continues as long as `i < w`. The list `M` will contain all integers `j` that satisfy either `x - 1 ≤ j < w` and `q % j == 0` or `q // j ≥ x - 1`. This is because the loop adds `i` to `M` whenever `i` meets these conditions, and `i` increases by 1 with each iteration until it reaches `w`.
