### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program based on the problem description and the function summary.

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to find the number of possible values of \( k \) such that the settling pattern matches the given position \( n \) and the number \( x \) received by Vasya.
   - The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to return a list of integers \( j \) such that \( x - 1 \leq j < w \) and either \( q \% j == 0 \) or \( q // j \geq x - 1 \), where \( w \) is the integer part of the square root of \( q \).
   - However, the logic inside `func_1` does not directly relate to finding valid \( k \) values. It checks divisors of \( q \), which is not relevant to the settling pattern.

3. **Key Logic Missing**:
   - The program needs to determine the number of valid \( k \) values by considering the periodicity of the settling pattern.
   - The settling pattern for \( k \) repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions, and we need to check if the position \( n \) and the number \( x \) match this pattern.

4. **Revised Approach**:
   - We need to find the number of \( k \) such that the settling pattern matches the given \( n \) and \( x \).
   - The key is to use the periodicity of the settling pattern to determine the valid \( k \) values.

5. **Example Analysis**:
   - For \( n = 10 \) and \( x = 2 \):
     - The settling pattern for \( k = 2, 3, 5, 6 \) is correct.
     - The program should correctly identify these values.

Given the issues identified in the original assessment, the program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the number of possible \( k \) values. The function `func_1` and its usage do not align with the problem constraints.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic to determine the number of possible \( k \) values. The function `func_1` and its usage do not align with the problem constraints.
