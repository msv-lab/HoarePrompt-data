Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `w` is greater than `i`, if `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, then `M` is a list containing `i` and `q // i`, otherwise `M` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. The conditions for `M` remain the same, meaning if `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, then `M` is updated to a list containing `i` and `q // i`. Otherwise, `M` remains unchanged. The value of `w` is still greater than `i`.
