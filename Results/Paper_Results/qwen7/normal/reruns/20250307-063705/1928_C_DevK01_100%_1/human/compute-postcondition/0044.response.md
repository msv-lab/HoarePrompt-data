Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `q` and `x`, where `q` represents the position in a line and `x` is an integer Vasya received. It returns a list `M` containing all integers `j` such that `x - 1 ≤ j < w` and either `q % j == 0` or `q // j ≥ x - 1`, where `w` is the integer part of the square root of `q`.**
