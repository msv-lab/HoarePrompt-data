Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `y`**: The calculation `y = n + x` is incorrect. According to the problem, the settling pattern repeats every `2k-2` positions, not every `n` positions. Therefore, `y` should be calculated as `y = 2k - 2 + x`.

2. **Incorrect Function Call**: The function `func_1` is called with `(y - 2) // 2` and `(n - x) // 2`, but these values need to be adjusted based on the correct formula for `y`.

3. **Incorrect Logic in `func_1`**: The logic in `func_1` needs to correctly identify valid `k` values based on the constraints. Specifically, it should check if the given `x` fits within the repeating pattern of `2k-2`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, x = map(int, input().split())
    ans = 0
    # Calculate y based on the settling pattern
    y = 2 * x - 2
    if y % 2 != 0:
        print(0)
        continue
    else:
        # Check if the position n falls within the repeating pattern
        if n <= y:
            ans += 1
        else:
            # Calculate the number of complete cycles and remaining positions
            cycles = (n - y) // y
            remaining = (n - y) % y
            # Check the remaining positions
            if remaining >= x - 1:
                ans += 1
            # Check for additional valid k values in the remaining positions
            for k in range(x - 1, remaining + 1):
                if (remaining - k) % (2 * x - 2) == 0:
                    ans += 1
        print(ans)
```

This corrected version ensures that the program correctly calculates the number of valid `k` values based on the given constraints.
