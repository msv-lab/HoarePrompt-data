### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `x` representing Vasya's position in the line and the number he received during the settling.

2. **Main Logic:**
   - The program calculates `y = n + x`.
   - If `y` is odd, it prints `0` and continues to the next test case.
   - Otherwise, it calls `func_1((y - 2) // 2, x)` to get a list of possible values of `k`.
   - If `n >= 3 * x - 2`, it adds the result of `func_1((n - x) // 2, x)` to the list obtained from the first call.
   - Finally, it prints the length of the unique elements in the combined list.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `q` and `x`.
   - It calculates the integer part of the square root of `q` and checks if it is an integer and greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
   - It initializes an empty list `M`.
   - It iterates from `1` to `w` (the integer part of the square root of `q`):
     - If `i` divides `q` exactly or if `q // i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, it adds `i` to the list `M`.
   - It returns the list `M`.

4. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The main logic correctly handles the conditions for printing `0` when `y` is odd.
   - The function `func_1` correctly identifies the divisors of `q` within the specified range.
   - The combination of results from `func_1` for `(y - 2) // 2` and `(n - x) // 2` ensures that all possible values of `k` are considered.
   - The final step of taking the unique elements and counting them is correct.

Given the analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
