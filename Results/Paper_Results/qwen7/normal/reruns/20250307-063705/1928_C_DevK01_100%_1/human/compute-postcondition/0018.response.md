Output State: **`i` is an integer greater than or equal to `x - 1`, `q` is an integer representing the position in the line (1 ≤ q < n ≤ 10^9), `x` is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling (1 ≤ x < q), `M` is a list containing three elements `[w, i, q // i]` where `w` is the square root of `q` and must be greater than 1, and `q` is divisible by `i`. Additionally, the value of `q // i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `M += [q // i]` appends the value of `q // i` to the list `M`. Initially, `M` contains two elements `[w, i]`. After executing the code, `M` now contains three elements: `[w, i, q // i]`. All other conditions and constraints remain unchanged.
