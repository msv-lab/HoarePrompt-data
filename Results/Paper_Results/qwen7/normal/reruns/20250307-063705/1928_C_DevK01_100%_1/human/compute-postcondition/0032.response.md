Output State: **`i` must be such that `i + 1 < w`; `M` is a list containing the value of `i`.**

Explanation: The code `M += [i]` appends the current value of `i` to the list `M`. The condition `i + 1 < w` from the initial state is still valid. Therefore, the updated state includes that `M` now contains the value of `i` added to it as a list element.
