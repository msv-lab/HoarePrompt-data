Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `q` and `x`. `q` is an integer representing the position in the line, and `x` is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling. The function returns a list `M` containing all integers `j` such that `x - 1 ≤ j < w` and either `q % j == 0` or `q // j ≥ x - 1`.**
