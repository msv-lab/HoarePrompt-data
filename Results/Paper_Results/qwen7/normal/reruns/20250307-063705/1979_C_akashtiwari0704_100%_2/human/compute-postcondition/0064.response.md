Output State: **`bets` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `sumo` is increased by `prod // a[0]`, `a[i]` is equal to `prod // a[i]`**

Explanation: The code `sumo += int(a[i])` increments `sumo` by the integer value of `a[i]`. Given the initial state, `i` is 0, so `a[i]` is `prod // a[0]`. Therefore, `sumo` is increased by `prod // a[0]`. The other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
