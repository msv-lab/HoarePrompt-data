Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive)
Code of the loop:
for T in range(t):

    def lcm(l):
        g = 1
        for i in range(len(l)):
            g = g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])
        return g
    bets = int(input())
    a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    prod = lcm(a)
    sumo = 0
    for i in range(bets):
        a[i] = prod // a[i]
        sumo += int(a[i])
    if sumo >= prod:
        print(-1)
    else:
        ans = ''
        for i in range(bets):
            ans += str(a[i]) + ' '
        print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `bets - 1`. `sumo` will be the sum of the integer values of each element in the list `a` after being updated by the loop. Each element in the list `a` will be updated to `prod // a[i]` for each iteration `i`. `bets` will remain a positive integer, indicating the number of iterations the loop ran. Additionally, if `sumo >= prod` is satisfied, the function does not change `sumo` and `i`. Otherwise, `sumo` is less than `prod`, and `ans` is a string containing the elements of `a` up to the last index separated by spaces.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `bets` is greater than or equal to the total number of iterations, `i` is equal to `bets`, `sumo` is increased by the sum of `prod // a[i]` for each `i` from 0 to `bets-1`, and `a[i]` is equal to `prod // a[i]` for each `i` from 0 to `bets-1`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, the function does not change `sumo` further. Otherwise, `sumo` remains as it was updated in each iteration but is still less than `prod`, and `ans` contains the concatenated string of `str(a[i]) + ' '` for every index `i` from 0 to `bets-1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `bets` is an input integer, `i` equals the length of list `l` plus the number of iterations (`bets`), `sumo` is the sum of `prod // a[i]` for each index `i` from 0 to `bets-1`, and each element `a[i]` in the list `a` is updated to `prod // a[i]` after being used in the calculation of `sumo`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, the function does not return anything. Otherwise, the function returns a string containing the concatenation of the string representations of all elements in the list `a` from index 0 to `bets-1`, separated by spaces.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
