Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `l`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop runs for each index in the range of `len(l)`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `l` must have at least 1 element.

3. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `l` must still have at least 1 element (since the length of `l` does not change within the loop).

Given these points, the updated state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`T` is `t-1`, `t` remains unchanged, `g` is `l[0]`, `i` is 1, `l` must have at least 1 element**
