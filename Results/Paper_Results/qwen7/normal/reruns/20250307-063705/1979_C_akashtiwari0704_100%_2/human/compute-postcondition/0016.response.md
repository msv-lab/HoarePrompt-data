Output State: **`bets` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `T` is 0, `g` is 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of all integers in list `a`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of all integers in the list `a` and assigns it to the variable `prod`. The LCM of a list of numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of each of the numbers in the list. The values of other variables remain unchanged.
