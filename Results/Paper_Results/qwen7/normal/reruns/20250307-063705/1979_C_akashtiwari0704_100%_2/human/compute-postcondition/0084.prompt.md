Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `bets` must be greater than or equal to the total number of iterations, `i` is equal to `bets`, `sumo` is increased by the sum of `prod // a[i]` for each `i` from 0 to `bets-1`, and `a[i]` is equal to `prod // a[i]` for each `i` from 0 to `bets-1`, and `sumo` is less than `prod`, `ans` is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(bets):
    ans += str(a[i]) + ' '


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `bets` must be greater than or equal to the total number of iterations, `i` must be less than `bets`, `sumo` is increased by the sum of `prod // a[i]` for each `i` from 0 to `bets-1`, `a[i]` is equal to `prod // a[i]` for each `i` from 0 to `bets-1`, `sumo` is less than `prod`, `ans` is the string formed by concatenating `str(a[i]) + ' '` for each `i` from 0 to `bets-1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `bets` must be greater than or equal to the total number of iterations, `i` is `bets`, `sumo` is increased by the sum of `prod // a[i]` for each `i` from 0 to `bets-1`, `a[i]` is equal to `prod // a[i]` for each `i` from 0 to `bets-1`, `sumo` is less than `prod`, `ans` is the string formed by concatenating `str(a[i]) + ' '` for each `i` from 0 to `bets-1`, `ans` is updated by adding `str(a[i]) + ' '` for the current `i`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `bets` must be greater than or equal to the total number of iterations, `i` is equal to `bets`, `sumo` is increased by the sum of `prod // a[i]` for each `i` from `0` to `bets-1`, `a[i]` is equal to `prod // a[i]` for each `i` from `0` to `bets-1`, `sumo` is less than `prod`, `ans` is the string formed by concatenating `str(a[i]) + ' '` for each `i` from `0` to `bets-1`, `ans` is updated by adding `str(a[i]) + ' '` for the current `i`, `ans` is the string formed by concatenating `str(a[i]) + ' '` for each `i` from `0` to `bets-1` and includes an additional `str(a[i]) + ' '` for the current `i`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
