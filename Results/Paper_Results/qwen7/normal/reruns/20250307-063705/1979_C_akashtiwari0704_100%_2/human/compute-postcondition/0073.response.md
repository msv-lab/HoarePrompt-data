Postcondition: **`bets` is greater than or equal to the total number of iterations, `i` is equal to `bets`, `sumo` is increased by the sum of `prod // a[i]` for each `i` from 0 to `bets-1`, and `a[i]` is equal to `prod // a[i]` for each `i` from 0 to `bets-1`. Additionally, `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`.**
