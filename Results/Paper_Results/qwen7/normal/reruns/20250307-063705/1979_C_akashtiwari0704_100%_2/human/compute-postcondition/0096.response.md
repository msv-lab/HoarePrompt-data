Output State: `T` is `t-1`, `t` remains unchanged, `g` is the product of all elements in list `l` divided by their greatest common divisor (GCD) when taken pairwise, `i` is equal to the length of list `l`, `l` must be a non-empty list.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `g` will hold the value of the product of all elements in the list `l`, with each product divided by the GCD of the current accumulated product and the next element in the list. The variable `i` will be equal to the length of the list `l`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The other variables `T`, `t`, and `g` retain their initial or updated values as described, while `l` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.
