Output State: **`bets` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `T` is 0, `g` is 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of all integers in list `a`, `sumo` is 0.**

The code initializes `sumo` to 0. This does not affect the values of the other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the output state retains the values of all variables as described in the initial state, with the addition of `sumo` being set to 0.
