Output State: **`bets` is an input integer, `T` is 1, `g` is 1, `l` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of all integers in list `a`, `sumo` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `sumo` to 0. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
