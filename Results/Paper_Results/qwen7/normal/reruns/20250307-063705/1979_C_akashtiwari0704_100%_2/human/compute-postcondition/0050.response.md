Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(len(l))`. The variables involved here are `i` and `len(l)`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `T` is 1
   - `g` is `l[0] * l[1]`
   - `l` is a list that must have at least 2 elements
   - `i` is 2

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(l)`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.

4. **Determine the next value of `i`**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` will be 3.

5. **Check if the loop should continue**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` (which will be 3) must be less than `len(l)`.
   - Therefore, `len(l)` must be greater than 3.

6. **Adjust the states**:
   - `T` remains unchanged at 1.
   - `g` remains unchanged at `l[0] * l[1]`.
   - `l` must still be a list with at least 2 elements, but now it must have at least 3 elements for the loop to continue.
   - `i` will be 3.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `T` is 1, `g` is `l[0] * l[1]`, `l` is a list that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 3**
