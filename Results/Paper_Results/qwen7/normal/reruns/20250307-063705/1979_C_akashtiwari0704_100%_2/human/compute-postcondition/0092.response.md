Output State: **`T` is `t-1`, `t` remains unchanged, `g` is `l[0] * l[1] // gcd(l[0], l[1])`, `i` is 2**

Explanation: Initially, `g` is set to `l[0]`. After executing the line `g = g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`, `g` is updated to `l[0] * l[1] // gcd(l[0], l[1])`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The other variables (`T`, `t`, and `l`) remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
