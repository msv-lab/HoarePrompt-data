Output State: **`T` is 1, `g` is `l[0] * l[1]`, `l` is a list that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 3, `g` is updated to `l[0] * l[1] * l[3] // gcd(l[0] * l[1], l[3])`**

Explanation: 
- The value of `T` remains unchanged at 1.
- The value of `g` is updated to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`. Given that `i` is 3, `g` becomes `l[0] * l[1] * l[3] // gcd(l[0] * l[1], l[3])`.
- The value of `l` must have at least 3 elements for the loop to continue.
- The value of `i` is incremented to 3.
