Based on the initial state provided:

- `bets` is greater than or equal to the total number of iterations.
- `i` is equal to `bets`.
- `sumo` is increased by the sum of `prod // a[i]` for each `i` from `0` to `bets-1`.
- `a[i]` is equal to `prod // a[i]` for each `i` from `0` to `bets-1`.
- `sumo` is less than `prod`.
- `ans` is the final string formed by concatenating `str(a[i]) + ' '` for each `i` from `0` to `bets-1`.

After all iterations of the loop have been executed, the value of `ans` will be a string where each element `a[i]` (for `i` from `0` to `bets-1`) is converted to a string and concatenated with a space. 

Since `i` is equal to `bets`, the loop would have completed all iterations, and `ans` will contain the concatenated string of `a[i]` for each `i` from `0` to `bets-1`.

Therefore, the print statement will output the string `ans`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the final string formed by concatenating str(a[i]) + ' ' for each i from 0 to bets-1)**
