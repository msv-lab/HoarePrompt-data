Postcondition: **Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `bets - 1`; `sumo` will be the sum of the integer values of each element in the list `a` after being updated by the loop; each element in the list `a` will be updated to `prod` // `a[i]` for each iteration `i`; `bets` must remain a positive integer, and the loop will have completed all its iterations. Additionally, the condition `sumo >= prod` is satisfied.**
