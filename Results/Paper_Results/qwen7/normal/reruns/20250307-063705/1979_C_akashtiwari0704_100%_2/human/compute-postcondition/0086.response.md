Postcondition: **`bets` is greater than or equal to the total number of iterations, `i` is equal to `bets`, `sumo` is increased by the sum of `prod // a[i]` for each `i` from 0 to `bets-1`, and `a[i]` is equal to `prod // a[i]` for each `i` from 0 to `bets-1`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, the function does not change `sumo` further. Otherwise, `sumo` remains as it was updated in each iteration but is still less than `prod`, and `ans` contains the concatenated string of `str(a[i]) + ' '` for every index `i` from 0 to `bets-1`.**
