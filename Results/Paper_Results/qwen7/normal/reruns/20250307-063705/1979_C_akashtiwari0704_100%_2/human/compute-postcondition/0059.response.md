Output State: **`bets` is an input integer, `T` is 1, `g` is 1, `l` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer.**

The code creates a list `a` by taking an input string, splitting it into elements based on spaces, converting each element to an integer, and storing these integers in a list. The values of `bets`, `T`, `g`, `l`, and `i` remain unchanged.
