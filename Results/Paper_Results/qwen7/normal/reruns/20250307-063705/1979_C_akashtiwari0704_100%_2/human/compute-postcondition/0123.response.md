Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `bets`.
2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space.
   - `i` is `i + 1`.
   - `bets` must be the same as before.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i` to `bets - 1`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration (`i` is `i + 1`), for the next iteration, `i` should be `i + 1` (i.e., `i + 2` if `i` was `i + 1` at the end of the previous iteration).
   - The value of `bets` remains unchanged.
   - The value of `ans` does not change because it is not directly modified within the loop head but rather updated inside the loop body.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `ans` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `i` is now `i + 1` (i.e., `i + 2` if `i` was `i + 1` at the end of the previous iteration).
   - `bets` remains the same.

Given the above steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`ans` is the original value of `ans` plus the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space, `i` is `i + 2`, `bets` must be the same as before**
