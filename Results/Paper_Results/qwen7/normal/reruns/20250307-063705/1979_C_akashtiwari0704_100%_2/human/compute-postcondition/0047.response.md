Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `len(l)`.

2. **Determine the current state after the previous iteration**:
   - `T` is 1
   - `g` is `l[0]`
   - `l` is a list that must have at least 1 element
   - `i` is 0

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for each index from 0 to `len(l) - 1`.

4. **Analyze the previous iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, the loop body has just finished executing for the first element of the list `l`.
   - Therefore, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it `i = 1`.

5. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `len(l)`.
   - Given that `i` is now 1, the loop will execute again if `len(l)` is greater than 1.

6. **Adjust the states**:
   - `T` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `g` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `l` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `i` is updated to 1.
   - `len(l)` must be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`T` is 1, `g` is `l[0]`, `l` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1**
