Output State: **`T` is 1, `g` is `l[0]`, `l` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0**

Explanation: The value of `g` is updated to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`. Given that `i` is 0, `g` is initially 1, and `l` is a list with at least one element, `g` is now updated to `1 * l[0] // gcd(1, l[0])`. Since the greatest common divisor (gcd) of 1 and any number is the number itself, `g` becomes `l[0]`. The other variables (`T`, `l`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
