Postcondition: **`bets` is an input integer, `i` equals the length of list `l` plus the number of iterations (`bets`), `sumo` is the sum of `prod // a[i]` for each index `i` from 0 to `bets-1`, and each element `a[i]` in the list `a` is updated to `prod // a[i]` after being used in the calculation of `sumo`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, the function does not return anything. Otherwise, the function returns a string containing the concatenation of the string representations of all elements in the list `a` from index 0 to `bets-1`, separated by spaces.**
