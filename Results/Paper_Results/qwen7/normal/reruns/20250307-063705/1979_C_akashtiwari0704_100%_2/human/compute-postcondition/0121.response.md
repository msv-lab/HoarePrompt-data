Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given code are `i` and `bets`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `bets`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space.
   - `a` and `i` retain their original values.

4. **Determine the adjustments needed**:
   - Since the loop condition depends on `i` and `bets`, we need to update these variables for the next iteration.
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `bets`.

5. **Calculate the new state**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was used in the loop, so for the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - `bets` remains unchanged unless specified otherwise in the loop body, but it is a constant for this loop.

6. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `ans` retains its current value because the loop body is omitted and no further modifications to `ans` are mentioned.
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
   - `bets` remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`ans` is the original value of `ans` plus the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space, `i` is `i + 1`, `bets` must be the same as before.**
