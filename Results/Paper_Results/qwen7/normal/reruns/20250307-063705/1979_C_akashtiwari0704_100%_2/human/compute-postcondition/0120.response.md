Output State: **`ans` is the original value of `ans` plus the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space, `a` and `i` retain their original values.**

Explanation: The code `ans += str(a[i]) + ' '` appends the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space to the existing value of `ans`. The variables `a` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
