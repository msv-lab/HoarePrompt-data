Functionality: The function `lcm` accepts a list `l` as input and returns the product of all elements in the list `l`, provided that `l` contains at least three elements and an initial condition `T` is set to 1. After executing the function, the variable `g` holds the product of all elements in the list `l`, the list `l` retains at least three elements, and the initial condition `T` remains unchanged at 1.
