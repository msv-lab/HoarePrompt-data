Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `len(l)`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `len(l)`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `T` is `t-1`
   - `t` remains unchanged
   - `g` is `l[0] * l[1] // gcd(l[0], l[1])`
   - `i` is 2

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 3 (since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration).
   - The length of the list `l` does not change within the loop, so `len(l)` remains the same.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `T` remains `t-1` because it is not affected by the loop.
   - `t` remains unchanged.
   - `g` remains `l[0] * l[1] // gcd(l[0], l[1])` because it is not affected by the loop.
   - `i` is now 3.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`T` is `t-1`, `t` remains unchanged, `g` is `l[0] * l[1] // gcd(l[0], l[1])`, `i` is 3**
