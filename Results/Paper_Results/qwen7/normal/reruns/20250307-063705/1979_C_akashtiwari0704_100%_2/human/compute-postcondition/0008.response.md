Output State: **`g` is updated to the value of `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`, `i` is `i + 1`, `l` must be a list**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `g` to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`. This means `g` is now the product of its previous value and the element at index `i` in the list `l`, divided by their greatest common divisor (gcd). Additionally, `i` is incremented by 1. The list `l` remains unchanged.
