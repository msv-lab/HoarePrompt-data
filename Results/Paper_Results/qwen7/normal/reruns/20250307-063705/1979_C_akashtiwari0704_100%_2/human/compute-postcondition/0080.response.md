Output State: **`bets` must be greater than or equal to the total number of iterations, `i` is `bets`, `sumo` is increased by the sum of `prod // a[i]` for each `i` from 0 to `bets-1`, `a[i]` is equal to `prod // a[i]` for each `i` from 0 to `bets-1`, `sumo` is less than `prod`, `ans` is the string formed by concatenating `str(a[i]) + ' '` for each `i` from 0 to `bets-1`, `ans` is updated by adding `str(a[i]) + ' '` for the current `i`**.

This means that the string `ans` has been updated by appending `str(a[i]) + ' '` to its current value for the current iteration of `i`. All other variables remain in their previously described states.
