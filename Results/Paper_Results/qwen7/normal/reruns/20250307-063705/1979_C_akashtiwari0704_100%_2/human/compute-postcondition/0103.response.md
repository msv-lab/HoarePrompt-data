Output State: **`bets` is an input integer, `T` is `t-1`, `t` remains unchanged, `g` holds the computed result, `i` is equal to the length of list `l`, `l` must be a non-empty list, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of all integers in list `a`, `sumo` is 0.**

The code initializes `sumo` to 0. No other variables are affected, so their states remain as they were in the initial state.
