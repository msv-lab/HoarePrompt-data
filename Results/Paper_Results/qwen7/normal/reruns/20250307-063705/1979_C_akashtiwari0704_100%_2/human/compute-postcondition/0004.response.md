Output State: **`g` is updated to the value of `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`, `len(l)` must be at least 1.**

Explanation: The variable `g` is updated to the value of `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`. Here, `l[i]` refers to an element in the list `l` at index `i`, and `gcd(g, l[i])` calculates the greatest common divisor of `g` and `l[i]`. The length of the list `l` remains at least 1, as the precondition is still valid.
