Postcondition: **`bets` is an input integer, `i` is equal to the length of list `l` plus the number of iterations (`bets`), `sumo` is increased by the value of `a[i]` for each iteration, and `a[i]` is updated to `prod // a[i]` for each iteration. Additionally, `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`.**
