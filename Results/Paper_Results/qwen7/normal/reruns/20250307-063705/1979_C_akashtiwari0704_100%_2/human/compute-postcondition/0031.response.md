Postcondition: **`i` will be equal to `bets - 1`, `sumo` will be the sum of the integer values of each element in the list `a` after being updated by the loop, each element in the list `a` will be updated to `prod` // `a[i]` for each iteration `i`, `bets` will remain a positive integer, and the loop will have completed all its iterations, and `sumo` will be less than `prod`**
