Output State: **`i` is `bets`, `sumo` is the sum of the integer values of each element in the list `a` after being updated by the loop, each element in the list `a` is updated to `prod` // `a[i]` for each iteration `i`, `sumo` is less than `prod`, `ans` is the string containing the elements of `a` up to index `i` separated by spaces, `ans` is updated by adding the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space.**

This means that the string `ans` has been updated by appending the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space, while all other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
