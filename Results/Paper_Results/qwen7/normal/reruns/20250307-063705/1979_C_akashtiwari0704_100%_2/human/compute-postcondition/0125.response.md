Output State: **The final value of `ans` will be a string containing the concatenation of the string representations of all elements in the list `a` from index 0 to `bets-1`, separated by spaces.**

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `ans` will contain a single string where each element of the list `a` (from the start up to but not including the `bets`-th element) is converted to a string and concatenated together with spaces in between. The values of `i`, `bets`, `sumo`, `a`, and `prod` will remain unchanged from their final values after the last iteration of the loop, except that `i` will be equal to `bets`.
