State: **`T` is `t-1`, `t` remains unchanged, `g` is 1, `i` is 0, `l` must have at least 1 element** 

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop is defined as `for i in range(len(l)):`. This means the loop will iterate over the length of the list `l`.
2. The variable `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration until `i` is less than `len(l)`.
3. For the loop to execute at least once, `len(l)` must be at least 1, meaning `l` must contain at least one element.
4. The initial values of `T`, `t`, and `g` do not affect the loop's execution, so they remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `i` starts at 0 and `l` must have at least one element for the loop to execute.
