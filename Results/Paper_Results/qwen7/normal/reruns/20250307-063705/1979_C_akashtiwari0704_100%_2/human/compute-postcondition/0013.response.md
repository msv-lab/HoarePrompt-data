Functionality: **The function `lcm` accepts a list of integers `l` and returns the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all elements in the list after iterating through all its elements. Initially, `t` is assumed to be greater than 0 and `T` is set to 0. The function calculates the product of all elements in the list after applying integer division by their greatest common divisor with the current product, updating `g` accordingly. After processing all elements in the list, the function returns the final value of `g`, which represents the gcd of all elements in the list.**
