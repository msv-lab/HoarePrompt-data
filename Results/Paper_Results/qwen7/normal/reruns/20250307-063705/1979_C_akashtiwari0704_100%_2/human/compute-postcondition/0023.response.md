Output State: **`i` is 1; `sumo` is increased by the integer value of `a[i]`; `a[i]` is equal to `prod` // `a[i]`; `bets` must be a positive integer**

Explanation: The code `sumo += int(a[i])` adds the integer value of `a[i]` to `sumo`. Given that `i` is initially 1, `a[i]` is equal to `prod // a[i]`. The values of `bets` and the other variables remain unchanged.
