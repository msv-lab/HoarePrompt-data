Functionality: The function `lcm` accepts a list `l` as input and returns the product of all elements in the list `l`. It ensures that the list `l` contains at least 3 elements and that the variable `T` is 1. After executing the function, the variable `g` holds the product of all elements in the list `l`, the list `l` still contains at least 3 elements, and the variable `T` remains unchanged at 1.
