Output State: **`bets` is an input integer, `T` is 1, `g` is 1, `l` is an empty list, `i` is 0**.

Explanation: The code `bets = int(input())` assigns the value of the input to the variable `bets`. The variable `T` remains unchanged at 1. The variable `g` is reset to 1. The list `l` is not modified and remains an empty list. The variable `i` is also reset to 0.
