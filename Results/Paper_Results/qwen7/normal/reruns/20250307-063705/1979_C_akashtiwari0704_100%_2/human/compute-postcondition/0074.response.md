Based on the initial state provided:

- `bets` is greater than or equal to the total number of iterations.
- `i` is equal to `bets`.
- `sumo` is increased by the sum of `prod // a[i]` for each `i` from 0 to `bets-1`.
- `a[i]` is equal to `prod // a[i]` for each `i` from 0 to `bets-1`.
- `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`.

The `print(-1)` statement will simply print the integer `-1`.

Output: **-1**
