Output State: **`bets` is an input integer, `T` is `t-1`, `t` remains unchanged, `g` holds the computed result, `i` is equal to the length of list `l`, `l` must be a non-empty list.**

Explanation: The code `bets = int(input())` assigns the value of the input received from the user to the variable `bets`. This changes the value of `bets` to an integer based on the user's input. The other variables (`T`, `t`, `g`, `i`, and `l`) remain unchanged from their previous states as described in the initial state.
