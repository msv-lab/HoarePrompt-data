Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and the list `l`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for each index `i` in the range from `0` to `len(l) - 1`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `g` is updated to the value of `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`.
   - `len(l)` must be at least 1.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in the list `l`. Since `len(l)` must be at least 1, it means there is at least one element left in the list.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be `previous_i + 1`.
   - The length of the list `l` remains the same unless an element is removed, but since no removal is mentioned, `len(l)` remains the same.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `g` will be updated based on the current value of `i` (which is `previous_i + 1`).
   - `len(l)` must still be at least 1.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `g` is updated to the value of `g * l[previous_i + 1] // gcd(g, l[previous_i + 1])`.
- `len(l)` must be at least 1.

Since we don't know the exact value of `previous_i`, we can represent it as `i` for the next iteration.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`g` is updated to the value of `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`, `len(l)` must be at least 1**
