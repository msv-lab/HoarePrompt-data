Output State: **`bets` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `T` is 0, `g` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `bets = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (converted to an integer) to the variable `bets`. The values of `t`, `T`, and `g` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `t` is still greater than 0, `T` is still 0, and `g` is still 1.
