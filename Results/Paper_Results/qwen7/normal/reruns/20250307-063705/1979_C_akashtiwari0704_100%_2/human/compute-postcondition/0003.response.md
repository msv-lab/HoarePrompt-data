Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `len(l)`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is not initialized in the given state, so it will start from 0 (the default value for `range`).
   - `l` is not mentioned in the initial state, so its state needs to be considered.

3. **Analyze the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `i < len(l)`.
   - Since `i` starts at 0, the loop will execute if `len(l)` is at least 1.

4. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - We need to ensure that `len(l)` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.
   - The initial values of `t`, `T`, and `g` do not affect the loop's execution, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `len(l)` must be at least 1.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`len(l)` must be at least 1**
