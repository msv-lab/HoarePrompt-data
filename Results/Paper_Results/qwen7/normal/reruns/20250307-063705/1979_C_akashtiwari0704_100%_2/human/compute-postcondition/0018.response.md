Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the variable `bets`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of Variables**:
   - `bets` is an input integer.
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `T` is 0.
   - `g` is 1.
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces.
   - `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of all integers in list `a`.
   - `sumo` is 0.

3. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `bets`. Therefore, the initial value of `i` should be 0, and `bets` should be a positive integer.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - `i` should be 0 initially.
   - `bets` should be a positive integer.

5. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`t`, `T`, `g`, `a`, `prod`, `sumo`) do not affect the loop's execution condition directly and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start executing.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `bets`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `bets` must be a positive integer**
