Based on the initial state provided:

- After the loop completes, `i` will be equal to `bets - 1`.
- `sumo` will be the sum of the integer values of each element in the list `a` after being updated by the loop.
- Each element in the list `a` will be updated to `prod // a[i]` for each iteration `i`.
- `bets` must remain a positive integer.
- The loop will have completed all its iterations.
- The condition `sumo >= prod` is satisfied.

Given this information, the print statement `print(-1)` will simply output the integer `-1`.

Output: **-1**
