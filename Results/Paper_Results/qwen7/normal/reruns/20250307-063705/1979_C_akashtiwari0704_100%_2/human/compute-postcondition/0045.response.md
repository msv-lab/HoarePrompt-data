State: **`T` is 1, `g` is 1, `l` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop head contains the variables `i` and `len(l)`.
2. For the loop to execute, `len(l)` must be at least 1 because the `range` function generates numbers from 0 up to but not including `len(l)`.
3. Before the loop starts, `i` is initialized to 0.
4. The initial values of `T` and `g` do not affect the loop's execution condition.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `l` must have at least 1 element to ensure `len(l)` is at least 1.
- `i` is set to 0 at the beginning of the loop.
- `T` and `g` remain as given (1 and 1 respectively), as they do not influence the loop's execution.
