Output State: `T` is `t-1`, `t` remains unchanged, `g` is the product of all elements in list `l` divided by their greatest common divisor (gcd) when taken pairwise, `i` is equal to the length of list `l`, `l` must have at least one element.

This output state describes that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `T` remains as `t-1`, `t` stays unchanged, `g` contains the result of multiplying all elements in the list `l` together and then dividing by their pairwise gcds, `i` will be equal to the length of the list `l`, and the list `l` must contain at least one element.
