Output State: **`bets` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `T` is 0, `g` is 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces.**

The code creates a list `a` by splitting the input string using `split()` and converting each element to an integer using `int()`. The original values of `bets`, `t`, `T`, and `g` remain unchanged.
