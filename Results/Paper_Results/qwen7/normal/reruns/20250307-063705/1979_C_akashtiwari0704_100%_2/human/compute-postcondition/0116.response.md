Based on the initial state provided:

- `bets` is an input integer.
- `i` is equal to the length of list `l` plus the number of iterations (`bets`).
- `sumo` is increased by the value of `a[i]` for each iteration.
- `a[i]` is updated to `prod // a[i]` for each iteration.
- `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`.

The print statement is simply `print(-1)`. This means that regardless of the values of the other variables and objects, the only thing that will be printed is `-1`.

Output: **-1**
