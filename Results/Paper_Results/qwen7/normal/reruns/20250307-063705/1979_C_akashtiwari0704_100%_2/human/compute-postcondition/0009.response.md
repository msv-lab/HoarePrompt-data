Output State: `g` is the product of all elements in the list `l` after performing the greatest common divisor (GCD) operation with each element, `T` is equal to the length of the list `l`, and `t` remains greater than 0.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `g` will hold the product of all elements in the list `l` after applying the GCD operation with each element. The variable `T` will be set to the length of the list `l`, and `t` will still be greater than 0 as it was initially.
