The function `lcm` accepts a parameter `l`, which is a list of integers. For each element in the list, the function calculates the product of all elements in the list, then divides this product by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the current accumulated product and the next element in the list. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `l` of integers, and returns the product of all elements in `l`, with each product divided by the GCD of the current accumulated product and the next element in the list.**
