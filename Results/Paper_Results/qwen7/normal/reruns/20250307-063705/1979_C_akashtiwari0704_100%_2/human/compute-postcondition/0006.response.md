Output State: **`g` is updated to the value of `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`**.

In this case, the value of `g` is updated to the result of `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`. The length of list `l` must be at least 1, which remains unchanged. The output state explicitly mentions that `g` has been updated according to the given formula, and no other variables are affected.
