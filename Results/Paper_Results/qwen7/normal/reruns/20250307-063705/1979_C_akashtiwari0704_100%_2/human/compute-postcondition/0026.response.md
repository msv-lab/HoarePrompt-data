Output State: **`i` is 2; `sumo` is increased by the integer value of `a[2]`; `a[2]` is assigned the value of `prod` divided by `a[2]`.**

Explanation: The code updates `sumo` by adding the integer value of `a[i]`, which is `a[2]` since `i` is 2. It also updates `a[2]` to be the value of `prod` divided by its current value. The initial state of `i` remains unchanged.
