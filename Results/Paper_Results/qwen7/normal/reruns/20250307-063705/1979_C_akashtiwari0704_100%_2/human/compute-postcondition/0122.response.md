Output State: **`ans` is the original value of `ans` plus the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space, `i` is `i + 1`, `bets` must be the same as before**.

This means that the string `ans` has been updated by appending the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space to its current value, and the integer `i` has been incremented by 1. The variable `bets` remains unchanged from its initial state.
