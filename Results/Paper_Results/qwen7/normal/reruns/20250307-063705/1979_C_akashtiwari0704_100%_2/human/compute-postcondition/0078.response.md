Output State: **`bets` must be greater than or equal to the total number of iterations, `i` must be less than `bets`, `sumo` is increased by the sum of `prod // a[i]` for each `i` from 0 to `bets-1`, `a[i]` is equal to `prod // a[i]` for each `i` from 0 to `bets-1`, `sumo` is less than `prod`, `ans` is the string formed by concatenating `str(a[i]) + ' '` for each `i` from 0 to `bets-1`.**

Explanation: The code appends the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space to `ans`. Since `i` is less than `bets`, this operation will be performed for each `i` from 0 to `bets-1`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
