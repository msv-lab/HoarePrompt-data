Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `bets - 1`. `sumo` will be the final sum of the integer values of each element in the list `a` after being updated by the loop. Each element in the list `a` will be updated to `prod // a[i]` for each iteration `i`. `bets` will remain a positive integer, indicating the number of iterations the loop ran. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, the function will print `-1`. Otherwise, the function will print a string containing the elements of `a` up to the last index separated by spaces.

In more detail, after all iterations of the loop:
- `i` will be `bets - 1`.
- `sumo` will be the sum of `prod // a[i]` for each `i` from 0 to `bets-1`.
- Each element `a[i]` in the list `a` will be updated to `prod // a[i]` after the loop.
- If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, the function will print `-1` and then terminate.
- If `sumo` is less than `prod`, the function will print a string containing the elements of `a` up to the last index separated by spaces.
