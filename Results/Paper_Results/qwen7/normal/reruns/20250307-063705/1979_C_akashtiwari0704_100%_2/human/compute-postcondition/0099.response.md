Functionality: **The function `lcm` accepts a list `l` of integers and returns the product of all elements in `l`, with each product divided by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the current accumulated product and the next element in the list. After executing the function, the program state includes the variable `g` holding the computed result, `i` set to the length of list `l`, and all other variables (`T`, `t`) retaining their initial or updated values as described.**
