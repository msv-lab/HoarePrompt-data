Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `l`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over the range of the length of the list `l`. This means `i` will increment from 0 to `len(l) - 1`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `g` is updated to the value of `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`.
   - We need to determine the new state for `i` and ensure that the loop can continue.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was the last index processed.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will be `i + 1`.

5. **Ensure the Loop Can Continue**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < len(l)`.
   - Thus, `i` must be less than `len(l)` for the loop to execute again.

6. **State Adjustment**:
   - The state of `g` remains unchanged because it is only updated inside the loop body.
   - The state of `i` changes to `i + 1`.
   - The state of `l` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop.

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`g` is updated to the value of `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`, `i` is `i + 1`, `l` must be a list**
