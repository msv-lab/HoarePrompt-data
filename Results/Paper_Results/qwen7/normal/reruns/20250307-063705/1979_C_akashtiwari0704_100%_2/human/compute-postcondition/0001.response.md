State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and `T` is 0** 

Explanation:
- The loop variable `T` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.
- The loop condition `range(t)` will execute as long as `T < t`.
- For the loop to start executing, `t` must be a positive integer (greater than 0), because if `t` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute at all.
- Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `t` is greater than 0 and `T` is set to 0 at the beginning of the loop.
