You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: `T` is 1
    g = 1
    for i in range(len(l)):
        g = g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])
        
    #State: Output State: `T` is 1, `g` is the product of all elements in the list `l` (i.e., `l[0] * l[1] * ... * l[n-1]`), `l` is a list that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is `len(l)`, `g` is updated to the product of all elements in `l` divided by the greatest common divisor of the product of all elements in `l` and `l[i]`.
    #
    #This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `g` will hold the product of all elements in the list `l`, and `i` will be equal to the length of the list `l`. The value of `T` remains unchanged at 1.
    return g
        def lcm(l):
        #Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list `l` and returns the product of all elements in the list `l`, given that `l` contains at least 3 elements and `T` is 1.
    #The program returns the product of all elements in the list `l`, which is `g`, and `l` has at least 3 elements, and `T` remains 1.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the product of all elements in the list `l`, which is `g`, and `l` has at least 3 elements, and `T` remains 1.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
