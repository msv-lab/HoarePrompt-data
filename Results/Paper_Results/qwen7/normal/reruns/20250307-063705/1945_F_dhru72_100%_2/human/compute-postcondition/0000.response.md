Output State: **`T` is a type variable, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `v` is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ v_i ≤ 10^9, and `p` is a permutation of numbers from 1 to n. Additionally, the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.**

Explanation: The code snippet `T = TypeVar('T')` defines a type variable `T` but does not affect the values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `v`, `p`). Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions of these variables.
