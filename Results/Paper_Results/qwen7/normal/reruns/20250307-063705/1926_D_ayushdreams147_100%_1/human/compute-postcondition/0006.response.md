Output State: **`res` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers such that each integer in the list is less than \(2^{31}\), `num` is the first element of the list `a`, `num` is not in `count`, and `count[(1 << 31) - 1 ^ num]` is 1.**

Explanation: The variable `res` was initially set to 0. The code snippet `res += 1` increments the value of `res` by 1, making `res` equal to 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
