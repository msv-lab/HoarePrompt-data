Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variable `_` (a placeholder variable) and the variable `times`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `times` is greater than 0.

3. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since the loop depends on the value of `times`, we need to ensure that `times` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

4. **Consider Other Variables:**
   - The variables `t` and `check` are not part of the loop head and do not affect the loop's execution directly. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted.

Based on the above steps, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `times` being greater than 0.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`times` must be greater than 0**
