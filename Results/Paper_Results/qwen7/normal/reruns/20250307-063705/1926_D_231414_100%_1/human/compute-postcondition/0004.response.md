Output State: **`times` must be greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `data` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `data = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, and then converts each element to an integer using the `map` function. The resulting list of integers is assigned to the variable `data`. The precondition that `times` must be greater than 0 and `n` is an input integer remains unchanged.
