Output State: **`times` is an input integer, and `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.**

Explanation: The variable `times` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means it now holds an integer input from the user. The variable `t` remains unchanged and still holds a positive integer value within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
