Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `num` is an input integer, and the numbers on the whiteboard are 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7.**

Explanation: The code `num = input()` assigns the value entered by the user to the variable `num`. The values of `t` and the numbers on the whiteboard remain unchanged. Therefore, `t` stays within the range 1 to 5000, and the numbers on the whiteboard remain as 2n integers between 1 and \(10^7\).
