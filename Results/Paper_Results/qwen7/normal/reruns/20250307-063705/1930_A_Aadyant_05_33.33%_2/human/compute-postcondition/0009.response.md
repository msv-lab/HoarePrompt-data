Output State: **`numbers` is 0, `a` is an integer input from the user, `list2` is an empty list, `list1` contains the sorted words from the string `b`.**

Explanation: The code `list1.sort()` sorts the list `list1` in ascending order. The initial state of `list1` contains the split words from the string `b`. After sorting, `list1` will contain those words in alphabetical order. The values of `numbers`, `a`, and `list2` remain unchanged.
