Output State: **`numbers` is 0, `int(num)` is the upper limit of the loop; `list2` is an empty list; `list1` is an empty list.**

The code initializes `list1` as an empty list. The values of `numbers` and `list2` remain unchanged from their initial state. The upper limit of the loop is still represented by `int(num)`.
