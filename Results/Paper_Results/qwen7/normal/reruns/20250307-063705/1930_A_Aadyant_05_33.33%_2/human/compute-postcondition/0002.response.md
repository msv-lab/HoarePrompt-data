Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `numbers` which is used in the `range` function, and `int(num)` is the upper limit of the range.

2. **Determine the initial state of `numbers`**: Since the loop starts with `numbers = 0`, the loop will begin its first iteration when `numbers` is 0.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `numbers` is less than `int(num)`. Therefore, the loop will stop when `numbers` equals `int(num)`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - The variable `numbers` should be set to 0 initially.
   - The variable `int(num)` represents the upper limit of the loop, so it should remain unchanged from its initial state.
   - The other variables (`out`, `t`, and `num`) are not directly involved in the loop's execution and do not need to be adjusted.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

State: **`numbers` is 0, `int(num)` is the upper limit of the loop (which is `int(num)` from the initial state)**

So, the final answer is:

State: **`numbers` is 0, `int(num)` is the upper limit of the loop**
