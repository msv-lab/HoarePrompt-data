Output State: **`numbers` is 0, `int(num)` is the upper limit of the loop; `list2` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list named `list2`. The values of `numbers` and `int(num)` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `numbers` is still 0, `int(num)` is still the upper limit of the loop, and `list2` is an empty list.
