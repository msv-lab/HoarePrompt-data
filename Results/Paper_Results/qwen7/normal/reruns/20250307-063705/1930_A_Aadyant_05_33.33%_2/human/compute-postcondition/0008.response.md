Output State: **`numbers` is 0, `a` is an integer input from the user, `list2` is an empty list, `list1` contains the split words from the string `b`.**

Explanation: The code `list1 = b.split()` splits the string `b` into a list of words based on whitespace by default and assigns it to `list1`. The other variables (`numbers`, `a`, and `list2`) remain unchanged.
