Output State: **`out` is an empty list, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `num` is an input integer, and the numbers on the whiteboard are 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7.**

The code initializes an empty list `out`. No changes are made to the values of `t`, `num`, or the numbers on the whiteboard. Therefore, these variables retain their initial conditions.
