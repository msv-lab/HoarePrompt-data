Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `ci`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop condition is `i < ci + 1`.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `ci` is 1
   - `ops` is a list containing tuples `[(1, 0), (1, 1)]`

4. **Check the Loop Condition**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `ci` is 1. The loop condition `i < ci + 1` evaluates to `1 < 1 + 1`, which is `True`. Therefore, the loop can execute again.

5. **Update the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 2.
   - `ci` remains the same, so `ci` is still 1.

6. **Formulate the New State**: The new state should reflect these changes.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 2, `ci` is 1, `ops` is a list containing tuples `[(1, 0), (1, 1)]`**
