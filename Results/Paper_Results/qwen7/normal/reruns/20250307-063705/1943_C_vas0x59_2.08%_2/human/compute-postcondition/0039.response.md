Output State: **`d` is the return value of `func_1(0)`, `previous` is the second return value of `bfs(a)`, `u2vs` is a list of length 1 where the single element is a list containing [0], `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing -1, -1, and `n` is appended to `path_ba`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `n` to the list `path_ba`. Given that `path_ba` initially contains `-1` and `-1`, after appending `n`, `path_ba` will contain `-1`, `-1`, and `n`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
