Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `u` is the new value from input minus 4, `v` is the new value from input minus 2, `u2vs[v]` contains `[v-1, u]`**

Explanation: The value of `v` is decremented by 1. Initially, `v` was the new value from input minus 1, so now it is the new value from input minus 2. The other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
