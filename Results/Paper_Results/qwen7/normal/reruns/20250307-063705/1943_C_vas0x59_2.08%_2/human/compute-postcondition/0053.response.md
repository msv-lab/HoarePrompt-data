Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `ci`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `ci + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `ci` is 1
   - `ops` is a list containing one tuple `(c, 0)`

4. **Check if the loop can execute again**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `ci + 1`.
   - Currently, `i` is 0 and `ci` is 1, so `i < ci + 1` evaluates to `0 < 1 + 1` which is `True`.

5. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 1.
   - `ci` remains the same, so `ci` is still 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 1, `ci` is 1, `ops` is a list containing one tuple `(c, 0)`**
