Output State: `d` is the return value of `func_1(0)`, `previous` is the second return value of `bfs(a)`, `u2vs` is a list of length 1 where the single element is a list containing [0], `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing -1, -1, 0, and `n` is equal to -1.

Explanation: The loop continues to append the value of `n` to `path_ba` until `n` equals -1. Given that the loop has executed three times and `n` is already -1 after the third iteration, it will break out of the loop without any further changes to `path_ba` or `n`. Therefore, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `path_ba` will contain [-1, -1, 0] and `n` will be -1.
