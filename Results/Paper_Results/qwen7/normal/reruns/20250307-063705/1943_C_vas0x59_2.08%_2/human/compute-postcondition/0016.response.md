Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `u` is the new value from input minus 3, `v` is the new value from input minus 1, `u2vs[v]` contains `[v, u]`**

Explanation: The code `u -= 1` decrements the value of `u` by 1. Since `u` was initially `new value from input minus 2`, after the operation, `u` becomes `new value from input minus 3`. The values of `n`, `v`, and `u2vs[v]` remain unchanged according to the initial state.
