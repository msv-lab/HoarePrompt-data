Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `u` is the new value from input minus 4, `v` is the new value from input minus 2, `u2vs[u]` contains `[v-1, u, v]`**

Explanation: The code appends `v` to the list `u2vs[u]`. Initially, `u2vs[u]` contains `[v-1, u]`. After appending `v`, the list becomes `[v-1, u, v]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
