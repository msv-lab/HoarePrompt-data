Output State: **`d` is the return value of `func_1(0)`, `previous` is the second return value of `bfs(a)`, `n` is `-1`, `u2vs` is a list of length 1 where the single element is a list containing [0], `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing `-1` and `-1`.**

Explanation: The variable `n` is `-1`, and the line `path_ba.append(n)` appends the value of `n` to the list `path_ba`. Since `path_ba` initially contains `-1`, after appending `-1` again, it becomes a list containing `-1` and `-1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
