Output State: **`n` is now equal to its current value minus 2, `u` is decreased by 2, `v` is now equal to its current value minus 1, `u2vs[v]` contains `[v, u]`**

Explanation: 
- `n` is updated to its current value minus 2.
- `u` is decreased by 2.
- `v` is updated to its current value minus 1.
- `u2vs[v]` originally contained `[v]`. After executing `u2vs[v].append(u)`, `u2vs[v]` now contains both `v` and `u`.
