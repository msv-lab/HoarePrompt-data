Output State: `c2` is 1, `d` is the return value of `func_1(0)`, `previous` is the second return value of `bfs(a)`, `u2vs` is a list of length 1 where the single element is a list containing `[0]`, `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing `[-1, -1, 0]`, `c1` is 0, `i` is 4, `ops` is a list containing `[ (0, 1), (1, 2), (0, 1), (1, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4) ]`.

To explain, the loop runs from `i = 1` to `len(path_ba) - c1 - 1`, which is `i = 1` to `len([-1, -1, 0]) - 0 - 1 = 1` to `1`. Since `c1` starts at 0, the loop actually runs from `i = 1` to `1` with a step of 2, meaning it will iterate twice (for `i = 1` and `i = 3`). However, the problem statement mentions the loop executing 3 times, indicating an additional iteration might be considered based on the provided outputs. Given the pattern, the loop would continue until `i = 3` and then one more iteration would occur, making `i = 4`. The `ops` list will append the tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for each iteration of `i`, resulting in the final list as described.
