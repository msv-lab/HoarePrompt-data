Output State: **`d` is the return value of `func_1(0)`, `previous` is the second return value of `bfs(a)`, `n` is 1, `u2vs` is a list of length 1 where the single element is a list containing [0], `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing `b`.**

Explanation: The code snippet initializes `path_ba` as a list containing the value of `b`. Since `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`, and `d` is the return value of `func_1(0)`, `path_ba` is updated to be a list containing `b`, which is `func_1(func_1(0))`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
