Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `u2vs` is a list of length `n` where each element is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes `u2vs` as a list of `n` empty lists. Each element in `u2vs` is now an empty list, representing the neighbors of the corresponding vertex in the tree. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it was an input integer before the code execution.
