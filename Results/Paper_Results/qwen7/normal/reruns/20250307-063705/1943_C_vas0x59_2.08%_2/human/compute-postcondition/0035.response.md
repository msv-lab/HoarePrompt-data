Output State: **`d` is the return value of `func_1(0)`, `previous` is the second return value of `bfs(a)`, `n` is -1, `u2vs` is a list of length 1 where the single element is a list containing [0], `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing -1 and -1, `n` is `previous[-1]`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `n` to be the value at index `-1` of the `path_ba` list. Since `path_ba` contains `-1` and `-1`, the value at index `-1` is `-1`. Therefore, `n` is updated to `-1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
