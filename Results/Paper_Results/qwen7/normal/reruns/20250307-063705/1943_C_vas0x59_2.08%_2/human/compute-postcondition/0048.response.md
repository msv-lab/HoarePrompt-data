Postcondition: **`d` is the return value of `func_1(0)`, `previous` is the second return value of `bfs(a)`, `u2vs` is a list of length 1 where the single element is a list containing [0], `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing [-1, -1, 0], and `n` is equal to -1. The length of `path_ba` is odd.**
