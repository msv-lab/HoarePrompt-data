Output State: **`d` is the return value of `func_1(0)`, `previous` is the second return value of `bfs(a)`, `u2vs` is a list of length 1 where the single element is a list containing [0], `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing -1, -1, and `n` is equal to `previous[-1]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block that was being executed, but since no loop or conditional block is specified in the code snippet, it simply indicates that we are breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables remain unchanged after executing the `break` statement.
