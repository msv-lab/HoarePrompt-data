Output State: **`d` is the return value of `func_1(0)`, `previous` is the second return value of `bfs(a)`, `u2vs` is a list of length 1 where the single element is a list containing [0], `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing -1, -1, and `n` is equal to `previous[-1]`**.

Explanation: The code `n = previous[path_ba[-1]]` updates the value of `n` to be the element in the `previous` list at the index given by `path_ba[-1]`. Since `path_ba` is a list containing `-1, -1`, the last element `path_ba[-1]` is `-1`. Therefore, `n` is set to `previous[-1]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
