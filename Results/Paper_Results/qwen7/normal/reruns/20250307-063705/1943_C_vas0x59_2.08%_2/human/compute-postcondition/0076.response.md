Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `d` is the return value of `func_1(0)`.
   - `previous` is the second return value of `bfs(a)`.
   - `u2vs` is a list of length 1 where the single element is a list containing `[0]`.
   - `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`.
   - `path_ba` is a list containing `[-1, -1, 0]`.
   - `c1` is 0.
   - `c2` is 1.
   - `i` is 4.
   - `ops` is a list containing `[ (0, 1), (1, 2), (0, 1), (1, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4) ]`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(*map(lambda x: f'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}', ops), sep='\n')
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The `map` function applies the lambda function to each element in the `ops` list.
   - The lambda function takes a tuple `x` from `ops` and returns a formatted string `f'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}'`.
   - `x[0]` and `x[1]` are the elements of the tuple, and `x[0] + 1` increments the first element by 1.
   - The `*` operator unpacks the map object into positional arguments for the `print` function.
   - The `sep='\n'` argument ensures that each output line is separated by a newline.

4. **Calculating the Output:**
   - For each tuple in `ops`, the lambda function will generate a string.
   - `ops` contains the tuples: `(0, 1), (1, 2), (0, 1), (1, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4)`.
   - Applying the lambda function to each tuple:
     - `(0, 1)` becomes `'1 1'`
     - `(1, 2)` becomes `'2 2'`
     - `(0, 1)` becomes `'1 1'`
     - `(1, 2)` becomes `'2 2'`
     - `(0, 3)` becomes `'1 3'`
     - `(1, 3)` becomes `'2 3'`
     - `(0, 4)` becomes `'1 4'`
     - `(1, 4)` becomes `'2 4'`
   - These strings are then printed with each on a new line.

5. **Final Output:**
   ```
   1 1
   2 2
   1 1
   2 2
   1 3
   2 3
   1 4
   2 4
   ```

Output: **1 1\n2 2\n1 1\n2 2\n1 3\n2 3\n1 4\n2 4**
