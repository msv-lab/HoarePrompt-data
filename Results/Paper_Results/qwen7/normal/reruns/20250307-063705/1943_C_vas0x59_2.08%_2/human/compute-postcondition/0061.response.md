Output State: **`c2` is 1, `d` is the return value of `func_1(0)`, `previous` is the second return value of `bfs(a)`, `u2vs` is a list of length 1 where the single element is a list containing [0], `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing [-1, -1, 0], and `n` is equal to -1.**

Explanation: The code calculates `c2` as the length of `path_ba` divided by 2. Given that `path_ba` contains 3 elements, its length is 3. Dividing 3 by 2 results in 1.5, but since `len(path_ba)` returns an integer, `c2` is set to 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
