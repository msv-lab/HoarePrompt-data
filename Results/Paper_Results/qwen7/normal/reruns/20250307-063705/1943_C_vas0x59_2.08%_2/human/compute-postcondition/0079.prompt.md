You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^3. u2vs is a list of length n where each element is a list of integers representing the neighbors of the corresponding vertex in the tree.
def func_2():
    n = int(input())
    u2vs = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for _ in range(n - 1):
        u, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        
        u -= 1
        
        v -= 1
        
        u2vs[u].append(v)
        
        u2vs[v].append(u)
        
    #State: The loop will have executed `n-1` times. The variable `n` will be 1 (since it starts as an input integer and decreases by 1 each iteration until it reaches 1). The list `u2vs` will be a list of length 1, where the single element is a list containing all integers from 0 to n-2 (i.e., from 0 to `n-2`). Each integer `i` (where `0 <= i < n-1`) will appear exactly twice in the `u2vs` list, once as an element in the sublist corresponding to `i` and once as an element in the sublist corresponding to another integer `j` such that `i` and `j` were input as `u` and `v` in some iteration.
    d, _ = bfs(0)
    a = func_1(d)
    d, previous = bfs(a)
    b = func_1(d)
    path_ba = [b]
    while True:
        n = previous[path_ba[-1]]
        
        if n == -1:
            break
        
        path_ba.append(n)
        
    #State: Output State: `d` is the return value of `func_1(0)`, `previous` is the second return value of `bfs(a)`, `u2vs` is a list of length 1 where the single element is a list containing [0], `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing -1, -1, 0, and `n` is equal to -1.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop continues to append the value of `n` to `path_ba` until `n` equals -1. Given that the loop has executed three times and `n` is already -1 after the third iteration, it will break out of the loop without any further changes to `path_ba` or `n`. Therefore, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `path_ba` will contain [-1, -1, 0] and `n` will be -1.
    ops = []
    if (len(path_ba) % 2 == 1) :
        ci = len(path_ba) // 2
        c = path_ba[ci]
        for i in range(ci + 1):
            ops.append((c, i))
            
        #State: Output State: `i` is 2, `ci` is 1, `ops` is a list containing tuples `[(1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2)]`.
        #
        #Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = ci`, where `ci` is initially 1. Since `ci` does not change within the loop, the loop will run exactly 2 times (from 0 to 1). Each iteration appends a tuple `(c, i)` to the list `ops`. Given that `c` is -1, the list `ops` will contain the tuples `(-1, 0)`, `(-1, 1)`, and `(-1, 2)` after all iterations. However, based on the provided output states after each iteration, it seems `c` remains as 1 throughout the loop. Therefore, the final list `ops` will contain the tuples `(1, 0)`, `(1, 1)`, and `(1, 2)`. The other variables (`d`, `previous`, `u2vs`, `b`, `path_ba`, and `c`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
    else :
        c2 = len(path_ba) // 2
        c1 = c2 - 1
        for i in range(1, len(path_ba) - c1, 2):
            ops.append((c1, i))
            
            ops.append((c2, i))
            
        #State: Output State: `c2` is 1, `d` is the return value of `func_1(0)`, `previous` is the second return value of `bfs(a)`, `u2vs` is a list of length 1 where the single element is a list containing `[0]`, `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing `[-1, -1, 0]`, `c1` is 0, `i` is 4, `ops` is a list containing `[ (0, 1), (1, 2), (0, 1), (1, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4) ]`.
        #
        #Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `len(path_ba) - c1 - 1`, which is `i = 1` to `len([-1, -1, 0]) - 0 - 1 = 1` to `1`. Since `c1` starts at 0, the loop effectively runs from `i = 1` to `1`, but due to the step size of 2, it will run for `i = 1, 3`. However, the problem statement indicates the loop executed 3 times, so we infer that `c1` was incremented within the loop or there's an implicit condition that allows the loop to run one extra iteration. Given the final state provided, `i` should be 4 after all iterations, and `ops` should contain 8 tuples as described.
    #State: `d` is the return value of `func_1(0)`, `previous` is the second return value of `bfs(a)`, `u2vs` is a list of length 1 where the single element is a list containing `[0]`, `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing `[-1, -1, 0]`, `c1` is 0, `c2` is 1, `i` is 4, and `ops` is a list containing `[ (0, 1), (1, 2), (0, 1), (1, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4) ]
    print(len(ops))
    #This is printed: 8
    print(*map(lambda x: f'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}', ops), sep='\n')
    #This is printed: ```
    #   1 1
    #   2 2
    #   1 1
    #   2 2
    #   1 3
    #   2 3
    #   1 4
    #   2 4
    #   ```
    #
    #Output:
    return None
    #The program returns None
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and returns None.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns None
