Output State: **`d` is the return value of `func_1(0)`, `previous` is the second return value of `bfs(a)`, `u2vs` is a list of length 1 where the single element is a list containing [0], `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing -1, -1, 0, and `n` is equal to -1.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `n` (which is -1) to the list `path_ba`. Since `n` is -1, the list `path_ba` changes from [-1, -1] to [-1, -1, 0]. All other variables remain unchanged.
