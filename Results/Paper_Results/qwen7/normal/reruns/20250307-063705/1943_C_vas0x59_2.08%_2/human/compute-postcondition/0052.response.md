Output State: **`i` is 0; `ci` is 1; `ops` is a list containing one tuple `(c, 0)`**.

In this output state, the variable `i` retains its initial value of 0, and `ci` also remains unchanged at 1. The variable `ops` is a list that now contains a single tuple, which is the result of appending `(c, i)` to it. Since `i` is 0, the tuple added to `ops` is `(c, 0)`.
