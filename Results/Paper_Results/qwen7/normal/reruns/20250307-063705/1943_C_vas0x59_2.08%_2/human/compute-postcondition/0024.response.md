Output State: **`d` is the return value of `func_1(0)`, `previous` is the second return value of `bfs(a)`, `n` is 1, `u2vs` is a list of length 1 where the single element is a list containing [0], `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`**.

Explanation: The code `b = func_1(d)` assigns the return value of `func_1(d)` to the variable `b`. Since `d` is the return value of `bfs(a)`, `b` will be the return value of `func_1(bfs(a))`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
