Output State: **`c2` is 1, `d` is the return value of `func_1(0)`, `previous` is the second return value of `bfs(a)`, `u2vs` is a list of length 1 where the single element is a list containing `[0]`, `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing `[-1, -1, 0]`, `c1` is 0, `i` is 2, `ops` is a list containing four tuples `[ (0, 1), (1, 2), (0, 1), (1, 2) ]**

Explanation: The code `ops.append((c2, i))` appends a tuple `(c2, i)` to the list `ops`. Given that `c2` is 1 and `i` is 1 initially, after the append operation, the list `ops` will contain the tuples `(0, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, `(0, 1)`, and `(1, 2)`. Therefore, `i` is incremented by 1, making it 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
