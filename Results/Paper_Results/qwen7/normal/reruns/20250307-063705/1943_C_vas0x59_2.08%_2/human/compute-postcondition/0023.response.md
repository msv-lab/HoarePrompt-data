Output State: **`d` is the return value of `bfs(a)`, `previous` is the second return value of `bfs(a)`, `n` is 1, `u2vs` is a list of length 1, where the single element is a list containing [0], `d` is 0, `a` is the return value of `func_1(0)`**.

Explanation: The code `d, previous = bfs(a)` calls the function `bfs` with the argument `a`. The function `a` is the return value of `func_1(0)`. The `bfs` function returns two values, which are assigned to `d` and `previous` respectively. The initial values of `n`, `u2vs`, and `d` remain unchanged.
