Output State: **`c2` is 1, `d` is the return value of `func_1(0)`, `previous` is the second return value of `bfs(a)`, `u2vs` is a list of length 1 where the single element is a list containing [0], `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing [-1, -1, 0], and `c1` is 0.**

Explanation: The variable `c1` is assigned the value of `c2 - 1`. Given that `c2` is 1, `c1` becomes 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
