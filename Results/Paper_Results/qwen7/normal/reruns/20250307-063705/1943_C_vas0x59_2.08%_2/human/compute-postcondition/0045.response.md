Output State: `d` is the return value of `func_1(0)`, `previous` is the second return value of `bfs(a)`, `u2vs` is a list of length 1 where the single element is a list containing [0], `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing -1, -1, 0, and `n` is equal to -1.

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `n` is not equal to -1. From the given information, we can see that after 3 iterations, `n` becomes -1, which causes the loop to break. Therefore, the loop will execute exactly 3 times. After these 3 iterations, `path_ba` will contain the sequence of nodes from the starting point (0) to the end point (-1), which means `path_ba` will be [-1, -1, 0]. The values of `d`, `previous`, `u2vs`, `b`, and `n` remain unchanged outside of the loop.
