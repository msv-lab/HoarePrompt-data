Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `u2vs` is a list of length `n` where each element is an empty list, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `u, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `u` and `v`. It does not modify the existing values of `n` or the list `u2vs`. Therefore, the conditions and values of `n` and `u2vs` remain unchanged, while `u` and `v` are assigned the input integers.
