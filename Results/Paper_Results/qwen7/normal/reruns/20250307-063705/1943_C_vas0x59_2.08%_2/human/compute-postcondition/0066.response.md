Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and the range parameters. The range parameters are implicitly defined by the loop itself, but the key variable here is `i`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `c2` is 1
   - `d` is the return value of `func_1(0)`
   - `previous` is the second return value of `bfs(a)`
   - `u2vs` is a list of length 1 where the single element is a list containing `[0]`
   - `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`
   - `path_ba` is a list containing `[-1, -1, 0]`
   - `c1` is 0
   - `i` is 2
   - `ops` is a list containing two tuples `[ (0, 1), (1, 2) ]`

3. **Loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `len(path_ba) - c1 - 1` with a step of 2. Given `path_ba` is `[-1, -1, 0]` and `c1` is 0, the range becomes `range(1, 2, 2)`.

4. **Current value of `i`**: `i` is currently 2.

5. **Next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 2 within the specified range. Since the range is `range(1, 2, 2)`, the only valid value for `i` is 1 (the first iteration) and then it would go out of the range if `i` were to be incremented further.

6. **Adjusting the state**: To allow the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be set to 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`c2` is 1, `d` is the return value of `func_1(0)`, `previous` is the second return value of `bfs(a)`, `u2vs` is a list of length 1 where the single element is a list containing `[0]`, `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing `[-1, -1, 0]`, `c1` is 0, `i` is 1, `ops` is a list containing two tuples `[ (0, 1), (1, 2) ]**.
