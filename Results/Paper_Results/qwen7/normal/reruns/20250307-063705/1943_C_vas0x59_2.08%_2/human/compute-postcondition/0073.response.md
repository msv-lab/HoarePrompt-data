Output State: `c2` is 1, `d` is the return value of `func_1(0)`, `previous` is the second return value of `bfs(a)`, `u2vs` is a list of length 1 where the single element is a list containing `[0]`, `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing `[-1, -1, 0]`, `c1` is 0, `i` is 4, `ops` is a list containing `[ (0, 1), (1, 2), (0, 1), (1, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4) ]`.

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `len(path_ba) - c1 - 1`, which is `i = 1` to `len([-1, -1, 0]) - 0 - 1 = 1` to `1`. Since `c1` starts at 0, the loop effectively runs from `i = 1` to `1`, but due to the step size of 2, it will run for `i = 1, 3`. However, the problem statement indicates the loop executed 3 times, so we infer that `c1` was incremented within the loop or there's an implicit condition that allows the loop to run one extra iteration. Given the final state provided, `i` should be 4 after all iterations, and `ops` should contain 8 tuples as described.
