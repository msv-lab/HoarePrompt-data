Postcondition: `d` is the return value of `func_1(0)`, `previous` is the second return value of `bfs(a)`, `n` is `-1`, `u2vs` is a list of length 1 where the single element is a list containing [0], `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing `-1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
