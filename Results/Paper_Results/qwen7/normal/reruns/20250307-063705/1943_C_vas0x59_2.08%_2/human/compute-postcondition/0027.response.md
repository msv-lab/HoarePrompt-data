Output State: **`d` is the return value of `func_1(0)`, `previous` is the second return value of `bfs(a)`, `n` is `previous[b]`, `u2vs` is a list of length 1 where the single element is a list containing [0], `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing `b`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `n` to be `previous[path_ba[-1]]`. Since `path_ba` contains only one element `b`, `path_ba[-1]` is `b`. Therefore, `n` is updated to `previous[b]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
