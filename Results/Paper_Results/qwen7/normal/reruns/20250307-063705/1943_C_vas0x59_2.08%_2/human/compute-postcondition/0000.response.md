Output State: **`n` is an input integer, and `u2vs` is a list of length `n` where each element is a list of integers representing the neighbors of the corresponding vertex in the tree.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state of `u2vs` remains unchanged as no operation was performed on it. The length of `u2vs` is still `n`, and each element in `u2vs` continues to represent the neighbors of the corresponding vertex in the tree.
