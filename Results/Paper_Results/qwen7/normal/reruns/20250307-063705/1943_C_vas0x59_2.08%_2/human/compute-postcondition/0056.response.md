Output State: **`i` is 2, `ci` is 1, `ops` is a list containing tuples `[(1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2)]`**

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(c, i)` to the list `ops`. Given the initial state where `c` is `ci` (which is 1) and `i` is 2, the new tuple added to `ops` is `(1, 2)`. Therefore, the updated list `ops` contains the tuples `[(1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2)]`. The values of `i` and `ci` remain unchanged.
