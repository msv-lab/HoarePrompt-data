Postcondition: **`d` is the return value of `func_1(0)`, `previous` is the second return value of `bfs(a)`, `u2vs` is a list of length 1 where the single element is a list containing `[0]`, `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing `[-1, -1, 0]`, `c1` is 0, `c2` is 1, `i` is 4, and `ops` is a list containing `[ (0, 1), (1, 2), (0, 1), (1, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4) ]**.

Explanation: 
- If `len(path_ba) % 2 == 1`, the loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = ci` (where `ci` is initially 1), appending tuples to `ops` until `i` reaches 2. After the loop, `ops` will contain the tuples `(1, 0)`, `(1, 1)`, and `(1, 2)`, and the other variables (`d`, `previous`, `u2vs`, `b`, `path_ba`, and `c`) remain unchanged.
- If `len(path_ba) % 2 != 1`, the loop runs from `i = 1` to `len(path_ba) - c1 - 1` (which is `i = 1` to `1`), appending tuples to `ops` until `i` reaches 4. After the loop, `ops` will contain the tuples `(0, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, `(0, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, `(0, 3)`, `(1, 3)`, `(0, 4)`, and `(1, 4)`, and `c1` is incremented to 1. The other variables (`d`, `previous`, `u2vs`, `b`, `path_ba`, and `c2`) retain their initial values.
