Output State: **`d` is the return value of `func_1(0)`, `previous` is the second return value of `bfs(a)`, `u2vs` is a list of length 1 where the single element is a list containing [0], `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing [-1, -1, 0], and `n` is equal to -1.**

Explanation: The given code initializes an empty list `ops`. This operation does not affect any of the existing variables. Therefore, the values of `d`, `previous`, `u2vs`, `b`, `path_ba`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states. Specifically, `path_ba` is updated to contain `[-1, -1, 0]` after the loop, and `n` remains `-1`.
