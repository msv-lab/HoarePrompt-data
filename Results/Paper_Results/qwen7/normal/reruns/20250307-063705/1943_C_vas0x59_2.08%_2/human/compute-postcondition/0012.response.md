Output State: **`n` is now equal to its current value minus 2, `u` is decreased by 2, `v` is now equal to its current value minus 1, `u2vs[u]` contains `[v]`**.

Explanation: 
- The initial state shows that `n` is equal to its current value minus 1, `u` is decreased by 1, `v` is equal to its current value minus 1, and `u2vs` remains the same.
- The code `u2vs[u].append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the list at index `u` in the dictionary `u2vs`.
- Since `u` was already decreased by 1 in the initial state, after this line of code, `u` is further decreased by 1, making it equal to its current value minus 2.
- Similarly, since `v` was already decreased by 1 in the initial state, after appending `v` to `u2vs[u]`, `v` is further decreased by 1, making it equal to its current value minus 1.
- Therefore, the updated state includes `n` being its current value minus 2, `u` being its current value minus 2, `v` being its current value minus 2, and `u2vs[u]` containing `[v]`.
