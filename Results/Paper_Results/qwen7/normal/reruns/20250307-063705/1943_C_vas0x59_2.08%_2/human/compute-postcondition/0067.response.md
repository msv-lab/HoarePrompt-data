Output State: **`c2` is 1, `d` is the return value of `func_1(0)`, `previous` is the second return value of `bfs(a)`, `u2vs` is a list of length 1 where the single element is a list containing `[0]`, `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing `[-1, -1, 0]`, `c1` is 0, `i` is 1, `ops` is a list containing three tuples `[ (0, 1), (1, 2), (0, 1) ]**.

Explanation: The line `ops.append((c1, i))` appends a tuple `(c1, i)` to the list `ops`. Given that `c1` is 0 and `i` is 1, the tuple `(0, 1)` is appended to `ops`. Since `ops` originally contained `[ (0, 1), (1, 2) ]`, after appending `(0, 1)`, it now contains `[ (0, 1), (1, 2), (0, 1) ]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
