Output State: **`c2` is 1, `d` is the return value of `func_1(0)`, `previous` is the second return value of `bfs(a)`, `u2vs` is a list of length 1 where the single element is a list containing [0], `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing [-1, -1, 0], and `c1` is 0, `i` is 2, `ops` is a list containing two tuples [(0, 1), (1, 2)].**

Explanation: The line `ops.append((c2, i))` appends a new tuple `(c2, i)` to the list `ops`. Given that `c2` is 1 and `i` is 1 initially, after appending, `i` becomes 2. The list `ops` now contains two tuples: `(0, 1)` from the initial state and `(1, 2)` from the new append operation. All other variables remain unchanged.
