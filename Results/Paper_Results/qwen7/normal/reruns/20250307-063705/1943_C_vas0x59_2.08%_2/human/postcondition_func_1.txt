The function reads an integer `n` and a tree structure defined by `n-1` edges. It then performs a breadth-first search (BFS) twice to find paths and distances, constructs a path from a node `a` to a node `b`, and finally generates and prints a sequence of operations based on the constructed path. The function returns `None`.
