Output State: **`c2` is 1, `d` is the return value of `func_1(0)`, `previous` is the second return value of `bfs(a)`, `u2vs` is a list of length 1 where the single element is a list containing `[0]`, `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing `[-1, -1, 0]`, `c1` is 0, `i` is 3, `ops` is a list containing `[ (0, 1), (1, 2), (0, 1), (1, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3) ]**.

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(c2, i)` to the list `ops`. Given that `c2` is 1 and `i` is 3, the new tuple `(1, 3)` is added to the existing list `ops`. The list `ops` originally contains `[ (0, 1), (1, 2), (0, 1), (1, 2), (0, 3) ]`, and after appending `(1, 3)`, it becomes `[ (0, 1), (1, 2), (0, 1), (1, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3) ]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
