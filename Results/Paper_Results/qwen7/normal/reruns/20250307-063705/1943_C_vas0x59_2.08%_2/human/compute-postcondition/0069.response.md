Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is defined by the `for i in range(1, len(path_ba) - c1, 2)` statement. The variables involved in this loop head are `i`.

2. **Determine the current state of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for values of `i` starting from 1 up to but not including `len(path_ba) - c1` in steps of 2. 

4. **Calculate the upper bound of the loop**: 
   - `len(path_ba)` is the length of the list `path_ba`, which contains `[-1, -1, 0]`. Therefore, `len(path_ba)` is 3.
   - `c1` is 0.
   - So, the upper bound of the loop is `len(path_ba) - c1 = 3 - 0 = 3`.

5. **Check if the loop can continue**: The loop increments `i` by 2 each time. Starting from 1, the possible values of `i` are 1, 3. Since `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, the next value `i` can take is 3.

6. **Adjust the state**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be set to 3. All other variables remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`c2` is 1, `d` is the return value of `func_1(0)`, `previous` is the second return value of `bfs(a)`, `u2vs` is a list of length 1 where the single element is a list containing `[0]`, `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing `[-1, -1, 0]`, `c1` is 0, `i` is 3, `ops` is a list containing four tuples `[ (0, 1), (1, 2), (0, 1), (1, 2) ]**
