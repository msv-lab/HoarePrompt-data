Output State: **`c2` is 1, `d` is the return value of `func_1(0)`, `previous` is the second return value of `bfs(a)`, `u2vs` is a list of length 1 where the single element is a list containing [0], `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing [-1, -1, 0], and `c1` is 0, `i` is 1, `ops` is a list containing one tuple (0, 1)**.

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(c1, i)` to the list `ops`. Given the initial state, `c1` is 0 and `i` is 1, so the tuple `(0, 1)` is added to `ops`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
