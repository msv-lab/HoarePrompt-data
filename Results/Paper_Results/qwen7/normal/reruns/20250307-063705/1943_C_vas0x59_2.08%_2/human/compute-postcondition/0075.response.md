Based on the initial state provided:

- `d` is the return value of `func_1(0)`.
- `previous` is the second return value of `bfs(a)`.
- `u2vs` is a list of length 1 where the single element is a list containing `[0]`.
- `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`.
- `path_ba` is a list containing `[-1, -1, 0]`.
- `c1` is 0.
- `c2` is 1.
- `i` is 4.
- `ops` is a list containing `[ (0, 1), (1, 2), (0, 1), (1, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4) ]`.

The print statement is `print(len(ops))`. 

To determine what will be printed, we need to find the length of the list `ops`. The list `ops` contains 8 tuples: `(0, 1), (1, 2), (0, 1), (1, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4)`.

Therefore, the length of `ops` is 8.

Output: **8**
