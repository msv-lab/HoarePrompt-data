Since the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, it will always execute at least once regardless of the initial state of the variables. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary to make the loop execute the first time.

State: **`d` is the return value of `func_1(0)`, `previous` is the second return value of `bfs(a)`, `n` is 1, `u2vs` is a list of length 1 where the single element is a list containing [0], `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing `b`**
