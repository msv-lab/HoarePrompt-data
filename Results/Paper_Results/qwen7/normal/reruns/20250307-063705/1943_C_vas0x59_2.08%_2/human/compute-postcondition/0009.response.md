Output State: **`n` is one less than its current value, `u2vs` remains the same, `u` and `v` are updated to the values entered by the user as a tuple.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the user input and assigns them to the variables `u` and `v` as a tuple. The value of `n` is one less than its current value as per the initial state, and `u2vs` remains unchanged since it is not affected by the code. Therefore, `n` is updated to be one less than its current value, `u2vs` stays the same, and `u` and `v` are set to the values entered by the user.
