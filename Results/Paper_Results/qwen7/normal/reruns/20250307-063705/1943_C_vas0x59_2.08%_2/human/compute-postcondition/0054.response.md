Output State: **`i` is 1, `ci` is 1, `ops` is a list containing tuples `[(1, 0), (1, 1)]**.

Explanation: The code `ops.append((c, i))` appends a new tuple `(c, i)` to the list `ops`. Given that `c` is `1` and `i` is `1` from the initial state, the new tuple added to `ops` is `(1, 1)`. Therefore, the list `ops` now contains two tuples: `(1, 0)` from the initial state and `(1, 1)` from the appended operation.
