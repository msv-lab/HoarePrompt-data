Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists, `u2vs[u]` is now a list containing `u-1` and `v`, `u2vs[v]` is now a list containing `u` and `v-2`, `u` is an input integer decreased by 1, `v` is an input integer decreased by 2**.

Explanation: The code `v -= 1` decrements the value of `v` by 1. Since `v` was initially an input integer decreased by 1, after decrementing, `v` becomes an input integer decreased by 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
