Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(ci + 1)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `ci`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ci` is 0
   - `i` is 1
   - `ops` is a list containing tuples `[(0, 1), (0, 1)]`

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < ci + 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `ci` is 0.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `ci + 1`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1 and `ci` is 0, the condition `i < ci + 1` is not satisfied. Therefore, the loop does not continue.
   - However, if we assume the loop was supposed to continue, `i` would need to be incremented by 1 from its current value of 1. So, `i` would become 2.
   - `ci` remains unchanged at 0.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `ci` remains 0.
   - `i` becomes 2.
   - `ops` is not affected by the loop head and remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`ci` is 0, `i` is 2, `ops` is a list containing tuples `[(0, 1), (0, 1)]**
