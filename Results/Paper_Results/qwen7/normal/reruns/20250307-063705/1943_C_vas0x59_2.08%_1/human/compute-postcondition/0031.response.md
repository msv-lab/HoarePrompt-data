Output State: **`a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `d` is the result of BFS starting from node `0`, `previous` is the second value returned by `bfs(a)`, `path_ba` is a list containing `b`, the current value of `n` is `-1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block immediately preceding the `break` statement, it simply indicates that the execution would break out of the most internal loop or if statement it was inside. The values of the variables `a`, `b`, `d`, `previous`, `path_ba`, and `n` remain unchanged.
