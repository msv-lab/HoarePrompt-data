You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^3. u2vs is a list of length n where each element is a list of integers representing the neighbors of the corresponding vertex in the tree.
def func_2():
    n = int(input())
    u2vs = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for _ in range(n - 1):
        u, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        
        u -= 1
        
        v -= 1
        
        u2vs[u].append(v)
        
        u2vs[v].append(u)
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `n` must be at least 2, `u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists initially, but after the loop, each list `u2vs[i]` (where `0 ≤ i < n`) will contain all integers from `0` to `n-1` except `i`. This means that for each index `i`, the list `u2vs[i]` will have all other indices as its elements.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop completes, each list in `u2vs` will contain all indices from `0` to `n-1` except for the index of the list itself.
    d, _ = bfs(0)
    a = func_1(d)
    d, previous = bfs(a)
    b = func_1(d)
    path_ba = [b]
    while True:
        n = previous[path_ba[-1]]
        
        if n == -1:
            break
        
        path_ba.append(n)
        
    #State: Output State: `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `d` is the result of BFS starting from node `0`, `previous` is the second value returned by `bfs(a)`, `path_ba` is a list containing nodes traversed until `n` equals `-1`.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop continues to append the value of `n` (which is determined by `previous[path_ba[-1]]`) to `path_ba` until `n` equals `-1`. Once this condition is met, the loop breaks. Therefore, `path_ba` will contain all the nodes traversed from the start node (determined by `a`) until the loop terminates. The other variables (`a`, `b`, `d`, and `previous`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
    ops = []
    if (len(path_ba) % 2 == 1) :
        ci = len(path_ba) // 2
        c = path_ba[ci]
        for i in range(ci + 1):
            ops.append((c, i))
            
        #State: Output State: `ci` is 0, `i` is 3, `ops` is a list containing tuples `[(0, 1), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3)]`.
        #
        #Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = ci + 1`, where `ci` starts at 0. After each iteration, `i` increases by 1. Given that the loop has executed 3 times, `i` will be 3 when the loop finishes. Therefore, `ci` remains 0 (since it is not modified within the loop), `i` becomes 3, and `ops` accumulates tuples `(c, i)` for each iteration, resulting in `[(0, 1), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3)]`.
    else :
        c2 = len(path_ba) // 2
        c1 = c2 - 1
        for i in range(1, len(path_ba) - c1, 2):
            ops.append((c1, i))
            
            ops.append((c2, i))
            
        #State: Output State: `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `d` is the result of BFS starting from node `0`, `previous` is the second value returned by `bfs(a)`, `path_ba` is a list containing nodes traversed until `n` equals `-1` that must have more than 0 elements, `ops` is a list containing twelve tuples, `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`, and `c1` is `c2 - 1`.
        #
        #To understand this final state, let's break it down:
        #- The loop runs as long as `len(path_ba) - c1 > 0`. Given that `c1 = c2 - 1` and `c2 = len(path_ba) / 2`, we can see that the loop will run until `len(path_ba) / 2 > 0`, which is always true as long as `path_ba` has more than 0 elements.
        #- Each iteration of the loop appends two tuples to `ops`: `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)`, where `i` starts from the smallest odd number less than `len(path_ba) / 2 + 1` and increases by 2 in each subsequent iteration.
        #- After the loop completes, if `path_ba` has `n` elements (where `n` is even), the loop will append a total of `n/2` iterations, resulting in appending `n` tuples to `ops`.
        #- Since `c1 = c2 - 1` and `c2 = n/2`, `c1 = n/2 - 1`.
        #- Therefore, after all iterations, `ops` will contain 12 tuples, with the first 5 being `(c1, i)`, followed by another `(c1, i)`, then `(c1, i)`, `(c2, i)`, and finally `(c1, i)`, and the last one being `(c2, i)` where `i` is `len(path_ba) - c1`.
        #
        #All other variables (`a`, `b`, `d`, `previous`, and `path_ba`) remain unchanged from their initial or previous states after the loop.
    #State: `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `d` is the result of BFS starting from node `0`, `previous` is the second value returned by `bfs(a)`, `path_ba` is a list containing nodes traversed until `n` equals `-1`, `ops` is a list containing either 4 tuples if `len(path_ba) % 2 == 1` or 12 tuples if `len(path_ba) % 2 == 0`, `ci` is 0, and `i` is 3.
    print(len(ops))
    #This is printed: 4 or 12
    print(*map(lambda x: f'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}', ops), sep='\n')
    #This is printed: - Each tuple in `ops` will be formatted as `f'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}'`.
    #   - For 4 tuples, the output will have 4 lines.
    #   - For 12 tuples, the output will have 12 lines.
    #
    #Given the above analysis, the output will be a series of strings, each representing a tuple from `ops` with the first element incremented by 1 and the second element unchanged.
    return None
    #The program returns None
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and returns None.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns None


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
