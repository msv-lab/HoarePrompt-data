Postcondition: `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `d` is the result of BFS starting from node `0`, `previous` is the second value returned by `bfs(a)`, `path_ba` is a list containing `b` and `n`, `n` is the value of `previous[path_ba[-1]]`. If `n == -1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
