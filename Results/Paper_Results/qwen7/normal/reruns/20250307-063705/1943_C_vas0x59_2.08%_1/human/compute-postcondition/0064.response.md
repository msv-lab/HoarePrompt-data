Output State: **`a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `d` is the result of BFS starting from node `0`, `previous` is the second value returned by `bfs(a)`, `path_ba` is a list containing nodes traversed until `n` equals `-1` that must have more than 0 elements, `ops` is a list containing one tuple `(c1, i)`, `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`, `c1` is `c2 - 1`**.

Explanation:
- The code `ops.append((c1, i))` appends a tuple `(c1, i)` to the list `ops`.
- The values of `a`, `b`, `d`, `previous`, `path_ba`, and `c2` remain unchanged.
- The value of `c1` is updated to `c2 - 1`.
- The list `ops` is now a list containing one tuple `(c1, i)`.
