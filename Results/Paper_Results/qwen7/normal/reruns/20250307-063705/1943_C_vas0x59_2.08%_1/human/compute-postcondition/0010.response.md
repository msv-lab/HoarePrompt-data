Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists, `u2vs[u]` is now a list containing `u-1` and `v`, `u2vs[v]` is now a list containing `u` and `v-1`, `u` is an input integer decreased by 1, `v` is an input integer decreased by 1**.

Explanation: The code `u -= 1` decreases the value of `u` by 1. The value of `v` remains unchanged, but since `u2vs[u]` and `u2vs[v]` were previously containing `u` and `v` respectively, they now contain `u-1` and `v`, and `u` and `v-1` respectively. All other conditions and values remain the same as the initial state.
