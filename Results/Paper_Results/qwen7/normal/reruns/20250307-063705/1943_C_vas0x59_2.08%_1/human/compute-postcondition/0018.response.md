Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists, `u2vs[u-1]` is now a list containing `u-2`, `u2vs[v-1]` is now a list containing `u`, `v-3`, and `u2vs[u]` is now a list containing `v`.**

Explanation: The code `u2vs[u].append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the list at index `u` in the `u2vs` list. Given the initial conditions, `u2vs[u-1]` contains `[u-2]` and `u2vs[v-1]` contains `[u, v-3]`. After executing the code, the list at index `u` in `u2vs` will contain `v`. All other conditions remain unchanged.
