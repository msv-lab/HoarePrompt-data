Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `u2vs` is a list of n empty lists, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `u, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to variables `u` and `v`. It does not modify the list `u2vs` or the condition on `n`. Therefore, `n` remains at least 2, `u2vs` is still a list of `n` empty lists, and `u` and `v` are set to the input integers.
