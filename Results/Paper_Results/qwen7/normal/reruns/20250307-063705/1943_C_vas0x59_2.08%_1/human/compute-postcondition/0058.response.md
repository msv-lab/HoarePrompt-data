Output State: `ci` is 0, `i` is 3, `ops` is a list containing tuples `[(0, 1), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3)]`.

In this final output state, after all iterations of the loop have executed, the variable `ci` remains unchanged at 0 because it is not modified within the loop. The variable `i` will be equal to 3 since the loop runs from 0 to `ci + 1`, and `ci` starts at 0. Therefore, the loop runs 4 times (from 0 to 3). The `ops` list accumulates tuples where the first element is always `c` (which is 0 in this case) and the second element is incremented by 1 with each iteration, resulting in the list `[(0, 1), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3)]`.
