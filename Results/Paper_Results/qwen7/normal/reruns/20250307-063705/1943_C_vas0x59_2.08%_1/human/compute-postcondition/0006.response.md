Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `u2vs` is a list of n empty lists, `u` is an input integer decreased by 1, `v` is an input integer decreased by 1, `u2vs[u]` is now a list containing `v`.**

Explanation: The code `u2vs[u].append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the list located at index `u` within the list `u2vs`. Since `u` is an input integer decreased by 1, and `v` is also an input integer decreased by 1, after executing the code, the list at index `u` in `u2vs` will contain the value `v`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
