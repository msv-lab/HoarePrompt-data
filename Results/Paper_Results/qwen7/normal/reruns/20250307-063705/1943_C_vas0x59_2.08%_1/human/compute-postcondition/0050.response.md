Output State: **`ci` is 0, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `d` is the result of BFS starting from node `0`, `previous` is the second value returned by `bfs(a)`, `path_ba` is a list containing nodes traversed until `n` equals `-1`, `ops` is an empty list, and the length of `path_ba` is odd.**

Explanation: The code calculates `ci` as the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2. Since the length of `path_ba` is odd, dividing it by 2 results in an integer quotient of 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
