Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists, `u2vs[u]` is now a list containing `u-1`, `v`, `u2vs[v]` is now a list containing `u`, `v-2`, and `u2vs[v]` is updated to include `u`, `u` and `v` are integers entered by the user.**

The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to variables `u` and `v`. These values are not specified in the initial state, so they are left as the integers entered by the user. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
