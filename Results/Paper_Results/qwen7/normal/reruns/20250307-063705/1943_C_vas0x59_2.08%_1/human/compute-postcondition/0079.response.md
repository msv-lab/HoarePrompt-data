Functionality: **The function processes an input integer `n` and a tree represented by a list of neighbor lists `u2vs`. It performs breadth-first searches (BFS) starting from specific nodes, constructs a list of traversal operations `ops`, and prints the count and details of these operations. The function ultimately returns `None`.**
