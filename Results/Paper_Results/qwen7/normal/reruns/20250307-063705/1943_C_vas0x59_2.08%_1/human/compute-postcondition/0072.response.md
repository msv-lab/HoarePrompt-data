Output State: `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `d` is the result of BFS starting from node `0`, `previous` is the second value returned by `bfs(a)`, `path_ba` is a list containing nodes traversed until `n` equals `-1` that must have more than 0 elements, `ops` is a list containing twelve tuples where each pair of consecutive tuples is `(c1, i)`, `(c2, i)`, `(c1, i)`, `(c2, i)`, `(c1, i)`, and `(c2, i)` with `c2` being half the length of `path_ba` and `c1` being `c2 - 1`, and `i` is incremented by 2 for each iteration of the loop.

This final state indicates that the loop has executed for as many times as possible given the condition `len(path_ba) - c1 > 0`. The variable `ops` contains all the tuples added during these iterations, following the pattern described above.
