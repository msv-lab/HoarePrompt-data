Since the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, it will always execute at least once regardless of the initial state of the variables. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the program state to allow the loop to proceed.

State: **`a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `d` is the result of BFS starting from node `0`, `previous` is the second value returned by `bfs(a)`, `path_ba` is a list containing `b`**
