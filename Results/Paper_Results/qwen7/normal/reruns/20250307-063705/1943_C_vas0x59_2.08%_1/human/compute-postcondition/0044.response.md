Output State: **`a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `d` is the result of BFS starting from node `0`, `previous` is the second value returned by `bfs(a)`, `path_ba` is a list containing `b` and `n` with `n` appended.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `n` to the list `path_ba`. Since `n` was previously part of the list (as `path_ba` contains `b` and `n`), appending `n` again does not change the list's contents. The values of other variables (`a`, `b`, `d`, `previous`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated list `path_ba` which now contains `b` and `n` with `n` appended.
