Based on the initial state provided:

- `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`.
- `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`.
- `d` is the result of BFS starting from node `0`.
- `previous` is the second value returned by `bfs(a)`.
- `path_ba` is a list containing nodes traversed until `n` equals `-1`.
- `ops` is a list containing either 4 tuples if `len(path_ba) % 2 == 1` or 12 tuples if `len(path_ba) % 2 == 0`.
- `ci` is 0.
- `i` is 3.

The key variable here is `ops`, which is a list of tuples. The length of `ops` depends on the length of `path_ba`.

To determine the length of `ops`:
- If `len(path_ba) % 2 == 1`, then `ops` contains 4 tuples.
- If `len(path_ba) % 2 == 0`, then `ops` contains 12 tuples.

Since the exact length of `path_ba` is not specified, we need to consider both cases. However, the problem does not provide enough information to definitively determine the length of `path_ba`. Therefore, we must consider both possibilities.

Given this, the output will depend on the parity of `len(path_ba)`:

- If `len(path_ba)` is odd, then `len(ops)` is 4.
- If `len(path_ba)` is even, then `len(ops)` is 12.

Since we cannot determine the exact length of `path_ba` from the given information, we provide both possible outputs:

Output: **4 or 12**
