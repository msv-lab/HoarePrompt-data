Output State: **`a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `d` is the result of BFS starting from node `0`, `previous` is the second value returned by `bfs(a)`, `path_ba` is a list containing `b` and `n`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `n` to the list `path_ba`. Since the initial state does not specify a particular value for `n`, and the problem statement mentions that if `n == -1`, the current value of `n` remains `-1`, the value of `n` is not specified. However, it is appended to `path_ba`. Therefore, `path_ba` now contains `b` and `n`.
