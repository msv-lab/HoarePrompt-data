The loop in question is a `while True` loop, which means the loop will always execute as long as the loop body does not explicitly break out of it. Since there are no conditions specified in the loop head to determine when the loop should stop, we do not need to adjust any specific states to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

However, based on the given task, we need to ensure that the loop head's conditions are met. In this case, since it's a `while True` loop, the loop will always proceed to the next iteration without any adjustments to the states.

Therefore, no changes are necessary to the current states.

State: **`a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `d` is the result of BFS starting from node `0`, `previous` is the second value returned by `bfs(a)`, `path_ba` is a list containing `b` and `n`**
