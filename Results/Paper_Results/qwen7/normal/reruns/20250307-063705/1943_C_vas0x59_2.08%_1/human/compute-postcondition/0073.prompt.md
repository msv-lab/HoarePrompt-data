Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `d` is the result of BFS starting from node `0`, `previous` is the second value returned by `bfs(a)`, path_ba is a list containing nodes traversed until `n` equals `-1`, `ops` is an empty list, `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`, `c1` is `c2 - 1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(path_ba) - c1, 2):
    ops.append((c1, i))
    ops.append((c2, i))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `d` is the result of BFS starting from node `0`, `previous` is the second value returned by `bfs(a)`, `path_ba` is a list containing nodes traversed until `n` equals `-1` that must have more than 0 elements, `ops` is a list containing two tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)`, `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`, `c1` is `c2 - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `d` is the result of BFS starting from node `0`, `previous` is the second value returned by `bfs(a)`, `path_ba` is a list containing nodes traversed until `n` equals `-1` that must have more than 0 elements, `ops` is a list containing four tuples `(c1, i)`, `(c2, i)`, `(c1, i)`, and `(c2, i)` where `c2` is half the length of `path_ba` and `c1` is `c2 - 1`, `i` is the next odd number less than `len(path_ba) / 2 + 1`, and `len(path_ba) - c1` remains the same.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `d` is the result of BFS starting from node `0`, `previous` is the second value returned by `bfs(a)`, `path_ba` is a list containing nodes traversed until `n` equals `-1` that must have more than 0 elements, `ops` is a list containing six tuples where the first five are `(c1, i)`, `(c1, i)`, `(c1, i)`, `(c2, i)`, and `(c1, i)` with `c2` being half the length of `path_ba` and `c1` being `c2 - 1`, and the sixth tuple is `(c2, i)` where `i` is `len(path_ba) - c1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
