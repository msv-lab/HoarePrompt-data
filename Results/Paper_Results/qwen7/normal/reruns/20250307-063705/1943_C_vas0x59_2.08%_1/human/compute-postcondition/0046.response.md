Output State: `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `d` is the result of BFS starting from node `0`, `previous` is the second value returned by `bfs(a)`, `path_ba` is a list containing nodes traversed until `n` equals `-1`.

Explanation: The loop continues to append the value of `n` (which is determined by `previous[path_ba[-1]]`) to `path_ba` until `n` equals `-1`. Once this condition is met, the loop breaks. Therefore, `path_ba` will contain all the nodes traversed from the start node (determined by `a`) until the loop terminates. The other variables (`a`, `b`, `d`, and `previous`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
