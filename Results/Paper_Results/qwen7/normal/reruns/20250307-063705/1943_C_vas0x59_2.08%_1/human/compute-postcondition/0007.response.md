Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `u2vs` is a list of n empty lists, `u2vs[v]` is now a list containing `u` and `v`, `u` is an input integer decreased by 1, `v` is an input integer decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code appends `u` to the list `u2vs[v]`. Initially, `u2vs[v]` is an empty list. After appending `u`, `u2vs[v]` contains both `u` and `v`. All other variables remain unchanged.
