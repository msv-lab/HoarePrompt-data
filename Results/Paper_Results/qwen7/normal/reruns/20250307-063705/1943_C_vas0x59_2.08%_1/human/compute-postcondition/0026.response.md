Output State: **`a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `d` is the result of BFS starting from node `0`, `previous` is the second value returned by `bfs(a)`, `path_ba` is a list containing `b`.**

Explanation: The line `path_ba = [b]` creates a list named `path_ba` and assigns it the value `[b]`. The values of other variables (`a`, `b`, `d`, and `previous`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
