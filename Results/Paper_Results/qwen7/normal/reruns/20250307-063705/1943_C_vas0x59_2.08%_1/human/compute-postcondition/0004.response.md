Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `u2vs` is a list of n empty lists, `u` is an input integer decreased by 1, `v` is an input integer.**

The code `u -= 1` decreases the value of `u` by 1. Since `u` was an input integer, now it is the input integer decreased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
