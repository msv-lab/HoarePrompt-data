Output State: **`a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `d` is the result of BFS starting from node `0`, `previous` is the second value returned by `bfs(a)`, `path_ba` is a list containing `b`, `n` is the value of `previous[path_ba[-1]]`**.

This means that the variable `n` is now assigned the value of `previous[path_ba[-1]]`. The other variables retain their initial states as described.
