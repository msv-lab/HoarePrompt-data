Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `a` and `b` are both the result of `func_1(d)`.
   - `d` is the result of BFS starting from node `0`.
   - `previous` is the second value returned by `bfs(a)`.
   - `path_ba` is a list containing nodes traversed until `n` equals `-1`.
   - `ops` is a list containing either 4 tuples if `len(path_ba) % 2 == 1` or 12 tuples if `len(path_ba) % 2 == 0`.
   - `ci` is 0.
   - `i` is 3.

2. **Code Snippet Analysis:**
   ```python
   print(*map(lambda x: f'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}', ops), sep='\n')
   ```

   This line of code maps over the `ops` list and formats each tuple into a string. The lambda function takes each tuple `x` from `ops` and returns a formatted string `f'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}'`. The `*` operator unpacks the mapped results and `sep='\n'` ensures that each formatted string is printed on a new line.

3. **Determine the Value of `ops`:**
   - Since `i` is 3, we need to determine the length of `path_ba` to know how many tuples `ops` contains.
   - If `len(path_ba) % 2 == 1`, then `ops` contains 4 tuples.
   - If `len(path_ba) % 2 == 0`, then `ops` contains 12 tuples.

   Without the exact value of `path_ba`, we cannot determine the exact contents of `ops`. However, we can describe the general form of the output based on the structure of `ops`.

4. **General Form of the Output:**
   - Each tuple in `ops` will be formatted as `f'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}'`.
   - For 4 tuples, the output will have 4 lines.
   - For 12 tuples, the output will have 12 lines.

Given the above analysis, the output will be a series of strings, each representing a tuple from `ops` with the first element incremented by 1 and the second element unchanged.

**Output:**
```
The output will consist of lines where each line represents a tuple from `ops` formatted as 'x[0] + 1 x[1]', with either 4 or 12 such lines depending on the length of `path_ba`.
```
