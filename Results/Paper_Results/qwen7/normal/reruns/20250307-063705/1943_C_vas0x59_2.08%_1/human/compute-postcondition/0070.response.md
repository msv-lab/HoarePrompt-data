Output State: **`a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `d` is the result of BFS starting from node `0`, `previous` is the second value returned by `bfs(a)`, `path_ba` is a list containing nodes traversed until `n` equals `-1` that must have more than 0 elements, `ops` is a list containing five tuples `(c1, i)`, `(c2, i)`, `(c1, i)`, `(c2, i)`, and `(c1, i)` where `c2` is half the length of `path_ba` and `c1` is `c2 - 1`, and `i` is `len(path_ba) - c1` (if `i_current + 2 > len(path_ba) - c1`), and `len(path_ba) - c1` remains the same.**

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(c1, i)` to the list `ops`. Since the previous value of `ops` was a list containing four tuples, after appending one more tuple, `ops` now contains five tuples. The values of other variables remain unchanged.
