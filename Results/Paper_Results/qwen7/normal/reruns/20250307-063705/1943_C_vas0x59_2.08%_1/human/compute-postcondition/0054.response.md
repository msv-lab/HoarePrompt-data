Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i` and `ci`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `ci + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ci` is 0
   - `i` is 1
   - `ops` is a list containing one tuple `(c, 1)`

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `ci + 1`.
   - Given `ci` is 0, `ci + 1` is 1.
   - Therefore, `i` must be less than 1 for the loop to execute again. However, since `i` is already 1, it cannot increment further within the current range.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `ci` remains the same because it is not modified within the loop.
   - `i` will be incremented to 2 if the loop were to execute again, but since `i` is already 1 and the loop condition requires `i < ci + 1` (which is 1), the loop will not execute again.

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration (if it were to occur) would be:

State: **`ci` is 0, `i` is 2, `ops` is a list containing one tuple `(c, 1)`** 

However, since the loop will not execute again due to the condition `i < ci + 1` being false, the state remains as it is unless the loop body modifies `ci` or `i`. 

So, the final state remains:

State: **`ci` is 0, `i` is 1, `ops` is a list containing one tuple `(c, 1)`**
