Output State: **`a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `d` is the result of BFS starting from node `0`, `previous` is the second value returned by `bfs(a)`, `path_ba` is a list containing `b` and `n`, `n` is the value of `previous[path_ba[-1]]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not affect the values of any variables; it only exits the current loop or conditional block. Since no loop or conditional block was specified in the code snippet, we assume it breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. All the initial conditions remain unchanged.
