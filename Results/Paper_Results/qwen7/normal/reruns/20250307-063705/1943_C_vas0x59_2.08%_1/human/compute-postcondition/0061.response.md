Output State: **`a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `d` is the result of BFS starting from node `0`, `previous` is the second value returned by `bfs(a)`, path_ba is a list containing nodes traversed until `n` equals `-1`, `ops` is an empty list, and `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `c2` as the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2. Since the length of `path_ba` is even, `c2` will be an integer representing half the number of elements in `path_ba`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
