Postcondition: **`a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `d` is the result of BFS starting from node `0`, `previous` is the second value returned by `bfs(a)`, `path_ba` is a list containing nodes traversed until `n` equals `-1`, `ops` is a list containing either 4 tuples if `len(path_ba) % 2 == 1` or 12 tuples if `len(path_ba) % 2 == 0`, `ci` is 0, and `i` is 3.**

Explanation: 
- If `len(path_ba) % 2 == 1`, then `ops` will contain 4 tuples: `[(0, 1), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3)]`, and `ci` remains 0 while `i` is set to 3.
- If `len(path_ba) % 2 == 0`, then `ops` will contain 12 tuples, with the structure described in the else part. `ci` remains 0, and `i` is set to 3.
