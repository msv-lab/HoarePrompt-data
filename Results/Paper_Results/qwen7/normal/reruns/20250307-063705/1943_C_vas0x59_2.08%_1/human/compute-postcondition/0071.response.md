Output State: **`a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `d` is the result of BFS starting from node `0`, `previous` is the second value returned by `bfs(a)`, `path_ba` is a list containing nodes traversed until `n` equals `-1` that must have more than 0 elements, `ops` is a list containing six tuples where the first five are `(c1, i)`, `(c1, i)`, `(c1, i)`, `(c2, i)`, and `(c1, i)` with `c2` being half the length of `path_ba` and `c1` being `c2 - 1`, and the sixth tuple is `(c2, i)` where `i` is `len(path_ba) - c1`.**

Explanation: The code appends a new tuple `(c2, i)` to the list `ops`. Given the structure of `ops` before this line, it now contains six tuples. The first five tuples follow the pattern `(c1, i)`, `(c1, i)`, `(c1, i)`, `(c2, i)`, and `(c1, i)` with `c2` being half the length of `path_ba` and `c1` being `c2 - 1`. The sixth tuple is `(c2, i)` where `i` is `len(path_ba) - c1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
