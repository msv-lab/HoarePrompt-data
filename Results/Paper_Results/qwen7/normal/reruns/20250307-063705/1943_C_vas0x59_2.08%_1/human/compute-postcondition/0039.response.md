Output State: **`a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `d` is the result of BFS starting from node `0`, `previous` is the second value returned by `bfs(a)`, `path_ba` is a list containing `b` and `n`, `n` is the value of `previous[path_ba[-1]]`, `path_ba` is updated by appending `n` to itself.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `n` to the list `path_ba`. Since `n` is defined as `previous[path_ba[-1]]`, the list `path_ba` now contains the elements `b` and `n`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
