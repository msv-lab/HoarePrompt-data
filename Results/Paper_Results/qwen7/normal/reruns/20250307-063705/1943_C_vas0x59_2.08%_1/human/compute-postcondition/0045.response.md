Output State: `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `d` is the result of BFS starting from node `0`, `previous` is the second value returned by `bfs(a)`, `path_ba` is a list containing nodes from the BFS traversal until a node `n` is found such that `previous[path_ba[-1]] == -1`.

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `n` (which is assigned the value of `previous[path_ba[-1]]`) is not equal to `-1`. This means that the loop will keep appending nodes to `path_ba` until it reaches a point where the next node in the path cannot be determined (i.e., `previous[path_ba[-1]]` returns `-1`). At this point, the loop breaks, and the final state of `path_ba` contains the sequence of nodes from the BFS traversal up to the last valid node before encountering a `-1`.
