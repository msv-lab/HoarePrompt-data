Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `len(path_ba) - c1`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range `1` to `len(path_ba) - c1 - 1` with a step of `2`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`
   - `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`
   - `d` is the result of BFS starting from node `0`
   - `previous` is the second value returned by `bfs(a)`
   - `path_ba` is a list containing nodes traversed until `n` equals `-1` that must have more than 0 elements
   - `ops` is a list containing two tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)`, where `c2` is half the length of `path_ba` and `c1` is `c2 - 1`

4. **Calculate the current value of `len(path_ba) - c1`**:
   - `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`, so `c2 = len(path_ba) / 2`
   - `c1` is `c2 - 1`, so `c1 = len(path_ba) / 2 - 1`
   - Therefore, `len(path_ba) - c1 = len(path_ba) - (len(path_ba) / 2 - 1) = len(path_ba) / 2 + 1`

5. **Determine the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - The loop increments `i` by `2` each time, so if the loop just finished, `i` was the largest odd number less than `len(path_ba) / 2 + 1`.

6. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by `2` to the next odd number.
   - `len(path_ba) - c1` remains the same unless `path_ba` changes.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `len(path_ba) - c1`.

**State:**
- `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`
- `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`
- `d` is the result of BFS starting from node `0`
- `previous` is the second value returned by `bfs(a)`
- `path_ba` is a list containing nodes traversed until `n` equals `-1` that must have more than 0 elements
- `ops` is a list containing two tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)`, where `c2` is half the length of `path_ba` and `c1` is `c2 - 1`
- `i` is the next odd number less than `len(path_ba) / 2 + 1`
- `len(path_ba) - c1` remains the same

So, the final state is:
State: **`a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `d` is the result of BFS starting from node `0`, `previous` is the second value returned by `bfs(a)`, `path_ba` is a list containing nodes traversed until `n` equals `-1` that must have more than 0 elements, `ops` is a list containing two tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)`, `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`, `c1` is `c2 - 1`, `i` is the next odd number less than `len(path_ba) / 2 + 1`, `len(path_ba) - c1` remains the same**
