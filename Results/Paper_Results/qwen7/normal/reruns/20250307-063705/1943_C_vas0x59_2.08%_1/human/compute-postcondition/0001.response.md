Output State: **`n` is an input integer, 1 ≤ n ≤ 2000, `u2vs` is a list of n empty lists.**

Explanation: The code initializes `u2vs` as a list of `n` empty lists. Each element in `u2vs` is an empty list, which means no changes are made to the existing values of `n` or `u2vs`. Therefore, the only change is that `u2vs` is now a list of `n` empty lists.
