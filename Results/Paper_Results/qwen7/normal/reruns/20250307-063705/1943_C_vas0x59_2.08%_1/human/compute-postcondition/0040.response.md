The `while True` loop does not have any condition based on the variables in the loop body to determine whether it should continue executing. Therefore, no adjustments to the states are necessary because the loop will always execute again.

However, to ensure clarity and completeness, let's review the states at the end of the previous iteration:

- `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`
- `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`
- `d` is the result of BFS starting from node `0`
- `previous` is the second value returned by `bfs(a)`
- `path_ba` is a list containing `b` and `n`
- `n` is the value of `previous[path_ba[-1]]`
- `path_ba` is updated by appending `n` to itself

Since the loop is `while True`, it will always execute again regardless of the current state of the variables. Thus, no changes are needed to the states.

State: **`a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `d` is the result of BFS starting from node `0`, `previous` is the second value returned by `bfs(a)`, `path_ba` is a list containing `b` and `n`, `n` is the value of `previous[path_ba[-1]]`, `path_ba` is updated by appending `n` to itself**
