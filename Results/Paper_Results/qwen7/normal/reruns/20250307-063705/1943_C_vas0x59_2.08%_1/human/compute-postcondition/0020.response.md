Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `n` must be at least 2, `u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists, where each index `i` (0 ≤ i < n) in `u2vs` contains a list of all indices `j` (0 ≤ j < n) such that there is an edge between node `i` and node `j` in the graph formed by the inputs provided during the loop's execution. Each list in `u2vs` will contain every index from 0 to `n-1`, indicating that every node is connected to every other node, forming a complete graph.

This is because the loop iterates `n-1` times, and each iteration adds two nodes `u` and `v` to each other's adjacency lists, effectively connecting them in a complete graph structure.
