Output State: **`a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `d` is the result of BFS starting from node `0`, `previous` is the second value returned by `bfs(a)`, `path_ba` is a list containing `b` and `n`, `n` is the value of `previous[path_ba[-1]] + 1`, `path_ba` is updated by appending `n` to itself**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `n` to be the value of `previous[path_ba[-1]]`. Since `path_ba` is a list containing `b` and `n`, the last element of `path_ba` is `n`. Therefore, `n` is set to the value of `previous[n]`. After updating `n`, `path_ba` is updated by appending `n` to itself, which means `path_ba` now contains `b`, `n`, and the new value of `n`.
