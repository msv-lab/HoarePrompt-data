Output State: **`a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `d` is the result of BFS starting from node `0`, `previous` is the second value returned by `bfs(a)`**, and `d` is updated to include the previous values from the BFS.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `d` to `b`. This means that `b` now holds the same value as `d`. The other variables (`a`, `d`, and `previous`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
