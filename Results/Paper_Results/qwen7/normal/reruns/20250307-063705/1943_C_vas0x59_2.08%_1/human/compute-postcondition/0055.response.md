Output State: **`ci` is 0, `i` is 1, `ops` is a list containing tuples `[(0, 1), (0, 1)]**.

Explanation: The code `ops.append((c, i))` appends a tuple `(c, i)` to the list `ops`. Initially, `ops` contains one tuple `(c, 1)`. Since `c` is 0 and `i` is 1, the tuple appended to `ops` is `(0, 1)`. Therefore, `ops` now contains two tuples: `(0, 1)` and `(0, 1)`. The values of `ci` and `i` remain unchanged.
