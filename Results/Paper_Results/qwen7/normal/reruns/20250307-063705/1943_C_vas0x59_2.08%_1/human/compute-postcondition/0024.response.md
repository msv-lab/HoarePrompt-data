Output State: **`a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `d` is the result of BFS starting from node `0`, `previous` is the second value returned by `bfs(a)`, and `d` is updated to include the previous values from the BFS.**

Explanation: The code `d, previous = bfs(a)` calls the `bfs` function with the argument `a`. The function returns two values: `d` and `previous`. The initial value of `d` is the result of BFS starting from node `0`, and now it also includes the `previous` values from the BFS. The variable `_` was the second value returned by `bfs(0)` but is not used, so its value is not relevant here. The variable `a` remains unchanged as it was the input to the `bfs` function.
