Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists, `u2vs[u]` is now a list containing `u` and `v`, `u2vs[v]` is now a list containing `u` and `v`, `u` is an input integer (decreased by 1), `v` is an input integer (decreased by 1)**.

Explanation: The code `u, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))` reads two integers from the input, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `u` and `v`. The values of `n` and `u2vs` remain unchanged. The values of `u` and `v` are updated to the integers input by the user, each decreased by 1 as per the initial state description.
