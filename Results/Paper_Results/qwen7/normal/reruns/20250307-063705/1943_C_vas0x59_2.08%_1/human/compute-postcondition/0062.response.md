Output State: **`a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `d` is the result of BFS starting from node `0`, `previous` is the second value returned by `bfs(a)`, path_ba is a list containing nodes traversed until `n` equals `-1`, `ops` is an empty list, `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`, `c1` is `c2 - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `c1 = c2 - 1` assigns the value of `c2 - 1` to `c1`. Since `c2` is defined as half the length of `path_ba`, `c1` is now one less than half the length of `path_ba`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
