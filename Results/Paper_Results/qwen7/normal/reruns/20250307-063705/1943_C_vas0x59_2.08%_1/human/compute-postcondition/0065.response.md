Output State: **`a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `d` is the result of BFS starting from node `0`, `previous` is the second value returned by `bfs(a)`, `path_ba` is a list containing nodes traversed until `n` equals `-1` that must have more than 0 elements, `ops` is a list containing two tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)`, `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`, `c1` is `c2 - 1`.**

Explanation: The code appends a new tuple `(c2, i)` to the list `ops`. Before this operation, `ops` contains one tuple `(c1, i)`. After appending, `ops` now contains two tuples: `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)`. The values of `c1` and `c2` remain as defined previously: `c1` is `c2 - 1`, and `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`. All other variables retain their initial states.
