Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop `for i in range(1, len(path_ba) - c1, 2)` will execute if the following conditions are met:
   - `1 < len(path_ba) - c1`: This ensures that the range function generates at least one value for `i`.
   - The step size of `2` means `i` will take values starting from `1` and incrementing by `2` each time.

3. **Check the initial state of the variables involved**:
   - `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`.
   - `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`.
   - `d` is the result of BFS starting from node `0`.
   - `previous` is the second value returned by `bfs(a)`.
   - `path_ba` is a list containing nodes traversed until `n` equals `-1`.
   - `ops` is an empty list.
   - `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`.
   - `c1` is `c2 - 1`.

4. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - We need to ensure that `len(path_ba) - c1 > 1` for the loop to execute.
   - Since `c1 = c2 - 1` and `c2 = len(path_ba) / 2`, we need to ensure that `len(path_ba) - (len(path_ba) / 2 - 1) > 1`.

5. **Simplify the condition**:
   - `len(path_ba) - (len(path_ba) / 2 - 1) > 1`
   - Simplifying this, we get: `len(path_ba) / 2 + 1 > 1` or `len(path_ba) / 2 > 0` or `len(path_ba) > 0`.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `len(path_ba)` to ensure it is greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `d` is the result of BFS starting from node `0`, `previous` is the second value returned by `bfs(a)`, `path_ba` is a list containing nodes traversed until `n` equals `-1` that must have more than 0 elements, `ops` is an empty list, `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`, `c1` is `c2 - 1`**.
