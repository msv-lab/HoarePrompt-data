Output State: **`a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `d` is the result of BFS starting from node `0`, `previous` is the second value returned by `bfs(a)`, `path_ba` is a list containing `b` and `n`, `n` is the value of `previous[path_ba[-1]]`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `previous[path_ba[-1]]` to `n`. Since `path_ba` is a list containing `b` and `n`, `path_ba[-1]` refers to the last element of the list, which is `n`. Therefore, `n` is reassigned to itself, keeping its original value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
