Output State: **`ci` is 0, `i` is 1, `ops` is a list containing one tuple `(c, 1)`**.

The code appends a tuple `(c, i)` to the list `ops`. Since `c` is not defined in the provided context, it is assumed to be a variable that holds a value before this operation. However, since no specific value for `c` is given, it remains as `c` in the tuple. The value of `i` is 1, so the tuple added to `ops` is `(c, 1)`. The values of `ci` and `i` remain unchanged.
