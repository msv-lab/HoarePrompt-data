Output State: **`a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `d` is the result of BFS starting from node `0`, `previous` is the second value returned by `bfs(a)`, `path_ba` is a list containing nodes traversed until `n` equals `-1` that must have more than 0 elements, `ops` is a list containing four tuples `(c1, i)`, `(c2, i)`, `(c1, i)`, and `(c2, i)` where `c2` is half the length of `path_ba` and `c1` is `c2 - 1`, `i` is the next odd number less than `len(path_ba) / 2 + 1`, and `len(path_ba) - c1` remains the same.**

Explanation: The line `ops.append((c2, i))` appends a new tuple `(c2, i)` to the list `ops`. Since `ops` already contains three tuples, after appending this new tuple, `ops` now contains four tuples. The values of `c2`, `c1`, and `i` remain the same as defined in the problem statement. All other variables retain their previous values.
