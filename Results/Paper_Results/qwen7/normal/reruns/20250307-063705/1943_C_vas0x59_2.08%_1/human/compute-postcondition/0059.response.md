Output State: `ci` is 0, `i` is 3, `ops` is a list containing tuples `[(0, 1), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3)]`.

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = ci + 1`, where `ci` starts at 0. After each iteration, `i` increases by 1. Given that the loop has executed 3 times, `i` will be 3 when the loop finishes. Therefore, `ci` remains 0 (since it is not modified within the loop), `i` becomes 3, and `ops` accumulates tuples `(c, i)` for each iteration, resulting in `[(0, 1), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3)]`.
