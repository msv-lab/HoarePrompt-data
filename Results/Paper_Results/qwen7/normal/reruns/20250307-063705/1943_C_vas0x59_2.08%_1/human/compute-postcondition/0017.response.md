Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists, `u2vs[u-1]` is now a list containing `u-2`, `v-1`, `u2vs[v-1]` is now a list containing `u`, `v-3`, and `u` is an integer that was decremented by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `v` is decremented by 1. The other variables and their conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, `u2vs[u-1]` now contains `u-2` and `v-1`, and `u2vs[v-1]` now contains `u` and `v-3`.
