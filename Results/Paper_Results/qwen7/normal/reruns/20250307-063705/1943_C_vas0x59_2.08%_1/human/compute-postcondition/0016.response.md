Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists, `u2vs[u-1]` is now a list containing `u-2`, `v`, `u2vs[v]` is now a list containing `u`, `v-2`, and `u` is an integer that was decremented by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `u` is decremented by 1, so `u2vs[u]` changes to `u2vs[u-1]`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
