Output State: **`n` is an input integer, 1 ≤ n ≤ 2000, `u2vs` is a list of length n where each element is a list of integers representing the neighbors of the corresponding vertex in the tree.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state of `n` being an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2000\) is preserved, and the variable `u2vs` remains unchanged as no operation was performed on it.
