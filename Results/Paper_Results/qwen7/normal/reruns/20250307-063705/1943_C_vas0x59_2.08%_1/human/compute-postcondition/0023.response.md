Output State: **`a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `d` is the result of BFS starting from node `0`, `u2vs` contains lists of all indices from `0` to `n-1` except for the index of the list itself, `_` is the second value returned by `bfs(0)` which is not used.**

Explanation: The variable `a` is assigned the result of calling `func_1` with `d` as the argument. The variable `d` remains unchanged as it was the result of BFS starting from node `0`. The variable `u2vs` and its contents remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given line of code. The variable `_` remains the second value returned by `bfs(0)` which is not used, as no further operations are mentioned that would alter its value.
