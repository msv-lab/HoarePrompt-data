Output State: **`a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `d` is the result of BFS starting from node `0`, `previous` is the second value returned by `bfs(a)`, `path_ba` is a list containing nodes traversed until `n` equals `-1`, ops is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list `ops`. This list does not affect any of the existing variables (`a`, `b`, `d`, `previous`, or `path_ba`). The loop described in the explanation remains intact and will continue to append the value of `n` (determined by `previous[path_ba[-1]]`) to `path_ba` until `n` equals `-1`. Since the loop body is not executed due to the lack of any iteration logic within the given code snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the initial conditions of the variables without any modifications.
