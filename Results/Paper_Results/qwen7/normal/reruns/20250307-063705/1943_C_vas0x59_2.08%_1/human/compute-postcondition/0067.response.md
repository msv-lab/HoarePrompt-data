Output State: **`a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `d` is the result of BFS starting from node `0`, `previous` is the second value returned by `bfs(a)`, `path_ba` is a list containing nodes traversed until `n` equals `-1` that must have more than 0 elements, `ops` is a list containing three tuples `(c1, i)`, `(c2, i)`, and `(c1, i)`, where `c2` is half the length of `path_ba` and `c1` is `c2 - 1`, `i` is the next odd number less than `len(path_ba) / 2 + 1`, and `len(path_ba) - c1` remains the same.**

Explanation:
- The code appends a tuple `(c1, i)` to the list `ops`.
- Initially, `ops` contains two tuples: `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)`.
- After appending `(c1, i)`, `ops` now contains three tuples: `(c1, i)`, `(c2, i)`, and `(c1, i)`.
- The values of `a`, `b`, `d`, `previous`, `path_ba`, `c2`, and `len(path_ba) - c1` remain unchanged.
