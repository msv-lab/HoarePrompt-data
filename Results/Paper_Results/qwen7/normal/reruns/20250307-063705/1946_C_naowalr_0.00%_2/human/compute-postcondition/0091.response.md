Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `L` is 50001, `R` is 100001, `x` is 75001, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`**

Explanation: The line `numCuts = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `numCuts`. All other variables (`i`, `L`, `R`, `x`, and `leftover`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
