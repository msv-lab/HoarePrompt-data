Output State: **`L` is 1, `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, all other variables and the structure of `adj` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The variable `L` is assigned the value 1. The values of `i`, `n`, and the adjacency list `adj` are not directly affected by this line of code since they are not used in the assignment. Therefore, `i` remains equal to `n - 1`, `n` is still greater than `i + 1`, and the structure of `adj` remains unchanged from its initial or previously updated states.
