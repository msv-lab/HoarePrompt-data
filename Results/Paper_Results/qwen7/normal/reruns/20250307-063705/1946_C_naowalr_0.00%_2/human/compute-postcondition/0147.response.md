Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `L` and `R` are consecutive integers with `R - L` equal to 1, `x` is the smaller of `L` and `R`, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)` from the last iteration.**

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the loop condition `R - L > 1` will no longer be true, meaning `R` and `L` will be consecutive integers differing by exactly 1. Since `numCuts` is reset to 0 at the beginning of each iteration and never incremented within the loop body, it remains 0 throughout all iterations. The value of `x` will be the smaller of `L` and `R` because the loop narrows down the search range until `R - L` equals 1. The value of `leftover` will be the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call made at the start of the last iteration, as it is not affected by the loop's execution.
