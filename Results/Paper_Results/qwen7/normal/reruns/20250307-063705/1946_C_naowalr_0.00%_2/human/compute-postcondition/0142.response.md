Postcondition: `i` is `n-1`, `n` is an integer read from stdin, `a` is the first integer from the input split by space, `b` is the second integer from the input split by space, `L` and `R` are either 1 and 100001 or adjusted based on the value of `numCuts` and `leftover`, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)` after the function call. If `numCuts > k` or (`numCuts == k` and `leftover >= x`), then `L` is `(L + R) // 2`. Otherwise, `R` is set to `x`.
