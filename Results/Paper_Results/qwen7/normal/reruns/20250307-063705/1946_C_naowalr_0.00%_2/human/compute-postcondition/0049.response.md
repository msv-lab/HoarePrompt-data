Output State: `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, `L` is a value between 1 and 100001 (inclusive), and `R` is the same as `L`.

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `R - L > 1`. After each iteration, the value of `x` is updated to be the integer division of `(L + R)` by 2. Depending on the conditions inside the loop, either `L` or `R` is updated. Since the loop continues until `R - L` is no longer greater than 1, eventually `L` will equal `R`. At this point, the loop terminates. Given the initial conditions and the fact that `numCuts` remains 0 throughout the loop (since it is reset to 0 at the start of each iteration), the final values of `L` and `R` will be the same, and `leftover` will be the result of `dfs(1, 1)` from the last iteration.
