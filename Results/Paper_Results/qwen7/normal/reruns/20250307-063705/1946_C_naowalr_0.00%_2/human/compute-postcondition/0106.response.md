Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < n - 1`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is an integer read from stdin.
   - `a` is the first integer from the input split by space.
   - `b` is the second integer from the input split by space.
   - `adj[a]` includes `b`.
   - `adj[b]` now includes `a`.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and the loop continues as long as `i < n - 1`, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `i = 1`.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged.
   - The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged.
   - The adjacency lists `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer read from stdin, `a` is the first integer from the input split by space, `b` is the second integer from the input split by space, `adj[a]` includes `b`, `adj[b]` now includes `a`**
