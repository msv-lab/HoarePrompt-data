Output State: **`a` is an integer equal to the first number input from stdin, `b` is an integer equal to the second number input from stdin, `adj[b]` now contains `[b, a]`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i + 1` (which is `x + 2`).**

Explanation: The code appends `a` to the list `adj[b]`. Initially, `adj[b]` contains `[a, b]`, so after appending `a`, it becomes `[b, a]`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and the condition for `n` remains the same, i.e., `n` must be greater than `i + 1` (which is `x + 2`).
