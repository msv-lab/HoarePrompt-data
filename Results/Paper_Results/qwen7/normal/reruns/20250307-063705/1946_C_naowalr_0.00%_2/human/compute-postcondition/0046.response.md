Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, `R` is the integer division of `(L + R)` by 2, and `leftover` is reassigned to the result of `dfs(1, 1)`**.

Explanation: The code sets `R` to the value of `x`, which is the integer division of `(L + R)` by 2. The values of `numCuts` and `leftover` remain unchanged from their initial state.
