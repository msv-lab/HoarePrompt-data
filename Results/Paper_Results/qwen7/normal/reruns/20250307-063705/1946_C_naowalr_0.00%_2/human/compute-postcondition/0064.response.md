Output State: **`a` is an integer equal to the first number input from stdin, `b` is an integer equal to the second number input from stdin, `adj[b]` now contains `[b, a]`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i + 1` (which is `x + 2`).**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from standard input and assigns them to `a` and `b`. It also updates `adj[b]` to contain `[b, a]`, increments `i` by 1, and ensures that `n` is greater than `i + 1` (which is `x + 2`). All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
