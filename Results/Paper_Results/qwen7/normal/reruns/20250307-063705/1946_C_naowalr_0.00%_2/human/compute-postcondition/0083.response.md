Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `L` is 50001, `R` is 100001, `x` is 75001, `numCuts` is greater than `k` or (`numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`)**

Explanation: The variable `numCuts` is explicitly set to 0. All other variables retain their initial values. The condition involving `numCuts` remains unchanged as no values of `k` or `leftover` are provided to evaluate the condition further.
