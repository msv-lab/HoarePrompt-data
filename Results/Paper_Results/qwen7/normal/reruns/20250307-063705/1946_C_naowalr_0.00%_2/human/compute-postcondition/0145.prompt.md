Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `n-1`, `n` is an integer read from stdin, `a` is the first integer from the input split by space, `b` is the second integer from the input split by space, `L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0
Code of the loop:
while R - L > 1:
    x = (L + R) // 2
    numCuts = 0
    leftover = dfs(1, 1)
    if numCuts > k or numCuts == k and leftover >= x:
        L = x
    else:
        R = x


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is `n-1`, `n` is an integer read from stdin, `a` is the first integer from the input split by space, `b` is the second integer from the input split by space, `L` and `R` are either 1 and 100001 or adjusted based on the value of `numCuts` and `leftover`, `numCuts` is either greater than `k` or equal to `k` with `leftover` being greater than or equal to `x`, or `numCuts` is less than or equal to `k` or equal to `k` with `leftover` being less than `x`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `i` is `n-1`, `n` is an integer read from stdin, `a` is the first integer from the input split by space, `b` is the second integer from the input split by space, `L` and `R` are either 1 and 100001 or adjusted based on the value of `numCuts` and `leftover`, `numCuts` is either greater than `k` or equal to `k` with `leftover` being greater than or equal to `x`, or `numCuts` is less than or equal to `k` or equal to `k` with `leftover` being less than `x`, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`, `numCuts` is 0, `R - L > 1` holds true, `leftover` is the result of dfs(1, 1). If `numCuts > k` or (`numCuts == k` and `leftover >= x`), then `R` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `R` is set to `x`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `i` is `n-1`, `n` is an integer read from stdin, `a` is the first integer from the input split by space, `b` is the second integer from the input split by space, `L` and `R` are either 1 and 100001 or adjusted based on the value of `numCuts` and `leftover`, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`. If `numCuts > k` or (`numCuts == k` and `leftover >= x`), then `R` is `(L + R) // 2`. Otherwise, `R` is set to `x`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
