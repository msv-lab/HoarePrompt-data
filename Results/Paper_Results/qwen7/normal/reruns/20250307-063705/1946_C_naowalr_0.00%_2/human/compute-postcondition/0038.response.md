Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, `x` is the integer division of `(L + R)` by 2, `R` is equal to `x`**.

Explanation: The code `R = x` assigns the value of `x` to `R`. The value of `x` is the integer division of `(L + R)` by 2, which remains unchanged. All other variables (`numCuts`, `leftover`, and the previous value of `x`) remain in their initial or previously calculated states.
