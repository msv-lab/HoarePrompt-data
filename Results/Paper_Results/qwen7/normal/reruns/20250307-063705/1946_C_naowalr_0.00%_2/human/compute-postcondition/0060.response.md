Output State: **`a` is an integer equal to the first number input from stdin, `b` is an integer equal to the second number input from stdin, `adj[b]` now contains `[a, b]`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from stdin and assigns them to `a` and `b` respectively. It also updates `adj[b]` to contain the list `[a, b]`. Additionally, it increments `i` by 1. The initial conditions that `n` must be greater than `i + 1` remain unchanged.
