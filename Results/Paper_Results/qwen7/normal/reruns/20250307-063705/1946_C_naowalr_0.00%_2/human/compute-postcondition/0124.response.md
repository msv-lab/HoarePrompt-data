Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is an integer read from stdin, `a` is the first integer from the input split by space, `b` is the second integer from the input split by space, `L` is `x`, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is greater than `k` or equal to `k` with `leftover` being greater than or equal to `x`.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `L` to the value of `x`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
