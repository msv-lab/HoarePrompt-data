Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `L` is 50001, `R` is 100001, `x` is 75001, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, `x` is 75001**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `x` to be the average of `L` and `R`. Given that `L` is 50001 and `R` is 100001, the calculation for `x` is `(50001 + 100001) // 2`, which results in 75001. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
