Output State: `i` is `n-1`, `n` is an integer read from stdin, `a` is the first integer from the input split by space, `b` is the second integer from the input split by space, `L` and `R` are such that `R - L` equals 1, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the condition `R - L > 1` will no longer hold true, meaning `R - L` will be exactly 1. The loop continues to narrow down the range between `L` and `R` until this condition is met. Since the loop exits when `R - L` is no longer greater than 1, the final values of `L` and `R` will differ by exactly 1. At this point, `numCuts` remains 0 as it was not incremented within the loop, and `leftover` is the result of the last call to `dfs(1, 1)`. The value of `x` is the midpoint of the final range `[L, R]`.
