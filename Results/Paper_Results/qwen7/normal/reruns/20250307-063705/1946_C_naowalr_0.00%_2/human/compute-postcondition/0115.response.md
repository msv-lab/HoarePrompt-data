Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is an integer read from stdin, `a` is the first integer from the input split by space, `b` is the second integer from the input split by space, `L` is 1.**

The code `L = 1` assigns the value 1 to the variable `L`. No other variables are affected, and the values of `i`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial states.
