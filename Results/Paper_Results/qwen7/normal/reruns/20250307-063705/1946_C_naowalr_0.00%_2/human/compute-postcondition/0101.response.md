Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `L` is 50001, `R` is 100001, `x` is 75001, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, `n` is an integer read from stdin, `k` is an integer read from stdin, `adj` is a list of lists with length `n + 1` where each element is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an adjacency list `adj` with `n + 1` elements, each being an empty list. This means that `adj` is now a list of `n + 1` sublists, all initially empty. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
