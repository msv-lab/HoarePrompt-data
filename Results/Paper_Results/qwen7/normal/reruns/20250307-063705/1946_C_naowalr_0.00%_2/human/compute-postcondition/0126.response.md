Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is an integer read from stdin, `a` is the first integer from the input split by space, `b` is the second integer from the input split by space, `L` is 1, `R` is `(L + R) // 2`, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`, `leftover` is the result of the dfs(1, 1) function call, `numCuts` is less than or equal to `k` or (`numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is less than `x`)**

Explanation: The code `R = x` updates the value of `R` to be equal to `x`. Since `x` is defined as `(L + R) // 2`, `R` now becomes `(L + R) // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
