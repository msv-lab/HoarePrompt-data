Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer read from stdin, representing the number of test cases.
Code of the loop:
for z in range(t):
    n, k = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))
    adj = [[] for i in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(n - 1):
        a, b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))
        adj[a].append(b)
        adj[b].append(a)
    L = 1
    R = int(100000.0 + 1)
    numCuts = 0
    while R - L > 1:
        x = (L + R) // 2
        numCuts = 0
        leftover = dfs(1, 1)
        if numCuts > k or numCuts == k and leftover >= x:
            L = x
        else:
            R = x
    print(L)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, `L` is a value between 1 and 100001 inclusive, and `R` is the same as `L`.

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as the difference between `R` and `L` is greater than 1. After each iteration, the value of `x` is updated as the integer division of `(L + R)` by 2. Depending on the conditions inside the loop, either `L` or `R` is updated to `x`. This process continues until the difference between `R` and `L` is no longer greater than 1, meaning `R` will eventually become equal to `L`. At this point, the loop terminates. Since `numCuts` is reset to 0 at the beginning of each iteration and never incremented within the loop body, it remains 0. The value of `leftover` is determined by the `dfs(1, 1)` function call at the start of each iteration and does not change across iterations. Therefore, after all iterations, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)` from the last iteration, and `L` and `R` are equal.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `numCuts` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `L` is 50001, `R` is 100001, `x` is 75001, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`.

Explanation: After the first three iterations, the value of `L` is 50001, and it has not been updated further because the condition `R - L > 1` no longer holds true. This means that `R` must have been reduced to 50001 or less in subsequent iterations, causing the loop to terminate. Given that `numCuts` remains 0 and does not meet the condition `numCuts > k` or `numCuts == k and leftover >= x`, the value of `L` stays at 50001. The value of `R` is also fixed at 100001 from the initial state, as it was not updated beyond the third iteration. The value of `x` continues to be the midpoint between `L` and `R`, which is 75001, and `i` remains `n - 1` as it is not affected by the loop. The value of `leftover` is the result of the function `dfs(1, 1)`, which is not specified to change during the loop iterations.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `i` is `n-1`, `n` is an integer read from stdin, `a` is the first integer from the input split by space, `b` is the second integer from the input split by space, `L` and `R` are such that `R - L` equals 1, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the condition `R - L > 1` will no longer hold true because the loop continues as long as `R - L > 1`. The final values of `L` and `R` will differ by 1, meaning the search range has narrowed down to a single value. Since the loop adjusts `L` and `R` based on the conditions involving `numCuts` and `leftover`, and given that `numCuts` remains 0 after all iterations, the final value of `R` will be the last value assigned to it when `R - L` was still greater than 1. This value will be very close to the optimal solution for the problem defined by the loop logic.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
