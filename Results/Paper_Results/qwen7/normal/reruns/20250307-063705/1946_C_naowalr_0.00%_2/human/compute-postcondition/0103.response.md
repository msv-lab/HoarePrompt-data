Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer read from stdin, `a` is the first integer from the input split by space, `b` is the second integer from the input split by space.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the standard input (stdin) separated by a space and assigns them to variables `a` and `b`. The variable `i` retains its initial value of 0, and `n` remains unchanged as it was only mentioned as an integer read from stdin but not used in the code.
