You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5. The adjacency list adj is a list of lists where adj[i] contains the neighbors of vertex i in the tree. The value of n - 1 is the number of edges in the tree.
def func_1():
    t = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    for z in range(t):
        n, k = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))
        
        adj = [[] for i in range(n + 1)]
        
        for i in range(n - 1):
            a, b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))
            adj[a].append(b)
            adj[b].append(a)
        
        L = 1
        
        R = int(100000.0 + 1)
        
        numCuts = 0
        
        while R - L > 1:
            x = (L + R) // 2
            numCuts = 0
            leftover = dfs(1, 1)
            if numCuts > k or numCuts == k and leftover >= x:
                L = x
            else:
                R = x
        
        print(L)
        
    #State: `numCuts` is 0, `L` and `R` are consecutive integers with `R - L` equal to 1, `x` is the smaller of `L` and `R`, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)` from the last iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes data through predefined variables t, n, k, and adj, where t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5, and adj is an adjacency list representing a tree with n vertices. For each test case, it returns information about the tree structure based on the given parameters.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
