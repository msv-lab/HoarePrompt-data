Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is an integer read from stdin, `a` is the first integer from the input split by space, `b` is the second integer from the input split by space, `L` and `R` are either 1 and 100001 or adjusted based on the value of `numCuts` and `leftover`, `numCuts` is either greater than `k` or equal to `k` with `leftover` being greater than or equal to `x`, or `numCuts` is less than or equal to `k` or equal to `k` with `leftover` being less than `x`, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`, and `R - L > 1` holds true.**

Explanation: The code calculates the midpoint `x` between `L` and `R` using integer division. This does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `L`, `R`, `numCuts`, `leftover`, `k`, or `x` (before the calculation). After executing `x = (L + R) // 2`, the value of `x` is updated, but the conditions involving `L`, `R`, and the other variables remain unchanged.
