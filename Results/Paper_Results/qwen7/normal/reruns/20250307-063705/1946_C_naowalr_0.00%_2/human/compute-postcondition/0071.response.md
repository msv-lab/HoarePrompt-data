Output State: **`L` is 1, `i` is `n - 1`, `R` is 100001, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `numCuts` is 0.**

Explanation: The variable `numCuts` is initialized to 0, but none of the other variables (`L`, `i`, `R`, or `n`) are affected by this line of code. Therefore, their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
