Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes data through predefined variables t, n, k, and adj, where t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5, and adj is an adjacency list representing a tree with n vertices. For each test case, it returns information about the tree structure based on the given parameters.**
