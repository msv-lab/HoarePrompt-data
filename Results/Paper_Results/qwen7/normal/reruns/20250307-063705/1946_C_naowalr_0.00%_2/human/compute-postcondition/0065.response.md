Output State: **`a` is an integer equal to the first number input from stdin, `b` is an integer equal to the second number input from stdin, `adj[a]` now contains `[a, b]`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i + 1` (which is `x + 2`).**

Explanation: The code `adj[a].append(b)` appends `b` to the list `adj[a]`. Initially, `adj[b]` contains `[b, a]`, so after appending `b` to `adj[a]`, `adj[a]` will contain `[a, b]`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged, with `n` still being greater than `i + 1` (which is `x + 2`).
