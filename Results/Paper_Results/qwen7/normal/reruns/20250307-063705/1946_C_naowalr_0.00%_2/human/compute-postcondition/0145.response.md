Output State: `i` is `n-1`, `n` is an integer read from stdin, `a` is the first integer from the input split by space, `b` is the second integer from the input split by space, `L` and `R` are such that `R - L` equals 1, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the condition `R - L > 1` will no longer hold true because the loop continues as long as `R - L > 1`. The final values of `L` and `R` will differ by 1, meaning the search range has narrowed down to a single value. Since the loop adjusts `L` and `R` based on the conditions involving `numCuts` and `leftover`, and given that `numCuts` remains 0 after all iterations, the final value of `R` will be the last value assigned to it when `R - L` was still greater than 1. This value will be very close to the optimal solution for the problem defined by the loop logic.
