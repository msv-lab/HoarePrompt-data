Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an integer from the input, `adj` is a list of lists with `n + 1` elements, each being an empty list, `a` and `b` are integers read from the standard input and assigned to the variables `a` and `b` respectively, `adj[a]` now contains the elements `a` and `b`, `adj[b]` now contains the element `a`, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` and `b` are integers obtained from `map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())`**.

This means that the values of `a` and `b` have been updated to the integers read from the standard input, and the other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
