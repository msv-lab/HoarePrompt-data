Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `R - L > 1`.
2. **Current values before the loop**:
   - `R` is 100001
   - `L` is 1
3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `R - L` must be greater than 1.
   - Currently, `R - L = 100001 - 1 = 100000`, which is indeed greater than 1.
4. **Check if any adjustments are necessary**:
   - Since `R - L` is already greater than 1, no adjustments to `R` or `L` are needed for the loop to execute the first time.

Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`numCuts` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an integer from the input, `adj` is a list of lists with `n + 1` elements, each containing a set of integers representing the adjacent nodes, `L` is 1, `i` is `n - 1`, `R` is 100001**
