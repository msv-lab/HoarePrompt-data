Output State: **`a` is an integer equal to the first number input from stdin, `b` is an integer equal to the second number input from stdin, `adj[a]` now contains `[a, b]`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The code appends `b` to the list `adj[a]`, which means that if `adj[a]` was previously `[a]`, it will now be `[a, b]`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `n` remain unchanged. The variable `i` is incremented by 1.
