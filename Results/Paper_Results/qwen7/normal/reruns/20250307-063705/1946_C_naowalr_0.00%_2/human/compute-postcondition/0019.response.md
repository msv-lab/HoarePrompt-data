Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an integer from the input, `adj` is a list of lists with `n + 1` elements, each containing a set of integers representing the adjacent nodes, `L` is 1, `i` is `n - 1`, `R` is 100001**.

Explanation: The code initializes `R` as an integer value calculated by adding 1 to 100000.0, which results in 100001. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the conditions and values of the other variables remain unchanged.
