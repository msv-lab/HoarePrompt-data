Postcondition: `i` is `n-1`, `n` is an integer read from stdin, `a` is the first integer from the input split by space, `b` is the second integer from the input split by space, `L` and `R` are either 1 and 100001 or adjusted based on the value of `numCuts` and `leftover`, `numCuts` is either greater than `k` or equal to `k` with `leftover` being greater than or equal to `x`, or `numCuts` is less than or equal to `k` or equal to `k` with `leftover` being less than `x`.
