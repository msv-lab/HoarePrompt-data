For each test case, the function reads the number of test cases \( t \), the number of vertices \( n \) and a threshold \( k \) from standard input, along with the adjacency list \( adj \) representing a tree. It then determines the smallest integer \( x \) such that cutting the tree at height \( x \) results in at most \( k \) connected components, with the total number of vertices in the largest component being less than or equal to 100001. The function prints this integer \( x \) for each test case.
