Output State: **`a` is an integer equal to the first number input from stdin, `b` is an integer equal to the second number input from stdin, `adj[a]` now contains `[b]`**.

Explanation: The line `adj[a].append(b)` appends the value of `b` to the list `adj[a]`. Since `a` and `b` are integers obtained from the standard input, `adj[a]` (which is initially an empty list) now contains the element `b`. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged.
