Postcondition: `i` is `n-1`, `n` is an integer read from stdin, `a` is the first integer from the input split by space, `b` is the second integer from the input split by space, `L` and `R` are adjusted based on the condition of `numCuts` and `leftover`, `numCuts` is updated accordingly, and `x` is recalculated as `(L + R) // 2`, `leftover` is the result of the dfs(1, 1) function call. If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or equal to `k` with `leftover` being greater than or equal to `x`, then `L` is set to `x`. Otherwise, `L` is set to 1 and `R` is set to `(L + R) // 2`, `numCuts` is reset to 0.
