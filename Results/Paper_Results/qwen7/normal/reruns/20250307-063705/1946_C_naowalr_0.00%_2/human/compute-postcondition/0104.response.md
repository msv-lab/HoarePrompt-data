Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer read from stdin, `a` is the first integer from the input split by space, `b` is the second integer from the input split by space, `adj[a]` includes `b`**.

Explanation: The line `adj[a].append(b)` appends the value of `b` to the list `adj[a]`. Since `a` and `b` are the first and second integers from the input split by space respectively, and no other changes are made to `i`, `n`, `a`, or `b`, these variables retain their initial values. The only new information is that `b` is now included in the list `adj[a]`.
