Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is an integer read from stdin, `a` is the first integer from the input split by space, `b` is the second integer from the input split by space, for every iteration `i` in the range `n-1`, both `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` include each other, meaning the graph represented by `adj` is fully constructed with all nodes connected.**

This output state indicates that after the loop has executed all its iterations (i.e., `n-1` times), the variable `i` will be equal to `n-1`. The adjacency list `adj` will be completely filled such that for every edge `(a, b)` provided in the input, both `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` will contain each other, forming a fully connected graph with `n` nodes.
