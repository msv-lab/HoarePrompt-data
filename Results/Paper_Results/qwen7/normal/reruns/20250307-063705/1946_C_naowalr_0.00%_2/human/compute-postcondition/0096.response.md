Output State: `numCuts` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `L` is 50001, `R` is 100001, `x` is 75001, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`.

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `L` remains 50001 because in the last iteration, `numCuts` is 0 and `leftover` (which is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`) is less than `x` (75001). The condition `numCuts > k` or (`numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` >= `x`) is not met, so `L` does not change from 75001 to 50001. Therefore, `L` stays at 50001, and since the loop terminates when `R - L <= 1`, the final values of `L` and `R` will be the same, both being 50001. The other variables (`i`, `numCuts`, `x`, and `leftover`) retain their values from the last iteration of the loop.
