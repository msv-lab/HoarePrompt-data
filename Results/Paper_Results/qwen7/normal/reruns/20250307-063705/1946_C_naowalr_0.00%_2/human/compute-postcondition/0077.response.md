Output State: **`L` is 50001, `R` is 100001, `x` is 50001, `i` is `n - 1`, `numCuts` is greater than `k` or (`numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`).**

Explanation: The variable `L` is updated to the value of `x`, which is 50001. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state. Therefore, `R` remains 100001, `x` remains 50001, `i` remains `n - 1`, and the condition for `numCuts` remains the same.
