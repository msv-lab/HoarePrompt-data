Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an integer from the input, `adj` is a list of lists with `n + 1` elements, each containing a set of integers representing the adjacent nodes, `L` is 1, `i` is `n - 1`, `R` is 100001, `x` is `(1 + 100001) // 2`**.

This means that the variable `x` is assigned the value of `(1 + 100001) // 2`, which simplifies to `50001`. All other variables retain their initial or previously mentioned states.
