Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies `i` and `n` as the variables involved in the loop condition `i in range(n - 1)`.

2. **Determine the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is an integer read from stdin
   - `a` is the first integer from the input split by space
   - `b` is the second integer from the input split by space
   - `adj[b]` now includes `a`, `a`, and `b`

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < n - 1`.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is read from stdin and does not change within the loop.
   - The values of `a`, `b`, and `adj[b]` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer read from stdin, `a` is the first integer from the input split by space, `b` is the second integer from the input split by space, `adj[b]` now includes `a`, `a`, and `b`**
