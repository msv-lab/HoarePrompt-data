Output State: **`L` is 1, `i` is `n - 1`, `R` is 100001, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, all other variables and the structure of `adj` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `R = int(100000.0 + 1)` assigns the value `100001` (after converting `100000.0 + 1` to an integer) to the variable `R`. All other variables (`L`, `i`, `n`, and the structure of `adj`) remain unchanged.
