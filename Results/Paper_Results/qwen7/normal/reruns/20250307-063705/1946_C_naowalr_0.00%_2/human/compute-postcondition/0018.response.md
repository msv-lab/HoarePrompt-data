Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an integer from the input, `adj` is a list of lists with `n + 1` elements, each containing a set of integers representing the adjacent nodes, `L` is 1, `i` is `n - 1`.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `L` to 1. This does not affect the values of `t`, `z`, `n`, `k`, or `adj`. The value of `i` remains unchanged as well, staying at `n - 1`. Therefore, the output state retains all the conditions and values from the initial state except for the new assignment to `L`.
