Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an integer from the input, `adj` is a list of lists with `n + 1` elements, each being an empty list, `a` is the first integer input, `b` is the second integer input, `adj[b]` now contains the elements `a` and `b`.**

Explanation: The code appends `a` to the list `adj[b]`. Initially, `adj[b]` is an empty list. After executing the line `adj[b].append(a)`, `adj[b]` now contains both `a` and `b`. All other variables remain unchanged.
