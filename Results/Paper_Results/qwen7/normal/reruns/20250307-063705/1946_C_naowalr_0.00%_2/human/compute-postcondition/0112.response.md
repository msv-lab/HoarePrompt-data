Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer read from stdin, `a` is the first integer from the input split by space, `b` is the second integer from the input split by space, `adj[b]` now includes `a`, `a`, and `b`, `adj[a]` now includes `b`**.

Explanation: The code appends `b` to the list `adj[a]`. Initially, `adj[b]` contains `[a, a, b]`. After executing `adj[a].append(b)`, `adj[a]` will include `b`. All other variables remain unchanged.
