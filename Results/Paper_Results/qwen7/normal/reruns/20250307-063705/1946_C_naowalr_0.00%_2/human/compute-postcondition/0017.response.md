Output State: `t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an integer from the input, `adj` is a list of lists with `n + 1` elements, each containing a set of integers representing the adjacent nodes. Specifically, for every pair `(a, b)` where `a` and `b` are integers read from the standard input, `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` will contain each other, and `i` is `n - 1`.

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, the adjacency list `adj` will represent a graph where each edge between nodes `a` and `b` is bidirectional, as both `a` and `b` will point to each other in their respective adjacency lists. The variable `i` will be equal to `n - 1`, indicating that the loop has completed its full iteration count.
