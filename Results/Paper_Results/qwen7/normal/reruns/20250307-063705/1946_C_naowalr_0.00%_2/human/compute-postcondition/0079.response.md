Output State: **`L` is 1, `R` is 50001, `x` is 50001, `i` is `n - 1`, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of dfs(1, 1)**.

Explanation: The code `R = x` updates the value of `R` to be equal to `x`. Given that `x` is 50001, `R` is now also 50001. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
