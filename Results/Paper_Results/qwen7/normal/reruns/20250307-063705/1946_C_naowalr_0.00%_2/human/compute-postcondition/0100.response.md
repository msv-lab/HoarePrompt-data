Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `L` is 50001, `R` is 100001, `x` is 75001, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, `n` is an integer read from stdin, `k` is an integer read from stdin.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers, `n` and `k`, from standard input using `sys.stdin.readline()`. These values are then assigned to the variables `n` and `k`. All other variables (`numCuts`, `i`, `L`, `R`, `x`, and `leftover`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
