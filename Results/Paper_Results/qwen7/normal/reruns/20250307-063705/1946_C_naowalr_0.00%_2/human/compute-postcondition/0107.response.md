Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer read from stdin, `a` is the first integer from the input split by space, `b` is the second integer from the input split by space, `adj[a]` now includes `b`, `adj[b]` now includes `a`**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the standard input using `sys.stdin.readline().split()` and then converts them into integers using `map(int, ...)`. These two integers are then assigned to variables `a` and `b`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged, and the adjacency lists `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` are updated to include each other.
