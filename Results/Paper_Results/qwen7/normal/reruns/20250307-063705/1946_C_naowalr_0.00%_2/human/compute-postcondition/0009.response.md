Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an integer from the input, `adj` is a list of lists with `n + 1` elements, each being an empty list, `a` is the first integer input, `b` is the second integer input, `adj[b]` now contains the elements `a` and `b`, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` and `b` are integers read from the standard input and assigned to the variables `a` and `b` respectively.**

This output state reflects that the values of `t`, `z`, `n`, `k`, `adj`, `a`, and `b` remain as per their initial conditions, except that `a` and `b` are updated to the integers read from the standard input. The variable `i` remains unchanged as the code does not affect its value.
