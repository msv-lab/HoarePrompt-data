Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an integer from the input, `adj` is a list of lists with `n + 1` elements, each being an empty list, `a` and `b` are integers read from the standard input and assigned to the variables `a` and `b` respectively, `adj[a]` now contains the elements `a` and `b`, `i` is `n - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `adj[a].append(b)` appends the value of `b` to the list `adj[a]`. Since `a` and `b` were previously read from the standard input and `adj[a]` was initialized to contain the elements `a` and `b`, appending `b` again means `adj[a]` will now contain `[a, b, b]`. However, since the initial state already mentioned that `adj[a]` contains `a` and `b`, the updated state is that `adj[a]` now contains the elements `a` and `b` (with `b` being appended again). All other variables remain unchanged.
