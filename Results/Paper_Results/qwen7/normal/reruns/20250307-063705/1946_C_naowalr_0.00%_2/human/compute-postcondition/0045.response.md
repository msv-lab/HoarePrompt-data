Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, `L` is the integer division of `(L + R)` by 2, and `leftover` is reassigned to the result of `dfs(1, 1)`**.

Explanation: The code `L = x` assigns the value of `x` to `L`. The value of `x` is defined as the integer division of `(L + R)` by 2. Since `R` is not defined in the initial state, it remains undefined, but the relationship between `L` and `R` is established. All other variables (`numCuts`, `leftover`, and the previous definition of `leftover`) remain unchanged.
