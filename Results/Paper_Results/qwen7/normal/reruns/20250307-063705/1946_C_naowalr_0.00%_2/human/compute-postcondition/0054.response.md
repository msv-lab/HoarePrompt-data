Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, `L` is a value between 1 and 100001 inclusive, `R` is the same as `L`, `n` is an integer read from standard input, `k` is an integer read from standard input, `adj` is a list of empty lists with indices from 0 to n inclusive.**

Explanation: The code initializes an adjacency list `adj` with `n + 1` empty lists. This means that each index from 0 to n now points to an empty list. The values of `numCuts`, `leftover`, `L`, `R`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.
