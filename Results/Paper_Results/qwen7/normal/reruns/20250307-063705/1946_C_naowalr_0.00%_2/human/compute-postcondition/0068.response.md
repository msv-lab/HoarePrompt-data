Output State: The adjacency list `adj` will contain edges for all pairs of integers `(a, b)` that were input from standard input, such that `adj[a]` will contain `b` and `adj[b]` will contain `a`. The variable `i` will be equal to `n - 1`, and `n` will be greater than `i + 1` (which is `n`), indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. All other variables from the initial state, such as `numCuts`, `leftover`, `L`, `R`, `a`, `b`, and the structure of `adj` for indices not involved in the input pairs, will remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
