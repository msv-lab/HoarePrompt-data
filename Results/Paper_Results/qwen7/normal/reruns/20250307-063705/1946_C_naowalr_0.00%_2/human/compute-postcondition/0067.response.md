Output State: All integers `a` and `b` entered from stdin will have their corresponding entries in `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` such that both lists contain each other exactly once. The variable `i` will be equal to `n - 1`. The variable `n` will remain as it was initially read from stdin and will be greater than or equal to 2 since the loop runs at least once.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the adjacency list `adj` will represent an undirected graph where each pair of vertices `(a, b)` will be connected by an edge, and each vertex will appear in the adjacency list of the other exactly once. The variable `i` will reflect the total number of iterations the loop ran, which is `n - 1`. The variables `a` and `b` will hold the last pair of integers read from stdin during the loop's final iteration.
