Postcondition: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is an integer read from stdin, `a` is the first integer from the input split by space, `b` is the second integer from the input split by space, `L` and `R` are either 1 and 100001 or adjusted based on the value of `numCuts` and `leftover`, `numCuts` is either greater than `k` or equal to `k` with `leftover` being greater than or equal to `x`, or `numCuts` is less than or equal to `k` or equal to `k` with `leftover` being less than `x`, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`, `numCuts` is 0, `R - L > 1` holds true, `leftover` is the result of dfs(1, 1). If `numCuts > k` or (`numCuts == k` and `leftover >= x`), then `R` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `R` is set to `x`.**
