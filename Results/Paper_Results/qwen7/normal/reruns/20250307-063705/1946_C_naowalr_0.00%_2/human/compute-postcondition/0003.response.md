Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 0, `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is an integer from the input, `adj` is a list of lists with `n + 1` elements, each being an empty list.**

Explanation: The code creates a list of lists named `adj`. This list contains `n + 1` elements, and each element is initialized as an empty list. The values of `t`, `z`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.
