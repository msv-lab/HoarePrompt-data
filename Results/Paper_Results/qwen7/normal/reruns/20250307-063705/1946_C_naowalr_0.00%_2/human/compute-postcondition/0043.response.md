Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, `x` is the integer division of `(L + R)` by 2.**

Explanation: The line `numCuts = 0` simply reassigns the value of `numCuts` to 0. Since `numCuts` was already 0 in the initial state, this assignment does not change its value. The other variables (`leftover` and `x`) remain unchanged as no operations are performed on them.
