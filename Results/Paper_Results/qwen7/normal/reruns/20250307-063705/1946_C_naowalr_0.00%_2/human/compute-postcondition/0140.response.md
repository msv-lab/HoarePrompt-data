Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is an integer read from stdin, `a` is the first integer from the input split by space, `b` is the second integer from the input split by space, `L` is `(L + R) // 2`, `R` is either 1 and 100001 or adjusted based on the value of `numCuts` and `leftover`, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)` after the function call, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)` after the function call.**

Explanation: The line `L = x` updates the value of `L` to be equal to `x`, which is defined as `(L + R) // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
