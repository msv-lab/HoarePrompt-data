Output State: `numCuts` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `L` is 50001, `R` is 100001, `x` is 75001, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`.

Explanation: After the first three iterations, the value of `L` is 50001, and it has not been updated further because the condition `R - L > 1` no longer holds true. This means that `R` must have been reduced to 50001 or less in subsequent iterations, causing the loop to terminate. Given that `numCuts` remains 0 and does not meet the condition `numCuts > k` or `numCuts == k and leftover >= x`, the value of `L` stays at 50001. The value of `R` is also fixed at 100001 from the initial state, as it was not updated beyond the third iteration. The value of `x` continues to be the midpoint between `L` and `R`, which is 75001, and `i` remains `n - 1` as it is not affected by the loop. The value of `leftover` is the result of the function `dfs(1, 1)`, which is not specified to change during the loop iterations.
