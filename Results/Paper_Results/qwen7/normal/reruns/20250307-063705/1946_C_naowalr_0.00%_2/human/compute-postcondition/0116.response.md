Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is an integer read from stdin, `a` is the first integer from the input split by space, `b` is the second integer from the input split by space, `L` is 1, `R` is 100001**.

Explanation: The code initializes `R` as the integer value of `100000.0 + 1`, which results in `100001`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
