Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `L` is 50001, `R` is 100001, `x` is 75001, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`**

Explanation: The code `leftover = dfs(1, 1)` assigns the result of the function `dfs(1, 1)` to the variable `leftover`. The values of the other variables (`numCuts`, `i`, `L`, `R`, `x`) remain unchanged. The function `dfs` is called with arguments `1` and `1`, but since its implementation is not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `leftover`. Therefore, `leftover` is updated to the return value of `dfs(1, 1)`.
