Output State: **`L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `x` is 50001, `i` is `n - 1`, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of dfs(1, 1)**

Explanation: The function `dfs(1, 1)` is called, which returns a value stored in `leftover`. The values of `L`, `R`, `x`, `i`, and `numCuts` remain unchanged from their initial states.
