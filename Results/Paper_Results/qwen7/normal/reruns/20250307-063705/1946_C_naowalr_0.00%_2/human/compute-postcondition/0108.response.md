Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer read from stdin, `a` is the first integer from the input split by space, `b` is the second integer from the input split by space, `adj[a]` now includes `b` and `b`, `adj[b]` now includes `a` and `a`**

Explanation: The code appends `b` to the list `adj[a]`. Since `adj[a]` already includes `b`, it now includes `b` again (though duplicates are typically not stored, the statement implies it). Similarly, `adj[b]` is updated to include `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
