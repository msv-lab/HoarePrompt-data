Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is an integer read from stdin, `a` is the first integer from the input split by space, `b` is the second integer from the input split by space, `L` and `R` are either 1 and 100001 or adjusted based on the value of `numCuts` and `leftover`, `numCuts` is either greater than `k` or equal to `k` with `leftover` being greater than or equal to `x`, or `numCuts` is less than or equal to `k` or equal to `k` with `leftover` being less than `x`, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`, `numCuts` is 0, and `R - L > 1` holds true.**

Explanation: The line `numCuts = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `numCuts`. All other variables retain their initial states as described in the initial state.
