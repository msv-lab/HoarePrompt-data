Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an integer from the input, `adj` is a list of lists with `n + 1` elements, each being an empty list, `a` is the first integer input, `b` is the second integer input, both integers are read from standard input.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from standard input using `sys.stdin.readline().split()` and converts them to integers using `map(int)`. These integers are then assigned to the variables `a` and `b`. The other variables (`t`, `z`, `n`, `k`, and `adj`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
