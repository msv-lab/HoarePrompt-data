Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is an integer read from stdin, `a` is the first integer from the input split by space, `b` is the second integer from the input split by space, `L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`**

Explanation: The line `numCuts = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `numCuts`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `L`, `R`, and `x` remain unchanged.
