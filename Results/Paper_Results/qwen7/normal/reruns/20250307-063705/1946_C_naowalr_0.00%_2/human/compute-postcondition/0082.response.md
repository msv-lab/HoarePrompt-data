Output State: **`L` is 50001, `R` is 100001, `x` is 75001, `i` is `n - 1`, `numCuts` is greater than `k` or (`numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`)**

Explanation: The value of `x` is updated to the average of `L` and `R` using integer division. Since `L` is 50001 and `R` is 100001, their average is calculated as `(50001 + 100001) // 2`, which results in 75001. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
