Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, `L` is `x`, `x` is the integer division of `(L + R)` by 2, `leftover` is updated to the result of `dfs(1, 1)`**.

Explanation: The variable `L` is assigned the value of `x`. The value of `x` is defined as the integer division of `(L + R)` by 2. The values of `numCuts` and `leftover` remain unchanged from their initial state, with `leftover` being updated to the result of `dfs(1, 1)` after the assignment.
