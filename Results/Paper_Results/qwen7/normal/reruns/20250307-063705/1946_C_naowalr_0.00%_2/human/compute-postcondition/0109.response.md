Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer read from stdin, `a` is the first integer from the input split by space, `b` is the second integer from the input split by space, `adj[b]` now includes `a`, `a`, and `b`.**

Explanation: The code appends `a` to the list `adj[b]`. Initially, `adj[b]` contains `a` and `a`. After executing `adj[b].append(a)`, `adj[b]` will contain `a`, `a`, and `b`. The values of `i`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
