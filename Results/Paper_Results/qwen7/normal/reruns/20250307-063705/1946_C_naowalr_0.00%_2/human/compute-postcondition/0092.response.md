Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `L` is 50001, `R` is 100001, `x` is 75001, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`**

Explanation: The code `leftover = dfs(1, 1)` assigns the result of the function `dfs(1, 1)` to the variable `leftover`. However, the initial state does not provide the specific value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`. Therefore, the only change is that `leftover` now holds the result of `dfs(1, 1)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
