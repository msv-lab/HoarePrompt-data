Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer read from stdin, `a` is the first integer from the input split by space, `b` is the second integer from the input split by space, `adj[b]` now includes `a`, `a`, `b`, and `adj[a]` now includes `b`**.

Explanation: The code `adj[b].append(a)` appends the value of `a` to the list `adj[b]`. Given the initial state, `adj[b]` already contains `a` and `b`. After executing the code, `adj[b]` will include `a`, `a`, and `b`. The values of `i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `adj[a]` remain unchanged.
