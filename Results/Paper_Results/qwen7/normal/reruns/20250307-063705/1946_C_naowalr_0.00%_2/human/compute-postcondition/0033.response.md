The loop condition is `while R - L > 1:`. This means the loop will continue as long as the difference between `R` and `L` is greater than 1.

To determine which states need to be adjusted, let's analyze the loop head:

- The loop head involves the variables `R` and `L`.

Given the current state:
- `numCuts` is 0.
- `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`.

The loop condition `R - L > 1` depends on the values of `R` and `L`. For the loop to execute one more time, the difference `R - L` must still be greater than 1. 

Since no adjustments were made to `R` and `L` in the previous iteration, and the loop condition is based solely on these two variables, we need to ensure that `R - L > 1` remains true for the next iteration.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `R` and `L`. Specifically, we need to ensure that `R` and `L` are such that their difference is still greater than 1.

State: **`numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, and `R - L > 1`**
