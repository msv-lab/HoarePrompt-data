Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 0, `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is an integer from the input**

The code reads two integers from the standard input and splits them into the variables `n` and `k`. The values of `t` and `z` remain unchanged. Therefore, `t` must still be greater than 0 and `z` is still 0. The values of `n` and `k` are the integers read from the input.
