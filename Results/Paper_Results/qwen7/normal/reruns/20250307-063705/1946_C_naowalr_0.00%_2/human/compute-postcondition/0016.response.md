Output State: `t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an integer from the input, `adj` is a list of lists with `n + 1` elements, each containing a total of `n-1` elements (since the loop runs `n-1` times), `a` and `b` are integers read from the standard input and assigned to the variables `a` and `b` respectively for each iteration, `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` now contain the elements added during each iteration, `i` is `n - 1`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the adjacency list `adj` will represent a connected graph with `n` nodes (numbered from 0 to `n-1`). Each node will have exactly one less edge than the number of nodes (`n-1` edges in total), as the loop runs `n-1` times, adding exactly one edge per iteration. The variables `a` and `b` will hold the last pair of nodes that were added to the adjacency list, and `i` will be equal to `n - 1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
