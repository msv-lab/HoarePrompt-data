Based on the initial state provided:

- `numCuts` is 0.
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- `L` is 50001.
- `R` is 100001.
- `x` is 75001.
- `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`.

The code snippet is:
```python
print(L)
```

From the initial state, we know that `L` is explicitly set to 50001. Since no operations are performed on `L` within the provided context, the value of `L` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be the value of `L`, which is 50001.

Output: **50001**
