Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer read from stdin, `a` is the first integer from the input split by space, `b` is the second integer from the input split by space, `adj[b]` now includes `a`, `a`, and `b`**.

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the standard input using `sys.stdin.readline().split()` and then converts them to integers using `map(int, ...)`. These two integers are then assigned to `a` and `b`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged, and `adj[b]` is updated to include `a` twice and itself.
