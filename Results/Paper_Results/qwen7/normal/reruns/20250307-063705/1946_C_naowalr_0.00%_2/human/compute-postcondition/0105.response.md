Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer read from stdin, `a` is the first integer from the input split by space, `b` is the second integer from the input split by space, `adj[a]` includes `b`, `adj[b]` now includes `a`**.

The code appends `a` to the list `adj[b]`. Initially, `adj[b]` contains `b` (since "adj[a] includes b" implies `b` was already in `adj[a]` which is the same as `adj[b]` initially). After executing the code, `a` is added to `adj[b]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
