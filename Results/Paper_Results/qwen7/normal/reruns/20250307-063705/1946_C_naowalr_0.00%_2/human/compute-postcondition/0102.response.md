Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from `0` to `n-1`. This means the loop will execute `n` times.

3. **Initial state of variables**:
   - `numCuts` is 0
   - `i` is `n - 1`
   - `L` is 50001
   - `R` is 100001
   - `x` is 75001
   - `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`
   - `n` is an integer read from stdin
   - `k` is an integer read from stdin
   - `adj` is a list of lists with length `n + 1` where each element is an empty list

4. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - The variable `i` starts at `n - 1`.
   - For the loop to execute, `i` needs to iterate from `0` to `n - 1`. Therefore, `i` must be adjusted to start from `0` and go up to `n - 1`.

Given this analysis, the only variables that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`. The initial value of `i` (`n - 1`) should be changed to `0` for the loop to start executing correctly.

**Final State**:
- `i` must be `0`
- `n` must be an integer read from stdin (to determine the number of iterations)

Therefore, the state after adjustment is:

State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer read from stdin**
