Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `numCuts` is 0
   - `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`
   - `L` is a value between 1 and 100001 inclusive
   - `R` is the same as `L`

2. **Loop Condition**: 
   - The loop continues as long as the difference between `R` and `L` is greater than 1.

3. **Loop Body**: 
   - The loop variable `z` is used to iterate over a range of `t`.
   - Inside the loop, `x` is updated as the integer division of `(L + R)` by 2.
   - Depending on some conditions (not specified here), either `L` or `R` is updated to `x`.
   - `numCuts` is reset to 0 at the beginning of each iteration but is not incremented within the loop body.

4. **Final State**: 
   - After all iterations, `numCuts` remains 0.
   - `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)` from the last iteration.
   - `L` and `R` are equal.

Given these points, let's determine the state at the start of the next iteration:

- `numCuts` is reset to 0 at the beginning of each iteration, so it remains 0.
- `leftover` is determined by the `dfs(1, 1)` function call at the start of each iteration and does not change across iterations.
- `L` and `R` are updated based on the loop condition, but since the loop condition checks if `R - L > 1`, and `L` and `R` are equal at the end of the loop, they will be updated such that `L` and `R` are still equal at the start of the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, `L` is a value between 1 and 100001 inclusive, and `R` is the same as `L`**.
