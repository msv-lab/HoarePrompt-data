Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is an integer read from stdin, `a` is the first integer from the input split by space, `b` is the second integer from the input split by space, `L` and `R` are either 1 and 100001 or adjusted based on the value of `numCuts` and `leftover`, `numCuts` is 0, `R - L > 1` holds true, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`, `R` is now equal to `x`**.

Explanation: The code `R = x` updates the value of `R` to be equal to `x`. The value of `x` is calculated as `(L + R) // 2`, which means `R` is now set to half the range between `L` and `R` (rounded down). All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
