Output State: **`a` is an integer equal to the first number input from stdin, `b` is an integer equal to the second number input from stdin, `adj[b]` now contains `[a, b]`**

Explanation: The code appends `a` to the list `adj[b]`. Initially, `adj[b]` contains `[b]`. After executing the code, `adj[b]` will contain both `b` and `a`, making it `[a, b]`. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged.
