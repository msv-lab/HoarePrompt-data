Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, `x` is the integer division of `(L + R)` by 2, `leftover` is updated to the result of `dfs(1, 1)`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `leftover` to be the result of the function `dfs(1, 1)`. The values of `numCuts` and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states.
