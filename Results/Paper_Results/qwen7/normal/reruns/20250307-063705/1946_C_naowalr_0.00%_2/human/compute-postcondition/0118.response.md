Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `R - L > 1`.
2. **Current States Before the Loop**:
   - `i` is `n-1`
   - `n` is an integer read from stdin
   - `a` is the first integer from the input split by space
   - `b` is the second integer from the input split by space
   - `L` is 1
   - `R` is 100001
   - `numCuts` is 0

3. **Determine the Variables Affecting the Loop Condition**:
   - The loop condition depends on `R` and `L`.
   - Specifically, `R - L > 1` must be true for the loop to execute.

4. **Check Current Values**:
   - `L` is 1
   - `R` is 100001

5. **Evaluate the Condition**:
   - `R - L = 100001 - 1 = 100000`
   - Since `100000 > 1`, the condition `R - L > 1` is already satisfied.

Given that the condition `R - L > 1` is already true with the current values of `L` and `R`, no adjustments are necessary to make the loop execute the first time.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is an integer read from stdin, `a` is the first integer from the input split by space, `b` is the second integer from the input split by space, `L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0**
