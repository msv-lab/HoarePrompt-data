Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an integer from the input, `adj` is a list of lists with `n + 1` elements, each containing a set of integers representing the adjacent nodes, `L` is 1, `i` is `n - 1`, `R` is 100001**

Explanation: The line `numCuts = 0` initializes the variable `numCuts` to 0. This is the only assignment operation in the given code snippet. All other variables retain their initial states as described in the initial state.
