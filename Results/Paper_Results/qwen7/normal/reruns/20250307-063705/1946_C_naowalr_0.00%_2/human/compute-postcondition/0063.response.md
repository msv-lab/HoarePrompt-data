Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n - 1)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state after the previous iteration**:
   - `a` is an integer equal to the first number input from stdin.
   - `b` is an integer equal to the second number input from stdin.
   - `adj[b]` now contains `[b, a]`.
   - `i` is `i + 1`.
   - `n` must be greater than `i + 1`.

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1, so if `i` was previously `x`, it is now `x + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than `i + 1`. Since `i` is now `x + 1`, `n` must be greater than `(x + 1) + 1`, which simplifies to `n > x + 2`.

Given this information, let's update the state:

- `a` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
- `b` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
- `adj[b]` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
- `i` is now `i + 1` (let's denote the previous value of `i` as `x`, so `i` is now `x + 1`).
- `n` must be greater than `x + 2`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`a` is an integer equal to the first number input from stdin, `b` is an integer equal to the second number input from stdin, `adj[b]` now contains `[b, a]`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i + 1` (which is `x + 2`)**.
