Output State: **`a` is an integer equal to the first number input from stdin, `b` is an integer equal to the second number input from stdin, `adj[b]` now contains `[b, a]`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`**.

Explanation: The code appends `a` to the list `adj[b]`. Initially, `adj[b]` contains `[a, b]`. After executing the code, `adj[b]` becomes `[b, a]`. The values of `a`, `b`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged except that `i` is incremented by 1.
