Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, `x` is the integer division of `(L + R)` by 2.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `x` to be the integer division of `(L + R)` by 2. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
