Postcondition: `numCuts` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `L` is 75001, `R` is 100001, `x` is 75001, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)` if `numCuts` is greater than `k` or if `numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`. Otherwise, `L` is 50001, `R` is 75001, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`.
