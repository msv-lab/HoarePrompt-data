Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, `L` is a value between 1 and 100001 inclusive, `R` is the same as `L`, `n` is an integer read from standard input, `k` is an integer read from standard input.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers, `n` and `k`, from standard input using `sys.stdin.readline().split()`. These values are then unpacked into the variables `n` and `k`. The values of `numCuts`, `leftover`, `L`, and `R` remain unchanged from their initial states.
