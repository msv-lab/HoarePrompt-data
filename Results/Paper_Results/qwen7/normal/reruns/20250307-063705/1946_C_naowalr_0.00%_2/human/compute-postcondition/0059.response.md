Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n - 1)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `a` is an integer equal to the first number input from stdin.
   - `b` is an integer equal to the second number input from stdin.
   - `adj[b]` now contains `[a, b]`.

3. **Determine the Conditions for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n - 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, if `i` was less than `n - 1`, it would increment by 1.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, if the loop can execute again, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - Therefore, `i` should be `i + 1` (let's denote the current value of `i` as `i_prev`).
   - The condition for the loop to continue (`i < n - 1`) means `i_prev + 1 < n - 1`, so `i` must be less than `n - 1` for the next iteration.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The state `i` needs to be adjusted to `i + 1`.
   - The state `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop head.

Given the above reasoning, the updated states are:

- `a` is an integer equal to the first number input from stdin.
- `b` is an integer equal to the second number input from stdin.
- `adj[b]` now contains `[a, b]`.
- `i` is `i + 1`.
- `n` must be greater than `i + 1`.

Thus, the final state is:

**State: **`a` is an integer equal to the first number input from stdin, `b` is an integer equal to the second number input from stdin, `adj[b]` now contains `[a, b]`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`**.
