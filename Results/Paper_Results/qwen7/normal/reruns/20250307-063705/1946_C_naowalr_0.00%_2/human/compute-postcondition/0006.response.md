Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an integer from the input, `adj` is a list of lists with `n + 1` elements, each being an empty list, `a` is the first integer input, `b` is the second integer input, `adj[a]` now contains the element `b`.**

Explanation: The code `adj[a].append(b)` appends the value of `b` to the list `adj[a]`. Initially, `adj` is a list of lists with `n + 1` elements, each being an empty list. After executing the code, the list at index `a` in `adj` now contains the element `b`. All other variables remain unchanged.
