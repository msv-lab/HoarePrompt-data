Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `R - L > 1`.
2. **Current States**: 
   - `numCuts` is 0
   - `i` is `n - 1`
   - `L` is 50001
   - `R` is 100001
   - `x` is 75001
   - `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`
3. **Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `R - L > 1` must hold true.

Given the current values:
- `L` is 50001
- `R` is 100001

The difference `R - L` is `100001 - 50001 = 50000`, which is greater than 1. Therefore, the loop can execute one more time without any adjustments to the states.

Since no adjustments are needed to satisfy the loop condition, we can conclude that the states do not need to be modified.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`numCuts` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `L` is 50001, `R` is 100001, `x` is 75001, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`**
