Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n`, `visited` is a list of boolean values of length `n` initialized to `False`, `coef` is a list of length `n` initialized to `None`**.

The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. This changes the value of `n` to the input integer, while the other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
