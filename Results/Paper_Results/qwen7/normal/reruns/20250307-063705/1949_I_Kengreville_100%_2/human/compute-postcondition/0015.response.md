Output State: **`i` is equal to `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `tot` is 0, `bipartite` is True.**

Explanation: The variable `bipartite` is assigned the boolean value `True`. This assignment does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, `tot`, `x[i]`, `y[i]`, or `r[i]`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
