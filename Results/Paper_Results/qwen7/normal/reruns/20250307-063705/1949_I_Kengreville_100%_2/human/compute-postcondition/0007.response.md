Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `x[0]`, `y[0]`, `r[0]` are integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `x[i], y[i], r[i] = map(int, input().split())` takes three integers as input from the user and assigns them to `x[i]`, `y[i]`, and `r[i]` respectively. Since `i` was initially 0, these values are assigned to `x[0]`, `y[0]`, and `r[0]`. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged.
