Precondition: **`n` is an integer representing the number of disks, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` containing the x-coordinates, y-coordinates, and radii of the disks respectively, `visited` is a boolean list of length `n` initialized to `False`, and `coef` is a list of length `n` initialized to `1`.**
