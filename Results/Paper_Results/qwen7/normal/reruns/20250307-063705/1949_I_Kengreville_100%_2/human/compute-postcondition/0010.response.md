Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is defined by the `for i in range(n):` statement. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `x[1]`, `y[1]`, `r[1]` are integers entered by the user (these variables are not part of the loop head, so they don't need to be adjusted).

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, so for the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 2.
   - Therefore, `i` should be 2.
   - `n` must still be greater than 0, but it does not change based on the loop itself.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` is now 2.
   - `n` must still be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0**
