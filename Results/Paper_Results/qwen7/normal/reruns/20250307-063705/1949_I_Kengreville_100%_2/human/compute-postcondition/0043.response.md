Output State: **All `coef[i]` where `i` ranges from 0 to `n-1` are set to 1, `tot` is 0, `bipartite` remains unchanged, and `ok` is True if `bipartite` is True and `tot` is not 0 for any iteration, otherwise `ok` remains False.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, each index `i` from `0` to `n-1` will have `coef[i]` set to `1` because the loop sets `coef[i]` to `1` for every unvisited `i`. The variable `tot` is reset to `0` in each iteration, so it will be `0` after all iterations. The variable `bipartite` remains unchanged as it is only modified within the `dfs` function, which is not specified further. The variable `ok` is set to `True` if `bipartite` is `True` and `tot` is not `0` for any iteration, otherwise it remains `False`.
