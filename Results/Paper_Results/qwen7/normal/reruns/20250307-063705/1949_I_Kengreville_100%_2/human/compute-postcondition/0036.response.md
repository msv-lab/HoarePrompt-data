Output State: **`coef[i]` is set to 1, `bipartite` remains unchanged, `coef[i_new + 1]` is set to 1, `tot` is set to 0, `ok` is True if `bipartite` is True and `tot` is not 0, otherwise `ok` remains unchanged.**

This means that the value of `coef[i]` is now explicitly set to 1, while the other variables (`bipartite`, `coef[i_new + 1]`, `tot`, and `ok`) retain their previous states according to the given conditions.
