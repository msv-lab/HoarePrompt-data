Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `x[1]`, `y[1]`, `r[1]` are integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code reads three integers from the user input and assigns them to `x[i]`, `y[i]`, and `r[i]` respectively, where `i` is 1. The values of `i` and the condition on `n` remain unchanged. The values of `x[1]`, `y[1]`, and `r[1]` are now specific integers entered by the user.
