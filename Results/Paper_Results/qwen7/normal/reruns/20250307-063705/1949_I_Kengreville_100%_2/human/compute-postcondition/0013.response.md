Output State: `i` is equal to `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `x[i]`, `y[i]`, `r[i]` are integers entered by the user for each valid index `i` from `0` to `n-1`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n-1`, indicating that the loop has completed all `n` iterations. The lists `x`, `y`, and `r` will each contain `n` integers, which are the values entered by the user during each iteration of the loop.
