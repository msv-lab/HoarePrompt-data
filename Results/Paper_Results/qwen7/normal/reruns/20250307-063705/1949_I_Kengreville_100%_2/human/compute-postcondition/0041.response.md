Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 1, `bipartite` remains unchanged, `coef[i_new + 1]` is set to 1, `tot` is set to 0, and `ok` remains unchanged. If `not visited[i]` is true, then `dfs(i)` has been called, `bipartite` remains unchanged, `coef[i_new + 1]` is set to 1, `tot` is set to 0, and `ok` remains unchanged.
