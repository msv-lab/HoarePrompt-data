You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000. x, y, and r are lists of length n, where for each i (0 ≤ i < n), x[i], y[i] are integers such that -10^9 ≤ x[i], y[i] ≤ 10^9, and r[i] is an integer such that 1 ≤ r[i] ≤ 10^9. visited is a list of boolean values of length n initialized to False. coef is a list of length n initialized to None.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    x = [None] * n
    y = [None] * n
    r = [None] * n
    visited = [False] * n
    coef = [None] * n
    for i in range(n):
        x[i], y[i], r[i] = map(int, input().split())
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is equal to `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `x[i]`, `y[i]`, `r[i]` are integers entered by the user for each valid index `i` from `0` to `n-1`.
    #
    #This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n-1`, indicating that the loop has completed all `n` iterations. The lists `x`, `y`, and `r` will each contain `n` integers, which are the values entered by the user during each iteration of the loop.
    tot = 0
    bipartite = True
    ok = False
    for i in range(n):
        if not visited[i]:
            coef[i] = 1
            tot = 0
            bipartite = True
            dfs(i)
            ok = ok or bipartite and tot != 0
        
    #State: All `coef[i]` where `i` ranges from 0 to `n-1` are set to 1, `tot` is 0, `bipartite` remains unchanged, and `ok` is True if `bipartite` is True and `tot` is not 0 for any iteration, otherwise `ok` remains False.
    if ok :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
    else :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    #State: All `coef[i]` where `i` ranges from 0 to `n-1` are set to 1, `tot` is 0, `bipartite` remains unchanged, and `ok` remains False.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but works with predefined lists n, x, y, r, visited, and coef. It processes these lists to determine some condition or perform some action based on the given constraints.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
