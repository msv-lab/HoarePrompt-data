Output State: **`coef[i]` is set to 1, the current value of `i` is such that it has not been visited, and `n` must be greater than 0; `tot` is 0.**

The variable `tot` is initialized to 0, but no other changes are made to the initial state. Therefore, `coef[i]` remains set to 1, `i` has not been visited, `n` must be greater than 0, and `tot` is now 0.
