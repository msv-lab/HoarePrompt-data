Output State: **`dfs(i)` has been called, `bipartite` is set to True, `coef[i_new + 1]` is set to 1, `tot` is set to 0, `ok` is set to `ok or (True and False)`, which simplifies to `ok or False`, thus `ok` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The variable `ok` is updated to `ok or bipartite and tot != 0`. Given that `bipartite` is `True` and `tot` is `0`, the condition `bipartite and tot != 0` evaluates to `False`. Therefore, `ok` remains unchanged from its previous state.
