Output State: **`coef[i]` is set to 1, the current value of `i` is such that it has not been visited, and `n` must be greater than 0**.

This means that the coefficient at index `i` in the list `coef` is now set to 1, while the conditions on `n` and the status of `i` remain unchanged from the initial state.
