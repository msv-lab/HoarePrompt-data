Based on the initial state provided:

- `coef[i]` for `i` ranging from 0 to `n-1` are all set to 1.
- `tot` is 0.
- `bipartite` remains unchanged, but its value is not specified.
- `ok` remains True if `bipartite` is True and `tot` is not 0 for any iteration, otherwise `ok` remains False.

The print statement is simply `print('YES')`.

Since the print statement directly outputs the string `'YES'`, regardless of the values of other variables, the output will be:

Output: **YES**
