Output State: **`coef[i]` is set to 1, `coef[i+1]` is set to 1, `tot` is set to 0, and `ok` remains unchanged.**

The code simply assigns the value `0` to the variable `tot`. Since the initial state of `tot` was `0`, it remains unchanged. All other variables (`coef[i]`, `coef[i+1]`, and `ok`) are not affected by this assignment.
