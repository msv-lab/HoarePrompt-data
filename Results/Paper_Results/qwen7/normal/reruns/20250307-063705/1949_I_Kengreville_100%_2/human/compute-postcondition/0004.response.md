Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of length `n` initialized to `None`, `y` is a list of length `n` initialized to `None`, `r` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to `None`, `visited` is a list of boolean values of length `n` with all elements set to `False`, `coef` is a list of length `n` initialized to `None`**.

Explanation: The code `visited = [False] * n` initializes the `visited` list to a list of `n` boolean values, all set to `False`. This updates the `visited` list while keeping the other lists and variables unchanged.
