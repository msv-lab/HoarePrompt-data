Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 1, `bipartite` remains unchanged, `coef[i+1]` is set to 1, `tot` is set to 0, and `ok` is True if `bipartite` is True and `tot` is not 0, otherwise `ok` remains unchanged. If `visited[i]` is False, then `coef[i]` is set to 1, `coef[i+1]` is set to 1, `tot` is set to 0, and `ok` is set to True. If `visited[i]` is True, then `coef[i+1]` remains 1, `tot` remains 0, and `ok` remains unchanged.
