Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to `n-1`.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will run as long as `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop starts with `i` being `n-1`, the loop will run if `n-1 < n`, which is always true as long as `n > 0`.
   - Therefore, the only variable that needs adjustment is `n`, ensuring it is greater than 0.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

- `n` must be greater than 0 (to ensure the loop runs).

Since `i` is already correctly initialized to `n-1`, no further adjustments are needed for `i`.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`n` must be greater than 0**.
