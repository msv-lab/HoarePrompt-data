Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(n):`.
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Initial Conditions:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, the postconditions are:
     - `n` must be greater than 0.
     - `bipartite` remains unchanged.
     - `coef[i]` is set to 1.
     - `tot` is set to 0.
     - `ok` is True if `bipartite` is True and `tot` is not 0, otherwise `ok` remains unchanged.

3. **Determine the Changes After One Iteration:**
   - The variable `i` will be incremented by 1 after each iteration.
   - The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is the upper limit of the range.

4. **Check the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `n` remains unchanged and `i` is incremented by 1, `i` will be 1 more than its value at the end of the previous iteration.

5. **Adjust the States:**
   - `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `bipartite` remains unchanged.
   - `coef[i]` will be set to 1 (this happens within the loop body).
   - `tot` will be set to 0 (this happens within the loop body).
   - `ok` will be updated based on the new values of `bipartite` and `tot`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `bipartite` remains unchanged.
- `coef[i]` is set to 1.
- `tot` is set to 0.
- `ok` is updated based on the new values of `bipartite` and `tot`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `bipartite` remains unchanged, `coef[i+1]` is set to 1, `tot` is set to 0, and `ok` is True if `bipartite` is True and `tot` is not 0, otherwise `ok` remains unchanged**.
