Output State: **`i` is equal to `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `tot` is 0, `x[i]`, `y[i]`, `r[i]` are integers entered by the user for each valid index `i` from `0` to `n-1`.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `tot` to 0. This does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, `x`, `y`, or `r`. After the loop completes, `i` is set to `n-1`, indicating that the loop has run `n` times. The values of `x[i]`, `y[i]`, and `r[i]` remain as integers entered by the user during each iteration of the loop. The only new information is that `tot` is now 0.
