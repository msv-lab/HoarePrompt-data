Output State: **`coef[i]` is set to 1, `bipartite` remains unchanged, `coef[i_new + 1]` is set to 1, `tot` is set to 0, `ok` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The line `tot = 0` sets the variable `tot` to 0. No other changes are made to the other variables (`coef[i]`, `bipartite`, `coef[i_new + 1]`, `ok`). Therefore, their states remain as they were in the initial state.
