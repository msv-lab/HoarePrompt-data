Based on the initial state provided:

- `coef[i]` where `i` ranges from 0 to `n-1` are all set to 1.
- `tot` is 0.
- `bipartite` remains unchanged, but its value is not relevant to the print statement.
- `ok` remains False, but again, its value is not relevant to the print statement.

The print statement simply outputs the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
