Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is defined by the `for i in range(n):` statement. The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `x[0]`, `y[0]`, `r[0]` are integers entered by the user (these are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted)

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `i < n` must hold true.
   - Since `i` is currently 0, the loop will execute as long as `n > 0`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 1.
   - `n` must still be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
- `i` becomes 1
- `n` must still be greater than 0

So, the updated state is:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0**
