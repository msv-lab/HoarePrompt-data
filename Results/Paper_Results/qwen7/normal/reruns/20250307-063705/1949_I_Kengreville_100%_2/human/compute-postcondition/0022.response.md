Output State: **`bipartite` is True, `coef[i]` is set to 1, the current value of `i` is such that it has not been visited, and `n` must be greater than 0; `tot` is 0.**

Explanation: The variable `bipartite` is assigned the value `True`, which means it is now known to be `True`. The other variables (`coef[i]`, `i`, `n`, and `tot`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
