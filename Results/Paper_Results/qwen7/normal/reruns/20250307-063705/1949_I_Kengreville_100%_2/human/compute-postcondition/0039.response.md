Output State: **`dfs(i)` has been called, `bipartite` is set to True, `coef[i_new + 1]` is set to 1, `tot` is set to 0, `ok` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `dfs(i)` is a function call that affects the execution flow but does not directly modify the values of the variables listed in the initial state. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
