Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of length `n` initialized to `None`, `y` is a list of length `n` initialized to `None`, `r` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to `None`, `visited` is a list of boolean values of length `n` with all elements set to `False`, `coef` is a list of length `n` initialized to `None`, `coef` is now a list of length `n` with all elements set to `None`.**

The code `coef = [None] * n` initializes the list `coef` to a list of length `n` with all elements set to `None`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
