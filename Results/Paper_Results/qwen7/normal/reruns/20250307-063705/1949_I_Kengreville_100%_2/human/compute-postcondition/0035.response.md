Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables involved in the loop head:**
   - The loop variable is `i`.
   - The loop condition is `i < n`.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration:**
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `bipartite` remains unchanged.
   - `coef[i+1]` is set to 1.
   - `tot` is set to 0.
   - `ok` is True if `bipartite` is True and `tot` is not 0, otherwise `ok` remains unchanged.
   - If `visited[i]` is False, then `coef[i]` is set to 1, `coef[i+1]` is set to 1, `tot` is set to 0, and `ok` is set to True.
   - If `visited[i]` is True, then `coef[i+1]` remains 1, `tot` remains 0, and `ok` remains unchanged.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration:**
   - Since the loop condition is `i < n`, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `bipartite` remains unchanged.
   - `coef[i+1]` is set to 1 (this will be true for the next value of `i`).
   - `tot` is set to 0.
   - `ok` is determined based on the new values of `bipartite` and `tot`.

Given these points, let's summarize the state adjustments:

- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `bipartite` remains unchanged.
- `coef[i+1]` is set to 1.
- `tot` is set to 0.
- `ok` is determined based on the new values of `bipartite` and `tot`.

Since the exact value of `i` is not specified, we can denote it as `i_new = i + 1`.

**Final State:**
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `bipartite` remains unchanged.
- `coef[i_new + 1]` is set to 1.
- `tot` is set to 0.
- `ok` is True if `bipartite` is True and `tot` is not 0, otherwise `ok` remains unchanged.

Thus, the final state is:

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `bipartite` remains unchanged, `coef[i+2]` is set to 1, `tot` is set to 0, and `ok` is True if `bipartite` is True and `tot` is not 0, otherwise `ok` remains unchanged.**
