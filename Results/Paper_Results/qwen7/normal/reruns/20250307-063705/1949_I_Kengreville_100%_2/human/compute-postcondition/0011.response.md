Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `x[2]`, `y[2]`, `r[2]` are integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `x[i], y[i], r[i] = map(int, input().split())` takes three integers as input from the user and assigns them to `x[i]`, `y[i]`, and `r[i]` respectively. Since `i` is 2, these assignments are specifically for the index 2 of the lists `x`, `y`, and `r`. The initial conditions that `i` is 2 and `n` must be greater than 0 remain unchanged.
