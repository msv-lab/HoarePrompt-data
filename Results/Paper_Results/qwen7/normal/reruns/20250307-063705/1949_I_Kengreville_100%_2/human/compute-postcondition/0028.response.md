Output State: **`coef[i]` is set to 1, `coef[i+1]` is set to 1, `tot` is set to 0, and `ok` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `coef[i] = 1` sets the value of `coef[i]` to 1. The other variables (`bipartite`, `tot`, and `ok`) remain unchanged according to the initial state and the code provided.
