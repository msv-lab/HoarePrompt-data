Postcondition: `res` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers where each integer is less than \(2^{31}\), `count` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where the key is the first element of `a` and the value is not specified, `num` is the first element in the list `a`. The current value of `num` is not in the dictionary `count`.
