You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

Example

Input

    10
    
    1 9
    
    8 4
    
    1 4
    
    3 4
    
    2 0
    
    2 4
    
    6 9
    
    3 3
    
    0 0
    
    9 9

Output

    1 9
    4 8
    1 4
    3 4
    0 2
    2 4
    6 9
    3 3
    0 0
    9 9

- Program:
def func():
    x = int(input())
    for i in range(x):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if x < y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases defined by an integer `t`. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y`, then prints them in ascending order. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading an integer `x` which represents the number of test cases. This part is correct and matches the problem description.
   
2. **Loop Through Test Cases**: The program then uses a `for` loop to iterate through each test case. This is also correct and follows the problem description.

3. **Reading Test Case Inputs**: Inside the loop, it reads two space-separated integers `x` and `y` using `input().split()`. This is correct as per the problem statement.

4. **Determining Minimum and Maximum**: The program checks if `x` is less than `y` and prints them accordingly. If `x` is not less than `y`, it swaps their order before printing. This logic is correct for determining the minimum and maximum values.

5. **Output Format**: The output format matches the problem statement, where for each test case, the minimum value is printed followed by the maximum value.

6. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as when `x` equals `y` correctly by printing the same number twice.

Given that the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all specified cases accurately, the program is correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**

```plaintext
Correctness: True
