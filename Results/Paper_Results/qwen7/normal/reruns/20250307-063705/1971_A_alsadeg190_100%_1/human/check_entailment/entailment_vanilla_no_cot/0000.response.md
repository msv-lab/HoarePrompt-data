Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the required functionality. The program reads `x` at the beginning but then uses `x` and `y` interchangeably within the loop, which is incorrect. It should read `x` and `y` for each test case separately and then print the minimum and maximum values for each pair.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        if x < y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)

func()
```

This corrected version correctly reads the number of test cases and then reads `x` and `y` for each test case, ensuring that the correct minimum and maximum values are printed for each pair.
