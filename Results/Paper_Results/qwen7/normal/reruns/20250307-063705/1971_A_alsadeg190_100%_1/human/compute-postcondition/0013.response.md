Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `i` is 1, `x` is the first input integer, `y` is the second input integer.**

Explanation: The code `x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes two space-separated integers as input and converts them into integers, assigning the first integer to `x` and the second integer to `y`. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
