Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `i` is 1.
- `x` is the first input integer.
- `y` is the second input integer.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(y, x)
```

This statement will print the value of `y` followed by the value of `x`.

Output: **y x (where y is the second input integer and x is the first input integer)**
