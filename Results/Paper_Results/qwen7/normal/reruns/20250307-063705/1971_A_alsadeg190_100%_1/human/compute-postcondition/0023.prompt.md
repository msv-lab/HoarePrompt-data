Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `x` is an input integer
Code of the loop:
for i in range(x):
    x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if x < y:
        print(x, y)
    else:
        print(y, x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `i` is 0, `x` is an input integer and `x` is greater than 0, `y` is an input integer. If `x` is less than `y`, then `x` remains unchanged and `y` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `x` remains unchanged and `y` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `i` is 1, `x` is the first input integer, `y` is the second input integer.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `i` is 2, `x` is the first input integer, `y` is the second input integer, `x` is converted to an integer from the first input, `y` is converted to an integer from the second input. Since both the if and else parts do not change the values of `t`, `i`, `x`, and `y`, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
