Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(x)`. The variables involved in this loop are `i` and `x`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
   - `i` is 1.
   - `x` is the first input integer.
   - `y` is the second input integer.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < x`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2.
   - Therefore, `i` should be 2.
   - The value of `x` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.

5. **Final state adjustment**:
   - `t` remains the same since it is not involved in the loop.
   - `i` is now 2.
   - `x` remains the same as the first input integer.
   - `y` remains the second input integer.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `i` is 2, `x` is the first input integer, `y` is the second input integer**.
