Output State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `i` is 99 (since the loop runs from `i` in `range(x)` and `x` is an input integer which can be up to 100), `x` is the first input integer, `y` is the second input integer.

Explanation: The loop iterates `x` times, where `x` is the first input integer provided. After 99 iterations (assuming the maximum value of `x` which is 100), the final values of `i` will be 99. The values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged throughout the loop as the loop body does not modify these variables.
