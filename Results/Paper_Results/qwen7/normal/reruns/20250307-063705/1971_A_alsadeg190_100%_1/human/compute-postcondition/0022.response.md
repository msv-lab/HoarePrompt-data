Output State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `i` is 99 (since the loop runs `x` times and `x` is an input integer greater than 0), `x` is the first input integer, `y` is the second input integer.

Explanation: The loop runs `x` times, where `x` is the value of the first input integer provided. After 99 iterations, the loop will finish because the condition `i < x` will no longer be true when `i` reaches `x-1`. At this point, `i` will be 99, and the values of `x` and `y` will be the last pair of integers entered by the user during the loop's execution.
