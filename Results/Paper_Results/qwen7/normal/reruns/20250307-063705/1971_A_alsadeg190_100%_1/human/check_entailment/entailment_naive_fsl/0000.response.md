Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle multiple test cases as described in the problem statement. It reads a single integer `x` at the beginning and then processes `x` test cases in a loop, but it does not reset or properly handle the input for each test case. Specifically, after processing the first test case, it continues to use the same values of `x` and `y` for subsequent test cases, which is incorrect.

For example, consider the following input:
```
2
1 9
8 4
```

The program will produce the following output:
```
1 9
4 8
```

However, the correct output should be:
```
1 9
8 4
```

This shows that the program does not correctly handle multiple test cases, hence it is incorrect.
