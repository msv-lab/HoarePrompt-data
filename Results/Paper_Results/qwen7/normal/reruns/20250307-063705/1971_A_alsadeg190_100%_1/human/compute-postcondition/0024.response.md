Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes three integer values: t, x, and y, where t is between 1 and 100 inclusive, and x and y are between 0 and 9 inclusive. Based on these values, the function returns different outputs in two cases: if t is less than 10, it returns x; otherwise, it returns y.**

Note: The provided code snippet does not explicitly define the function to accept `t`, `x`, and `y` as parameters, but based on the constraints and the expected behavior, these values are implied to be part of the function's input context.
