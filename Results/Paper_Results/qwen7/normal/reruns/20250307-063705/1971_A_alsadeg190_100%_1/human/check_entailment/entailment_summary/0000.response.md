Reasoning:
- The problem requires outputting the minimum and maximum of two integers for each test case.
- The provided program defines a function `func()` that takes no arguments but uses `input()` to read from stdin.
- It correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y`, and prints the minimum followed by the maximum.
- However, the logic in the `for` loop is flawed because it reassigns `x` and `y` within the loop, which means the values of `x` and `y` used in the comparison and printing are not the ones originally read from the input.
- The correct approach should directly compare and print the original `x` and `y` values without reassigning them inside the loop.

Given this analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the required functionality.

Correctness: **False**
