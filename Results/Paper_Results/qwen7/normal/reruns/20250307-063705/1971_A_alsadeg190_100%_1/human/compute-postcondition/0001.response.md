State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `x` is an input integer, `i` is 0, `x` must be greater than 0**

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `x`.
   - `i` is initialized to 0 in the loop header (`for i in range(x):`).
   - `x` is the variable that determines the number of iterations.

2. **Determine Initial Values**:
   - `t` is given as an integer between 1 and 100, but this value does not directly affect the loop's execution.
   - `x` is an input integer that determines the number of iterations. For the loop to execute, `x` must be greater than 0.

3. **Adjust States**:
   - `i` is set to 0 by default in the loop header.
   - `x` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` being 0 and `x` being greater than 0.
