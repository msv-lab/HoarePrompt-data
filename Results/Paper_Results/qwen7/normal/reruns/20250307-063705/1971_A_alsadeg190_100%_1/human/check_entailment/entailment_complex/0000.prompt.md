Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

Example

Input

    10
    
    1 9
    
    8 4
    
    1 4
    
    3 4
    
    2 0
    
    2 4
    
    6 9
    
    3 3
    
    0 0
    
    9 9

Output

    1 9
    4 8
    1 4
    3 4
    0 2
    2 4
    6 9
    3 3
    0 0
    9 9

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, x and y are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 9.
def func():
    x = int(input())
    for i in range(x):
        x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if x < y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `i` is 99 (since the loop runs from `i` in `range(x)` and `x` is an input integer which can be up to 100), `x` is the first input integer, `y` is the second input integer.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop iterates `x` times, where `x` is the first input integer provided. After 99 iterations (assuming the maximum value of `x` which is 100), the final values of `i` will be 99. The values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged throughout the loop as the loop body does not modify these variables.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases defined by an integer `t`. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y`, then prints them in ascending order. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value.

# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
