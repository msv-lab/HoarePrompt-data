Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `i` is 1.
- `x` is the first input integer.
- `y` is the second input integer.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(x, y)
```

This print statement will output the values of `x` and `y`, which are the first and second input integers respectively.

Output: **x y (where x is the first input integer and y is the second input integer)**
