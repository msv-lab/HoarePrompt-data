### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading an integer `x` which represents the number of test cases. This part is correct and matches the problem description.

2. **Loop Through Test Cases**: The program then uses a `for` loop to iterate through each test case. This is also correct and follows the problem description.

3. **Reading Test Case Inputs**: Inside the loop, it reads two space-separated integers `x` and `y` using `input().split()`. This is correct as per the problem statement.

4. **Determining Minimum and Maximum**: The program checks if `x` is less than `y` and prints them accordingly. If `x` is not less than `y`, it swaps their order before printing. However, there is a critical issue with this approach. The variables `x` and `y` inside the loop are redefined with the new input values, but the outer variable `x` (which holds the number of test cases) is not updated. Therefore, the loop will always use the same value of `x` (the number of test cases) instead of iterating over the test cases themselves.

5. **Output Format**: The output format matches the problem statement, where for each test case, the minimum value is printed followed by the maximum value. However, due to the issue mentioned above, the loop will not process the test cases correctly.

6. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as when `x` equals `y` correctly by printing the same number twice. But since the loop does not process the test cases properly, this handling is irrelevant.

Given that the loop does not correctly process the test cases because it uses the same value of `x` (the number of test cases) instead of iterating over the test cases themselves, the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is inaccurate because the program does not correctly process the test cases due to the misuse of the loop variable `x`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
