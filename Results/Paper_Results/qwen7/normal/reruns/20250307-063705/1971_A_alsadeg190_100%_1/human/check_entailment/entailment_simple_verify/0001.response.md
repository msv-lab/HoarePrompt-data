### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `x` and then iterates through each test case using a `for` loop. This matches the problem description.

2. **Reading Test Case Inputs**: Inside the loop, the program reads two space-separated integers `x` and `y` using `input().split()`. However, there is a critical issue here. The variables `x` and `y` inside the loop are shadowing the outer `x` variable, which was assigned the number of test cases. This means that the values of `x` and `y` read from the input are being used incorrectly. 

3. **Determining Minimum and Maximum**: The logic for determining the minimum and maximum values is correct. However, due to the shadowing issue, the values of `x` and `y` used in the comparison are not the intended values. Instead, they are the values from the current test case.

4. **Output Format**: The output format is correct, but since the values of `x` and `y` are incorrect due to the shadowing issue, the output will be incorrect.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program should handle the edge case where `x` equals `y` correctly, but since the values of `x` and `y` are incorrect, this edge case handling will also be incorrect.

Given that the program shadows the outer `x` variable with the inner `x` variable, leading to incorrect values being used for comparison and output, the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment was inaccurate because the program has a logical error due to variable shadowing, which leads to incorrect outputs.
