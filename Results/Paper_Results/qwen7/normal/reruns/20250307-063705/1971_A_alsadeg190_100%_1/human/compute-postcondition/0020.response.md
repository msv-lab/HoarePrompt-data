Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `i` is 2.
- `x` is the first input integer.
- `y` is the second input integer.
- `x` is converted to an integer from the first input.
- `y` is converted to an integer from the second input.

The `print(y, x)` statement will print the values of `y` and `x`.

Output: **y, x (where y is the second input integer and x is the first input integer)**
