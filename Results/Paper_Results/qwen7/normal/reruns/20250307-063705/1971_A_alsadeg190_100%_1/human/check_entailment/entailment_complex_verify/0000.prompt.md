You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

Example

Input

    2 4
    
    6 9
    
    3 3
    
    0 0
    
    9 9

Output

    1 9
    4 8
    1 4
    3 4
    0 2
    2 4
    6 9
    3 3

- Program: 
def func():
    x = int(input())
    for i in range(x):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if x < y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, x and y are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 9.
def func():
    x = int(input())
    for i in range(x):
        x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if x < y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `i` is 99 (since the loop runs from `i` in `range(x)` and `x` is an input integer which can be up to 100), `x` is the first input integer, `y` is the second input integer.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop iterates `x` times, where `x` is the first input integer provided. After 99 iterations (assuming the maximum value of `x` which is 100), the final values of `i` will be 99. The values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged throughout the loop as the loop body does not modify these variables.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases defined by an integer `t`. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y`, then prints them in ascending order. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle multiple test cases as described in the problem statement. It reads a single integer `x` at the beginning and then processes `x` test cases in a loop, but it does not reset or properly handle the input for each test case. Specifically, after processing the first test case, it continues to use the same values of `x` and `y` for subsequent test cases, which is incorrect.

For example, consider the following input:
```
2
1 9
8 4
```

The program will produce the following output:
```
1 9
4 8
```

However, the correct output should be:
```
1 9
8 4
```

This shows that the program does not correctly handle multiple test cases, hence it is incorrect.
