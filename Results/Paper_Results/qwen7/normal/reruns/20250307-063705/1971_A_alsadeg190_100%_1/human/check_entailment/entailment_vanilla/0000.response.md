### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading an integer `x` which represents the number of test cases. This part is correct and matches the problem description.
   
2. **Loop Through Test Cases**: The program then uses a `for` loop to iterate through each test case. This is also correct and follows the problem description.

3. **Reading Test Case Inputs**: Inside the loop, it reads two space-separated integers `x` and `y` using `input().split()`. This is correct as per the problem statement.

4. **Determining Minimum and Maximum**: The program checks if `x` is less than `y` and prints them accordingly. If `x` is not less than `y`, it swaps their order before printing. This logic is correct for determining the minimum and maximum values.

5. **Output Format**: The output format matches the problem statement, where for each test case, the minimum value is printed followed by the maximum value.

6. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as when `x` equals `y` correctly by printing the same number twice.

Given that the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all specified cases accurately, the program is correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
