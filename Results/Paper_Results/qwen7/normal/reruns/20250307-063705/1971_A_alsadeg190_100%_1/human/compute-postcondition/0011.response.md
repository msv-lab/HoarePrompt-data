Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `x`.
2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < x`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
   - `i` is 0.
   - `x` is an input integer and `x` is greater than 0.
   - `y` is an input integer.
   - If `x` is less than `y`, then `x` remains unchanged and `y` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `x` remains unchanged and `y` remains unchanged.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 1.
   - Therefore, `i` becomes 1.
   - The value of `x` does not change because it is the upper limit of the loop, and the condition for the loop to continue is `i < x`.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the loop.
   - `i` is now 1.
   - `x` remains unchanged.
   - `y` remains unchanged.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `i` is 1, `x` is an input integer and `x` is greater than 0, `y` is an input integer.**
