Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(x)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `x`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
   - `i` is 0.
   - `x` is an input integer and `x` is greater than 0.
   - `y` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < x`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time it runs, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would be 0 (if it just started) or some value less than `x`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` will become `i + 1`.
   - The value of `x` remains unchanged because it is the upper limit of the range and does not change within the loop.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the loop.
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value.
   - `x` remains unchanged.
   - `y` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the loop.

Given that `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, after incrementing `i` by 1, `i` will be 1. Therefore, the new state for the next iteration is:

**State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `i` is 1, `x` is an input integer and `x` is greater than 0, `y` is an input integer.**
