You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

Example

Input

    10
    
    1 9
    
    8 4
    
    1 4
    
    3 4
    
    2 0
    
    2 4
    
    6 9
    
    3 3
    
    0 0
    
    9 9

Output

    1 9
    4 8
    1 4
    3 4
    0 2
    2 4
    6 9
    3 3
    0 0
    9 9

- Program:
def func():
    x = int(input())
    for i in range(x):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if x < y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases defined by an integer `t`. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y`, then prints them in ascending order. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle multiple test cases as described in the problem statement. It reads a single integer `x` at the beginning and then processes `x` test cases in a loop, but it does not reset or properly handle the input for each test case. Specifically, after processing the first test case, it continues to use the same values of `x` and `y` for subsequent test cases, which is incorrect.

For example, consider the following input:
```
2
1 9
8 4
```

The program will produce the following output:
```
1 9
4 8
```

However, the correct output should be:
```
1 9
8 4
```

This shows that the program does not correctly handle multiple test cases, hence it is incorrect.
