Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 100, `i` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `x` is greater than 0, `y` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes two integers as input separated by a space, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `x` and `y` respectively. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `x` is updated to the first input integer, and `y` is updated to the second input integer.
