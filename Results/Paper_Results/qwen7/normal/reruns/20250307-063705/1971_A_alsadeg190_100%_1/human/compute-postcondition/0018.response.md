Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `i` is 2, `x` is the first input integer, `y` is the second input integer, `x` is converted to an integer from the first input, `y` is converted to an integer from the second input**.

Explanation: The code `x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes two space-separated integers as input, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `x` and `y` respectively. The initial values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged.
