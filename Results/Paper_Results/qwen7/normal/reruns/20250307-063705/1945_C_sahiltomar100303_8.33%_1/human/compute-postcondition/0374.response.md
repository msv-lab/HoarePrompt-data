Postcondition: `left` is greater than 0, `leftMove` is 0, `left` is equal to `mid`, `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `mid` remains as `n // 2`, `rightZero` will be incremented by the number of '0's from index `n // 2` to `n - 1`, and `rightOne` will be incremented by the number of '1's from index `n // 2` to `n - 1`. Additionally, `s[left - 1]` is not equal to '0'.
