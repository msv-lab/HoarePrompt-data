Output State: **`left` is 0, `leftMove` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `mid` remains as `n // 2`, `rightZero` is incremented by the number of '0's from index `n // 2` to `n - 2`, `rightOne` is incremented by the number of '1's from index `n // 2` to `n - 2`, `right` is `mid + 1`, `right` is now `mid + 1 + 1` (since `right += 1`)**.

Explanation: The line `right += 1` increments the value of `right` by 1. Initially, `right` was set to `mid + 1`. After executing `right += 1`, `right` becomes `mid + 2`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state and the given code snippet.
