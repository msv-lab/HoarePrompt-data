Postcondition: `leftZero` is either `leftZero - 1` or `leftZero`, and `rightOne` is either `rightOne + 1` or `rightOne`. Similarly, `leftOne` is either `leftOne - 1` or `leftOne`, and `rightZero` is either `rightZero + 1` or `rightZero`. Either `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2` or `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2` must still hold true.
