Output State: **`left` is equal to `mid` - 2, `leftMove` is 0, `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `mid` remains as `n // 2`, `rightZero` is incremented by the number of '0's from index `n // 2` to `n - 1`, `rightOne` is incremented by the number of '1's from index `n // 2` to `n - 1`. If the character at index `left - 1` (which is `mid - 2`) in the string `s` is '0', then `leftZero` is decreased by 1 and `rightZero` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `leftOne` is decreased by 1 and `rightOne` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The line `left -= 1` decrements the value of `left` by 1. Since `left` was originally equal to `mid - 1`, after decrementing, `left` becomes `mid - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state description.
