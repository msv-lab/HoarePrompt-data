Output State: `left` is 0, `leftMove` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `mid` remains as `n // 2`, `rightZero` is incremented by the number of '0's from index `n // 2` to `n - 1`, `rightOne` is incremented by the number of '1's from index `n // 2` to `n - 1`, `right` is `n`.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `right` until one of the conditions in the while loop is no longer met. After executing the loop three times, `right` is at `n // 2 + 3`. Each iteration increments `right` by 1. Therefore, after the loop completes all its iterations, `right` will be equal to `n`. All other variables (`left`, `leftMove`, `i`, `mid`, `rightZero`, `rightOne`) remain unchanged from their last known state before the loop condition was no longer satisfied.
