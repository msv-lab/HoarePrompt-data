Output State: **`left` is greater than 0, `leftZero >= (left + 1) // 2` or `rightOne >= (n - left + 1) // 2` is true, `s[left - 1] != '0'`, and `leftOne` is decreased by 1.**

The value of `leftOne` is decreased by 1, but the exact value of `leftOne` before the operation is not specified. The conditions involving `leftZero`, `rightOne`, and `s[left - 1]` remain unchanged as no operations affect them.
