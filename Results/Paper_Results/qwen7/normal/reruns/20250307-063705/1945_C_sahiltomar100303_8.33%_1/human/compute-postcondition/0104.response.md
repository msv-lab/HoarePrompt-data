Output State: **`s` is a string, `right` is an index within the string `s` plus 1, `tleftZero` is unchanged, `trightZero` is unchanged, `trightOne` is unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `right += 1` increments the value of `right` by 1. Since the initial value of `right` was an index within the string `s`, after executing the code, `right` is now one index position ahead. The values of `tleftZero`, `trightZero`, and `trightOne` remain unchanged because the code does not affect these variables.
