Postcondition: `s` is a string, `right` is the original index plus 1. If `s[right]` is '0', then `tleftZero` is the original value plus 1, `trightZero` is the original value minus 1. If `s[right]` is not '0', then `tleftZero` must be less than (right + 1) // 2, `tleftOne` is incremented by 1, and `trightOne` is decreased by 1.
