Output State: **`right` is set to `n`, `leftZero` is 0, `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 0, `rightOne` is 0, `tleftZero` is 0, `trightZero` is 0, `trightOne` is unchanged from the previous iteration, `mid` is `n // 2`.**

Explanation: The code sets `trightZero` to 0. This updates the value of `trightZero` but does not affect any other variables. The other variables retain their initial or unchanged values.
