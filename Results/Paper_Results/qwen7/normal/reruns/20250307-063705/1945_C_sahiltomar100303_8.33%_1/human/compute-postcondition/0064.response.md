Output State: **After executing `leftMove = 0`, `left` is equal to `mid`, `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `mid` remains as the integer value obtained from `n // 2`, `rightZero` will be `2 * (n - mid)` (if there are more zeros in the last `n - mid` characters of `s`) or `rightOne` will be `2 * (n - mid) - 1` (if there are more ones in the last `n - mid` characters of `s`), `trightZero` and `trightOne` will be the same as the final values of `rightZero` and `rightOne` respectively, and `leftMove` is 0.**

This output state reflects that the variable `leftMove` has been assigned the value 0, while all other variables retain their previous values as described in the initial state.
