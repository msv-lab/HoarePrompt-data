Output State: **`i` is `n // 2`, `mid` is `n // 2`, and `rightOne` is `rightOne + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `rightOne += 1` increments the value of `rightOne` by 1. The values of `i` and `mid` remain unchanged from their initial state, which is `n // 2`. The condition `s[i] != '0'` is also still valid as no operation has altered the string `s`.
