Output State: **`left` is equal to `mid` - 4, `leftMove` is 0, `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `mid` remains as `n // 2`, `rightZero` is incremented by either 1 (if the character at `left - 1` is '0') or by the number of '0's from index `n // 2` to `n - 1` (if the character at `left - 1` is '1'), and `rightOne` is incremented by either 1 (if the character at `left - 1` is '1') or by the number of '1's from index `n // 2` to `n - 1` (if the character at `left - 1` is '0'). Also, `n` must be greater than 4.**

Explanation: The line `left -= 1` decrements the value of `left` by 1. Since `left` was previously equal to `mid - 3`, after decrementing, `left` becomes `mid - 4`. All other variables (`leftMove`, `i`, `mid`, `rightZero`, `rightOne`) remain unchanged. The condition that `n` must be greater than 4 also remains valid.
