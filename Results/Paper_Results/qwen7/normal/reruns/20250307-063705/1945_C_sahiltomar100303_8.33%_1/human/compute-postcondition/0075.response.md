Output State: **`left` is `left - 1` and is greater than 0; either `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2` or `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2` must still be true. If `s[left - 1] == '0'`, then `leftZero` is decreased by 1, `left` remains greater than 0, `rightZero` is increased by 1. If `s[left - 1] != '0'` and `leftOne` is 0, then `leftZero >= (left + 1) // 2` or `rightOne >= (n - left + 1) // 2` is true.**

Explanation: The code decrements the value of `left` by 1. The conditions related to `leftZero`, `rightZero`, `leftOne`, and `rightOne` remain valid as per the initial postconditions, with the necessary adjustments for the new value of `left`.
