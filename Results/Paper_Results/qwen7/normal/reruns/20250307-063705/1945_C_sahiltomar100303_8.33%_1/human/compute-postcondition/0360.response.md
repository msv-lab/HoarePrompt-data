Output State: **`i` is `n // 2 + 2`, `mid` is `n // 2`, `rightZero` is incremented by 1, `trightZero` is incremented by 1**

Explanation: The variable `trightZero` is incremented by 1. The values of `i` and `mid` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `i` is `n // 2 + 2`, `mid` is `n // 2`, and `rightZero` is incremented by 1, making `trightZero` incremented by 1 as well.
