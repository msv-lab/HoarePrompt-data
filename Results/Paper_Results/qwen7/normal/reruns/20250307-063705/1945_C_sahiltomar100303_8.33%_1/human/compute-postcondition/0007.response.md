Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string input by the user, `mid` is `n // 2`, `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `leftOne` to 0. This does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions for `t`, `n`, `s`, `mid`, and `rightZero`, while adding that `leftOne` is now 0.
