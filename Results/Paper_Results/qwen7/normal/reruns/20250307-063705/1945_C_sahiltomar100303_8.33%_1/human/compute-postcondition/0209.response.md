Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be equal to `n // 2 + (n // 2)`, which simplifies to `n - 1`, `mid` will still be `n // 2`, `leftZero` will be twice the number of '0's encountered from index 0 to `n // 2 - 1`, `leftOne` will be twice the number of '1's encountered from index 0 to `n // 2 - 1`, `rightZero` will be twice the number of '0's encountered from index `n // 2` to `n - 1`, `rightOne` will be twice the number of '1's encountered from index `n // 2` to `n - 1`, `trightZero` will be the total number of '0's encountered from index 0 to `n - 1`, and `trightOne` will be the total number of '1's encountered from index 0 to `n - 1`.

This means that after the loop completes, `i` will reach the end of the string `s`, `mid` remains unchanged at the midpoint of the string, and both `leftZero`, `leftOne`, `rightZero`, `rightOne`, `trightZero`, and `trightOne` will reflect the counts of their respective characters across the entire string based on the given logic.
