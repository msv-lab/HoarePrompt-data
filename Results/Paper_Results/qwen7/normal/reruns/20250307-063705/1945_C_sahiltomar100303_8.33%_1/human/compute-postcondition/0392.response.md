Output State: **`left` is equal to `mid` - 3, `leftMove` is 0, `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `mid` remains as `n // 2`, `rightZero` is incremented by the number of '0's from index `n // 2` to `n - 1`, `rightOne` is incremented by the number of '1's from index `n // 2` to `n - 1`, and `n` must be greater than 4.**

Explanation: The variable `leftOne` is decremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `left` is updated to `mid - 3` because `left` was originally `mid - 2` and `leftOne` is decremented by 1, which does not affect the value of `left` directly but indicates a change in the count of '1's to its left.
