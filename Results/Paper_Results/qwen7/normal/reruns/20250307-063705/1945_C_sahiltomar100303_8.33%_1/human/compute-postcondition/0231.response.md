To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions in the loop head:

```python
while left > 0 and (leftZero < (left + 1) // 2 or rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition Breakdown**:
   - The loop continues as long as `left > 0`.
   - Additionally, the loop continues if either `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2` or `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2`.

2. **Current States at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `total` is 0
   - `i` is `n - 3`
   - `mid` is `n // 2`
   - `rightZero` is either `n // 2 + 1` or twice the number of '0's encountered from index `n // 2` to `n - 1`
   - `trightZero` is the total number of '0's encountered from index 0 to `n - 1`
   - `rightOne` is either twice the number of '1's encountered from index `n // 2` to `n - 1` plus 1 or less than `(n - mid + 1) // 2` plus 1
   - `trightOne` is the total number of '1's encountered from index 0 to `n - 1`
   - `left` is `mid - 2`
   - `leftMove` is either 0 or 1
   - `n` is greater than 0
   - `rightZero` is less than `(mid + 1) // 2`
   - `rightOne` is less than `(n - mid + 1) // 2` plus 1
   - `leftZero` is less than `(left + 1) // 2`
   - `leftOne` is less than `(left + 1) // 2` minus 1

3. **Adjusting States**:
   - **`left`**: Since `left` is part of the loop condition, it must be adjusted to ensure `left > 0`.
   - **`leftZero`**: Since `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2` is part of the loop condition, `leftZero` must be adjusted to ensure this inequality holds.
   - **`rightOne`**: Since `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2` is part of the loop condition, `rightOne` must be adjusted to ensure this inequality holds.

### Conclusion:

The states that need to be adjusted are `left`, `leftZero`, and `rightOne`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `n - 3`, `mid` is `n // 2`, `rightZero` is either `n // 2 + 1` or twice the number of '0's encountered from index `n // 2` to `n - 1`, `trightZero` is the total number of '0's encountered from index 0 to `n - 1`, `rightOne` is either twice the number of '1's encountered from index `n // 2` to `n - 1` plus 1 or less than `(n - mid + 1) // 2` plus 1, `trightOne` is the total number of '1's encountered from index 0 to `n - 1`, `left` must be greater than 0, `leftZero` must be less than `(left + 1) // 2`, `rightOne` must be less than `(n - left + 1) // 2`, `leftMove` is either 0 or 1, `n` is greater than 0, `rightZero` is less than `(mid + 1) // 2`, `rightOne` is less than `(n - mid + 1) // 2` plus 1, `leftZero` is less than `(left + 1) // 2`, `leftOne` is less than `(left + 1) // 2` minus 1**
