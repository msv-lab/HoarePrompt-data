Postcondition: `left` is equal to `mid` - 3, `leftMove` is 0, `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `mid` remains as `n // 2`, `rightZero` is incremented by either 1 (if the character at `left - 1` is '0') or by the number of '0's from index `n // 2` to `n - 1` (if the character at `left - 1` is '1'), and `rightOne` is incremented by either 1 (if the character at `left - 1` is '1') or by the number of '1's from index `n // 2` to `n - 1` (if the character at `left - 1` is '0'). Also, `n` must be greater than 4.
