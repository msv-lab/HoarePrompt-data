Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `mid`.

2. **Determine the initial values at the start of the loop**:
   - From the postcondition, we know that `i` is `n // 2 + 1` and `mid` is `n // 2`.
   - The loop starts from `i = mid + 1` (since `range(mid, n)` means it starts from `mid` and goes up to `n-1`).

3. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n // 2 + 1` and `mid` is `n // 2`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Therefore, `i` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration, making `i` equal to `n // 2 + 2`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be updated to `n // 2 + 2`.
   - `mid` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is `n // 2 + 2`, `mid` is `n // 2`**
