Output State: **`left` is greater than 0, `leftZero >= (left + 1) // 2` or `rightOne >= (n - left + 1) // 2` is true, `s[left - 1] != '0'`, and `leftOne` is 0.**

Explanation: The variable `rightOne` is incremented by 1. Since `leftOne` is decreased by 1 before this line of code, its new value is 0. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
