Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `mid`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop starts from `i = mid` and goes up to `i < n`.

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is `n // 2 + 1`.
   - `mid` is `n // 2`.
   - If `s[i]` is '0', then `rightZero` is incremented by 2.
   - Otherwise, `rightOne` is incremented by 2.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop starts from `i = mid` (which is `n // 2`) and increments `i` by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` will be `n // 2 + 1`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `i < n`. Therefore, if `i` is currently `n // 2 + 1`, the loop will continue as long as `n // 2 + 1 < n`, which simplifies to `n > n // 2 + 1` or `n > 2 * (n // 2) + 1` or `n > n + 1`, which is not possible unless `n` is at least 3. However, since we are starting from `i = n // 2 + 1`, the loop will continue until `i` reaches `n`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will become `n // 2 + 2`.
   - `mid` remains the same because it is not being modified within the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is `n // 2 + 2`, `mid` is `n // 2`, `rightZero` is incremented by 2 if `s[n // 2 + 1]` is '0', otherwise `rightOne` is incremented by 2**.
