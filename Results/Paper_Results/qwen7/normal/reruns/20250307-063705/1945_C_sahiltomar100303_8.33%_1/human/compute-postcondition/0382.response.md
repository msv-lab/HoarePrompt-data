Output State: **`left` is equal to `mid` - 1, `leftMove` is 0, `leftZero` is decreased by 1, `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `mid` remains as `n // 2`, `rightZero` is incremented by the number of '0's from index `n // 2` to `n - 1`, `rightOne` is incremented by the number of '1's from index `n // 2` to `n - 1`.**

Explanation: The line `leftZero -= 1` decreases the value of `leftZero` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
