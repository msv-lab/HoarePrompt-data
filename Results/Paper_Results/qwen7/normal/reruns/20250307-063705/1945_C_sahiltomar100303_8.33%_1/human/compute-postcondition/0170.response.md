Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(mid):`.
   - The variables involved in this loop are `i` and `mid`.

2. **Understand the Current State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - `mid` is `n // 2`.
   - The postcondition states that if `s[i]` is '0', then `leftZero` is 2. Otherwise, `tleftOne` is 1.

3. **Determine the Next State:**
   - The loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented from 1 to 2.
   - Since `mid` does not change within the loop, `mid` remains `n // 2`.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - `i` needs to be updated to 2.
   - `mid` remains `n // 2`.
   - The values of `leftZero` and `tleftOne` do not change because they are not part of the loop head and their values depend on the condition inside the loop, which we are not modifying here.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is 2, `mid` is `n // 2`**
