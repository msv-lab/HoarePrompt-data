Output State: **`i` is `n // 2`, `mid` is `n // 2`, and `rightOne` is `rightOne + 2`.**

Explanation: The code `trightOne += 1` increments the value of `rightOne` by 1. Since `rightOne` was initially `rightOne + 1`, after the increment, its new value is `rightOne + 2`. The values of `i` and `mid` remain unchanged from their initial state.
