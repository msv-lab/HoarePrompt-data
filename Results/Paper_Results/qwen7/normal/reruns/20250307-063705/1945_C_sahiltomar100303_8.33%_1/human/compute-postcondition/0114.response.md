Output State: **`s` is a string, `right` is the original index plus 1, `tleftZero` is the original value plus 1, `tleftOne` is unchanged, `trightZero` is the original value of `trightZero` minus 1, `trightOne` is unchanged.**

The code `trightZero -= 1` decrements the value of `trightZero` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
