Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `mid`.

2. **Determine the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `i` is 1
   - `mid` is `n // 2`
   - If `s[i]` is '0', then `leftZero` is 2.
   - Otherwise, `leftOne` is 2.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i` to `mid` (inclusive), so the loop condition is `i < mid`.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at 1 and the loop runs until `i < mid`, the next value of `i` will be 2.
   - `mid` remains unchanged as it is determined by `n // 2` and does not change within the loop.

5. **Check the Postcondition for the Next Iteration**:
   - If `s[2]` is '0', then `leftZero` should be 2.
   - Otherwise, `leftOne` should be 2.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is 2, `mid` is `n // 2`, if `s[2]` is '0', then `leftZero` is 2, otherwise `leftOne` is 2**
