Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, `mid` remains as `n // 2`. The variable `rightZero` will be incremented by the total number of '0's encountered from index `n // 2` to `n-1`, and `rightOne` will be incremented by the total number of '1's encountered from index `n // 2` to `n-1`.

This means that `i` will reach `n` because the loop increments `i` starting from `mid` (which is `n // 2`) until it reaches `n`. The value of `mid` remains `n // 2` since it is not modified within the loop. The counts `rightZero` and `rightOne` will reflect the cumulative count of '0's and '1's respectively from the middle index (`n // 2`) to the end of the string `s`.
