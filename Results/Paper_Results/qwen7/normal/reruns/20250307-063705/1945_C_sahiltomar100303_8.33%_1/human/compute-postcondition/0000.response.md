Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 2⋅10^4. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 3⋅10^5, and `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅10^5.** 

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. All other conditions and constraints remain unchanged.
