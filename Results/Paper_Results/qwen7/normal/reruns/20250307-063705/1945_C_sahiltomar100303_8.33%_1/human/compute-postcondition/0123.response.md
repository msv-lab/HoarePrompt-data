Postcondition: **Output State: The loop terminates when `right` equals `n`, meaning all characters in the string `s` have been processed. At this point, `tleftZero` will be the total number of zeros encountered before `mid` (inclusive), `tleftOne` will be the total number of ones encountered before `mid` (inclusive), `trightZero` will be the total number of zeros encountered from `mid` to `right-1`, and `trightOne` will be the total number of ones encountered from `mid` to `right-1`. Since the loop condition `right < n` ensures that `right` reaches the end of the string, `right` is now set to `n`. The values of `tleftZero`, `tleftOne`, `trightZero`, and `trightOne` will reflect the counts of zeros and ones as described above, with no further changes possible because the loop has terminated. Additionally, `left` is currently equal to 0. The current value of `right` is `n` and the if condition `right != n` is false.**
