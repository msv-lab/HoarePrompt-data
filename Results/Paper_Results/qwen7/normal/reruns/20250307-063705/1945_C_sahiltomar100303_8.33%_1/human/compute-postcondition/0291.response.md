Based on the given initial state and the precondition:

- `total` is 0.
- `students` is 1 less than its initial value and is greater than or equal to 1.
- `trightOne` is less than \((n - (right + 1)) // 2 - 1\).
- `tleftZero` is increased by 1 for each iteration until it reaches \((right + 2) // 2\).
- `tleftOne` is increased by 1 for each iteration.
- `trightZero` is decreased by 1 for each iteration.
- `right` is equal to \(n - 1\).
- `left` is equal to 0.
- `tleftZero` is less than \((n + 1) // 2\).

The `print(left)` statement will print the value of the variable `left`.

Given that `left` is explicitly set to 0 in the initial state, the output will be:

Output: **0**
