Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be `n // 2 + (n // 2)`, which simplifies to `n - 1`. The value of `mid` remains `n // 2`. `rightZero` will be twice the number of '0's encountered from index `n // 2` to `n - 1`, and `trightZero` will be the total number of '0's encountered from index 0 to `n - 1`. Similarly, `rightOne` will be twice the number of '1's encountered from index `n // 2` to `n - 1`, and `trightOne` will be the total number of '1's encountered from index 0 to `n - 1`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be at the end of the string (`n - 1`), `mid` will still be at the middle of the string (`n // 2`). The counts of '0's and '1's in the second half of the string are stored in `rightZero` and `rightOne` respectively, while `trightZero` and `trightOne` store the cumulative counts of '0's and '1's from the start of the string to the end.
