Output State: **`left` is 0, `leftMove` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `mid` remains as `n // 2`, `rightZero` is incremented by the number of '0's from index `n // 2` to `n - 2`, `rightOne` is incremented by the number of '1's from index `n // 2` to `n - 2`, `right` is `mid + 1`. Additionally, either `tleftZero` is less than `(n // 2 + 1) // 2` or `trightOne` is less than `(n // 2 + 1) // 2`. If `s[right - 1]` is '0', `tleftZero` is incremented by 1 and `trightZero` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `tleftOne` is incremented by 1 and `trightOne` is decremented by 1.**

Explanation: The line `right += 1` increments the value of `right` by 1. Since `right` was initially set to `mid`, which is `n // 2`, after this operation, `right` becomes `mid + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged. The conditions involving `tleftZero`, `trightZero`, `tleftOne`, and `trightOne` also remain the same unless `s[right - 1]` changes, but since no such change is specified, these conditions are carried forward as they were.
