Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be equal to `n // 2`, `mid` remains as `n // 2`. If the character `s[n // 2]` is '0', then `leftZero` will be `(n // 2 + 2) // 2 * 2`, otherwise `leftOne` will be the same value.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n // 2 - 1`.
- After each iteration, `i` increases by 1.
- Therefore, after all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n // 2 - 1`, but since the loop condition checks `i < mid` and `mid` does not change, `i` will be set to `n // 2` right before the loop exits.
- The value of `leftZero` or `leftOne` will be the sum of the increments made during each iteration, which is `(n // 2 + 2) // 2 * 2` because `tleftZero` is incremented by 1 for each '0' encountered and `tleftOne` is incremented by 1 for each '1' encountered. The exact value depends on the characters in the string `s` up to index `n // 2 - 1`.
