Output State: **`i` is 3, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is 4, `tleftZero` is 1**

Explanation: The variable `tleftZero` is incremented by 1, so `tleftZero` becomes 1 + 1 = 2. The value of `i`, `mid`, and `leftZero` remains unchanged. Therefore, the updated values are `i` is 3, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is 3, and `tleftZero` is 2. However, since the initial description of `leftZero` and the new value of `tleftZero` might be confusing due to the naming conflict, it should be noted that `tleftZero` is specifically the one that was incremented, making its value 2. Given the initial state and the increment operation, the final values are as stated.
