Output State: **`total` is 0, `students` is 1 less than its initial value and is greater than or equal to 1, `trightOne` is less than `(n - (right + 1)) // 2 - 1`, `tleftZero` is increased by 1, `tleftOne` is either increased by 1 or remains unchanged, `trightZero` is decreased by 1; `right` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `right += 1` increments the value of `right` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given conditions. Therefore, `right` is increased by 1, while the other variables retain their respective conditions from the initial state.
