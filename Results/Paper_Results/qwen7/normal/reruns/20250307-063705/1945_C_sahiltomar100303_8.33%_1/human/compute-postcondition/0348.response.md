Output State: **`i` is `n // 2`, `mid` is `n // 2`, `n` must be greater than `n // 2`, and `s[i] != '0'`, `rightOne` is `rightOne + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `trightOne += 1` increments the value of `rightOne` by 1. All other variables (`i`, `mid`, `n`, `s[i]`, and `s`) remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the updated state includes `rightOne` being increased by 1.
