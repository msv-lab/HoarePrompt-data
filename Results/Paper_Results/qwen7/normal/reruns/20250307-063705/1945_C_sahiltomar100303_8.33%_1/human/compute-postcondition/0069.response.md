Output State: **`leftZero` is decreased by 1, `left` is greater than 0, `rightZero` is increased by 1, and either `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2` or `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2` must still be true.**

Explanation: The code increases the value of `rightZero` by 1. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged from the initial state. Therefore, `leftZero` is decreased by 1, `left` is still greater than 0, `rightZero` is now one more than its original value, and the condition involving `leftZero` and `rightOne` must still hold true.
