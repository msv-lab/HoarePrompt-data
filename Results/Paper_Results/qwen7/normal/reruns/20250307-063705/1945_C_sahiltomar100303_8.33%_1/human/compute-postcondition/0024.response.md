Output State: **`i` is 1; `mid` is a positive integer; `leftZero` is increased by 2.**

Explanation: The code `tleftZero += 1` increments the value of `leftZero` by 1. Since `leftZero` was previously increased by 1 (from the initial state), it is now increased by 2. The values of `i` and `mid` remain unchanged.
