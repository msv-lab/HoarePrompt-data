Output State: **`left` is greater than 0, `leftMove` is 0, `left` is equal to `mid`, `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `mid` remains as `n // 2`, `rightZero` is incremented by 1, `rightOne` will be incremented by the number of '1's from index `n // 2` to `n - 1`, and the current value of `s[left - 1]` is '0', `leftZero` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `rightZero += 1` increments the value of `rightZero` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
