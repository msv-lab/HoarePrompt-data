Output State: **`i` is 1; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftOne` is 2**

Explanation: The variable `tleftOne` is not defined in the initial state, so it is assumed to be a typo and should be `leftOne`. The code increments `leftOne` by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The values of `i` and `mid` remain unchanged.
