Output State: `i` is `0`, `mid` is `n // 2`, `rightZero` is either `n // 2 + 3` or twice the number of '0's encountered from index `n // 2` to `n - 1` plus 2, `trightZero` is the total number of '0's encountered from index 0 to `n - 1`, `rightOne` is either twice the number of '1's encountered from index `n // 2` to `n - 1` plus 1 or less than `(n - mid + 1) // 2` plus 2, `trightOne` is the total number of '1's encountered from index 0 to `n - 1`, `left` is `0`, `leftMove` is either 0 or 1, `n` is greater than 0, `rightZero` is less than `(mid + 1) // 2`, `rightOne` is less than `(n - mid + 1) // 2` plus 2, `leftZero` is less than `(left + 1) // 2`, `leftOne` is less than `(left + 1) // 2` minus 1.

This output state describes the final conditions of the variables after the loop has executed all its iterations. The loop continues to decrement `left` until it reaches 0, adjusting `leftZero`, `rightZero`, `leftOne`, and `rightOne` based on the value of `s[left - 1]`. The other variables such as `mid`, `trightZero`, `trightOne`, `i`, `n`, `leftMove` remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop, which they are not in this case.
