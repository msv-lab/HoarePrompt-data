Output State: **`leftZero` is `leftZero - 1`; either `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2` or `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2` must still hold true.**

Explanation: The variable `leftZero` is decremented by 1. The conditions involving `leftZero` and `rightOne` must still hold true as per the initial state. Therefore, the updated state reflects that `leftZero` has been decreased by 1, and the logical condition involving `leftZero` and `rightOne` remains valid.
