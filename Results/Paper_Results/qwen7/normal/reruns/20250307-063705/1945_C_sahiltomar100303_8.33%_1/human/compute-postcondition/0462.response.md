Based on the initial state provided:

- `left` is 0
- `leftMove` is 0
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `mid` remains as `n // 2`
- `rightZero` is incremented by the number of '0's from index `n // 2` to `n - 1`
- `rightOne` is incremented by the number of '1's from index `n // 2` to `n - 1`
- `right` is `n`
- `right` is not equal to `n`, and `(abs((n + 1) // 2 - left) > abs((n + 1) // 2 - right))`

The `print(right)` statement will print the value of `right`, which is explicitly stated to be `n`.

Output: **n**
