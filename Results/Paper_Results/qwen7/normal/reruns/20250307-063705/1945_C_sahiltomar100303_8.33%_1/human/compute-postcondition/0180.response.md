Output State: **`i` is 3, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftOne` is 3**.

Explanation: The initial state has `i` as 3, `mid` as `n // 2`, and `leftOne` as 2 (or `leftZero` as 2, depending on the condition). The code increments `leftOne` by 1, so `leftOne` becomes 3. The values of `i` and `mid` remain unchanged.
