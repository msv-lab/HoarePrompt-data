Output State: **`left` is equal to `mid` - 3, `leftMove` is 0, `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `mid` remains as `n // 2`, `rightZero` is incremented by the number of '0's from index `n // 2` to `n - 1`, `rightOne` is incremented by the number of '1's from index `n // 2` to `n - 1`, and `n` must be greater than 4.**

Explanation: The code decrements `leftZero` by 1. Since `leftZero` was initially equal to `mid - 2`, after decrementing, it becomes `mid - 3`. All other variables remain unchanged.
