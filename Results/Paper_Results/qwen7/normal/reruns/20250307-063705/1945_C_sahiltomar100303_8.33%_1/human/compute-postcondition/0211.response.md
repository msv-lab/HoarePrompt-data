Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `mid` is `n // 2`, `rightZero` is twice the number of '0's encountered from index `n // 2` to `n - 1`, `trightZero` is the total number of '0's encountered from index 0 to `n - 1`, `rightOne` is twice the number of '1's encountered from index `n // 2` to `n - 1`, `trightOne` is the total number of '1's encountered from index 0 to `n - 1`, and `left` is `mid`.**

Explanation: The code `left = mid` simply assigns the value of `mid` to `left`. Since `mid` was previously `n // 2`, `left` now also holds the value `n // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state.
