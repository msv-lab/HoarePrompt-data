Output State: **`i` is `n // 2`, `mid` is `n // 2`, `n` must be greater than `n // 2`, `rightZero` is incremented by 1.**

The code `trightZero += 1` increments the value of `rightZero` by 1. Since `trightZero` is just a typo and should be `rightZero`, the value of `rightZero` is increased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
