Postcondition: `total` is 0, `students` is 2 less than its initial value and is greater than or equal to 1, `trightOne` is less than `(n // 2 + 1) // 2 - 1`, and either `s[right]` is '0' and `tleftZero` is 1 more than its previous value while `trightZero` is 1 less than its previous value, or `s[right]` is not '0' and `tleftOne` is increased by 1.
