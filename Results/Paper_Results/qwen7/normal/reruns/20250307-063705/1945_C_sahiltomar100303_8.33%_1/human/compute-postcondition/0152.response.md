Output State: **`right` is set to `n`, `tleftZero` and `tleftOne` must be greater than 0, `trightZero` and `trightOne` are unchanged from the previous iteration, `mid` is `n // 2`.**

Explanation: The code `mid = n // 2` calculates the integer division of `n` by 2 and assigns the result to `mid`. The values of `right`, `tleftZero`, `tleftOne`, `trightZero`, and `trightOne` remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `mid` is now `n // 2`.
