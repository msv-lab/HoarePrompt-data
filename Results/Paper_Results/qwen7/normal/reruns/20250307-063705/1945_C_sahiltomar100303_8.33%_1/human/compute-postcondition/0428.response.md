Output State: **`left` is 0, `leftMove` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `mid` remains as `n // 2`, `rightZero` is incremented by the number of '0's from index `n // 2` to `n - 2`, `rightOne` is incremented by the number of '1's from index `n // 2` to `n - 2`, `right` is `n // 2 + 3`, `right` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `right += 1` increments the value of `right` by 1. Initially, `right` was `n // 2 + 2`. After executing the code, `right` becomes `n // 2 + 3`. All other variables remain unchanged.
