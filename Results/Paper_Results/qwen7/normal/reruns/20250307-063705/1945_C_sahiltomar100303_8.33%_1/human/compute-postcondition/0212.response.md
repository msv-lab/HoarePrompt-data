Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `mid` is `n // 2`, `rightZero` is twice the number of '0's encountered from index `n // 2` to `n - 1`, `trightZero` is the total number of '0's encountered from index 0 to `n - 1`, `rightOne` is twice the number of '1's encountered from index `n // 2` to `n - 1`, `trightOne` is the total number of '1's encountered from index 0 to `n - 1`, `left` is `mid`, `leftMove` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `leftMove = 0` initializes `leftMove` to 0. None of the other variables are affected by this assignment, so their values remain unchanged.
