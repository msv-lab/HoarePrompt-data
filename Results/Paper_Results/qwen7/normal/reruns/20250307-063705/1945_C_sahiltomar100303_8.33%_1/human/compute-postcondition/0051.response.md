Output State: **`i` is `mid`, `mid` is `n // 2`, `rightOne` is increased by 2.**

Explanation: The variable `rightOne` was already increased by 1 in the initial state. The code snippet `trightOne += 1` increments `rightOne` by 1 again. Therefore, `rightOne` is increased by 2 in total. The values of `i` and `mid` remain unchanged from their initial states.
