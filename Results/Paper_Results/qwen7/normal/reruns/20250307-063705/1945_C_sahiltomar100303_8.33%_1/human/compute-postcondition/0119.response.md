Output State: **`s` is a string, `right` is the original index plus 2, `tleftZero` is either the original value plus 1 or remains unchanged, `tleftOne` is incremented by 1 if the character at `right-1` is '0', otherwise it remains unchanged, `trightZero` is unchanged, `trightOne` is decreased by 1 if the character at `right-1` is '0', otherwise it remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The line `right += 1` increments the value of `right` by 1. Therefore, `right` is now the original index plus 1 plus 1, which means it is the original index plus 2. The values of `s`, `tleftZero`, `tleftOne`, `trightZero`, and `trightOne` remain unchanged unless the character at the new position of `right` (i.e., `right-1`) is '0'. In that case, `tleftOne` would be incremented by 1 and `trightOne` would be decreased by 1.
