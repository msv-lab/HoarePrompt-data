Let's break down the initial state and determine the value of `left` before the `print(left)` statement is executed.

1. **Total (`total`)**: Given as 0.
2. **Students (`students`)**: It is 1 less than its initial value and is greater than or equal to 1. This implies that `students` was initially 2 (since it is now 1 less and still >= 1).
3. **`trightOne`**: Less than \((n - (right + 1)) // 2 - 1\). Since `right` is `n - 1`, this becomes \((n - (n - 1 + 1)) // 2 - 1 = (n - n) // 2 - 1 = -1 - 1 = -2\). So, `trightOne` must be less than -2.
4. **`tleftZero`**: Increased by 1 for each iteration until it reaches \((right + 2) // 2\). Since `right` is `n - 1`, this becomes \((n - 1 + 2) // 2 = (n + 1) // 2\). So, `tleftZero` will eventually reach \((n + 1) // 2\).
5. **`tleftOne`**: Increased by 1 for each iteration.
6. **`trightZero`**: Decreased by 1 for each iteration.
7. **`right`**: Equal to `n - 1`.
8. **`left`**: Not equal to 0, not equal to `n`, and closer to \((n + 1) // 2\) than `right`.

Given these conditions, let's consider the implications:

- Since `trightOne` is less than -2, it means there are no iterations where `trightOne` increments.
- `tleftZero` increases until it reaches \((n + 1) // 2\).
- `tleftOne` also increases with each iteration.
- `trightZero` decreases with each iteration.
- `left` is not 0, not `n`, and closer to \((n + 1) // 2\) than `right`.

To find the exact value of `left`, we need to understand the balance between `tleftZero` and `tleftOne` and how they affect `left`. Given that `trightZero` is decreasing and `tleftZero` is increasing, and considering `left` is closer to \((n + 1) // 2\) than `right`, `left` must be around the middle of the range but slightly towards the center.

Since `students` is 2, and considering the constraints, `left` would be the middle value if `n` were odd, and slightly adjusted due to the conditions. Given the constraints and the fact that `left` is closer to \((n + 1) // 2\) than `right`, `left` would be 1.

Output: **1**
