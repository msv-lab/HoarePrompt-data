Output State: **`left` is equal to `mid` - 1, `leftMove` is 0, `left` is equal to `mid` - 1, `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `mid` remains as `n // 2`, `rightZero` is incremented by the number of '0's from index `n // 2` to `n - 1`, `rightOne` is incremented by the number of '1's from index `n // 2` to `n - 1`, `leftOne` is decreased by 1, if the character at index `left - 1` (which is `mid - 2`) in the string `s` is '0', `rightZero` is incremented by 1 and `leftZero` is decreased by 1, otherwise, `rightOne` is incremented by 1 and `leftOne` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code decrements `leftOne` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states. The condition to increment `rightZero` or `rightOne` based on the character at `mid - 2` in `s` is still valid and will be evaluated when needed.
