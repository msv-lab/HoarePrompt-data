Output State: **`i` is 2, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is 2**

Explanation: The variable `tleftZero` is not present in the initial state, so assuming it was meant to be `leftZero`, the code increments `leftZero` by 1. Given that `leftZero` was initially 1, after executing `leftZero += 1`, its value becomes 2. The values of `i` and `mid` remain unchanged from their initial states.
