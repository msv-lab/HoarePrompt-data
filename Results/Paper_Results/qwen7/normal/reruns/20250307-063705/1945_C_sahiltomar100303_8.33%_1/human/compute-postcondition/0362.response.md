Output State: **`i` is `n // 2 + 2`, `mid` is `n // 2`, `rightOne` is incremented by 2**.

Explanation: The variable `rightOne` was already incremented by 1 in the initial state. The code snippet `trightOne += 1` increments `rightOne` by 1 again. Therefore, `rightOne` is incremented by 2 in total. The values of `i` and `mid` remain unchanged.
