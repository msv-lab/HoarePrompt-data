Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n - 1`, `mid` remains as the integer value obtained from `n // 2`, `rightZero` will be incremented by `n - mid` times (each time adding 2 if `s[i]` is '0'), and `rightOne` will be incremented by `n - mid` times (each time adding 1 if `s[i]` is '1'). `trightZero` will be equal to `rightZero` and `trightOne` will be equal to `rightOne`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes, `i` will be the last index of the string `s`, `mid` will still be half of the length of `s` (integer division), `rightZero` will count the number of zeros in the second half of the string `s` (with each zero contributing 2 to the count due to the loop structure), `rightOne` will count the number of ones in the second half of the string `s` (with each one contributing 1 to the count), and `trightZero` and `trightOne` will reflect the final counts of `rightZero` and `rightOne` respectively.
