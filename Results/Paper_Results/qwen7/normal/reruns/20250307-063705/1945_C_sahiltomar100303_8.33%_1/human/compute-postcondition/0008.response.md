Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string input by the user, `mid` is `n // 2`, `rightZero` is 0, `rightOne` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `rightOne = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `rightOne`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `s`, `mid`, `rightZero`, and `leftOne`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
