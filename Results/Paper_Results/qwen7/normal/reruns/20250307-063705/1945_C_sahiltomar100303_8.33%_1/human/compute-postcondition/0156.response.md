Output State: **`right` is set to `n`, `leftZero` is 0, `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 0, `rightOne` is 0, `tleftZero` and `tleftOne` must be greater than 0, `trightZero` and `trightOne` are unchanged from the previous iteration, `mid` is `n // 2`.**

Explanation: The line `rightOne = 0` sets the value of `rightOne` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
