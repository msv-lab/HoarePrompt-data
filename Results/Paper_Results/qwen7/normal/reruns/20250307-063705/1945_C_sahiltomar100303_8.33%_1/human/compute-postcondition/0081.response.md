Postcondition: `left` is greater than 0, `leftZero` is adjusted according to whether `s[left - 1]` is '0' or not. If `s[left - 1]` is '0', then `leftZero` is decreased by 2 and `rightZero` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `leftZero` remains unchanged, `leftOne` is decreased by 1, and `rightOne` is increased by 1. Additionally, either `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2` or `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2` must still hold true.
