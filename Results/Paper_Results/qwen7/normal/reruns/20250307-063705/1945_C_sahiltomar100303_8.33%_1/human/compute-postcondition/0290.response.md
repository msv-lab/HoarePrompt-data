Postcondition: `total` is 0, `students` is 1 less than its initial value and is greater than or equal to 1, `trightOne` is less than `(n - (right + 1)) // 2 - 1`, `tleftZero` is increased by 1 for each iteration until it reaches `(right + 2) // 2`, `tleftOne` is increased by 1 for each iteration, `trightZero` is decreased by 1 for each iteration, `right` is equal to `n - 1`, `left` is equal to 0, **`tleftZero` is less than `(n + 1) // 2`**.
