Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the optimal position for the road is exactly at the middle of the village. Specifically, the program fails to check if the exact middle position satisfies the condition before moving to the next steps. 

Consider the following input:
```
3
3
110
```

The expected output is `1` because placing the road after the first house (position 1) would result in 1 out of 2 residents being satisfied on the left side (since `leftZero = 1` and `1 >= ceil(2/2) = 1`) and 0 out of 1 resident being satisfied on the right side (since `rightOne = 0` and `0 < ceil(1/2) = 1`). However, the program does not correctly handle this scenario and might miss the optimal position due to its current logic structure.
