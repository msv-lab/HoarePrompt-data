Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `mid`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - According to the given information, after the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n // 2`.
   - Similarly, `mid` will also remain as `n // 2`.
   - The loop starts from `i = mid` and goes up to `i < n`.

3. **Adjust the initial state**:
   - Since the loop starts with `i = mid` and the final value of `i` after all iterations is `n // 2`, we need to set `i` to `n // 2` at the start of the loop.
   - `mid` should also be set to `n // 2` at the start of the loop.

4. **Consider the condition for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute if `mid` (which is `n // 2`) is less than `n`.
   - Therefore, `n` must be greater than `n // 2`.

5. **Final state adjustment**:
   - `i` should be set to `n // 2`.
   - `mid` should be set to `n // 2`.
   - `n` must be greater than `n // 2` to ensure the loop can execute.

Putting it all together, the adjusted state before the loop starts is:

**State: **`i` is `n // 2`, `mid` is `n // 2`, `n` must be greater than `n // 2`**.
