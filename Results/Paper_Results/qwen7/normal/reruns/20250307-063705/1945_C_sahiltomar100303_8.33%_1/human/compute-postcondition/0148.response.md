Postcondition: **`right` is set to `n`, indicating all characters in the string `s` have been processed. `tleftZero`, `tleftOne`, `trightZero`, and `trightOne` reflect the counts of zeros and ones as described. If `left` is 0, `right` remains `n` regardless of the value of `tleftOne`. Otherwise, `left` is not 0, and the absolute difference between `left` and half of `n+1` will be less than or equal to the absolute difference between `right` and half of `n+1`.**
