Output State: **`left` is 0, `leftMove` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `mid` remains as `n // 2`, `rightZero` is incremented by the number of '0's from index `n // 2` to `n - 1`, `rightOne` is incremented by the number of '1's from index `n // 2` to `n - 1`, `right` is `mid`, `s[right]` is '0', `tleftZero` is incremented by 1, and either `tleftZero` must be less than `(n // 2 + 1) // 2` or `trightOne` must be less than `(n // 2 + 1) // 2`.**

Explanation: The line `tleftZero += 1` increments the value of `tleftZero` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
