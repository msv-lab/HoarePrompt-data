Based on the initial state provided:

- `left` is explicitly stated to be 0.
- `leftMove` is not directly relevant to the print statement.
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- `mid` is `n // 2`.
- `rightZero` and `rightOne` are incremented by the count of '0's and '1's respectively from index `n // 2` to `n - 1`.
- `right` is explicitly stated to be `n`.

The print statement is `print(left)`, and since `left` is explicitly given as 0, the output will be:

Output: **0**
