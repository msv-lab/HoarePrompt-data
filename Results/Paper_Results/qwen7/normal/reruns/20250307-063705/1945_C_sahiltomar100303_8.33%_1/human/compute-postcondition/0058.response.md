Output State: **`i` is `mid + 1`, `mid` is `n // 2`, `n` is unchanged, `rightOne` is updated to `rightOne + 1`, `trightOne` is `rightOne + 1**.

The code `trightOne += 1` increments the value of `trightOne` by 1. Given that `rightOne` was previously updated to `rightOne + 1`, `trightOne` now equals `rightOne + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
