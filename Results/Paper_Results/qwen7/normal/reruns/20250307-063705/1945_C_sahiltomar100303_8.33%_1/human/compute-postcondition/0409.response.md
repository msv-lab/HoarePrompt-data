Output State: **`left` is 0, `leftMove` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `mid` remains as `n // 2`, `rightZero` is incremented by the number of '0's from index `n // 2` to `n - 1`, `rightOne` is incremented by the number of '1's from index `n // 2` to `n - 1`, `right` is `mid`, `tleftOne` is incremented by 1, `trightOne` is decremented by 1, and either `tleftZero` is greater than or equal to `(n // 2 + 1) // 2` or `trightOne` is greater than or equal to `(n // 2 + 1) // 2`**.

Explanation: The code `trightOne -= 1` decrements the value of `trightOne` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
