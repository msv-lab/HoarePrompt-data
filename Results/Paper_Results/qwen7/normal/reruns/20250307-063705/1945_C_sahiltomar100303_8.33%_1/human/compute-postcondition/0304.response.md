Postcondition: **`total` is 0, `students` is 1 less than its initial value and is greater than or equal to 1, `trightOne` is less than `(n - (right + 1)) // 2 - 1`, `tleftZero` is increased by 1 for each iteration until it reaches `(right + 2) // 2`, `tleftOne` is increased by 1 for each iteration, `trightZero` is decreased by 1 for each iteration, `right` is equal to `n - 1`, `left` is either equal to 0 or not equal to 0, and `tleftZero` is either greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2` or less than `(n + 1) // 2`. Depending on the condition of the if statement, either the current value of `left` is closer to `((n + 1) // 2)` than `right`, or the absolute difference between `((n + 1) // 2)` and `left` is greater than the absolute difference between `((n + 1) // 2)` and `right`.**
