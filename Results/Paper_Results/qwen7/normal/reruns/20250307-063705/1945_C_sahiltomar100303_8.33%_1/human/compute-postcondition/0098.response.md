Output State: **`s` is a string, `right` is an index within the string `s`, the character at index `right` in string `s` is '0', `tleftZero` is increased by 1, `trightZero` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `trightZero` is decremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The character at index `right` in string `s` is still '0', and `tleftZero` is still increased by 1.
