Based on the initial state provided:

- `left` is 0.
- `leftMove` is 0.
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- `mid` remains as `n // 2`.
- `rightZero` is incremented by the number of '0's from index `n // 2` to `n - 1`.
- `rightOne` is incremented by the number of '1's from index `n // 2` to `n - 1`.
- `right` is `n`.
- The condition `right == n` is true.
- The current value of `rightOne` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`.

The `print(left)` statement will print the value of `left`, which is explicitly stated to be 0.

Output: **0**
