Postcondition: `left` is 0, `leftMove` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `mid` remains as `n // 2`, `rightZero` is incremented by the number of '0's from index `n // 2` to `n - 1`, `rightOne` is incremented by the number of '1's from index `n // 2` to `n - 1`, `right` is `n`, and the current value of `right` is equal to `n`. Additionally, the number of '0's from index `n // 2` to `n - 1` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`.
