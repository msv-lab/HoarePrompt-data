Output State: **`i` is `n // 2 + 1`, `mid` is `n // 2`, `rightOne` is `rightOne + 1`**

Explanation: The variable `rightOne` is incremented by 1. The values of `i` and `mid` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `i` is `n // 2 + 1`, `mid` is `n // 2`, and `rightOne` is increased by 1.
