Output State: **After the code executes, `left` is equal to `mid`, `i` will be equal to `n - 1`, `mid` remains as `n // 2`, `rightZero` will be incremented by the number of '0's from index `n // 2` to `n - 1`, and `rightOne` will be incremented by the number of '1's from index `n // 2` to `n - 1`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `mid` to `left`. This does not change the values of `i`, `mid`, `rightZero`, or `rightOne`. Therefore, these variables retain their previous states. Specifically, `left` now holds the value of `mid`, while `i` remains equal to `n - 1`, `mid` remains as `n // 2`, and `rightZero` and `rightOne` remain unchanged in terms of their counting operations.
