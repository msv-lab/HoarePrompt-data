Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `n - 3`, `mid` is `n // 2`, `rightZero` is either `n // 2 + 1` or twice the number of '0's encountered from index `n // 2` to `n - 1`, `trightZero` is the total number of '0's encountered from index 0 to `n - 1`, `rightOne` is either twice the number of '1's encountered from index `n // 2` to `n - 1` plus 1 or less than `(n - mid + 1) // 2` plus 1, `trightOne` is the total number of '1's encountered from index 0 to `n - 1`, `left` is `mid - 2`, `leftMove` is either 0 or 1, `n` is greater than 0, `rightZero` is less than `(mid + 1) // 2`, `rightOne` is less than `(n - mid + 1) // 2` plus 1, `leftZero` is less than `(left + 1) // 2` and `leftOne` is less than `(left + 1) // 2` minus 1.**

The variable `i` is decremented by 1, changing its value from `n - 2` to `n - 3`. All other variables remain unchanged as the code only affects `i`.
