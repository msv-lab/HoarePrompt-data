Output State: **`s` is a string, `right` is the original index plus 1, `tleftZero` is the original value plus 1, `tleftOne` is unchanged, `trightZero` is unchanged, `trightOne` must be less than (n - right + 1) // 2**

Explanation: The variable `tleftZero` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `right` and its relation to other variables are preserved, and `tleftOne`, `trightZero`, and `trightOne` stay the same.
