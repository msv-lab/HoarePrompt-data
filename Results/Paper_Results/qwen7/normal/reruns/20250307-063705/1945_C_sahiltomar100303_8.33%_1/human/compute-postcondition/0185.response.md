Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `mid`.

2. **Determine Initial Values**: 
   - The loop starts with `i` set to `mid`.
   - `mid` is given as `n // 2`.

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `i < n`.

4. **Initial State**: 
   - After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n // 2`.
   - `mid` will still be `n // 2`.
   - `leftZero` will be twice the number of '0's encountered from index 0 to `n // 2 - 1`.
   - `leftOne` will be twice the number of '1's encountered from index 0 to `n // 2 - 1`.
   - `tleftZero` will be the total number of '0's encountered up to the last iteration.
   - `tleftOne` will be the total number of '1's encountered up to the last iteration.

5. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since the loop starts with `i = mid` and `mid = n // 2`, we need to ensure that `i` is initially set to `n // 2`.
   - The values of `leftZero`, `leftOne`, `tleftZero`, and `tleftOne` are determined by the loop body, but they do not affect the initial state of the loop.

Given this analysis, the only variables that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are `i` and `mid`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is `n // 2`, `mid` is `n // 2`**
