Output State: **`i` is 2; `mid` is a positive integer greater than 1; `leftZero` is increased by 2.**

Explanation: The variable `tleftZero` is assigned the value of `leftZero + 1`. Since `leftZero` was increased by 1 before this line of code, `tleftZero` is now increased by 1 from its previous value, making it increased by 2 in total. The values of `i` and `mid` remain unchanged.
