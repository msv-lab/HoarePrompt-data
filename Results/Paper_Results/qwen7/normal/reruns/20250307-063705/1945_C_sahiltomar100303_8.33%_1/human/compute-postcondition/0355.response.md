Output State: **`i` is `n // 2 + 1`, `mid` is `n // 2`, `rightOne` is `rightOne + 2`**

Explanation: The code `trightOne += 1` increments the value of `rightOne` by 1. Initially, `rightOne` was `rightOne + 1`. After executing the code, `rightOne` becomes `rightOne + 2`. The values of `i` and `mid` remain unchanged.
