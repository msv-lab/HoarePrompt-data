Output State: **`left` is now `left - 1`, `leftZero` is adjusted according to whether `s[left - 1]` is '0' or not, `leftOne` is decreased by 1, and `rightOne` is increased by 1. Additionally, either `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2` or `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2` must still hold true.**

Explanation: The value of `left` is decremented by 1. The conditions for `leftZero` and `leftOne` adjustments remain the same, and the relationship involving `leftZero` and `rightOne` also holds true after the decrement.
