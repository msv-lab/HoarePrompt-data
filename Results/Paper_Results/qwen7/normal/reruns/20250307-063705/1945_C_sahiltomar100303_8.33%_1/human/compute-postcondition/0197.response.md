Output State: **`i` is `n // 2 + 1`, `mid` is `n // 2`, `rightZero` is `rightZero + 2`**

Explanation: The line `trightZero += 1` increments the value of `rightZero` by 1. Since `rightZero` was initially `rightZero + 1`, after executing this line, its new value becomes `rightZero + 2`. The values of `i` and `mid` remain unchanged from their initial states.
