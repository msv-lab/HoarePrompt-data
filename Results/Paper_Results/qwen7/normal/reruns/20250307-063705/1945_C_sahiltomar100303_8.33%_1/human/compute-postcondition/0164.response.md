Output State: **`i` is 1, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is 2, the current value of `s[i]` is '0'**

Explanation: The variable `tleftZero` (which was referred to as `leftZero` in the output state) is incremented by 1. Initially, `leftZero` is 1, so after executing `tleftZero += 1`, `leftZero` becomes 2. The other variables (`i`, `mid`, and the current value of `s[i]`) remain unchanged.
