Output State: **`total` is 0, `students` is 1 less than its initial value and is greater than or equal to 1, `trightOne` is less than `(n - (right + 1)) // 2 - 1`, `tleftZero` is increased by 1 for each iteration until it reaches `(right + 2) // 2`, `tleftOne` is increased by 1 for each iteration, `trightZero` is decreased by 1 for each iteration, `right` is now `n // 2`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the input string, `leftZero` is 0, `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 0.**

The variable `leftOne` is assigned the value 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
