Postcondition: **`s` is a string, `right` is an index within the string `s` plus 1, if `s[right]` is '0', then `tleftZero` is increased by 1 and `trightZero` is decreased by 1. If `s[right]` is not '0', then `tleftOne` is increased by 1 and either `trightZero` is decreased by 1 or `trightOne` is decreased by 1.**
