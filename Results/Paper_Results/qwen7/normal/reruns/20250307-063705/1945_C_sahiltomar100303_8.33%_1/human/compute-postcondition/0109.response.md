Output State: **`s` is a string, `right` is an index within the string `s` plus 1, `tleftOne` is increased by 1, `tleftZero` must be less than `(right + 1) // 2`, `trightOne` is decreased by 1 or `trightOne` must be less than `(n - right + 1) // 2`**

The code `trightOne -= 1` decreases the value of `trightOne` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The conditions involving `tleftZero` and `trightOne` remain the same, just with the updated value of `trightOne`.
