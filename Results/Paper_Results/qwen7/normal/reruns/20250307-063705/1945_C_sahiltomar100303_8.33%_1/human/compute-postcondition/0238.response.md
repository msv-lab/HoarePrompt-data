Output State: `i` is `0`, `mid` is `n // 2`, `rightZero` is either `n // 2 + 2` or twice the number of '0's encountered from index `n // 2` to `n - 1` plus 1, `trightZero` is the total number of '0's encountered from index 0 to `n - 1`, `rightOne` is either twice the number of '1's encountered from index `n // 2` to `n - 1` plus 1 or less than `(n - mid + 1) // 2` plus 1, `trightOne` is the total number of '1's encountered from index 0 to `n - 1`, `left` is `0`, `leftMove` is either 0 or 1, `n` is greater than 0, `rightZero` is less than `(mid + 1) // 2`, `rightOne` is less than `(n - mid + 1) // 2` plus 1, `leftZero` is less than `(left + 1) // 2`, `leftOne` is less than `(left + 1) // 2` minus 1.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `left` will eventually reach 0 because the loop continues as long as `left > 0`. The conditions inside the loop ensure that `leftZero` and `leftOne` are adjusted based on whether the character at `left - 1` is '0' or '1'. Since the loop stops when `left` becomes 0, `i` will also be 0. The values of `mid`, `trightZero`, `trightOne`, `rightZero`, `rightOne`, `leftMove`, `n`, and the inequalities involving these variables will remain as described after the last iteration, assuming they hold true before the final decrement of `left`.
