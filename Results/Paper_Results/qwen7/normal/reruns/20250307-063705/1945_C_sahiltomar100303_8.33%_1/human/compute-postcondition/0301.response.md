Based on the given initial state and the conditions provided:

- `total` is 0.
- `students` is 1 less than its initial value and is greater than or equal to 1.
- `trightOne` is less than \((n - (right + 1)) // 2 - 1\).
- `tleftZero` is increased by 1 for each iteration until it reaches \((right + 2) // 2\).
- `tleftOne` is increased by 1 for each iteration.
- `trightZero` is decreased by 1 for each iteration.
- `right` is equal to \(n - 1\).
- `left` is not equal to 0.
- `right` is not equal to \(n\).
- The absolute difference between \(((n + 1) // 2)\) and `left` is greater than the absolute difference between \(((n + 1) // 2)\) and `right`.

The `print(right)` statement will print the value of `right`, which is given as \(n - 1\).

Output: **n - 1**
