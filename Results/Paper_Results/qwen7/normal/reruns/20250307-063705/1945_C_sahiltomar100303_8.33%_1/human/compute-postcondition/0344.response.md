Output State: **`i` is `n // 2`, `mid` is `n // 2`, `n` must be greater than `n // 2`, `rightZero` is incremented by 1.**

The code `rightZero += 1` increments the value of `rightZero` by 1. Since `rightZero` was not previously defined, it is assumed to be 0 before this line of code is executed. After executing the code, `rightZero` is now 1. All other variables (`i`, `mid`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
