Output State: `left` is equal to 0, `leftMove` is 0, `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `mid` remains as `n // 2`, `rightZero` is incremented by the number of '0's from index `n // 2` to `n - 1`, and `rightOne` is incremented by the number of '1's from index `n // 2` to `n - 1`.

Explanation: The loop continues to decrement `left` until the condition `left > 0 and (leftZero < (left + 1) // 2 or rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2)` no longer holds true. After the loop completes, `left` will be 0 because it starts at `mid` and decreases by 1 each iteration. The conditions for the loop ensure that `leftZero` and `rightOne` are adjusted based on the characters in the string `s` between indices `n // 2` and `n - 1`. Since the loop stops when the conditions are no longer met, `rightZero` and `rightOne` will reflect the counts of '0's and '1's in the specified range of the string `s`.
