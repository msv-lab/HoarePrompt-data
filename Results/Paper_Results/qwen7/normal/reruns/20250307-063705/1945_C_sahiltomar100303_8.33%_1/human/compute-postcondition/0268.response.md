Output State: `i` is `n`, `mid` is `n // 2`, `rightZero` is `0`, `trightZero` is the total number of '0's encountered from index 0 to `n - 1`, `rightOne` is `0`, `trightOne` is the total number of '1's encountered from index 0 to `n - 1`, `left` is `0`, `leftMove` is either 0 or 1, `n` is greater than 0, `rightZero` is `0`, `rightOne` is `0`, `leftZero` is `0`, `leftOne` is `-1` (or less than 0), `right` is `n`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `right` will be equal to `n` because the loop continues as long as `right < n`. The conditions inside the loop ensure that `tleftZero` and `trightOne` are adjusted based on whether the character at `right` is '0' or '1'. Since the loop exits when both `tleftZero` and `trightOne` meet their respective conditions, by the end, `tleftZero` and `trightOne` will reflect the counts of '0's and '1's up to the point where the loop exited. The variables `rightZero` and `rightOne` will be set to 0 because they are reset each iteration, and `leftZero` and `leftOne` will be 0 or -1 (or less than 0) because the loop does not modify them once the initial state is set.
