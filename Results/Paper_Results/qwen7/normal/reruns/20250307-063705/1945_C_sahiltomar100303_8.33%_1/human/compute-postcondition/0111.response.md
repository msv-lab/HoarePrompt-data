Output State: **`s` is a string, `right` is the original index plus 1, `tleftZero` is unchanged, `tleftOne` is unchanged, `trightZero` is unchanged, `trightOne` is unchanged.**

Explanation: The line `right += 1` increments the value of `right` by 1. However, since no other operations are performed on `tleftZero`, `tleftOne`, `trightZero`, or `trightOne`, their values remain unchanged. The initial state of `right` being an index within the string `s` plus 1 also remains valid.
