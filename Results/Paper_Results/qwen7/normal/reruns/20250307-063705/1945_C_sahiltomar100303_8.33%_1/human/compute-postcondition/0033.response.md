Output State: **`i` is 2, `mid` is a positive integer greater than 1, `leftOne` is increased by 2.**

The code `tleftOne += 1` increments the value of `leftOne` by 1. Since `leftOne` was already increased by 1 before this line of code, it is now increased by 2. The values of `i` and `mid` remain unchanged.
