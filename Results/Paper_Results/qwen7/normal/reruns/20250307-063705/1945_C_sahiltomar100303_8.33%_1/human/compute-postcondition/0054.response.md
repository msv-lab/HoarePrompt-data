Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the range `range(mid, n)`.

2. **Determine the initial values**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `mid`.
   - `mid` is `n // 2`.
   - `n` is unchanged.
   - If `s[i]` is '0', then `rightZero` is increased by 2; otherwise, `rightOne` is increased by 2.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will iterate from `mid` to `n-1`.

4. **Calculate the new value of `i`**:
   - Since `i` starts at `mid` and the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` will be `mid + 1`.

5. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.
   - Therefore, for the next iteration, `i` should be `mid + 1`.

6. **Adjust the other states**:
   - `mid` remains unchanged.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `rightZero` and `rightOne` will be updated based on the value of `s[mid + 1]`.

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `i` is `mid + 1`.
- `mid` is `n // 2`.
- `n` is unchanged.
- `rightZero` and `rightOne` will be updated based on the value of `s[mid + 1]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is `mid + 1`, `mid` is `n // 2`, `n` is unchanged, `rightZero` and `rightOne` will be updated based on the value of `s[mid + 1]`**.
