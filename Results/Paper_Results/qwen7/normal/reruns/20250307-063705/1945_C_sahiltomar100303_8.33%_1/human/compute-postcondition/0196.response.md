Output State: **`i` is `n // 2 + 1`, `mid` is `n // 2`, `rightZero` is `rightZero + 1`**

In this case, the code increments the value of `rightZero` by 1. Since `i` and `mid` are not affected by this line of code, their values remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` is still `n // 2 + 1` and `mid` is still `n // 2`. The value of `rightZero` is updated to be its original value plus one.
