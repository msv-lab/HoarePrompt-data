Output State: **`i` is 0, `mid` is a positive integer, and the first character of `s` is not '0'; `leftOne` is 2.**

Explanation: The variable `tleftOne` is updated by adding 1 to its current value. Initially, `leftOne` is 1, so after executing `tleftOne += 1`, `leftOne` becomes 2. The values of `i`, `mid`, and `s` remain unchanged.
