Postcondition: `left` is 0, `leftMove` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `mid` remains as `n // 2`, `rightZero` is incremented by the number of '0's from index `n // 2` to `n - 2`, `rightOne` is incremented by the number of '1's from index `n // 2` to `n - 2`, `right` is `mid + 1`, and either `tleftZero` is less than `(right + 1) // 2` or `trightOne` is less than `(n - right + 1) // 2`. If `s[right]` is '0', then `tleftZero` is incremented by 1 and `trightZero` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `tleftOne` is incremented by 1 and `trightOne` is decreased by 1.
