Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n // 2`, `mid` will still be `n // 2`, `leftZero` will be twice the number of '0's encountered from index 0 to `n // 2 - 1`, `leftOne` will be twice the number of '1's encountered from index 0 to `n // 2 - 1`, `tleftZero` will be the total number of '0's encountered up to the last iteration, and `tleftOne` will be the total number of '1's encountered up to the last iteration.**

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, the variables `leftZero` and `leftOne` will each hold the count of '0's and '1's respectively from the start of the string `s` up to the midpoint (`n // 2`). The variables `tleftZero` and `tleftOne` will hold the cumulative counts of '0's and '1's from the start of the string up to the last executed iteration of the loop.
