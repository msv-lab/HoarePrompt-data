Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `leftMove` is 0, `left` is equal to `mid`, `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `mid` remains as `n // 2`, `rightZero` will be incremented by the number of '0's from index `n // 2` to `n - 1`, and `rightOne` will be incremented by the number of '1's from index `n // 2` to `n - 1`.
Code of the loop:
while left > 0 and (leftZero < (left + 1) // 2 or rightOne < (n - left + 1) //
    2):
    if s[left - 1] == '0':
        leftZero -= 1
        rightZero += 1
    else:
        leftOne -= 1
        rightOne += 1
    left -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `left` is equal to `mid` - 1, `leftMove` is 0, `left` is equal to `mid` - 1, `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `mid` remains as `n // 2`, `rightZero` is incremented by the number of '0's from index `n // 2` to `n - 1`, `rightOne` is incremented by the number of '1's from index `n // 2` to `n - 1`, if the character at index `left - 1` (which is `mid - 2`) in the string `s` is '0', `rightZero` is incremented by 1 and `leftZero` is decreased by 1, otherwise, `rightOne` is incremented by 1 and `leftOne` is decreased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `left` is equal to `mid` - 2, `leftMove` is 0, `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `mid` remains as `n // 2`, `rightZero` is incremented by the number of '0's from index `n // 2` to `n - 1`, `rightOne` is incremented by the number of '1's from index `n // 2` to `n - 1`. If the character at index `left - 1` (which is `mid - 2`) in the string `s` is '0', then `leftZero` is decreased by 1 and `rightZero` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `leftOne` is decreased by 1 and `rightOne` is incremented by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `left` is equal to `mid` - 4, `leftMove` is 0, `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `mid` remains as `n // 2`, `rightZero` is incremented by either 1 (if the character at `left - 1` is '0') or by the number of '0's from index `n // 2` to `n - 1` (if the character at `left - 1` is '1'), and `rightOne` is incremented by either 1 (if the character at `left - 1` is '1') or by the number of '1's from index `n // 2` to `n - 1` (if the character at `left - 1` is '0'). Also, `n` must be greater than 4.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
