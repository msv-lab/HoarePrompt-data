Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `mid` is `n // 2`, `rightZero` is `n // 2 + 1`, `trightZero` is the total number of '0's encountered from index 0 to `n - 1`, `rightOne` is either twice the number of '1's encountered from index `n // 2` to `n - 1` plus 1 or less than `(n - mid + 1) // 2`, `trightOne` is the total number of '1's encountered from index 0 to `n - 1`, `left` is `mid - 1`, `leftMove` is either 0 or 1, `n` is greater than 0, `rightZero` is less than `(mid + 1) // 2`, `rightOne` is less than `(n - mid + 1) // 2`, `leftZero` is less than `(left + 1) // 2` and `leftZero` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The line `rightZero += 1` increments the value of `rightZero` by 1. Initially, `rightZero` was `n // 2`. After adding 1, it becomes `n // 2 + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given conditions.
