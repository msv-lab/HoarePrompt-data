Output State: **`left` is greater than 0 and either `leftZero < (left) // 2` or `rightOne < (n - left) // 2` must still be true, and `leftOne` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `leftOne` is decremented by 1. Since `left` is greater than 0, `leftOne` was initially a positive value. After decrementing, `leftOne` is now one less than its original value. The conditions involving `leftZero`, `leftOne`, `rightOne`, and `n` must still hold true as per the initial state.
