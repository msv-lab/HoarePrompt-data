Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`. The variable `mid` is also mentioned in the postcondition but it is not directly part of the loop head.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop starts from `i = mid` and goes up to `i < n`.

3. **Determine the state adjustments**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n // 2`, `mid` is `n // 2`, and `n` must be greater than `n // 2`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1 (since `i` starts from `n // 2` and increments by 1 each iteration).

4. **Check the loop condition**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n`.
   - Since `i` is currently `n // 2`, for the loop to continue, `n // 2` must be less than `n`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `n // 2 + 1`.
   - `n` remains the same because it is not modified within the loop.
   - `mid` remains the same because it is not modified within the loop.

6. **Postcondition for the next iteration**:
   - `i` must be `n // 2 + 1`.
   - `mid` must be `n // 2`.
   - `n` must still be greater than `n // 2`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is `n // 2 + 1`, `mid` is `n // 2`, `n` must be greater than `n // 2`**
