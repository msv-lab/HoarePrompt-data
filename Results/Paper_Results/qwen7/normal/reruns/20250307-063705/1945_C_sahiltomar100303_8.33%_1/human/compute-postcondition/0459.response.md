Based on the initial state provided:

- `left` is explicitly given as 0.
- `leftMove` is not relevant to the print statement.
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- `mid` remains as `n // 2`.
- `rightZero` and `rightOne` are incremented by the count of '0's and '1's respectively from index `n // 2` to `n - 1`.
- `right` is explicitly given as `n`.
- The absolute difference between `left` and `(n + 1) // 2` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `right` and `(n + 1) // 2`.

The print statement is `print(left)`. Since `left` is explicitly given as 0, the print statement will simply output this value.

Output: **0**
