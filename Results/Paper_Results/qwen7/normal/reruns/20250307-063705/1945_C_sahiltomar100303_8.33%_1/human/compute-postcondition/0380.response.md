Output State: **`left` is equal to `mid` - 1, `leftMove` is 0, `left` is equal to `mid` - 1, `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `mid` remains as `n // 2`, `rightZero` is incremented by the number of '0's from index `n // 2` to `n - 1`, `rightOne` is incremented by the number of '1's from index `n // 2` to `n - 1`, if the character at index `left - 1` (which is `mid - 2`) in the string `s` is '0', `rightZero` is incremented by 1 and `leftZero` is decreased by 1, otherwise, `rightOne` is incremented by 1 and `leftOne` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `left -= 1` decrements the value of `left` by 1. Since `left` was previously equal to `mid`, it now equals `mid - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code. The conditions for incrementing `rightZero` and `rightOne`, and decrementing `leftZero` and `leftOne` based on the character at index `left - 1` still apply.
