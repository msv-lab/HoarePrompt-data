Output State: **`right` is set to `n`, `leftZero` is 0, `tleftZero` and `tleftOne` must be greater than 0, `trightZero` and `trightOne` are unchanged from the previous iteration, `mid` is `n // 2`.**

This means that the variable `leftZero` has been assigned the value 0, while all other variables remain in their initial states as described.
