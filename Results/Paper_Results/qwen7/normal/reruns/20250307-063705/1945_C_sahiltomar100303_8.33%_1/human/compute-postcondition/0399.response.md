Output State: **`left` is 0, `leftMove` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `mid` remains as `n // 2`, `rightZero` is incremented by the number of '0's from index `n // 2` to `n - 1`, `rightOne` is incremented by the number of '1's from index `n // 2` to `n - 1`, `right` is `mid`.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the value of `mid` to the variable `right`. No other variables are affected. The values of `left`, `leftMove`, `i`, `mid`, `rightZero`, and `rightOne` remain unchanged from their previous states.
