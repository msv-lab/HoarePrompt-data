Postcondition: `leftZero` and `leftOne` are updated such that if `s[left - 1] == '0'`, then `leftZero` is decremented by 1 and `leftOne` remains unchanged, while `rightZero` is incremented by 1 and `rightOne` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `leftOne` is decremented by 1 and `leftZero` remains unchanged, while `rightOne` is incremented by 1 and `rightZero` remains unchanged. Additionally, either `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2` or `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2` must still hold true.
