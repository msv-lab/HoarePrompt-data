Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After executing `leftMove = 0`, `left` is equal to `mid`, `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `mid` remains as the integer value obtained from `n // 2`, `rightZero` will be `2 * (n - mid)` (if there are more zeros in the last `n - mid` characters of `s`) or `rightOne` will be `2 * (n - mid) - 1` (if there are more ones in the last `n - mid` characters of `s`), `trightZero` and `trightOne` will be the same as the final values of `rightZero` and `rightOne` respectively, and `leftMove` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while left > 0 and (leftZero < (left + 1) // 2 or rightOne < (n - left + 1) //
    2):
    if s[left - 1] == '0':
        leftZero -= 1
        rightZero += 1
    else:
        leftOne -= 1
        rightOne += 1
    left -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `left` is `left - 1` and is greater than 0; either `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2` or `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2` must still be true. If `s[left - 1] == '0'`, then `leftZero` is decreased by 1, `left` remains greater than 0, `rightZero` is increased by 1. If `s[left - 1] != '0'` and `leftOne` is 0, then `leftZero >= (left + 1) // 2` or `rightOne >= (n - left + 1) // 2` is true.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `left` is now `left - 1`, `leftZero` is adjusted according to whether `s[left - 1]` is '0' or not, `leftOne` is decreased by 1, and `rightOne` is increased by 1. Additionally, either `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2` or `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2` must still hold true.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `leftZero` and `leftOne` are updated according to the conditions described; `left` is decremented by 1; either `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2` or `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2` still holds true.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
