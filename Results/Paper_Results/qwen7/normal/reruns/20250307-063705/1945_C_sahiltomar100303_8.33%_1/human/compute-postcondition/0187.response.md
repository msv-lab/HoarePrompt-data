Output State: **`i` is `n // 2`, `mid` is `n // 2`, and `rightZero` is 1.**

Explanation: The variable `rightZero` is incremented by 1, starting from an unspecified initial value (which is not relevant since it is only incremented). The values of `i` and `mid` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given line of code. Therefore, `i` and `mid` both stay at `n // 2`, and `rightZero` is now 1.
