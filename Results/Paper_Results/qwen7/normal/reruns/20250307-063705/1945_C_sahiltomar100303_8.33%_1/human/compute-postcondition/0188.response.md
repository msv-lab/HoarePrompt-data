Output State: **`i` is `n // 2`, `mid` is `n // 2`, and `trightZero` is 2.**

Explanation: The variable `trightZero` is incremented by 1. Initially, `trightZero` was set to 1. After executing `trightZero += 1`, `trightZero` becomes 2. The values of `i` and `mid` remain unchanged from their initial states.
