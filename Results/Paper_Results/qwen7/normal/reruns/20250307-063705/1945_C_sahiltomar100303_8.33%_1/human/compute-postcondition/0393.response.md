Output State: **`left` is equal to `mid` - 3, `leftMove` is 0, `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `mid` remains as `n // 2`, `rightZero` is incremented by the number of '0's from index `n // 2` to `n - 1`, `rightOne` is incremented by 1 from index `n // 2` to `n - 1`, and `n` must be greater than 4.**

Explanation: The code `rightOne += 1` increments the value of `rightOne` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `rightOne` is now incremented by 1 compared to its previous value, while all other variables retain their original states.
