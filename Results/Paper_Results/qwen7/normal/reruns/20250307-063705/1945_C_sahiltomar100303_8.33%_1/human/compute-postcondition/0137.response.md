Postcondition: **`right` equals `n`, meaning all characters in the string `s` have been processed. At this point, `tleftZero` will be the total number of zeros encountered before `mid` (inclusive), `tleftOne` will be the total number of ones encountered before `mid` (inclusive), `trightZero` will be the total number of zeros encountered from `mid` to `right-1`, and `trightOne` will be the total number of ones encountered from `mid` to `right-1`. Additionally, `left` is not equal to 0, and the condition `tleftZero < (n + 1) // 2` is true.**
