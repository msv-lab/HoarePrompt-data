Output State: **`total` is 0, `students` is 1 less than its initial value and currently must be greater or equal to 1, `trightOne` is less than `(n // 2 + 1) // 2`, `tleftZero` is 1 more than its previous value, `trightZero` is 1 less than its previous value, the current value of `s[right]` is '0'**.

Explanation: The variable `trightZero` is decremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states. Therefore, `trightZero` is now 1 less than its previous value.
