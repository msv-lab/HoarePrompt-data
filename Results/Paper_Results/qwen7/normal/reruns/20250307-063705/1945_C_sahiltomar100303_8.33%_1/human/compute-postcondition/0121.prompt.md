Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `left` will be 0, `leftZero` and `leftOne` will be adjusted based on the binary string `s` such that no further moves can be made according to the given conditions, and `rightZero` and `rightOne` will reflect the counts of zeros and ones in the remaining part of the string starting from `mid` to the end of the string. The conditions `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2` or `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2` will no longer be true, indicating that the loop has terminated when these conditions fail for the final time. `right` is now set to `mid`.
Code of the loop:
while right < n and (tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2 or trightOne < (n - right +
    1) // 2):
    if s[right] == '0':
        tleftZero += 1
        trightZero -= 1
    else:
        tleftOne += 1
        trightOne -= 1
    right += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `s` is a string, `right` is an index within the string `s` plus 1, `tleftZero` is unchanged, `trightZero` is unchanged, `trightOne` is unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `s` is a string, `right` is the original index plus 1, `tleftZero` is unchanged, `tleftOne` is unchanged, `trightZero` is unchanged, `trightOne` is unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `s` is a string, `right` is the original index plus 2, `tleftZero` is either the original value plus 1 or remains unchanged, `tleftOne` is incremented by 1 if the character at `right-1` is '0', otherwise it remains unchanged, `trightZero` is unchanged, `trightOne` is decreased by 1 if the character at `right-1` is '0', otherwise it remains unchanged.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
