Output State: **`i` is 1, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is 1, the current value of `s[i]` is '0'**

Explanation: The variable `leftZero` is incremented by 1. Initially, `leftZero` was not specified, but since no initial value was given, we assume it was 0 before this line of code. After executing `leftZero += 1`, `leftZero` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
