Postcondition: `total` is 0, `students` is either 1 or 2 less than its initial value and is greater than or equal to 1, `trightOne` is less than or equal to `(n // 2 + 1) // 2 - 1`, and `tleftZero` and `tleftOne` are updated as follows: if `s[right]` is '0', then `tleftZero` is 1 more than its previous value and `trightZero` is 1 less than its previous value; otherwise, `tleftOne` is increased by 1.
