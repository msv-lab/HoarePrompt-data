Output State: **`i` is `n // 2`, `mid` is `n // 2`, `n` must be greater than `n // 2`, and `s[i] != '0'`, `rightOne` is `rightOne + 1`**.

This means that the variable `rightOne` has been incremented by 1, while the other variables (`i`, `mid`, `n`, and `s[i]`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
