Output State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `s` is a string, `right` is equal to `n`, `tleftZero` is the total count of zeros in the string `s` up to the index where the loop terminates, `tleftOne` is the total count of ones in the string `s` up to the index where the loop terminates, `trightZero` is 0, and `trightOne` is 0.

This means that the loop continues to increment `right` until it reaches the end of the string (`n`). During each iteration, the counts of zeros (`tleftZero`) and ones (`tleftOne`) are updated based on the character at the current `right` position. Once `right` equals `n`, the loop terminates, and `trightZero` and `trightOne` are set to 0 because there are no more characters to process beyond the end of the string.
