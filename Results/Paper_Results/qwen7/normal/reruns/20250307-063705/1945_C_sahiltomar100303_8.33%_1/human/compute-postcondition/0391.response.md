Output State: **`left` is equal to `mid` - 3, `leftMove` is 0, `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `mid` remains as `n // 2`, `rightZero` is incremented by 1, `rightOne` is incremented by the number of '1's from index `n // 2` to `n - 1**, and `n` must be greater than 4.

Explanation: The code increments `rightZero` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
