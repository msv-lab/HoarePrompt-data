Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `mid` is `n // 2`, `rightZero` is twice the number of '0's encountered from index `n // 2` to `n - 1`, `trightZero` is the total number of '0's encountered from index 0 to `n - 1`, `rightOne` is either twice the number of '1's encountered from index `n // 2` to `n - 1` plus 1 or less than `(n - mid + 1) // 2`, `trightOne` is the total number of '1's encountered from index 0 to `n - 1`, `left` is `mid - 1`, `leftMove` is either 0 or 1, `n` is greater than 0, `rightZero` is less than `(mid + 1) // 2`, `rightOne` is less than `(n - mid + 1) // 2`, and `leftZero` must be less than `(left + 1) // 2`; `leftOne` is decreased by 1.**

This means that the value of `leftOne` has been decremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
