Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `mid`.

2. **Determine the initial values at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `n // 2`
   - `mid` is `n // 2`
   - `s[i]` is checked, and based on its value, either `trightZero` is set to 2 or `rightOne` is incremented by 2.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i` to `n-1` (inclusive).

4. **Determine the new value of `i` at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop starts from `i` and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.

5. **Check if the loop should continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n`.
   - Given that `i` was `n // 2` at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` will be `n // 2 + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `n // 2 + 1` must be less than `n`.

6. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be updated to `n // 2 + 1`.
   - `mid` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop body.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is `n // 2 + 1`, `mid` is `n // 2`**.
