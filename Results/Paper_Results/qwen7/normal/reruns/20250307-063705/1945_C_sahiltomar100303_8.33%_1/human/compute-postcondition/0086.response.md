Output State: **`leftZero` is `leftZero - 1`; `rightZero` is `rightZero + 1`; either `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2` or `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2` must still hold true.**

Explanation: The code increments `rightZero` by 1. The initial conditions that `leftZero` is `leftZero - 1` and that either `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2` or `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2` must still hold true remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes the incremented `rightZero` and the unchanged conditions.
