Output State: **`right` is set to `n`, `leftZero` is 0, `rightZero` is 0, `tleftZero` and `tleftOne` must be greater than 0, `trightZero` and `trightOne` are unchanged from the previous iteration, `mid` is `n // 2`.**

Explanation: The code sets `rightZero` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `right` is still set to `n`, `leftZero` remains 0, and `rightZero` is now 0. The conditions for `tleftZero` and `tleftOne` and the states of `trightZero` and `trightOne` remain the same, and `mid` is still `n // 2`.
