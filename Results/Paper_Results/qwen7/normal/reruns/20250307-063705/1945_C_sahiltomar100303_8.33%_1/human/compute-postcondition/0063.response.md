Output State: **After executing `left = mid`, `i` will be equal to `n - 1`, `mid` will remain as the integer value obtained from `n // 2`, and either `rightZero` will be `2 * (n - mid)` (if there are more zeros in the last `n - mid` characters of `s`) or `rightOne` will be `2 * (n - mid) - 1` (if there are more ones in the last `n - mid` characters of `s`). The values of `trightZero` and `trightOne` will be the same as the final values of `rightZero` and `rightOne` respectively; `left` is now equal to `mid`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will point to the last index of the string `s`. `mid` will still be half of the length of `s` (rounded down). Depending on whether there are more zeros or ones in the second half of the string (from index `mid` to the end), `rightZero` or `rightOne` will be set accordingly. The values of `trightZero` and `trightOne` will reflect the counts of zeros and ones in the entire string `s`. Additionally, `left` is now set to the value of `mid`.
