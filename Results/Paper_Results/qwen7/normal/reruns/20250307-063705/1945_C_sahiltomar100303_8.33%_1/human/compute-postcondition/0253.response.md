Output State: **`total` is 0, `students` is 2 less than its initial value and is greater than or equal to 1, `trightOne` is less than `(n - (right + 1)) // 2`, `tleftZero` is equal to `(right + 2) // 2`, `trightZero` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `trightZero -= 1` decreases the value of `trightZero` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
