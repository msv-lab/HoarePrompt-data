Output State: **`left` must be greater than 0, `leftMove` is 0, `left` is equal to `mid`, `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `mid` remains as `n // 2`, `rightZero` will be incremented by the number of '0's from index `n // 2` to `n - 1`, `rightOne` will be incremented by the number of '1's from index `n // 2` to `n - 1`, and the character at index `left - 1` in the string `s` is not '0', `leftOne` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `leftOne -= 1` decreases the value of `leftOne` by 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged according to the initial state description.
