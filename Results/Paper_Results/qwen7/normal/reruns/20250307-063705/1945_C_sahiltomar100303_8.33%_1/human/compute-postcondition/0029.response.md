Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `mid`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `mid`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `mid` is a positive integer.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues if `i < mid`, and `i` is currently 1, the loop will continue as long as `mid` is greater than 1.
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration, so it will become 2.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be 2, and `mid` must still be a positive integer greater than 1.

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is 2, `mid` is a positive integer greater than 1**
