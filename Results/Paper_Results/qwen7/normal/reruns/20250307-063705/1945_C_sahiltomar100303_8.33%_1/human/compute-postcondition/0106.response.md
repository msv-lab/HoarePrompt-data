Output State: **`s` is a string, `right` is an index within the string `s` plus 1, `tleftZero` is increased by 1, `trightOne` must be less than `(n - right + 1) // 2`**

Explanation: The variable `tleftZero` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`s`, `right`, and `trightOne`) remain unchanged. The condition involving `trightOne` remains valid as it was not affected by the code.
