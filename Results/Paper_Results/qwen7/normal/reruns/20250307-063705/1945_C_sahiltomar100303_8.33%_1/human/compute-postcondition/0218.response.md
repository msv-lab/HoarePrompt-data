Postcondition: `i` is `n - 1`, `mid` is `n // 2`, `rightZero` is twice the number of '0's encountered from index `n // 2` to `n - 1`, `trightZero` is the total number of '0's encountered from index 0 to `n - 1`, `rightOne` is twice the number of '1's encountered from index `n // 2` to `n - 1`, `trightOne` is the total number of '1's encountered from index 0 to `n - 1`, `left` is `mid`, `leftMove` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `rightZero` must be less than `(mid + 1) // 2`, `rightOne` must be less than `(n - mid + 1) // 2`, `s[left - 1]` is not '0'
