Output State: **`i` is 0, `mid` is a positive integer, and the first character of `s` is not '0'; `leftOne` is 1.**

Explanation: The variable `leftOne` is incremented by 1. Since `leftOne` was initially 0 (implied from the context), after executing `leftOne += 1`, its value becomes 1. The values of `i`, `mid`, and the first character of `s` remain unchanged.
