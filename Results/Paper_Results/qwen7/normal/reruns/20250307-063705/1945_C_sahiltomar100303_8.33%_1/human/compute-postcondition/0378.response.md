Postcondition: `left` is greater than 0, `leftMove` is 0, `left` is equal to `mid`, `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `mid` remains as `n // 2`, `rightZero` is incremented by the number of '0's from index `n // 2` to `n - 1`, `rightOne` is incremented by the number of '1's from index `n // 2` to `n - 1`. If the character at index `left - 1` in the string `s` is '0', then `rightZero` is incremented by 1 and `leftZero` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `rightOne` is incremented by 1 and `leftOne` is decreased by 1.
