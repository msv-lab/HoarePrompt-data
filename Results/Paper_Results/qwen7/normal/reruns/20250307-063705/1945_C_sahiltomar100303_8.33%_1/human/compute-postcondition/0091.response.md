Output State: **`leftZero` and `leftOne` are updated according to the conditions described; `left` is decremented by 1; either `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2` or `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2` still holds true.**

Explanation: The line `left -= 1` decrements the value of `left` by 1. The conditions for updating `leftZero` and `leftOne` remain unchanged, and the condition involving `rightOne` still needs to hold true. Therefore, the updated state includes the decrement of `left`, and the conditions related to `leftZero`, `leftOne`, and `rightOne` are maintained as per the initial postcondition.
