Output State: **`i` is `n // 2 + 2`, `mid` is `n // 2`, `rightOne` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `rightOne += 1` increments the value of `rightOne` by 1. The values of `i` and `mid` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `i` is still `n // 2 + 2`, `mid` is still `n // 2`, and `rightOne` is incremented by 1.
