Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `mid` is `n // 2`, `rightZero` is `n // 2 + 1`, `trightZero` is the total number of '0's encountered from index 0 to `n - 1`, `rightOne` is less than `(n - mid + 1) // 2`, `trightOne` is the total number of '1's encountered from index 0 to `n - 1`, `left` is `mid`, `leftMove` is 1, and `n` is greater than 0.**

Explanation: The line `rightZero += 1` increments the value of `rightZero` by 1. Initially, `rightZero` was `n // 2`. After adding 1, `rightZero` becomes `n // 2 + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
