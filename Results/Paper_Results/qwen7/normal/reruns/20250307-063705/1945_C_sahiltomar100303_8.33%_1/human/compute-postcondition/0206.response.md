Output State: **`i` is `n // 2 + 2`, `mid` is `n // 2`, `rightOne` is `rightOne + 2`**

Explanation: The code `trightOne += 1` increments the value of `rightOne` by 1. Since `trightOne` was previously `rightOne + 1`, after the increment, `rightOne` becomes `rightOne + 2`. The values of `i` and `mid` remain unchanged from their initial states.
