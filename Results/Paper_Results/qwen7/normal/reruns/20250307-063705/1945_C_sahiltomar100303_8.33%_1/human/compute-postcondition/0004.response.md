Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string input by the user, `mid` is `n // 2`.**

Explanation: The code `mid = n // 2` assigns the value of `n // 2` (integer division of `n` by 2) to the variable `mid`. The values of `t` and `s` remain unchanged from their initial states.
