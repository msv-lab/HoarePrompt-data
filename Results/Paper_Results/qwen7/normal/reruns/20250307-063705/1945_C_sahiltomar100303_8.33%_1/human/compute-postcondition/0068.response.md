Output State: **`leftZero` is decreased by 1, `left` is greater than 0, and either `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2` or `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2` must still be true.**

Explanation: The variable `leftZero` is decremented by 1. The conditions involving `leftZero` and `rightOne` must still hold true as per the initial postconditions. The value of `left` remains greater than 0, and the relationship between `leftZero` and the given expressions, as well as `rightOne` and its corresponding expression, must still be satisfied.
