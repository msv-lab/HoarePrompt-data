Based on the initial state provided:

- `left` is 0
- `leftMove` is 0
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `mid` remains as `n // 2`
- `rightZero` is incremented by the number of '0's from index `n // 2` to `n - 1`
- `rightOne` is incremented by the number of '1's from index `n // 2` to `n - 1`
- `right` is `n`
- The condition `right == n` is true
- `rightOne` is less than `(n + 1) // 2`

The `print(right)` statement will print the value of `right`.

Since `right` is explicitly stated to be `n`, the output will be:

Output: **n**
