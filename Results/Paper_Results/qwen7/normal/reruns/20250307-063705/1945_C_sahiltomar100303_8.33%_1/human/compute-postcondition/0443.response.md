Postcondition: **`left` is 0, `leftMove` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `mid` remains as `n // 2`, `rightZero` is incremented by the number of '0's from index `n // 2` to `n - 1`, `rightOne` is incremented by the number of '1's from index `n // 2` to `n - 1`, `right` is `n`. If `right != n`, the condition `right != n` is still true. If `right == n`, then either the function does nothing, or `rightOne` is less than `(n + 1) // 2`.**
