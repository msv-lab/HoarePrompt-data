Output State: **`left` is 0, `leftMove` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `mid` remains as `n // 2`, `rightZero` is incremented by the number of '0's from index `n // 2` to `n - 2`, `rightOne` is incremented by the number of '1's from index `n // 2` to `n - 2`, `right` is `mid + 1`, `tleftOne` is `tleftOne + 1`, `trightOne` is decreased by 1, and either `tleftZero` is less than `(right + 1) // 2` or `trightOne` is less than `(n - right + 1) // 2`.**

Explanation: The code `trightOne -= 1` decreases the value of `trightOne` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
