Postcondition: **The loop has terminated, meaning all characters in the string `s` have been processed. At this point, `tleftZero` will be the total number of zeros encountered before `mid` (inclusive), `tleftOne` will be the total number of ones encountered before `mid` (inclusive), `trightZero` will be the total number of zeros encountered from `mid` to `right-1`, and `trightOne` will be the total number of ones encountered from `mid` to `right-1`. The value of `right` is now set to `n`. Additionally, `left` is still equal to 0. The current value of `rightOne` is greater than or equal to half of `n + 1`**.
