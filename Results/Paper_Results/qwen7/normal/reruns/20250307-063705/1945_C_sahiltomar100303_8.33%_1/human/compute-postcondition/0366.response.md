Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be equal to `n - 1`, `mid` remains as `n // 2`. The variable `rightZero` will be incremented by the number of '0's from index `n // 2` to `n - 1`, and `rightOne` will be incremented by the number of '1's from index `n // 2` to `n - 1`.

This means that `rightZero` and `rightOne` will hold the counts of '0's and '1's respectively in the substring starting from the middle index (`n // 2`) to the end of the string (`n - 1`).
