Output State: **`leftOne` is `leftOne - 1`, `rightOne` is `rightOne + 1`, and either `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2` or `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2` still holds true.**

Explanation: The variable `rightOne` is incremented by 1. The conditions involving `leftZero`, `leftOne`, `rightOne`, and `n` remain unchanged as they are still valid after the code execution.
