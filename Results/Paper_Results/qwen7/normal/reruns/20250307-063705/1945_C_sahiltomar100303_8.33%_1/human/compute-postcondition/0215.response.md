Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `mid` is `n // 2`, `rightZero` is twice the number of '0's encountered from index `n // 2` to `n - 1`, `trightZero` is the total number of '0's encountered from index 0 to `n - 1`, `rightOne` is twice the number of '1's encountered from index `n // 2` to `n - 1`, `trightOne` is the total number of '1's encountered from index 0 to `n - 1`, `left` is `mid`, `leftMove` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `rightZero` is less than `(mid + 1) // 2`, `rightOne` is less than `(n - mid + 1) // 2`, and the current value of `s[left - 1]` is '0'.**

Explanation: The line `leftZero -= 1` decreases the value of `leftZero` by 1. Since `leftZero` was previously defined as twice the number of '0's encountered from index `n // 2` to `n - 1`, its new value is now one less than the original count. All other variables remain unchanged. The condition that `rightZero` is less than `(mid + 1) // 2` and `rightOne` is less than `(n - mid + 1) // 2` remains valid. The value of `leftMove` is updated to 1 because `leftZero` has been decremented.
