Output State: **`left` is greater than 0, `leftZero` < (left) // 2 or `rightOne` < (n - left) // 2 is still true, `leftOne` is decreased by 1, `rightOne` is increased by 1**.

This means that the value of `leftOne` has been decreased by 1, and the value of `rightOne` has been increased by 1. The conditions involving `leftZero` and `rightOne` remain unchanged as per the initial state, and `left` remains greater than 0.
