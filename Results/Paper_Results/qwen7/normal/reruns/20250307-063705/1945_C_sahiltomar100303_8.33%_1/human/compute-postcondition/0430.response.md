Output State: `left` is 0, `leftMove` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `mid` remains as `n // 2`, `rightZero` is incremented by the number of '0's from index `n // 2` to `n - 1`, `rightOne` is incremented by the number of '1's from index `n // 2` to `n - 1`, `right` is `n`.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `right` until either `right` reaches `n` or both `tleftZero >= (right + 1) // 2` and `trightOne >= (n - right + 1) // 2` are true. After executing the loop three times, `right` is at `n // 2 + 3`. Since the loop condition checks `right < n`, it will continue to run until `right` equals `n`. Therefore, after all iterations, `right` will be `n`. The values of `left`, `leftMove`, `i`, `mid`, `rightZero`, and `rightOne` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
