Postcondition: **The loop has terminated, meaning all characters in the string `s` have been processed. At this point, `tleftZero` will be the total number of zeros encountered before `mid` (inclusive), `tleftOne` will be the total number of ones encountered before `mid` (inclusive), `trightZero` will be the total number of zeros encountered from `mid` to `right-1`, and `trightOne` will be the total number of ones encountered from `mid` to `right-1`. The value of `right` is now set to `n`. Additionally, `left` is still equal to 0. The number of ones encountered up to `mid` (inclusive), `tleftOne`, is less than half of the total length of the string, i.e., `tleftOne < (n + 1) // 2`.**
