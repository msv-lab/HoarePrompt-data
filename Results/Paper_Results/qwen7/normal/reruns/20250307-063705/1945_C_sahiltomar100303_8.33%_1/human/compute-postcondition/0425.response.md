Output State: **`left` is 0, `leftMove` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `mid` remains as `n // 2`, `rightZero` is incremented by the number of '0's from index `n // 2` to `n - 2`, `rightOne` is incremented by the number of '1's from index `n // 2` to `n - 2`, `right` is `n // 2 + 2`, `tleftZero` must be less than `(right + 1) // 2`, `tleftOne` is 1, `trightOne` is equal to `(n - right + 1) // 2 - 1`**

Explanation: The code subtracts 1 from `trightOne`. The value of `trightOne` was originally less than `(n - right + 1) // 2`, so after subtracting 1, it becomes equal to `(n - right + 1) // 2 - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
