Output State: **`right` is set to `n`, `leftZero` is 0, `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 0, `rightOne` is 0, `tleftZero` is 0, `trightZero` is 0, `trightOne` is 0, `mid` is `n // 2`, `tleftOne` is 0**.

Explanation: The line `trightOne = 0` sets the value of `trightOne` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
