Output State: **`i` is 0, `mid` is a positive integer, `s[i]` is '0', `leftZero` is 1**

The code `leftZero += 1` increments the value of `leftZero` by 1. Since `leftZero` was initially 0, after executing this line, its value becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
