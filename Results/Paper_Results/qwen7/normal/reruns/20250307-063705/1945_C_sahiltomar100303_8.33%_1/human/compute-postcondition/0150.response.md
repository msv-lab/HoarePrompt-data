Output State: **`right` is set to `n`, `tleftZero` and `tleftOne` must be greater than 0, `trightZero` and `trightOne` are unchanged from the previous iteration, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The values of `right`, `tleftZero`, `tleftOne`, `trightZero`, and `trightOne` remain unchanged from their initial state.
