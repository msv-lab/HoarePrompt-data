Postcondition: **`total` is 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `mid` is `n // 2`, `rightZero` is either `n // 2 + 1` or twice the number of '0's encountered from index `n // 2` to `n - 1`, `trightZero` is the total number of '0's encountered from index 0 to `n - 1`, `rightOne` is either twice the number of '1's encountered from index `n // 2` to `n - 1` plus 1 or less than `(n - mid + 1) // 2` plus 1, `trightOne` is the total number of '1's encountered from index 0 to `n - 1`, `left` is `mid - 1`, `leftMove` is either 0 or 1, `n` is greater than 0, `rightZero` is less than `(mid + 1) // 2`, `rightOne` is less than `(n - mid + 1) // 2` plus 1, `leftZero` is less than `(left + 1) // 2` and `leftOne` is less than `(left + 1) // 2` minus 1.**

This postcondition summarizes both the if and else parts of the if-else block. It states that depending on whether the character at `s[left - 1]` is '0' or not, either `leftZero` is decreased by 1 or `leftOne` is decreased by 1, while keeping other conditions intact.
