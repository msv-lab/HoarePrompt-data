Based on the initial state provided:

- `right` equals `n`, meaning all characters in the string `s` have been processed.
- The conditions `right == n` is false and `left` is not equal to 0 indicate that the loop or process has not yet fully completed, but it is close to being done.
- The condition involving `left` and `right` being close to half of `n+1` suggests that `left` is closer to the midpoint of the string length than `right`.

Given these conditions, the value of `left` must be such that it is closer to half of `n+1` than `right` is, but still not equal to `n` (which would mean all characters have been processed).

However, since `right` equals `n` and the condition `right == n` is false, this implies there might be a misunderstanding in the problem setup because if `right` equals `n`, then `right == n` should be true. Given the constraints, let's assume the closest logical scenario where `left` is just before `n` and closer to the midpoint.

Thus, `left` would be `n-1` because it is the last position before `right` reaches `n`.

Output: **n-1**
