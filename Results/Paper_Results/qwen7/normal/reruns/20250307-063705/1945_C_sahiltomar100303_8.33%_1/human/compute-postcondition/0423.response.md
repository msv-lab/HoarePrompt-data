Output State: **`left` is 0, `leftMove` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `mid` remains as `n // 2`, `rightZero` is incremented by the number of '0's from index `n // 2` to `n - 2`, `rightOne` is incremented by the number of '1's from index `n // 2` to `n - 2`, `right` is `n // 2 + 2`, `tleftZero` is `tleftZero + 1`, `trightZero` is decreased by 1, `trightOne` must be less than `(n - right + 1) // 2`**

Explanation: The line `trightZero -= 1` decreases the value of `trightZero` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states.
