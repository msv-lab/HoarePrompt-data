Output State: **`i` is `mid + 1`, `mid` is `n // 2`, `n` is unchanged, `rightZero` is `rightZero + 2`.**

Explanation: The variable `trightZero` is updated to be `rightZero + 1`. Given the initial state where `rightZero` is `rightZero + 1`, after executing the line `trightZero += 1`, the value of `rightZero` becomes `rightZero + 2`. The values of `i`, `mid`, and `n` remain unchanged.
