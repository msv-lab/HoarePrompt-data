Output State: **`i` is `0`, `mid` is `n // 2`, `rightZero` is either `n // 2 + 3` or twice the number of '0's encountered from index `n // 2` to `n - 1` plus 2, `trightZero` is the total number of '0's encountered from index 0 to `n - 1`, `rightOne` is either twice the number of '1's encountered from index `n // 2` to `n - 1` plus 1 or less than `(n - mid + 1) // 2` plus 2, `trightOne` is the total number of '1's encountered from index 0 to `n - 1`, `left` is `0`, `leftMove` is either 0 or 1, `n` is greater than 0, `rightZero` is less than `(mid + 1) // 2`, `rightOne` is less than `(n - mid + 1) // 2` plus 2, `leftZero` is less than `(left + 1) // 2`, `leftOne` is less than `(left + 1) // 2` minus 1, `right` is `mid`.**

The code `right = mid` simply assigns the value of `mid` to the variable `right`. Since `mid` is `n // 2`, `right` now holds the same value as `mid`. All other variables remain unchanged.
