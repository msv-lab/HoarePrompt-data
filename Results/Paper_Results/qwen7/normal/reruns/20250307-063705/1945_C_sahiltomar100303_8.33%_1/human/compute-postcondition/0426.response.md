Postcondition: `left` is 0, `leftMove` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `mid` remains as `n // 2`, `rightZero` is incremented by the number of '0's from index `n // 2` to `n - 2`, `rightOne` is incremented by the number of '1's from index `n // 2` to `n - 2`, `right` is `n // 2 + 2`. If `s[right]` is '0', then `tleftZero` is incremented by 1 and `trightZero` is decreased by 1, and `trightOne` must still be less than `(n - right + 1) // 2`. Otherwise, `tleftOne` is set to 1 and `trightOne` is set to `(n - right + 1) // 2 - 1`.
