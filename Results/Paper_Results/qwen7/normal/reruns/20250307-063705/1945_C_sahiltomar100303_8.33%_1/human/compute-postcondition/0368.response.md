Output State: **`leftMove` is 0, `left` is equal to `mid`, `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `mid` remains as `n // 2`, `rightZero` will be incremented by the number of '0's from index `n // 2` to `n - 1`, and `rightOne` will be incremented by the number of '1's from index `n // 2` to `n - 1`.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `leftMove`. This does not affect the values of `left`, `i`, `mid`, `rightZero`, or `rightOne`. Therefore, these variables retain their previous states as described in the initial state.
