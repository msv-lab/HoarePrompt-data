Postcondition: `i` is `n // 2 + 2`, `mid` is `n // 2`, `rightZero` and `rightOne` are incremented by either 1 or 2 based on the value of `s[n // 2 + 1]`. If `s[n // 2 + 1]` is '0', `rightZero` is incremented by 1 and `rightOne` is incremented by 1. If `s[n // 2 + 1]` is '1', `rightOne` is incremented by 2.
