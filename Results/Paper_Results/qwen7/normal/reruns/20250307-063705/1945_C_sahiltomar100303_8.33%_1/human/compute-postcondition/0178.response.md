Output State: **`i` is 3, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is 3, if `s[3]` equals '0', then `leftZero` is 3, otherwise `leftOne` is 3.**

Explanation: The variable `leftZero` is incremented by 1, so its new value is 3. The other variables (`i`, `mid`, `leftOne`, and the condition involving `s[3]`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
