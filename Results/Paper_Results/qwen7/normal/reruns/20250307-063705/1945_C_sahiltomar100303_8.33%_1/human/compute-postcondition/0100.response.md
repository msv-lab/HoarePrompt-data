Output State: **`s` is a string, `right` is an index within the string `s`, and the character at index `right` is not '0'; `tleftOne` is increased by 1.**

The code `tleftOne += 1` increments the value of `tleftOne` by 1. The initial state of `s`, `right`, and the character at index `right` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `tleftOne`.
