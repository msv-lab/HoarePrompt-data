Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variable `v` and the range `range(na_frente, -1, -1)`. This means `v` starts from `na_frente` and decrements by 1 until it reaches -1.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `v` is greater than or equal to -1. At the end of the previous iteration, `v` was one less than its value at the start of the current iteration. 

3. **Determine the New Value of `v`**: Since `v` was one less than its value at the start of the current iteration, and the loop decrements `v` by 1 each time, `v` at the start of the next iteration will be one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `total`: The value of `total` could either be the sum of its original value and `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or the sum of its original value and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` based on the conditions given.
   - `v`: As determined, `v` will be one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `best`: The value of `best` is already determined based on the conditions involving `total`, `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` at the end of the previous iteration, so it does not change.
   - `cases`, `c`, `na_frente`, `pos_final`, `custo_pra_passar_b`: These variables remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the next iteration are `total` and `v`.

**State:**
- `total` is either the sum of its original value and `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or the sum of its original value and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.
- `v` is one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration.
- `best`, `cases`, `c`, `na_frente`, `pos_final`, and `custo_pra_passar_b` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the updated state is:
**`total` is either the sum of its original value and `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or the sum of its original value and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `v` is one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration, `best` is the same, `cases` is the same, `c` is the same, `na_frente` is the same, `pos_final` is the same, and `custo_pra_passar_b` is the same.**
