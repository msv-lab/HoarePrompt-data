Output State: **`best` is set based on the condition involving `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `cases` is a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{cases} \leq 10^4\), `c` is 1, `na_frente` is the same, `pos_final` is the same, `custo_pra_passar_b` is the same, `total` is the sum of its original value and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, and `v` is one less than its value at the start of the current iteration.**

Explanation: The code `total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]` increments the value of `total` by the value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
