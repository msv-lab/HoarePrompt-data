Postcondition: **`best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is true. Otherwise, `best` remains unchanged. `cases` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ cases ≤ 10^4, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is greater than or equal to -1, `pos_final` is one less than its original input integer, `total` is increased by either `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]` is true, or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` if the condition is false, and `v` is now `v + 1` and is greater than `pos_final - 1`.**
