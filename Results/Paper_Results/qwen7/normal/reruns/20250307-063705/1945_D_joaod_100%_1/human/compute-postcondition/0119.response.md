Postcondition: `total` is either the sum of its original value and `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or the sum of its original value and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`; `v` is one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration; `best`, `cases`, `c`, `na_frente`, `pos_final`, and `custo_pra_passar_b` remain unchanged.
