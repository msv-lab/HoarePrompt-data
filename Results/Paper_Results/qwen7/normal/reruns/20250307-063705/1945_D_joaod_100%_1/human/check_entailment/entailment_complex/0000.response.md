Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the number of test cases (`cases`), the number of people in the queue (`na_frente`), and the maximum allowable final position (`pos_final`). It also correctly reads and stores the costs for swapping (`custo_pra_trocar_a`) and passing (`custo_pra_passar_b`).

2. **Loop Logic**: The program iterates backward through the list of people in the queue, starting from the last person (`na_frente - 1`) down to the first person (`0`). This ensures that the program considers the cumulative cost of moving Kirill to the desired position while accounting for the costs of swapping and passing.

3. **Cost Calculation**: 
   - The program correctly updates the `best` variable to store the minimum cumulative cost found so far.
   - It handles the conditions for swapping and passing correctly, ensuring that the cost of swapping is considered only if it is less than the cost of passing.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases where Kirill needs to move to a position beyond his current position by accumulating the appropriate costs.

5. **Output**: The program prints the minimum cumulative cost for each test case, which is stored in the `best` variable.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
