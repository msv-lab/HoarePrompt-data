Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple inputs (t, n, m, a, b) where t is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, and for each test case, n and m are positive integers with 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, and a and b are lists of n positive integers ranging from 1 to 10^9. The function returns a result based on the processing of these inputs.**
