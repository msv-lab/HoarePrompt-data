Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `v` and `na_frente`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates from `na_frente` to `-1` in reverse order (decrementing by 1 each time).

3. **Determine the state changes inside the loop**: Inside the loop, `v` is decremented by 1 each iteration. The postconditions given include:
   - `v` is one less than the previous value of `v`.
   - `total` is increased by either `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.
   - `best` is updated based on certain conditions.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `v` is decremented by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `v` will be one less than its current value.
   - `na_frente` remains unchanged unless the loop exits due to some condition outside the loop body.

Given the postconditions and the loop structure, let's adjust the states:

- `v` will be one less than its current value.
- `na_frente` remains unchanged.
- `total` is increased by either `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.
- `best` might be updated, but since we are focusing on the loop head variables, we don't need to explicitly state the update for `best`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`na_frente` is a non-negative integer, `v` is one less than the previous value of `v` and must be greater than or equal to `-1`; `total` is increased by either `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, and `best` remains unchanged.**
