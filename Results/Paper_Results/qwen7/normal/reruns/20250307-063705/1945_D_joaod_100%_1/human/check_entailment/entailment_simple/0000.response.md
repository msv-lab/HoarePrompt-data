Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**: 
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`cases`) and iterates through each test case.
   - It then reads the number of people in front of Kirill (`na_frente`) and the maximum allowable final position (`pos_final`), adjusting them by subtracting 1.
   - It correctly reads and initializes the lists `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` from the input.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The program iterates backward from `na_frente` to 0, which is correct for calculating the minimum cost to move Kirill to a position no greater than `pos_final`.
   - It updates the `best` variable to store the minimum cumulative cost found during the iteration.
   - The logic for updating `total` and deciding whether to swap positions or pass through is correct. Specifically, it checks if swapping is cheaper than passing through and updates accordingly.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the value of `best` for each test case, which is the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to follow the problem statement correctly and handles all aspects of the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
