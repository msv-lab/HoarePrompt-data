Output State: **`na_frente` is a non-negative integer, `v` is one less than the previous value of `v` and must be greater than or equal to `-1`; `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, and `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`.**

Explanation: The code `total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` increases the value of `total` by the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. The values of `na_frente`, `v`, and `best` remain unchanged from their initial postconditions. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `total` and retains the conditions specified for `na_frente`, `v`, and `best`.
