Output State: **`best` is the minimum cumulative cost found during the loop, `cases` is the same as before, `c` is incremented by 1, `na_frente` is assigned the value of the first integer input, `pos_final` is assigned the value of the second integer input, and `custo_pra_passar_b` and `total` remain unchanged.**

This means that the variables `best`, `cases`, and `custo_pra_passar_b` retain their previous values from the initial state. The variable `c` is incremented by 1. The variables `na_frente` and `pos_final` are now assigned the values of two integers input by the user, while `total` remains unchanged.
