Postcondition: **`best` is set to the largest possible float value, `cases` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ cases ≤ 10^4, `c` is 0, `na_frente` must be greater than or equal to -1, `pos_final` is one less than its original input integer, `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` are lists of integers created from the input split, `total` is updated by adding either the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` depending on the condition, and `v` is greater than `pos_final`.**
