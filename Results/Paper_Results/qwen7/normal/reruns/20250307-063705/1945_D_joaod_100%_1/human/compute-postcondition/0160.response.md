Postcondition: `na_frente` is a non-negative integer. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, then `total` is updated as follows: if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`; otherwise, `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, then `total` is increased by either `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, depending on which is smaller.
