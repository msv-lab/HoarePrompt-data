### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: 
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - It correctly parses the number of people in the queue (`na_frente`) and the maximum allowable final position of Kirill (`pos_final`).

2. **Cost Arrays**:
   - The program correctly reads and stores the costs `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` for each person in the queue.

3. **Loop and Logic**:
   - The loop iterates from `na_frente` to `-1` (inclusive), which is correct for processing each person in the queue.
   - The logic inside the loop checks whether the current position `v` is within the allowed final position `pos_final`.
     - If `v` is within the allowed final position, it updates `best` and `total` based on the minimum cost between swapping and passing.
     - If `v` is outside the allowed final position, it only adds the cost of passing to `total`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where Kirill might need to swap positions multiple times to reach his desired position while minimizing costs.
   - The logic ensures that the minimum cost is tracked correctly.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the minimum cost for each test case, which is the expected output format.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. There are no apparent errors in the logic or the handling of input and output.
