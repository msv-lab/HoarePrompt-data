Output State: **`best` is the minimum cumulative cost found during the loop, `cases` is the same as before, `c` is incremented by 1, `na_frente` is decreased by 1, `pos_final` is the second integer input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `total` remains unchanged, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.**

The variable `na_frente` is decremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `na_frente` is now one less than its original value.
