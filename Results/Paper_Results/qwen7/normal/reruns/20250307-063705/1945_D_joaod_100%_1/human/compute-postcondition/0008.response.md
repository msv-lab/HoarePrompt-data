Output State: **`best` is set to the largest possible float value; `cases` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ `cases` ≤ 10^4, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is one less than its original input integer, `pos_final` is one less than its original input integer, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers created from the input split, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers created from the input split, `total` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `best = sys.float_info.max` sets the variable `best` to the maximum possible floating-point value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
