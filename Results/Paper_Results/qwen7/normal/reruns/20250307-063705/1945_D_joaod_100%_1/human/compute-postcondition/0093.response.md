Output State: **`best` is set to `sys.float_info.max`, `cases` remains a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{cases} \leq 10^4\), `c` is 1, `na_frente` must be at least 0, `pos_final` is now one less than its original input integer, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers created from the input split, `total` is `total` plus `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, and `v` is greater than `pos_final`, and `(custo_pra_trocar_a[v] >= custo_pra_passar_b[v])`.**

In this output state, the `total` variable has been updated by adding the value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to its current value. All other variables retain their initial conditions or ranges as specified in the initial state.
