Postcondition: `best` is now equal to `total` + `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `v <= pos_final` and `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, otherwise `best` is set based on the condition involving `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. `cases` is a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{cases} \leq 10^4\), `c` is 1, `na_frente` is the same, `pos_final` is the same, `custo_pra_passar_b` is the same, and `v` is one less than its value at the start of the current iteration. `total` is either the sum of its original value and `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or the sum of its original value and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.
