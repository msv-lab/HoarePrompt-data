Output State: **`cases` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ `cases` ≤ 10^4, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is one less than its original input integer, `pos_final` is an input integer, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers created from the input split, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers created from the input split.**

The value of `na_frente` is decremented by 1, while the values of `cases`, `c`, `pos_final`, `custo_pra_trocar_a`, and `custo_pra_passar_b` remain unchanged.
