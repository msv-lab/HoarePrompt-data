Output State: **`best` is set to the largest possible float value, `cases` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ cases ≤ 10^4, `c` is 0, `na_frente` must be greater than or equal to -1, `pos_final` is one less than its original input integer, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers created from the input split, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers created from the input split, `total` is `total` plus the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, and `v` is greater than `pos_final`.**

In this output state, the variable `total` has been updated by adding the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` to its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
