Output State: **`total` is now the sum of its original value and `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`; `v` is one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration; `best`, `cases`, `c`, `na_frente`, `pos_final`, and `custo_pra_passar_b` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` updates the value of `total` by adding `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` to it. The variable `v` is decremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. The values of `best`, `cases`, `c`, `na_frente`, `pos_final`, and `custo_pra_passar_b` remain unchanged as per the initial state.
