Output State: **`best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, `cases` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ cases ≤ 10^4, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is greater than or equal to -1, `pos_final` is one less than its original input integer, `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` are lists of integers created from the input split, `total` is increased by either `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]` is true, or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` if the condition is false, and `v` is greater than `pos_final - 1`.**

In this output state, the variable `best` has been updated to the sum of `total` and `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `v` is still greater than `pos_final - 1`.
