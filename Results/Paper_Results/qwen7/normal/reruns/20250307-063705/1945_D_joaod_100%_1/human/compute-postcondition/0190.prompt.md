Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `best` is set to the maximum float value, `cases` is the same as before, `c` is incremented by 1, `na_frente` is decreased by 1, `pos_final` is the second integer input - 1, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `total` is 0, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.
Code of the loop:
for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1):
    if v <= pos_final:
        if best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]:
            best = total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
        if custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
            total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
        else:
            total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
    elif custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
        total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
    else:
        total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `na_frente` is a non-negative integer, `v` is a value. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, then `total` is updated based on whether `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`: if true, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`; otherwise, `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, then `total` is increased by either `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, depending on which is smaller.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `na_frente` is a non-negative integer, `v` is a value that is one less than the previous value of `v` and must be greater than or equal to `-1`; `total` is increased by either `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, and `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `v <= pos_final` and `best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, otherwise `best` remains unchanged. If `v > pos_final`, `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]` if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is greater than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, otherwise `best` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `na_frente` is a non-negative integer, `v` is one less than the previous value of `v` and must be greater than or equal to `-1`; `total` is increased by either `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, and `best` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
