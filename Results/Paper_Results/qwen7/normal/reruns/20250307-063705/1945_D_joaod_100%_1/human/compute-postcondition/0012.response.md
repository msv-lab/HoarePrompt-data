Output State: **`best` is equal to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, `cases` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ cases ≤ 10^4, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is greater than or equal to -1, `pos_final` is one less than its original input integer, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers created from the input split, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers created from the input split, `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, the current value of `v` satisfies v ≤ pos_final, and the condition `best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is true.**

This means that the value of `best` has been updated to the sum of `total` and `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
