Output State: **`cases` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ `cases` ≤ 10^4, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is one less than its original input integer, `pos_final` is one less than its original input integer, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers created from the input split, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers created from the input split.**

Explanation: The code `pos_final -= 1` decrements the value of `pos_final` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `pos_final` is now one less than its original input integer, while `cases`, `c`, `na_frente`, `custo_pra_trocar_a`, and `custo_pra_passar_b` retain their initial states.
