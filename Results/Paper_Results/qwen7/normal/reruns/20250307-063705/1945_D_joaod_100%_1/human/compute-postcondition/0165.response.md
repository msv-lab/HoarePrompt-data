Postcondition: `na_frente` is a non-negative integer, `v` is a value that is one less than the previous value of `v` and must be greater than or equal to `-1`; `best` is either `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if the condition `best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is true, or remains unchanged if the condition is false.
