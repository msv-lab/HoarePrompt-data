Output State: **`na_frente` is a non-negative integer, `v` is a value that is one less than the previous value of `v` and must be greater than or equal to `-1`; `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the `total` variable by adding the value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to it. The value of `v` is decreased by 1, but its exact value is not specified. The precondition that `v` is one less than its previous value and must be greater than or equal to `-1` remains valid. The value of `na_frente` is unchanged.
