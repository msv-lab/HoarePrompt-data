Output State: **`best` contains the maximum value found during the loop, `cases` remains a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{cases} \leq 10^4\), `c` is 1, `na_frente` is reduced by 1, `pos_final` is now one less than its original input integer, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers created from the input split, `total` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `total = 0` sets the variable `total` to 0. All other variables (`best`, `cases`, `c`, `na_frente`, `pos_final`, and `custo_pra_passar_b`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
