Output State: **`na_frente` is a non-negative integer, `v` is one less than the previous value of `v` and must be greater than or equal to `-1`; `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, and `best` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code snippet `total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]` increments the value of `total` by the value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. The other variables (`na_frente`, `v`, and `best`) remain unchanged according to the given conditions.
