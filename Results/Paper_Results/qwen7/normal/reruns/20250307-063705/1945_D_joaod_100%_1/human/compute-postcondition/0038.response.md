Output State: **`best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is true. Otherwise, `best` remains unchanged. `cases` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ cases ≤ 10^4, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is greater than or equal to -1, `pos_final` is one less than its original input integer, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, and `v` is greater than `pos_final - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]` increments `total` by the value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
