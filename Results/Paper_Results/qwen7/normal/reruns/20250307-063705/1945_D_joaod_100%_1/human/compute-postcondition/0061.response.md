Based on the initial state provided:

- `best` contains the maximum value found during the loop, which is the best possible total cost calculated based on the conditions provided.
- `cases` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ cases ≤ 10^4.
- `c` is 0.
- `na_frente` is adjusted according to the loop's decrement.
- `pos_final` remains one less than its original input integer.
- `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` are lists of integers created from the input split.
- `total` holds the final accumulated cost as per the loop's logic.

The `print(best)` statement will print the value of `best`, which is the maximum value found during the loop and represents the best possible total cost calculated based on the conditions provided.

Output: **best (where best is the maximum value found during the loop representing the best possible total cost)**
