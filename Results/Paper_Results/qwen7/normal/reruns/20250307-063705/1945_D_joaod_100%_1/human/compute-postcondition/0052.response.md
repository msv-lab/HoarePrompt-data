Output State: **`best` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `v <= pos_final` is true, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is greater than or equal to -1, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, and `v` is now `v - 1` and is greater than `pos_final - 1`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]` updates the value of `total` by adding `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to it. This change affects only the `total` variable, increasing its value by `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. The conditions related to `best`, `c`, `na_frente`, and `v` remain unchanged from the initial state.
