Output State: **`total` is increased by the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`; `na_frente` is a non-negative integer, and `v` is greater than `pos_final`. The current value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than the current value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.**

Explanation: The code `total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` increases the value of `total` by the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
