Output State: **`best` is set to the maximum float value, `cases` is the same as before, `c` is incremented by 1, `na_frente` is decreased by 1, `pos_final` is the second integer input - 1, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `total` is 0, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The line `best = sys.float_info.max` sets the variable `best` to the maximum floating-point value. This operation does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the values of `cases`, `c`, `na_frente`, `pos_final`, `custo_pra_passar_b`, and `custo_pra_trocar_a` remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `total` remains 0.
