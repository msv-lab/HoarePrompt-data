Output State: **`total` is either the sum of its original value and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` or the sum of its original value and `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`; `best` is updated to `total` + `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `best` > `total` + `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`; `v` is one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration; `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`; `best`, `cases`, `c`, `na_frente`, `pos_final`, and `custo_pra_passar_b` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]` increases the value of `total` by `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. All other variables (`best`, `cases`, `c`, `na_frente`, `pos_final`, and `custo_pra_passar_b`) remain unchanged. The value of `v` is also updated to be one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration, but this does not affect the current state description since it's mentioned that `v` is already in its updated state.
