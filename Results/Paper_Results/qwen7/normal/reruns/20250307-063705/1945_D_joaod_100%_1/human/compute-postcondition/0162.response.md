Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `v` and `na_frente`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `v = na_frente` down to `v = -1`. The loop continues as long as `v` is greater than or equal to `-1`.

3. **Determine the state adjustments**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `v` was set to the current value of `v` minus 1 (since the loop decrements `v`).
   - For the loop to continue, `v` must be greater than or equal to `-1`.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `v` should be decreased by 1.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `na_frente` remains unchanged because it is the upper bound of the loop and does not change within the loop.
   - `v` needs to be adjusted to `v - 1`.

5. **Postconditions**:
   - The postcondition for the loop body is based on the value of `v`. Since `v` is being decremented, the postcondition will still hold for the new value of `v`.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `v` and `na_frente`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`na_frente` is a non-negative integer, `v` is a value that is one less than the previous value of `v` and must be greater than or equal to `-1`.**
