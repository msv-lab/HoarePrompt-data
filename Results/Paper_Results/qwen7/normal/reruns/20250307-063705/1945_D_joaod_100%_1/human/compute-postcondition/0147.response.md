Output State: **`na_frente` is a non-negative integer, `v` is a value such that `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, `best` is greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, and `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is greater than or equal to `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`; `total` is now `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `total` by adding `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to it. All other conditions and relationships between the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `na_frente`, `v`, `best`, and the relationship between `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` stay the same, while `total` is updated to include the new value.
