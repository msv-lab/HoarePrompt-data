Output State: **`best` contains the maximum value found during the loop, `cases` remains a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{cases} \leq 10^4\), `c` is 1, `na_frente` is adjusted according to the input split, `pos_final` remains one less than its original input integer, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers created from the input split, `custo_pra_passar_b` is unchanged, and `total` holds the final accumulated cost as per the loop's logic.**

Explanation: The code `custo_pra_trocar_a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `custo_pra_trocar_a`. The other variables (`best`, `cases`, `c`, `na_frente`, `pos_final`, `custo_pra_passar_b`, and `total`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
