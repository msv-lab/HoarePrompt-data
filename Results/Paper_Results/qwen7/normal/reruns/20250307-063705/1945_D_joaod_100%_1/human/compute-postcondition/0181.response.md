Output State: **`na_frente` is a non-negative integer, `v` is one less than the previous value of `v` and must be greater than or equal to `-1`; `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, and `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the `total` by adding the value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. The other variables (`na_frente`, `v`, `total`, and `best`) are described as per their postconditions, with `v` being one less than its previous value and `best` being updated to reflect the new `total` plus `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.
