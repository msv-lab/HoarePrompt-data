Output State: **`cases` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ `cases` ≤ 10^4, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is an input integer, `pos_final` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `na_frente` and `pos_final`. These values are converted to integers using the `map` function. The value of `cases` remains unchanged, and the value of `c` also remains 0.
