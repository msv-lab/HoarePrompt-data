Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `c` which is being initialized by `range(cases)`.

2. **Determine the Initial Value of `c`**: Since `c` is being initialized by `range(cases)`, the initial value of `c` will be 0 when the loop starts.

3. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `c < cases`. Therefore, the loop will execute at least once if `cases` is greater than 0.

4. **Adjusting the States**: We need to ensure that the initial state of `c` is set to 0 and that `cases` is a positive integer within the given range (1 ≤ `cases` ≤ 10^4).

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `c` should be 0.
- `cases` should be a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ `cases` ≤ 10^4.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be:

**State: **`cases` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ `cases` ≤ 10^4, and `c` is 0**.
