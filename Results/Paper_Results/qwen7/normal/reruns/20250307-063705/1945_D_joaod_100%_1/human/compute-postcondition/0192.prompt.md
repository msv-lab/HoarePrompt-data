Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cases` is an input integer, and it is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `cases` ≤ 10^4. All other variables (t, n, m, a, b) remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for c in range(cases):
    na_frente, pos_final = map(int, input().split())
    custo_pra_trocar_a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    custo_pra_passar_b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    na_frente -= 1
    pos_final -= 1
    total = 0
    best = sys.float_info.max
    for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1):
        if v <= pos_final:
            if best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]:
                best = total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
            if custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
                total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
            else:
                total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
        elif custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
            total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
        else:
            total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
    print(best)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: All iterations of the loop have been executed. The variable `best` contains the maximum value found during the loop, which is the best possible total cost calculated based on the conditions provided. The variable `cases` remains a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ cases ≤ 10^4, `c` is still 0, `na_frente` is adjusted according to the loop's decrement, `pos_final` remains one less than its original input integer, `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` are lists of integers created from the input split, and `total` holds the final accumulated cost as per the loop's logic.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: The loop will have executed for all iterations, meaning `v` will have iterated from `na_frente` down to -1. After all iterations, `best` will hold the minimum cumulative cost found during the loop, which is updated whenever a lower cost is found compared to the current `best`. `cases` will remain a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{cases} \leq 10^4\), `c` will still be 1, `na_frente` will remain unchanged, `pos_final` will be one less than its original input integer, `custo_pra_passar_b` will remain as a list of integers created from the input split, and `total` will be the final accumulated cost after considering all possible values of `v` according to the conditions specified in the loop body.

In summary, `best` will reflect the optimal cost, while `total` will represent the total cost accumulated over all iterations, and all other variables will retain their states as they were after the last iteration of the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The loop has executed all iterations, meaning `v` has gone through all values from `na_frente` down to `-1`. The final state of `total` is the sum of either `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` for each `v` in the specified range, depending on the conditions within the loop. The variable `best` retains its last updated value, which was determined during the loop execution based on the conditions provided.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
