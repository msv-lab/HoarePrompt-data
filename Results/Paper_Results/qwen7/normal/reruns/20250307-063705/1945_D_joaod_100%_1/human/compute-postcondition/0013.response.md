Postcondition: `best` is set to the largest possible float value, `cases` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ cases ≤ 10^4, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is greater than or equal to -1, `pos_final` is one less than its original input integer, `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` are lists of integers created from the input split, `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is true, and `total` remains unchanged otherwise, the current value of `v` satisfies v ≤ pos_final.
