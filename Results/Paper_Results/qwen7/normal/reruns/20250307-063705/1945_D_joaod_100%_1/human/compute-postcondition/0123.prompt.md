Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `best` is set to `sys.float_info.max`, `cases` remains a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{cases} \leq 10^4\), `c` is 1, `na_frente` is reduced by 1, `pos_final` is now one less than its original input integer, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers created from the input split, `total` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1):
    if v <= pos_final:
        if best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]:
            best = total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
        if custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
            total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
        else:
            total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
    elif custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
        total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
    else:
        total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `best` is set to `sys.float_info.max` if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is greater than or equal to `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, otherwise `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. `cases` remains a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{cases} \leq 10^4\), `c` is 1, `na_frente` must be at least 0, `pos_final` is now one less than its original input integer, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers created from the input split, and `total` is the sum of `total` and either `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` depending on the condition.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `best` is now equal to `total` + `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `v <= pos_final` and `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, otherwise `best` is set based on the condition involving `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. `cases` is a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{cases} \leq 10^4\), `c` is 1, `na_frente` is the same, `pos_final` is the same, `custo_pra_passar_b` is the same, and `v` is one less than its value at the start of the current iteration. `total` is either the sum of its original value and `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or the sum of its original value and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `total` is either the sum of its original value and `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, or the sum of its original value and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`; `best` is updated to `total` + `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `best` > `total` + `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` when `v <= pos_final`; `v` is one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration; `total` is adjusted according to the condition: if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`; otherwise, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`; `best`, `cases`, `c`, `na_frente`, `pos_final`, and `custo_pra_passar_b` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
