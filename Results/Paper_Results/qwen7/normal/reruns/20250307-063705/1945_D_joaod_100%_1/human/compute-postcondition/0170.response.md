Output State: **`na_frente` is a non-negative integer, `v` is a value that is one less than the previous value of `v` and must be greater than or equal to `-1`; `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`.**

Explanation: The code `total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` updates the value of `total` by adding `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` to it. The variables `na_frente` and `v` remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `v` is updated to be one less than its previous value, but it must still be greater than or equal to `-1`. The value of `total` is now increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`.
