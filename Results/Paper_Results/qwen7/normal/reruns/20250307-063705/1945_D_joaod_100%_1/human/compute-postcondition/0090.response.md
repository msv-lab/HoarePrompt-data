Output State: **`best` is set to `sys.float_info.max`, `cases` remains a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{cases} \leq 10^4\), `c` is 1, `na_frente` must be at least 0, `pos_final` is now one less than its original input integer, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers created from the input split, `total` is the original value of `total` plus `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, and `v` is greater than `pos_final`.**

Explanation: The line `total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` increments the value of `total` by the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
