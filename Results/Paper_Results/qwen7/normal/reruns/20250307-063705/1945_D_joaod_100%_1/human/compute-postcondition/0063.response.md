Output State: **`best` contains the maximum value found during the loop, `cases` remains a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{cases} \leq 10^4\), `c` is 1, `na_frente` is adjusted according to the input split, `pos_final` remains one less than its original input integer, `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` are lists of integers created from the input split, and `total` holds the final accumulated cost as per the loop's logic.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `na_frente` and `pos_final`. The initial value of `c` was 0, and after executing the line `na_frente, pos_final = map(int, input().split())`, `c` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
