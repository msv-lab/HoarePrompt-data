Output State: **`best` is the minimum cumulative cost found during the loop, `cases` is the same as before, `c` is incremented by 1, `na_frente` is the first integer input, `pos_final` is the second integer input, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `total` remains unchanged, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.**

The code reads a line of input, splits it into individual integers, and converts them into a list, which is assigned to `custo_pra_passar_b`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
