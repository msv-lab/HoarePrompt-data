Output State: **`best` is set to the largest possible float value, `cases` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ cases ≤ 10^4, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is greater than or equal to -1, `pos_final` is one less than its original input integer, `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` are lists of integers created from the input split, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, and `v` is greater than `pos_final - 1`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]` increments the value of `total` by the value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
