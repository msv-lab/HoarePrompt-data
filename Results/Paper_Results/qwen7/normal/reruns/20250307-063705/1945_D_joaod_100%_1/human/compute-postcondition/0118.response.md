Output State: **`total` is either the sum of its original value and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` or the sum of its original value and `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`; `v` is one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration; `best`, `cases`, `c`, `na_frente`, `pos_final`, and `custo_pra_passar_b` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code updates `total` by adding `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to its current value. Since `v` is one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration, the value of `v` is now decreased by 1. All other variables (`best`, `cases`, `c`, `na_frente`, `pos_final`, and `custo_pra_passar_b`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
