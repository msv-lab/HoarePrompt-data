Output State: **`best` is set to the largest possible float value, `cases` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ cases ≤ 10^4, `c` is 0, `na_frente` must be greater than or equal to -1, `pos_final` is one less than its original input integer, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers created from the input split, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers created from the input split, `total` is `total` + `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, and `v` is greater than `pos_final`, and `(custo_pra_trocar_a[v] >= custo_pra_passar_b[v])**.

This means that the `total` variable has been updated by adding the value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to its current value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
