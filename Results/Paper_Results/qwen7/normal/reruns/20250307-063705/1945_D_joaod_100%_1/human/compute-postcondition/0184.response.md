Output State: **`na_frente` is a non-negative integer, `v` is one less than the previous value of `v` and must be greater than or equal to `-1`; `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, and `best` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` increases the value of `total` by the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. The other variables (`na_frente`, `v`, and `best`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, their states remain as described in the initial state.
