Postcondition: `best` is set to `sys.float_info.max`, `cases` remains a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{cases} \leq 10^4\), `c` is 1, `na_frente` must be at least 0, `pos_final` is now one less than its original input integer, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers created from the input split, `total` is 0, and if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, then `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, otherwise `best` remains unchanged.
