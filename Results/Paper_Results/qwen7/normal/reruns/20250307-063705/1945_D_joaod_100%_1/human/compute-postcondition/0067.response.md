Output State: **`best` contains the maximum value found during the loop, `cases` remains a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{cases} \leq 10^4\), `c` is 1, `na_frente` is reduced by 1, `pos_final` is now one less than its original input integer, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers created from the input split, and `total` holds the final accumulated cost as per the loop's logic.**

The code `pos_final -= 1` decrements the value of `pos_final` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
