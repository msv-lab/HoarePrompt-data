Postcondition: `na_frente` is a non-negative integer, `v` is a value that is one less than the previous value of `v` and must be greater than or equal to `-1`; `total` is increased by either `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, and `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `best` is less than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, otherwise `best` remains unchanged if `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, otherwise `best` remains unchanged.
