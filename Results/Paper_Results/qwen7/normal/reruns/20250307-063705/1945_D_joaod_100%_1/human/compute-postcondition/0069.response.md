Output State: **`best` is set to `sys.float_info.max`, `cases` remains a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{cases} \leq 10^4\), `c` is 1, `na_frente` is reduced by 1, `pos_final` is now one less than its original input integer, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers created from the input split, `total` is 0.**

Explanation: The code sets `best` to `sys.float_info.max`, which is the largest representable floating-point number. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
