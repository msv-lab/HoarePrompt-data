Output State: **`best` is the minimum cumulative cost found during the loop, `cases` is the same as before, `c` is incremented by 1, `na_frente` is decreased by 1, `pos_final` is the second integer input - 1, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `total` is 0, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.**

The code simply assigns the value `0` to the variable `total`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
