Output State: **`na_frente` is a non-negative integer, `v` is a value such that `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, `best` is greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, and `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`; `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `total` by adding `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` to it. All other conditions and values remain unchanged from the initial state.
