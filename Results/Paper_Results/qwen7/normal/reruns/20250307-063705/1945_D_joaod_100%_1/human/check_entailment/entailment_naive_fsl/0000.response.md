Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `v` is greater than `pos_final`. Specifically, the logic inside the loop does not correctly account for the scenario where Kirill needs to move past `pos_final` to reach his desired position. This can lead to incorrect calculations of the minimum cost.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3 2
10 20 30
5 15 25
```

In this case, Kirill wants to be in the first two positions, but the program does not correctly handle the scenario where he needs to move past the second position to achieve this. The program will incorrectly calculate the cost, leading to an incorrect result.
