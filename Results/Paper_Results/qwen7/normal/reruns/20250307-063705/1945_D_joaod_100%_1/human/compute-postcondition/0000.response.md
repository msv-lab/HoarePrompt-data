Output State: **`cases` is an input integer, and it is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `cases` ≤ 10^4. All other variables (t, n, m, a, b) remain unchanged.**

This means that the variable `cases` is assigned the value of an integer input, which is within the range of 1 to 10^4. The initial conditions for `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
