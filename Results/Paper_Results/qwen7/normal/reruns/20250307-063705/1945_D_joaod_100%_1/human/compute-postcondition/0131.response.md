Output State: **`best` is the minimum cumulative cost found during the loop, `cases` is the same as before, `c` is incremented by 1, `na_frente` is decreased by 1, `pos_final` is the second integer input - 1, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `total` remains unchanged, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code `pos_final -= 1` decrements the value of `pos_final` by 1. Since `pos_final` was initially the second integer input, after this operation, its new value will be the second integer input minus 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
