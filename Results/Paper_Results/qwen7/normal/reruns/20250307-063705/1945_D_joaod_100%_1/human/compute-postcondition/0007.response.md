Output State: **`cases` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ `cases` ≤ 10^4, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is one less than its original input integer, `pos_final` is one less than its original input integer, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers created from the input split, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers created from the input split, `total` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `total` to 0. Since no other operations are performed on the existing variables, their values remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions plus the new value of `total`.
