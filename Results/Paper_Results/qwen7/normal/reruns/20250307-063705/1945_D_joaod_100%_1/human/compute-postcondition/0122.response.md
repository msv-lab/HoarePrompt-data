Postcondition: `total` is either the sum of its original value and `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, or the sum of its original value and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`; `best` is updated to `total` + `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `best` > `total` + `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` when `v <= pos_final`; `v` is one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration; `total` is adjusted according to the condition: if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`; otherwise, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`; `best`, `cases`, `c`, `na_frente`, `pos_final`, and `custo_pra_passar_b` remain unchanged.
