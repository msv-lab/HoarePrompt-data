Output State: **`best` is now `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, `cases` remains a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{cases} \leq 10^4\), `c` is 1, `na_frente` must be at least 0, `pos_final` is now one less than its original input integer, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers created from the input split, and the condition `best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is no longer true.**

Explanation: The variable `best` is updated to the value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition `best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is no longer true because `best` has just been set to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`.
