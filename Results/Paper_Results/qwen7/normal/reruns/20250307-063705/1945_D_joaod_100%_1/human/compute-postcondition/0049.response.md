Postcondition: `best` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `v <= pos_final` is true, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is greater than or equal to -1, `total` is increased by either `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]` is true, or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` if the condition is false, and `v` is now `v - 1` and is greater than `pos_final - 1`. If the condition `best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is false, `best` remains unchanged.
