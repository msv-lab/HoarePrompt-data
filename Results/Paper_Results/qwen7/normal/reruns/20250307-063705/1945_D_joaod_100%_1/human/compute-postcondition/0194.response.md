Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where for each case, it calculates the minimum cumulative cost required to transform a sequence of integers represented by list `a` into another sequence represented by list `b`. It achieves this by considering two options at each position: either to change the element in `a` to match the corresponding element in `b` or to pass over the element in `a`. The function outputs the minimum cost for each test case.**
