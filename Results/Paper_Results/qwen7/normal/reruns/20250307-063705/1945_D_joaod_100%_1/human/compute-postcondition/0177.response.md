Output State: **`na_frente` is a non-negative integer, `v` is one less than the previous value of `v` and must be greater than or equal to `-1`; `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, and `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`.**

Explanation: The variable `best` is updated to the value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. The values of `na_frente`, `v`, and `total` remain unchanged from their initial states, except that `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. The variable `best` is set to this new value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`.
