Postcondition: `na_frente` is a non-negative integer, `v` is a value that is one less than the previous value of `v` and must be greater than or equal to `-1`; `total` is increased by either `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, depending on whether `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.
