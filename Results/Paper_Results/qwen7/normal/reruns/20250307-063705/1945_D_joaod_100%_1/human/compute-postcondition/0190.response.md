Output State: **The loop has executed all iterations, meaning `v` has gone through all values from `na_frente` down to `-1`. The final state of `total` is the sum of either `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` for each `v` in the specified range, depending on the conditions within the loop. The variable `best` retains its last updated value, which was determined during the loop execution based on the conditions provided.**

In more detail, after all iterations:
- `na_frente` will be `-1` since `v` starts from `na_frente` and decreases by 1 until it reaches `-1`.
- `v` will be `-1` after the loop completes.
- `total` will be the accumulated cost based on the selection between `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` for each `v` from `na_frente` to `-1`, following the given conditions.
- `best` will hold the highest value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` when `v <= pos_final` and `best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, or `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]` when `v > pos_final` and `custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.
