Output State: **`total` is either the sum of its original value and `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, or the sum of its original value and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`; `best` is updated to `total` + `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `best` > `total` + `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`; `v` is one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration; `total` is now `total` + `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`; `best`, `cases`, `c`, `na_frente`, `pos_final`, and `custo_pra_passar_b` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code updates `total` by adding `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` to its current value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `v` is also decremented by 1, but since this change is not reflected in the output state, it is mentioned separately.
