Output State: **`best` is the minimum cumulative cost found during the loop, `cases` is the same as before, `c` is incremented by 1, `na_frente` is the first integer input, `pos_final` is the second integer input, `custo_pra_passar_b` and `total` remain unchanged, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer using the `map` function. The resulting list of integers is assigned to `custo_pra_trocar_a`. The other variables (`best`, `cases`, `c`, `na_frente`, `pos_final`, `custo_pra_passar_b`, and `total`) retain their original values.
