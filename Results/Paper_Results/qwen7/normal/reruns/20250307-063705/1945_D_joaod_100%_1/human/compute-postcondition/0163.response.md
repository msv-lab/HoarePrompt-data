Output State: **`na_frente` is a non-negative integer, `v` is a value that is one less than the previous value of `v` and must be greater than or equal to `-1`; `best` is `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` to the variable `best`. Since `v` is one less than its previous value and must be greater than or equal to `-1`, the value of `v` remains unchanged in terms of its relationship to the previous value. The value of `na_frente` also remains unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes the new assignment to `best` and retains the conditions on `v`.
