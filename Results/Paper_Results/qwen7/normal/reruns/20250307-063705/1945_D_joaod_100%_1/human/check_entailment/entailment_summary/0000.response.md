Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves finding the minimum cost for Kirill to move to one of the first `m` positions in the queue by swapping his position with others. The cost includes the cost of swapping with the person in front (`a_i`) and the cost of passing over each person between Kirill's current position and the target position (`b_i`).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of people in the queue (`na_frente`) and the maximum allowable final position (`pos_final`).
   - It then reads and stores the costs for swapping (`custo_pra_trocar_a`) and passing over (`custo_pra_passar_b`).
   - The program iterates backward from the last person to the first, calculating the minimum cost to reach a position within the allowed range (`pos_final`).
   - The logic inside the loop correctly handles the conditions for swapping and passing, updating the `total` cost and `best` minimum cost accordingly.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum cost for each test case.

3. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The program handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately, such as when Kirill is already within the allowed range (`v <= pos_final`), and when he needs to pass over elements without swapping.
   - The backward iteration ensures that the minimum cost is calculated optimally by considering all possible swaps and passes.

4. **Output**: The program correctly outputs the minimum cost for each test case as specified in the problem statement.

Given the analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
