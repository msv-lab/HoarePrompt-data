Output State: **`na_frente` is a non-negative integer, `v` is a value that is one less than the previous value of `v` and must be greater than or equal to `-1`; `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, and `best` is either `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if the condition `best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is true, or remains unchanged if the condition is false.**

Explanation: The code `total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]` increments the value of `total` by `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. The other variables (`na_frente`, `v`, and `best`) are not directly affected by this line of code, so their conditions remain the same. Specifically, `na_frente` is a non-negative integer, `v` is one less than its previous value and must be greater than or equal to `-1`, and `best` remains unchanged unless the condition `best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is true, in which case `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`.
