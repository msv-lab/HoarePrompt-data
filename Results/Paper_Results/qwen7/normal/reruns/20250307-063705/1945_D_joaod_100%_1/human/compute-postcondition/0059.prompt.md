Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `best` is set to the largest possible float value; `cases` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ `cases` ≤ 10^4, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is one less than its original input integer, `pos_final` is one less than its original input integer, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers created from the input split, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers created from the input split, `total` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1):
    if v <= pos_final:
        if best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]:
            best = total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
        if custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
            total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
        else:
            total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
    elif custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
        total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
    else:
        total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `best` is set to the largest possible float value, `cases` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ cases ≤ 10^4, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is greater than or equal to -1, `pos_final` is one less than its original input integer, `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` are lists of integers created from the input split, `total` is increased by either `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]` is true, or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` if the condition is false, and `v` is greater than `pos_final`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `best` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `v <= pos_final` is true. Otherwise, `best` remains unchanged. `cases` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ cases ≤ 10^4, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is greater than or equal to -1, `pos_final` is one less than its original input integer, `total` is increased by either `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]` is true, or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` if the condition is false, and `v` is now `v + 1` and is greater than `pos_final - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `best` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `v <= pos_final` is true. Otherwise, `best` remains unchanged. `cases` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ cases ≤ 10^4, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is greater than or equal to -1, `total` is increased by either `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]` is true, or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` if the condition is false, and `v` is now `v - 1` and is greater than `pos_final - 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
