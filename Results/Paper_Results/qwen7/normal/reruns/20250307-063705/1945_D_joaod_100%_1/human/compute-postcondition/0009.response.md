Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable `v` is defined in the range `na_frente` to `-1` with a step of `-1`.
   - Therefore, the variables involved in the loop head are `v`, `na_frente`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of These Variables:**
   - `best` is set to the largest possible float value (though this doesn't affect the loop execution).
   - `cases` is a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{cases} \leq 10^4\).
   - `c` is 0.
   - `na_frente` is one less than its original input integer.
   - `pos_final` is one less than its original input integer.
   - `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers created from the input split.
   - `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers created from the input split.
   - `total` is 0.

3. **Check the Condition for the Loop to Execute:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `v` is greater than or equal to `-1`.
   - Initially, `v` is set to `na_frente`, which is one less than the original input integer.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since the loop starts with `v` being `na_frente` and decrements until it reaches `-1`, the loop will definitely execute if `na_frente` is greater than or equal to `-1`.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that `na_frente` is greater than or equal to `-1`.

Given the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

- `na_frente` must be greater than or equal to `-1`.

So, the final state is:

**State: **`best` is set to the largest possible float value, `cases` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ cases ≤ 10^4, `c` is 0, `na_frente` must be greater than or equal to -1, `pos_final` is one less than its original input integer, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers created from the input split, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers created from the input split, `total` is 0**.
