Output State: **`stack` contains the tuple `(1, 1)`, `A` is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing k edges, and `g` is an adjacency list representation of the tree.**

Explanation: The code initializes a stack with a single tuple `(1, 1)`. The values of `A` and `g` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the stack now contains the tuple `(1, 1)`, while `A` and `g` retain their original values.
