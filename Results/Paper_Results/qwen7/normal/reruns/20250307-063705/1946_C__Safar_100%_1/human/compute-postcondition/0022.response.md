Output State: **`x` is 1, `g` maintains its original structure, and `stack` contains tuples `(node, 1)` for every direct child of `x` in the graph `g`.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `x` remains 1 because the loop iterates over the children of `x` in the graph `g`, but does not change the value of `x`. The variable `g` remains unchanged as it is only used to fetch nodes and is not modified within the loop. The `stack` accumulates tuples `(node, x)` for each direct child `node` of `x` in the graph, where `x` is 1. This means `stack` will contain a tuple for each node directly connected to `x` in the graph, assuming all such nodes were processed.
