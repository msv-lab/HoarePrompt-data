Output State: **`r` is 0, `stack` contains the tuple (1, 1), `x` is 1, `p` is 1, `A` is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing k edges, `g` is an adjacency list representation of the tree, `visited` is a set containing 1, `d` is a dictionary containing the key-value pair {(1): 1}.**

Explanation: The code `visited.add(x)` adds the value of `x` (which is 1) to the set `visited`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
