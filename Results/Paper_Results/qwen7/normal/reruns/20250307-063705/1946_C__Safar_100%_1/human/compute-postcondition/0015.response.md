Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case involves the variables `node` and `x`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each element in `g[x]`. This means `node` takes on each value from the list `g[x]` in sequence.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `x` is 1.
   - `g` must have at least one entry for `x`.
   - Either the current value of `node` is not equal to `p` and `(node, x)` is appended to `stack`, or there is no action taken since there is no else part.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `node` is iterating through `g[x]`, the next value of `node` will be the next element in the list `g[1]`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `node` must be different from `p` (since the condition for appending `(node, x)` to `stack` is when `node != p`).

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `x` remains the same as it is not being modified within the loop.
   - `g` remains the same as it is not being modified within the loop.
   - `node` will be the next element in `g[1]` if it is different from `p`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the next value of `node` in the list `g[1]` (if it is different from `p`), while keeping `x` and `g` unchanged.

**State:**
- `x` is 1.
- `g` must have at least one entry for `x`.
- `node` is the next element in `g[1]` if it is different from `p`.

Therefore, the final state is:
**`x` is 1, `g` must have at least one entry for `x`, `node` is the next element in `g[1]` if it is different from `p`.**
