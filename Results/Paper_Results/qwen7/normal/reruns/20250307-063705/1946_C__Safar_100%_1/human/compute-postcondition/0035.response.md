Output State: **`r` is either 1 or 0, `stack` contains the tuple (1, 0), `x` is 1, `p` is 1, `A` is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing k edges, `g` is an adjacency list representation of the tree, `visited` is an empty set, and `d` is a dictionary containing the key-value pair {(1): 2}**.

Explanation: The code `stack.pop()` removes the last element from the stack. Initially, `stack` contains the tuple `(1, 1)`. After popping, `stack` will contain `(1, 0)`. All other variables remain unchanged. Additionally, since `x` is in `visited` and `d[x]` is updated to `d[p]` which is 2, `d` remains `{(1): 2}`.
