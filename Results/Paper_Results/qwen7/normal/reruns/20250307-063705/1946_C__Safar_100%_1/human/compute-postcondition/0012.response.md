Output State: **`x` is 1, `g` must have at least one entry for `x`, the current value of `node` is not equal to `p`, and `(node, x)` is appended to `stack`.**

Explanation: The code `stack.append((node, x))` appends a tuple containing the current values of `node` and `x` to the list `stack`. Since `x` is 1 and `node` is not equal to `p`, the tuple `(node, 1)` is added to `stack`. The other conditions and values remain unchanged.
