Output State: **`stack` contains the tuple `(1, 1)`, `A` is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing k edges, `g` is an adjacency list representation of the tree, `visited` is an empty set.**

The code initializes a new variable `visited` as an empty set. This does not affect the values of `stack`, `A`, or `g`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states, and the new `visited` set is introduced as an empty set.
