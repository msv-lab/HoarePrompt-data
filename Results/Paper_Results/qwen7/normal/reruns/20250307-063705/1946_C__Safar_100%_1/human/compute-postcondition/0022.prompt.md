Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `r` is 0, `stack` contains the tuple (1, 1), `x` is 1, `p` is 1, `A` is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing k edges, `g` is an adjacency list representation of the tree, `visited` is a set containing 1, `d` is a dictionary containing the key-value pair {(1): 1}
Code of the loop:
for node in g[x]:
    if node != p:
        stack.append((node, x))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `x` is 1, `g` must have at least one entry for `x`, and either the current value of `node` is not equal to `p` and `(node, x)` is appended to `stack`, or there is no action taken since there is no else part.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `x` is 1, `g` maintains its original structure, and if `node` is different from `p`, `stack` contains a tuple `(node, x)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `x` is 1, `g` maintains its original structure, if `node` is different from `p`, `stack` contains a tuple `(node, 1)`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
