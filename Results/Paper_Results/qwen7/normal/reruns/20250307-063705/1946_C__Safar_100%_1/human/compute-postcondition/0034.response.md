Postcondition: **`r` is either 1 or 0, `stack` contains the tuple (1, 1), `x` is 1, `p` is 1, `A` is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing k edges, `g` is an adjacency list representation of the tree, `visited` is an empty set, and `d` is a dictionary containing the key-value pair {(1): 1 or 2}. `x` is in `visited`, and if `d[x]` is not greater than or equal to `A`, then `d[x]` is equal to `d[p]` which is now 2.**
