Output State: **`x` is 1, `stack` contains a tuple (`node`, 1)**

Explanation: The code `stack.append((node, x))` appends a tuple containing `node` and the current value of `x` (which is 1) to the list `stack`. Since `x` remains unchanged at 1, and the tuple `(node, 1)` is added to `stack`, the updated state includes `x` being 1 and `stack` containing the tuple `(node, 1)`.
