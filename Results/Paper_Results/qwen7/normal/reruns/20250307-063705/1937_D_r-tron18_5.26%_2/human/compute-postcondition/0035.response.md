Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `el` is `s1[n-2]`, `suffZero` is a list with one element which is `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`**.

Explanation: The code calculates the value of `zeroInd` using the function `func_1` applied to the list `suffZero` with two different arguments. The values of the other variables (`i`, `el`, `suffZero`, `ol`, and `zr`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The function `func_1` is called twice with different parameters, but its exact implementation is not provided, so the value of `zeroInd` is expressed as the given formula.
