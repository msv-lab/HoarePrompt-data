### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have a one-dimensional grid with characters `<` and `>`.
   - A pinball starts at each cell and moves based on the character at that cell.
   - The character at the cell is inverted after the pinball moves.
   - The pinball stops when it leaves the grid.

2. **Given Code Analysis:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the grid size `n` and the string `s1`.
   - It calls `func_2(s1, n)` to compute the time taken for each pinball to leave the grid.
   - `func_2` calculates the time taken for each pinball starting from each cell using a complex algorithm involving prefix sums and suffix sums.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - **Initialization:**
     - `pre` stores the positions of cells with `>` characters.
     - `totalOne` counts the number of `>` characters.
     - `preOne` is a prefix sum array for `pre`.
     - `suffZero` is a suffix sum array for positions of cells with `<` characters.
     - `ans` is initialized to store the results for each cell.
   - **Main Loop:**
     - The loop iterates backward through the string `s1`.
     - For each character, it calculates the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid based on the position and the direction (`>` or `<`).
     - It updates the `ans` array with the calculated times.
     - It adjusts the `preOne` and `suffZero` arrays accordingly.

4. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the difference between the last element in the list `arr` and the element at a specific index.
   - The index is determined by the `times` parameter and the length of `arr`.

5. **Correctness Check:**
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly handles the movement and inversion of the characters.
   - The calculations for the time taken to leave the grid are consistent with the problem statement.
   - The use of prefix and suffix sums helps efficiently compute the required times for each pinball.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the given code correctly implements the solution to the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
