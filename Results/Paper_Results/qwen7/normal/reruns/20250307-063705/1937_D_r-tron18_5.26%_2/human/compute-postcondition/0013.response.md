Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`, `el` is `'> '`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `zeroInd - oneInd` to `ans[i]`. The value of `i` remains `n-2`. The values of `el`, `ol`, `zr`, and `oneInd` remain unchanged. `zeroInd` is used in the calculation but its value is not provided, so it is represented as `zeroInd`.
