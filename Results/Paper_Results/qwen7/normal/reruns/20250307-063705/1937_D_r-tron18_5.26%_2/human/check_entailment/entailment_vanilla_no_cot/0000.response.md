Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem. Specifically, the `func_2` function is overly complex and does not accurately simulate the movement of the pinball according to the rules specified. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Movement Duration**: The function `func_2` attempts to calculate the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid but does not correctly account for the inversion of the grid cells and the direction of movement.

2. **Complexity and Logic Errors**: The use of `accumulate` and the intricate logic inside `func_2` do not align with the problem requirements. The problem requires simulating the movement of the pinball step-by-step, considering the changes in the grid after each move.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Grid Inversion**: The function does not properly handle the inversion of the grid cells as the pinball moves. Instead, it seems to be trying to compute some kind of cumulative sum or difference, which is not relevant to the problem.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, you should simulate the movement of the pinball step-by-step, keeping track of its position and the state of the grid. Hereâ€™s a more appropriate approach:

1. **Simulate Pinball Movement**: For each query, start from the initial position and follow the rules until the pinball leaves the grid.
2. **Track Time and Inversions**: Keep track of the time taken and the state of the grid as the pinball moves.

Here is a simplified version of how you might implement this:

```python
def simulate_pinball_movement(s, pos):
    n = len(s)
    time = 0
    while 0 <= pos < n:
        time += 1
        # Move based on current character
        if s[pos] == '<':
            pos -= 1
        else:
            pos += 1
        # Invert the character
        s = s[:pos] + ('<' if s[pos] == '>' else '>') + s[pos+1:]
    return time

def solve(n, s):
    results = []
    for i in range(n):
        # Simulate starting from each position
        results.append(simulate_pinball_movement(s, i))
    return results

# Example usage
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input().strip()
    results = solve(n, s)
    print(' '.join(map(str, results)))
```

This approach ensures that the pinball is simulated correctly according to the problem statement, and it avoids the complexity and potential errors present in the original code.
