Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `el` is `'> '`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * suffZero[-1]`**.

Explanation: The variable `zeroInd` is assigned the value `2 * suffZero[-1]`. Since `suffZero[-1]` refers to the last element of the list `suffZero`, `zeroInd` is calculated as twice that value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
