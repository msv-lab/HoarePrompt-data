Output State: **`i` is `n-3`, `el` is `s1[i]`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is the list `preOne` with the last element removed, `ans[i]` is updated based on the new values of `zeroInd` and `oneInd`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, totalOne)`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `zeroInd` to be twice the result of `func_1(suffZero, totalOne)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The function `func_1` is called with `suffZero` and `totalOne` as arguments, and its result is multiplied by 2 to assign to `zeroInd`.
