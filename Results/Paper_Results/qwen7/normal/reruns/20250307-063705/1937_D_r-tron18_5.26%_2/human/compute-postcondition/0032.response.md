Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `el` is `s1[n-2]`, `suffZero` is a list with two elements `[suffZero[-1] + i + 1, suffZero[-2] + suffZero[-1] + i + 1]`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, len(suffZero) - 1)`, `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1` to `ans[i]`. Since `i` is `n-2`, the updated state of `ans` at index `i` (which is `n-2`) is now `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
