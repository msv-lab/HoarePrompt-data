Output State: **`i` is `n-3`, `el` is `s1[i]`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is the list `preOne` with the last element removed, `suffZero` is updated to append `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value `2 * preOne[-1]` to the variable `oneInd`. Since `preOne` is a list, removing the last element does not affect the value of `preOne[-1]` immediately before the assignment. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
