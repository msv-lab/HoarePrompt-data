Output State: **`i` is `n-3`, `el` is `s1[i]`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is the list `preOne` with the last element removed, `suffZero` is updated to append `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`**

Explanation: The code appends a new value to the list `suffZero`. The new value is calculated as the last element of `suffZero` (`suffZero[-1]`) plus `i` (which is `n-3`) plus 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
