Output State: **`i` is `n-3`, `el` is `s1[i]`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is the list `preOne` with the last element removed, `suffZero` is updated to append `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`, `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`.**

Explanation: The line `ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd` calculates the difference between `zeroInd` and `oneInd` and assigns it to `ans[i]`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `i`, `el`, `ol`, `zr`, `preOne`, `suffZero`, `zeroInd`, and `oneInd` remain unchanged from their initial states, while `ans[i]` is updated with the calculated value.
