Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `el` is `s1[n-2]`, and `suffZero` is a list with one element which is `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`.**

Explanation: The code appends a new value to the list `suffZero`. This new value is calculated as `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`. Since `suffZero` was initially empty, `suffZero[-1]` (which refers to the last element of the list) does not exist before the first append operation. Therefore, the first element of `suffZero` is simply `i + 1 + 1`, which simplifies to `i + 2`. Given that `i` is `n-2`, the first element of `suffZero` becomes `(n-2) + 2`, which is `n`. Thus, `suffZero` contains the single element `n`. The values of `i` and `el` remain unchanged.
