Output State: **`pre` is a list of integers where each integer i+1 is the position index (1-based) of '>' in `s1`; `s1` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5.**

Explanation: The code creates a list comprehension that iterates over the enumerated elements of `s1`. For each element where the character is '>', it calculates the index (0-based) plus one and adds it to the list `pre`. Therefore, `pre` contains the positions (1-based) of all '>' characters in `s1`. The length of `s1` remains `n`, and its content (consisting of '<' and '>') does not change.
