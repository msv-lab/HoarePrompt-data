Output State: **`i` is `n-3`, `el` is `s1[i]`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is the list `preOne` with the last element removed, `ans[i]` is updated based on the new values of `zeroInd` and `oneInd`, `ol` is now `totalOne`, `zr` is now `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * suffZero[-1]`**

Explanation: The code assigns `2 * suffZero[-1]` to `zeroInd`. Since `suffZero[-1]` is the last element of the list `suffZero`, `zeroInd` is now twice the value of the last element of `suffZero`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
