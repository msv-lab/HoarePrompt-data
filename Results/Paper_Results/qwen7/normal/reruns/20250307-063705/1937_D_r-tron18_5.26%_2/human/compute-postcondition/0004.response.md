Output State: **`ans` is a list of `n` zeros, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the corresponding elements in `pre` starting from 0; `pre` is a list of integers where each integer i+1 is the position index (1-based) of '>' in `s1`; `totalOne` is the length of `pre`; `suffZero` is a list containing `[0]`.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `ans` with `n` zeros. This operation does not affect the values of `preOne`, `pre`, `totalOne`, and `suffZero`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states. The new variable `ans` is initialized as a list of `n` zeros.
