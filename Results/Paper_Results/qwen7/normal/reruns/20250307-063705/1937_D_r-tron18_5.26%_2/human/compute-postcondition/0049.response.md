Output State: **`i` is `n-3`, `el` is `s1[i]`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is the list `preOne` with the last element removed, `ans[i]` is updated based on the new values of `zeroInd` and `oneInd`, `oneInd` is `oneInd - func_1(preOne, 1)`**

Explanation: The code subtracts the result of `func_1(preOne, 1)` from `oneInd`. Since `oneInd` was previously defined as `func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1)`, the updated value of `oneInd` is now `oneInd - func_1(preOne, 1)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
