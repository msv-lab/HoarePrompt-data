Output State: **`i` is `n-3`, `el` is `s1[i]`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is the list `preOne` with the last element removed, `ans[i]` is updated as follows: if `ol <= zr`, then `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - (2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1))` and `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`. Otherwise, `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`, where `oneInd` is `oneInd - func_1(preOne, 1)` and `fi` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)`, `preOne` is the list `preOne` with the last element removed.**

Explanation: The code `preOne.pop()` removes the last element from the list `preOne`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state description. The conditions for updating `ans[i]` and the values of `oneInd` and `fi` depend on the comparison between `ol` and `zr`, but since the exact values of these variables are not specified, they remain as described in the initial state.
