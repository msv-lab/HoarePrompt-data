You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a one-dimensional grid of length n . The i -th cell of the grid
contains a character s_i , which is either '<' or '>'.

When a pinball is placed on one of the cells, it moves according to the
following rules:

  * If the pinball is on the i -th cell and s_i is '<', the pinball moves one cell to the left in the next second. If s_i is '>', it moves one cell to the right. 
  * After the pinball has moved, the character s_i is inverted (i. e. if s_i used to be '<', it becomes '>', and vice versa). 
  * The pinball stops moving when it leaves the grid: either from the left border or from the right one. 

You need to answer n independent queries. In the i -th query, a pinball will
be placed on the i -th cell. Note that we always place a pinball on the
initial grid.

For each query, calculate how many seconds it takes the pinball to leave the
grid. It can be shown that the pinball will always leave the grid within a
finite number of steps.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^5 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 5 \cdot
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a string s_1s_2 \ldots s_{n} of
length n consisting of characters '<' and '>'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, for each i (1 \le i \le n ) output the answer if a pinball
is initially placed on the i -th cell.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers representing the positions of the pinball on the grid at different times, where the index represents the time step and the value at each index represents the cell position. times is an integer representing the initial time step when the pinball is placed on the grid (1 <= times <= n).

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and an integer `times`. It calculates the difference between the last element in the list `arr` and the element at an index derived from `times`, ensuring the index is within valid bounds. The function then returns this calculated difference.

    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be `-1`, meaning the loop has completed its execution. The value of `el` will be irrelevant since `i` is out of bounds. `suffZero` will contain the cumulative sum of indices of characters `>` in `s1` from the end, adjusted according to the loop's logic. `ol` will be `totalOne` (or `totalOne - 1` if the last element processed was `'> '`). `zr` will be the length of `suffZero` minus 1. `preOne` will be empty as it is reduced by one element in each iteration until it is exhausted. `ans` will contain the calculated values for each index `i` processed by the loop, adjusted by the conditions specified within the loop body.
    print(*ans)
    #This is printed: the calculated values in the list ans
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a string `s1` consisting of characters '<' and '>' and an integer `n` representing the length of `s1`. It calculates and returns a list `ans` where each element represents a specific balance value based on the characters '<' and '>' in `s1`. The calculation involves iterating through `s1` from the end to the beginning, updating counts and indices, and adjusting the balance values according to the encountered characters. The final state of the program is the printing of the list `ans`, which contains the calculated balance values for each position in `s1`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves simulating the movement of a pinball on a one-dimensional grid where each cell contains either '<' or '>'. The pinball moves left or right based on the direction indicated by the cell, and the direction at the cell is toggled after each move. The goal is to calculate the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The pinball's movement depends on the direction of the current cell.
   - The direction changes after each move.
   - The pinball leaves the grid once it reaches either the leftmost or rightmost boundary.

3. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - **Function `func_1`**: This function seems to be incorrectly named and its purpose is unclear from the context. It appears to be related to calculating some difference between elements in an array, but the logic is not clear.
   - **Function `func_2`**: This function aims to calculate the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid. It uses prefix sums (`pre`) and suffix sums (`suffZero`) to keep track of positions where the direction is '>', and it calculates the time for each starting position.

4. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - The core logic of the code seems to correctly simulate the pinball's movement and calculate the time taken to leave the grid.
   - The use of prefix and suffix sums helps in efficiently calculating the time for each starting position.
   - The handling of different cases (when the pinball is moving towards the left or right) is implemented correctly.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles edge cases such as when the pinball starts at the boundaries or when the grid is entirely one direction ('<' or '>').
   - The logic for updating the prefix and suffix sums is consistent with the problem requirements.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - Based on the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic to calculate the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**

**Explanation**: The provided code correctly simulates the pinball's movement and calculates the time taken to leave the grid for each starting position. The use of prefix and suffix sums ensures efficient computation, and the logic handles all necessary cases.
