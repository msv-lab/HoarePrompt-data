You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s1 is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', and n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5 and s1 has length n.
def func_2(s1, n):
    pre = [(i + 1) for i, el in enumerate(s1) if el == '>']
    totalOne = len(pre)
    preOne = list(accumulate(pre, initial=0))
    suffZero = [0]
    ans = [0] * n
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        el = s1[i]
        
        if el == '>':
            ol, zr = totalOne, len(suffZero) - 1
            if ol <= zr:
                zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)
                oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)

                zeroInd = 2 * suffZero[-1]
                oneInd = func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1)
                oneInd -= func_1(preOne, 1)
                fi = func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)
                ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi
            preOne.pop()
            totalOne -= 1
        else:
            suffZero.append(suffZero[-1] + i + 1)
            ol, zr = totalOne, len(suffZero) - 1
            if zr <= ol:
                zeroInd = suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]
                oneInd = 2 * func_1(preOne, zr)
                ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1
            else:
                zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)
                oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1]
                ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be `-1`, meaning the loop has completed its execution. The value of `el` will be irrelevant since `i` is out of bounds. `suffZero` will contain the cumulative sum of indices of characters `>` in `s1` from the end, adjusted according to the loop's logic. `ol` will be `totalOne` (or `totalOne - 1` if the last element processed was `'> '`). `zr` will be the length of `suffZero` minus 1. `preOne` will be empty as it is reduced by one element in each iteration until it is exhausted. `ans` will contain the calculated values for each index `i` processed by the loop, adjusted by the conditions specified within the loop body.
    print(*ans)
    #This is printed: the calculated values in the list ans
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: `s1`, a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', and `n`, an integer such that 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5 and the length of `s1` is `n`. Depending on the content of `s1`, the function returns either an error message if the string is invalid or a specific value indicating the balance of '<' and '>' characters in the string.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
