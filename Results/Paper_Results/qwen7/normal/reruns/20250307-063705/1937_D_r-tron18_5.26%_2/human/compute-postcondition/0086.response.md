Output State: **`i` is `n-4`, `el` is `s1[i]`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is the list `preOne` with the last element removed, `suffZero` is updated to `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`, `zeroInd` is `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]`, `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`, `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`**.

Explanation: The code assigns `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1` to `ans[i]`. This does not affect the values of `i`, `el`, `ol`, `zr`, `preOne`, `suffZero`, or `zeroInd` and `oneInd`. Therefore, their values remain unchanged from the initial state. The only new value calculated is `ans[i]`, which is the result of the expression involving `zeroInd` and `oneInd`.
