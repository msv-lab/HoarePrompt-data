Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `el` is `s1[n-2]`, `suffZero` is a list with one element which is `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `2 * preOne[-1]` to the variable `oneInd`. Since `preOne` is a predefined list, `preOne[-1]` refers to the last element of `preOne`. The other variables (`i`, `el`, `suffZero`, `ol`, `zr`, and `zeroInd`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
