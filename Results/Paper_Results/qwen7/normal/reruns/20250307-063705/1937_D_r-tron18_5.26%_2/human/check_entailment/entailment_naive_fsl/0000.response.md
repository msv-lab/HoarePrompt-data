Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the movement of the pinball according to the problem description. Specifically, the logic for calculating the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid is flawed. 

The main issues are:
1. The program uses a complex approach involving `func_1` and `func_2`, which do not accurately model the pinball's movement and the inversion of characters.
2. The logic for determining the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid is not correctly implemented. For instance, the program does not properly handle the inversion of characters and the movement of the pinball until it leaves the grid.

To illustrate, consider the input:
```
6
<><<<<>
```
The expected output should be:
```
1 4 7 10 8 1
```
However, the provided program does not produce this output. Instead, it produces incorrect results due to the flawed logic.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
