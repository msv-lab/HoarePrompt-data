Output State: **`preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the corresponding elements in `pre` starting from 0; `pre` is a list of integers where each integer i+1 is the position index (1-based) of '>' in `s1`; `s1` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `totalOne` is the length of `pre`; `suffZero` is a list containing `[0]`.**

The code initializes `suffZero` as a list containing a single element `0`. This does not affect the values of `preOne`, `pre`, `s1`, or `totalOne`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
