Output State: **`i` is `n-3`, `el` is `'> '`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is the list `preOne` with the last element removed, `ans[i]` is unchanged if `totalOne` is less than or equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`, otherwise `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`, where `zeroInd` is `2 * suffZero[-1]`, `oneInd` is `func_1(preOne, len(suffZero) - 1) + func_1(preOne, len(suffZero)) - func_1(preOne, 1)`, and `fi` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)` and `totalOne` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The line `totalOne -= 1` decreases the value of `totalOne` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `i` is updated to `n-3` because `i` was initially `n-2`.
