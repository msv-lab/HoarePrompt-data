The function `func_2` accepts a string `s1` consisting of characters '<' and '>' and an integer `n` representing the length of `s1`. It calculates and returns a list `ans` where each element represents a specific balance value based on the characters '<' and '>' in `s1`. The calculation involves iterating through `s1` from the end to the beginning, updating counts and indices, and adjusting the balance values according to the encountered characters. The final state of the program is the printing of the list `ans`, which contains the calculated balance values for each position in `s1`.
