Output State: **`i` is `n-3`, `el` is `s1[i]`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is the list `preOne` with the last element removed, `ans[i]` is updated based on the new values of `zeroInd` and `oneInd`, `ol` is now `totalOne`, `zr` is now `len(suffZero) - 1`**.

Explanation: The code updates the values of `ol` and `zr` directly to `totalOne` and `len(suffZero) - 1`, respectively. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
