Postcondition: `i` is `n-4`, `el` is `s1[i]`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is the list `preOne` with the last element removed, `suffZero` is updated to `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`. Depending on the condition `zr <= ol`, `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are calculated as follows:
- If `zr <= ol`, then `zeroInd` is `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]`, and `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`.
- Otherwise, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`, and `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`.

After executing the if-else block, `ans[i]` is set to `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1` if `zr <= ol`, and `ans[i]` is set to `zeroInd - oneInd` otherwise.
