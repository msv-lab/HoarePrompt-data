### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves simulating the movement of a pinball on a one-dimensional grid where each cell contains either '<' or '>'. The pinball moves left or right based on the direction indicated by the cell, and the direction at the cell is toggled after each move. The goal is to calculate the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The pinball's movement depends on the direction of the current cell.
   - The direction changes after each move.
   - The pinball leaves the grid once it reaches either the leftmost or rightmost boundary.

3. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - **Function `func_1`**: This function seems to be incorrectly named and its purpose is unclear from the context. It appears to be related to calculating some difference between elements in an array, but the logic is not clear. Given the context, this function is not used in the main logic of `func_2`, so it can be considered irrelevant for the correctness of the solution.
   - **Function `func_2`**: This function aims to calculate the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid. It uses prefix sums (`pre`) and suffix sums (`suffZero`) to keep track of positions where the direction is '>', and it calculates the time for each starting position.

4. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - The core logic of the code seems to correctly simulate the pinball's movement and calculate the time taken to leave the grid.
   - The use of prefix and suffix sums helps in efficiently calculating the time for each starting position.
   - The handling of different cases (when the pinball is moving towards the left or right) is implemented correctly.
   - However, there is a critical flaw in the logic of `func_2` that affects the correctness of the solution. Specifically, the way the time is calculated for each position does not accurately reflect the actual movement of the pinball. The time calculation is based on the assumption that the pinball will always move in a straight line until it hits a boundary, but this is not necessarily true due to the toggling of directions.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles edge cases such as when the pinball starts at the boundaries or when the grid is entirely one direction ('<' or '>').
   - However, the logic for updating the prefix and suffix sums is not sufficient to handle all possible movements of the pinball, especially when the grid configuration is complex.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - Based on the analysis, the provided code does not correctly implement the logic to calculate the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting position. The time calculation is flawed and does not account for the toggling of directions properly.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

**Explanation**: The provided code attempts to simulate the pinball's movement and calculate the time taken to leave the grid, but the logic for calculating the time is flawed. The time calculation does not accurately reflect the actual movement of the pinball due to the toggling of directions, leading to incorrect results.

Final: **False**
