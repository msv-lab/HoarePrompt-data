Output State: **`i` is `n-3`, `el` is `s1[i]`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is the list `preOne` with the last element removed, `ans[i]` is updated based on the new values of `zeroInd` and `oneInd`, `oneInd` is `oneInd - func_1(preOne, 1)`, `fi` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)`**

Explanation: The code calculates the value of `fi` using the function `func_1`. Specifically, `fi` is set to the difference between `func_1(preOne, zr + 1)` and `func_1(preOne, zr)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
