Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `s1`, a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', and `n`, an integer such that 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5 and the length of `s1` is `n`. Depending on the content of `s1`, the function returns either an error message if the string is invalid or a specific value indicating the balance of '<' and '>' characters in the string.**

This means the function checks if the input string `s1` is valid (i.e., it only contains '<' and '>') and calculates the balance between these characters. If the string is invalid, it returns an error message. Otherwise, it returns a value based on the balance of '<' and '>' characters.
