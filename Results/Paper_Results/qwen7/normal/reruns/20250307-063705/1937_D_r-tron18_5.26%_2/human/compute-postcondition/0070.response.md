Output State: **`i` is `n-4`, `el` is `s1[i]`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is the list `preOne` with the last element removed, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, totalOne)**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)` to `zeroInd`. Here, `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, so `zeroInd` becomes `2 * func_1(suffZero, totalOne)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
