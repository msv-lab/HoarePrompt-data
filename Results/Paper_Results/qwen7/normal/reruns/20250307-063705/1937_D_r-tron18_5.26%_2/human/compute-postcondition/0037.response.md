Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `el` is `s1[n-2]`, `suffZero` is a list with one element which is `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`, `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`**

Explanation: The code updates `ans[i]` with the value of `zeroInd - oneInd`. Since `i` is `n-2`, `el` is `s1[n-2]`, `suffZero` is a list with one element which is `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`, and `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`, the value of `ans[i]` is now `zeroInd - oneInd`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
