Output State: **`i` is `n-4`, `el` is `s1[i]`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is the list `preOne` with the last element removed, `suffZero` is updated to `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`, `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`**.

The code updates `ans[i]` to the value of `zeroInd - oneInd`. Since `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are calculated using the existing variables and functions, these values are now part of the state. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
