Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `el` is `'> '`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`**.

This means that the variable `zeroInd` is assigned the value of twice the result of the function `func_1` applied to the list `suffZero` and the value of `ol`. All other variables retain their previous values.
