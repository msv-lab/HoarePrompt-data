Output State: **`i` is `n-4`, `el` is `s1[i]`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is the list `preOne` with the last element removed, `suffZero` is updated to `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)**

Explanation: The code calculates `zeroInd` using the function `func_1` with two arguments: `suffZero` and `ol + 1` for the first argument, and `1` for the second argument. The values of the other variables (`i`, `el`, `ol`, `zr`, `preOne`, and `suffZero`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The function `func_1` is called twice with different arguments, and the result of `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)` is assigned to `zeroInd`.
