Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `el` is `s1[n-2]`, `suffZero` is a list with two elements `[suffZero[-1] + i + 1, suffZero[-2] + suffZero[-1] + i + 1]`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, len(suffZero) - 1)`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)` to the variable `oneInd`. Since `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `oneInd` is calculated as `2 * func_1(preOne, len(suffZero) - 1)`. No other variables are affected by this line of code.
