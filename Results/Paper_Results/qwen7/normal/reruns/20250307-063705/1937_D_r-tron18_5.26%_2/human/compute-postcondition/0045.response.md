Output State: **`i` is `n-3`, `el` is `s1[i]`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is the list `preOne` with the last element removed, `ans[i]` is updated based on the new values of `zeroInd` and `oneInd`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `oneInd` to `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `preOne[-1]` is the last element of the list `preOne` before it was modified, and `func_1(preOne, 1)` is the result of the function call with the list `preOne` and the integer `1` as arguments.
