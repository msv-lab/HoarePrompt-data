Output State: **`i` is `n-4`, `el` is `s1[i]`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is the list `preOne` with the last element removed, `zeroInd` is `2 * suffZero[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`, `oneInd` is `func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1)`**

Explanation: The code subtracts the result of `func_1(preOne, 1)` from `oneInd`. Since `oneInd` was initially calculated as `func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1)`, after executing the code, `oneInd` becomes `func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, 1)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
