Output State: **`preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the corresponding elements in `pre` starting from 0; `pre` is a list of integers where each integer i+1 is the position index (1-based) of '>' in `s1`; `s1` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>'; `totalOne` is the length of `pre`.**

Explanation: The code `preOne = list(accumulate(pre, initial=0))` creates a new list `preOne` where each element is the cumulative sum of the corresponding elements in `pre`, starting from 0. The initial value of 0 ensures that the first element in `preOne` is 0, even if the first element in `pre` is non-zero. The values of `pre`, `s1`, and `totalOne` remain unchanged.
