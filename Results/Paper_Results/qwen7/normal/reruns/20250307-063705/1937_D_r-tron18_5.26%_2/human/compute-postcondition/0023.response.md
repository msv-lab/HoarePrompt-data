Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `el` is `'> '`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is the list `preOne` with the last element removed, `ans[i]` is unchanged if `totalOne` is less than or equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`, otherwise `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`, where `zeroInd` is `2 * suffZero[-1]`, `oneInd` is `func_1(preOne, len(suffZero) - 1) + func_1(preOne, len(suffZero)) - func_1(preOne, 1)`, and `fi` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)`**.

Explanation: The code `preOne.pop()` removes the last element from the list `preOne`. No other variables are affected by this operation. The values of `i`, `el`, `ol`, `zr`, `zeroInd`, `oneInd`, and `fi` remain unchanged unless they are recalculated based on the updated `preOne`. Since the exact values of these variables depend on the function `func_1` and the current state of `preOne`, which has now lost its last element, the expressions for `zeroInd`, `oneInd`, and `fi` will be based on the new, shorter `preOne`. However, without the actual values of `preOne`, `suffZero`, and the results of `func_1`, we cannot simplify further.
