Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `el` is `s1[n-2]`, `suffZero` is a list with two elements `[suffZero[-1] + i + 1, suffZero[-2] + suffZero[-1] + i + 1]`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`**.

Explanation: The code updates `suffZero` by adding `suffZero[-2]` to `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`. Since `suffZero` initially has one element, `suffZero[-1]` is the last element, which is `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`. Adding `suffZero[-2]` (which is `suffZero[-1] - i - 1`) to this gives the new last element `suffZero[-2] + suffZero[-1] + i + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
