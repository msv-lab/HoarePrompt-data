Output State: **`i` is `n-3`, `el` is `s1[i]`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is the list `preOne` with the last element removed, `suffZero` is updated to append `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)**

Explanation: The code calculates `zeroInd` using the function `func_1`. The function `func_1` is called twice with different arguments, but since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `zeroInd`. However, the other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
