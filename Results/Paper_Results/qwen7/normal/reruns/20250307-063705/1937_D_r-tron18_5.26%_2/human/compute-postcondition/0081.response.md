Output State: **`i` is `n-4`, `el` is `s1[i]`, `ol` is `totalOne - 1`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is the list `preOne` with the last element removed, and `ans[i]` is updated as follows: If `ol <= zr`, then `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`, where `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`. Otherwise, `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`, where `zeroInd` is `2 * suffZero[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)` and `oneInd` is `func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1)`, and `fi` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr).**

Explanation: The line `totalOne -= 1` decreases the value of `totalOne` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `ans[i]` is updated based on the conditions given, but since the exact values of `suffZero`, `preOne`, and the results of `func_1` are not specified, the updated formula for `ans[i]` remains as described.
