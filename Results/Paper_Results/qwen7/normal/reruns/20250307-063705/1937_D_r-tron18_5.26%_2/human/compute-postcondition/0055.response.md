Output State: **`i` is `n-3`, `el` is `s1[i]`, `ol` is `totalOne - 1`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is the list `preOne` with the last element removed, `ans[i]` is updated as follows: if `ol <= zr`, then `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - (2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1))` and `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`. Otherwise, `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`, where `oneInd` is `oneInd - func_1(preOne, 1)` and `fi` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)`**.

Explanation: The line `totalOne -= 1` decreases the value of `totalOne` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The conditions for updating `ans[i]` and the values of `oneInd` and `fi` depend on the comparison between `ol` and `zr`, which are not affected by this line of code.
