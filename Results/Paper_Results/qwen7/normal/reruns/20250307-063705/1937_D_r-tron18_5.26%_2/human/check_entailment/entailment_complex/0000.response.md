### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires calculating the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell. The pinball moves based on the direction indicated by the character in the grid ('<' or '>'), and the direction changes after each move.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - **Initialization**: 
     - `pre` stores the positions of cells with '>'.
     - `totalOne` keeps track of the count of these positions.
     - `preOne` uses `accumulate` to create a prefix sum array for `pre`.
     - `suffZero` starts as `[0]` and accumulates the positions of cells with '<' from the end.
     - `ans` is initialized as a list of zeros with length `n`.

   - **Main Loop**:
     - Iterates backward through the string `s1`.
     - For each character, updates the balance values (`zeroInd` and `oneInd`) based on whether the character is '>' or '<'.
     - Adjusts the balance values accordingly and stores the result in `ans`.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - **Purpose**: Computes the difference between the last element in `arr` and an element at a specific index derived from `times`.
   - **Logic**: Ensures the index is within bounds before accessing `arr`.

4. **Overall Logic**:
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly handles the backward traversal of the string and updates the balance values based on the direction of the pinball.
   - The use of prefix sums and suffix sums helps efficiently compute the required values without redundant calculations.
   - The final output matches the expected format and values based on the problem statement.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles edge cases like empty strings and single-character strings correctly.
   - The logic ensures that the pinball always leaves the grid within a finite number of steps.

### Conclusion:
Given the detailed analysis, the provided functions correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is correct.
