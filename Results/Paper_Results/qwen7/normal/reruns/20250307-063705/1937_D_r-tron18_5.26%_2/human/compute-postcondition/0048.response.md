Output State: **`i` is `n-3`, `el` is `s1[i]`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is the list `preOne` with the last element removed, `ans[i]` is updated based on the new values of `zeroInd` and `oneInd`, `oneInd` is `func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1)`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `oneInd` by calling the function `func_1` twice with different arguments. The first call is with `preOne` and `zr` as arguments, and the second call is with `preOne` and `zr + 1` as arguments. The results of these two calls are added together to get the new value of `oneInd`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
