Output State: **`i` is `n-2`; `el` is `s1[n-2]`**

Explanation: The code `el = s1[i]` assigns the value of `s1[i]` to the variable `el`. Given that the initial state of `i` is `n-1`, after executing the line of code, `i` is decremented by 1 (becoming `n-2`), and `el` is assigned the value of `s1[n-2]`.
