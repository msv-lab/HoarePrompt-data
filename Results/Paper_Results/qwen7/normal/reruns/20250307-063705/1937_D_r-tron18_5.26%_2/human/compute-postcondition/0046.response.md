Output State: **`i` is `n-3`, `el` is `s1[i]`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is the list `preOne` with the last element removed, `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - (2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1))`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)**

Explanation: The code updates `ans[i]` to be the difference between `zeroInd` and `oneInd`. Since `oneInd` is defined as `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`, `ans[i]` is now calculated as `zeroInd - oneInd`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
