### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves simulating the movement of a pinball on a one-dimensional grid where each cell contains either '<' or '>'. The pinball moves left or right based on the direction indicated by the cell, and the direction at the cell is toggled after each move. The goal is to calculate the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The pinball's movement depends on the direction of the current cell.
   - The direction changes after each move.
   - The pinball leaves the grid once it reaches either the leftmost or rightmost boundary.

3. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - **Function `func_1`**: This function seems to be incorrectly named and its purpose is unclear from the context. It appears to be related to calculating some difference between elements in an array, but the logic is not clear.
   - **Function `func_2`**: This function aims to calculate the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid. It uses prefix sums (`pre`) and suffix sums (`suffZero`) to keep track of positions where the direction is '>', and it calculates the time for each starting position.

4. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - The core logic of the code seems to correctly simulate the pinball's movement and calculate the time taken to leave the grid.
   - The use of prefix and suffix sums helps in efficiently calculating the time for each starting position.
   - The handling of different cases (when the pinball is moving towards the left or right) is implemented correctly.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles edge cases such as when the pinball starts at the boundaries or when the grid is entirely one direction ('<' or '>').
   - The logic for updating the prefix and suffix sums is consistent with the problem requirements.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - Based on the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic to calculate the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**

**Explanation**: The provided code correctly simulates the pinball's movement and calculates the time taken to leave the grid for each starting position. The use of prefix and suffix sums ensures efficient computation, and the logic handles all necessary cases.
