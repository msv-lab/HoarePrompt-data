Output State: **`i` is `n-3`, `el` is `s1[i]`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is the list `preOne` with the last element removed, `suffZero` is updated to append `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`, `zeroInd` is `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]`, `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`, `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans[i]` to `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`. Since `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are defined in terms of `suffZero` and `preOne`, their values remain unchanged. The other variables (`i`, `el`, `ol`, `zr`, `preOne`, `suffZero`) are not directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, they retain their previous values.
