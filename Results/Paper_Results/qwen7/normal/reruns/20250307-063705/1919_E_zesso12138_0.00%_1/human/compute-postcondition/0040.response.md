Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `j`.
2. **Determine the initial value of `j`**: The loop starts with `j` being 0 because `range(2 * n + 1)` generates values from 0 to \(2 * n\).
3. **Check if the loop can execute**: For the loop to execute, `j` must be within the range of 0 to \(2 * n\). Since `j` starts at 0, the loop will definitely execute as long as `2 * n` is a valid non-negative integer.

Given the initial state:
- All elements in `new_dp` are equal to 0.
- `i` is 2.

Since the loop condition depends on `j`, and `j` starts at 0, we need to ensure that the initial state of `j` is set correctly. However, the initial state of `i` (which is 2) does not affect the loop execution directly.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the initial value of `j`.

**State:**
**`j` is 0, `i` is 2**
