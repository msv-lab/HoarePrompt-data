Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
There is a hidden array a of size n consisting of only 1 and -1 . Let p be the
prefix sums of array a . More formally, p is an array of length n defined as
p_i = a_1 + a_2 + \ldots + a_i . Afterwards, array p is sorted in non-
decreasing order. For example, if a = [1, -1, -1, 1, 1] , then p = [1, 0, -1,
0, 1] before sorting and p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] after sorting.

You are given the prefix sum array p after sorting, but you do not know what
array a is. Your task is to count the number of initial arrays a such that the
above process results in the given sorted prefix sum array p . As this number
can be large, you are only required to find it modulo 998\,244\,353 .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 5000
) — the size of the hidden array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n
(|p_i| \le n ) — the n prefix sums of a sorted in non-decreasing order.

It is guaranteed that p_1 \le p_2 \le \ldots \le p_n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5000 .

Output

For each test case, output the answer modulo 998\,244\,353 .

Note

In the first two test cases, the only possible arrays a for n = 1 are a = [1]
and a = [-1] . Their respective sorted prefix sum arrays p are p = [1] and p =
[-1] . Hence, there is no array a that can result in the sorted prefix sum
array p = [0] and there is exactly 1 array a that can result in the sorted
prefix sum array p = [1] .

In the third test case, it can be proven that there is no array a that could
result in the sorted prefix sum array p = [-1, 1, 2] .

In the fourth test case, the 3 possible arrays a that could result in the
sorted prefix sum array p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] are:

  * a = [1, -1, 1, -1, -1] . The prefix sum array before sorting is p = [1, 0, 1, 0, -1] , which after sorting gives p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] . 
  * a = [1, -1, -1, 1, 1] . The prefix sum array before sorting is p = [1, 0, -1, 0, 1] , which after sorting gives p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] . 
  * a = [-1, 1, 1, -1, 1] . The prefix sum array before sorting is p = [-1, 0, 1, 0, 1] , which after sorting gives p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] . 

For the fifth test case, the only possible array a that could result in the
sorted prefix sum array p = [-4, -3, -3, -2, -1] is a = [-1, -1, -1, -1, 1] .

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, and p is a list of n integers representing the sorted prefix sums where |p[i]| ≤ n for all 0 ≤ i < n.

        dp = new_dp
        
    #State: Output State: The final state of `dp` will be such that each element in `dp` is equal to \(2^n\) modulo `MOD`. This is because the given loop essentially performs a convolution operation on the initial condition where `dp[n]` is 1, spreading out the value symmetrically across the list `dp`. After `n` iterations, every position in `dp` will have been incremented according to the rules defined in the loop, resulting in each element being equivalent to \(2^n\) modulo `MOD`.
    #
    #This outcome can be derived from observing that each iteration doubles the contributions to adjacent positions in `dp`, and since the loop runs for exactly `n` iterations, it fully propagates the initial value of 1 at `dp[n]` to all positions, scaled by \(2^n\) modulo `MOD`.
    final_sum = p[-1] + offset
    return dp[final_sum]
    #The program returns dp[final_sum], where final_sum is p[-1] + offset, and each element in dp is equal to \(2^n\) modulo MOD.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` integers representing sorted prefix sums. It initializes a dynamic programming array `dp` and iterates through it to update its values based on specific rules. After `n` iterations, each element in `dp` is set to \(2^n\) modulo `MOD`. Finally, it calculates `final_sum` as `p[-1] + offset` and returns the value at index `final_sum` in the `dp` array.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, n is a positive integer representing the size of the hidden array a, and p is a list of n integers representing the sorted prefix sums of a. Each |p_i| ≤ n and p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ ... ≤ p_n.

    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()

    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):

        result = func_1(n, p)
        
        results.append(result)
        
    #State: Output State: `index` is `9 + 3*n`, `t` must be equal to 3, `n` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `p` is a list of `n` integers obtained by converting the substring of `data` from index `7 + 2*n` to index `7 + 3*n`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`, `results` is a list with the elements `result`, `result`, and `result`.
    #
    #This means after the loop has executed all its iterations (in this case, 3 times), the `index` will be at the position `9 + 3*n` in the `data` list. The variable `t` will be set to 3 since the loop runs exactly 3 times. The variable `n` remains as the integer value of `data[2]`. The list `p` is updated to contain the integers from the substring of `data` starting at index `7 + 2*n` and ending at `7 + 3*n`. The variable `result` holds the return value of `func_1(n, p)` for the last iteration, and it is appended to the `results` list, making `results` a list with three identical elements, each being the return value of `func_1(n, p)`.
    for res in results:
        print(res)
        
    #State: `res` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)` from the last iteration, and `results` is a list containing three identical elements, each being the return value of `func_1(n, p)` from the last iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the size of the hidden array and its sorted prefix sums from input, calls another function `func_1` to compute a result, and stores these results in a list. After processing all test cases, it prints the computed results for each case.
