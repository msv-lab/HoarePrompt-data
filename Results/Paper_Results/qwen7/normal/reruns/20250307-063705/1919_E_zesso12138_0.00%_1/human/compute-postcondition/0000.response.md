Output State: **`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is a positive integer representing the size of the hidden array `a`, and `p` is a list of `n` integers representing the sorted prefix sums of `a`. Each |`p_i`| ≤ `n` and `p_1` ≤ `p_2` ≤ ... ≤ `p_n`. The function `input` is now set to `sys.stdin.read` for reading input.**

The code `input = sys.stdin.read` simply reassigns the `input` variable to refer to the `read` method of `sys.stdin`, which means that instead of using the standard `input()` function, the program will read all input at once using `sys.stdin.read()`. This does not change the values of `t`, `n`, or `p`, but it does alter how input will be processed in subsequent parts of the program.
