You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, and p is a list of n integers representing the sorted prefix sums where |p[i]| ≤ n for all 0 ≤ i < n.
def func_1(n, p):
    dp = [0] * (2 * n + 1)
    offset = n
    dp[offset] = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        new_dp = [0] * (2 * n + 1)
        
        for j in range(2 * n + 1):
            if dp[j] > 0:
                if j + 1 <= 2 * n:
                    new_dp[j + 1] = (new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD
                if j - 1 >= 0:
                    new_dp[j - 1] = (new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD
        
        dp = new_dp
        
    #State: Output State: The final state of `dp` will be such that each element in `dp` is equal to \(2^n\) modulo `MOD`. This is because the given loop essentially performs a convolution operation on the initial condition where `dp[n]` is 1, spreading out the value symmetrically across the list `dp`. After `n` iterations, every position in `dp` will have been incremented according to the rules defined in the loop, resulting in each element being equivalent to \(2^n\) modulo `MOD`.
    #
    #This outcome can be derived from observing that each iteration doubles the contributions to adjacent positions in `dp`, and since the loop runs for exactly `n` iterations, it fully propagates the initial value of 1 at `dp[n]` to all positions, scaled by \(2^n\) modulo `MOD`.
    final_sum = p[-1] + offset
    return dp[final_sum]
    #The program returns dp[final_sum], where final_sum is p[-1] + offset, and each element in dp is equal to \(2^n\) modulo MOD.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` integers representing sorted prefix sums. It returns `dp[final_sum]`, where `final_sum` is `p[-1] + offset`, and each element in `dp` is \(2^n\) modulo `MOD`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns dp[final_sum], where final_sum is p[-1] + offset, and each element in dp is equal to \(2^n\) modulo MOD.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
