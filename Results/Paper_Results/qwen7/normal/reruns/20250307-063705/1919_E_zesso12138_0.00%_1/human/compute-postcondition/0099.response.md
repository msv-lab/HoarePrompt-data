Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variable `j`. The other variables mentioned (`i` and `new_dp`) are not part of the loop head and therefore their states do not need to be adjusted based on the loop itself.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is within the range `range(2 * n + 1)`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was 6.

3. **Update the State of `j`**: Since `j` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `j` will be `7`.

4. **Check the Postcondition**: The postcondition given is that if `j - 1` is greater than or equal to 0 and `dp[j] > 0`, then `new_dp[j - 1]` is updated to `(new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`. However, since we are only asked to update the state of `j` for the next iteration, we do not need to evaluate this condition now.

5. **Adjust the State**: The only state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `j`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is 6, `new_dp` is a list of 0s with length 2 * n + 1, `j` is 7**
