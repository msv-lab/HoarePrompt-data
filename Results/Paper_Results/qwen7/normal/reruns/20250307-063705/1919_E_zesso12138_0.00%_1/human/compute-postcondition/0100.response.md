Output State: **`i` is 6, `new_dp` is a list of 0s with length 2 * n + 1, `j` is 7, `new_dp[8]` is `(new_dp[8] + dp[7]) % MOD`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `new_dp[j + 1]`, which is `new_dp[8]` (since `j` is 7), by adding `dp[7]` to its current value and then taking the result modulo `MOD`. The other variables (`i` and `new_dp` with other indices) remain unchanged.
