    #State: Output State: The final state of `dp` will be such that each element in `dp` is equal to \(2^n\) modulo `MOD`. This is because the given loop essentially performs a convolution operation on the initial condition where `dp[n]` is 1, spreading out the value symmetrically across the list `dp`. After `n` iterations, every position in `dp` will have been incremented according to the rules defined in the loop, resulting in each element being equivalent to \(2^n\) modulo `MOD`.
    #
    #This outcome can be derived from observing that each iteration doubles the contributions to adjacent positions in `dp`, and since the loop runs for exactly `n` iterations, it fully propagates the initial value of 1 at `dp[n]` to all positions, scaled by \(2^n\) modulo `MOD`.
    final_sum = p[-1] + offset
    return dp[final_sum]
    #The program returns dp[final_sum], where final_sum is p[-1] + offset, and each element in dp is equal to \(2^n\) modulo MOD.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` integers representing sorted prefix sums. It initializes a dynamic programming array `dp` and iterates through it to update its values based on specific rules. After `n` iterations, each element in `dp` is set to \(2^n\) modulo `MOD`. Finally, it calculates `final_sum` as `p[-1] + offset` and returns the value at index `final_sum` in the `dp` array.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, n is a positive integer representing the size of the hidden array a, and p is a list of n integers representing the sorted prefix sums of a. Each |p_i| ≤ n and p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ ... ≤ p_n.

    #State: Output State: `index` is `9 + 3*n`, `t` must be equal to 3, `n` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `p` is a list of `n` integers obtained by converting the substring of `data` from index `7 + 2*n` to index `7 + 3*n`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`, `results` is a list with the elements `result`, `result`, and `result`.
    #
    #This means after the loop has executed all its iterations (in this case, 3 times), the `index` will be at the position `9 + 3*n` in the `data` list. The variable `t` will be set to 3 since the loop runs exactly 3 times. The variable `n` remains as the integer value of `data[2]`. The list `p` is updated to contain the integers from the substring of `data` starting at index `7 + 2*n` and ending at `7 + 3*n`. The variable `result` holds the return value of `func_1(n, p)` for the last iteration, and it is appended to the `results` list, making `results` a list with three identical elements, each being the return value of `func_1(n, p)`.
    for res in results:
        print(res)
        
    #State: `res` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)` from the last iteration, and `results` is a list containing three identical elements, each being the return value of `func_1(n, p)` from the last iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the size of the hidden array and its sorted prefix sums from input, calls another function `func_1` to compute a result, and stores these results in a list. After processing all test cases, it prints the computed results for each case.
