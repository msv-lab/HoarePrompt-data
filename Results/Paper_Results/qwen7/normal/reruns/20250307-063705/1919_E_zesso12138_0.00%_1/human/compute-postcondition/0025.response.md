Output State: **`index` is 9 + n, `t` must be greater than 1, `n` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `p` is a list of `n` integers obtained by converting the substring of `data` from index `7 + n + n` to index `7 + 2*n`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`, `results` is a list with the element `result`, `n` is now the integer value of `data[index]`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `result` to the return value of `func_1(n, p)`. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial state descriptions. The value of `n` is updated to the integer value of `data[index]`, which is 9 + n.
