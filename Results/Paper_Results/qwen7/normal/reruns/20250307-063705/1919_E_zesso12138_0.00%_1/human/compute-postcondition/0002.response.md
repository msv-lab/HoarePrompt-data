Output State: **`index` is 0, `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is a positive integer representing the size of the hidden array `a`, `p` is a list of `n` integers representing the sorted prefix sums of `a`, each |`p_i`| ≤ `n` and `p_1` ≤ `p_2` ≤ ... ≤ `p_n`, and `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.**

The code initializes the variable `index` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `p`, or `data`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
