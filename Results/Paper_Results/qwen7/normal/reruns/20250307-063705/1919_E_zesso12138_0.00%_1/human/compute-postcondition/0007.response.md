Output State: **`index` is 3, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `p` is a list of `n` integers representing the sorted prefix sums of `a`, each |`p_i`| ≤ `n` and `p_1` ≤ `p_2` ≤ ... ≤ `p_n`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, and `results` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `n` by converting `data[index]` (which is `data[2]` given the initial state) to an integer. All other variables remain unchanged. The index is updated to `index + 1` because the next element in the list `data` would be accessed.
