Postcondition: `dp[j]` is greater than 0, and `new_dp[j - 1]` is updated to (`new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]`) % MOD if `j - 1` is greater than or equal to 0. Additionally, `new_dp[j + 1]` is updated to (`new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]`) % MOD if `j + 1` is less than or equal to `2 * n`. All other variables retain their values from the precondition.
