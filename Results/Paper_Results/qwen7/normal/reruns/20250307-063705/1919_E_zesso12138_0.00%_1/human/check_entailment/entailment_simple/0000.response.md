### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is intended to compute the number of ways to construct the original array `a` from the given sorted prefix sum array `p`.
   - It uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of ways to achieve the given prefix sums.
   - The logic seems to be flawed because the current implementation does not correctly simulate the construction of the array `a` from the prefix sums `p`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` reads input and processes multiple test cases.
   - It calls `func_1` for each test case and stores the results.
   - The results are printed at the end.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic in `func_1` is incorrect. It initializes a DP array `dp` and updates it in a way that doesn't reflect the actual construction of the array `a` from the prefix sums `p`.
   - The final result returned by `func_1` is based on an incorrect assumption about how the prefix sums are generated from the array `a`.

Given the problem statement, the goal is to count the number of ways to construct the array `a` from the given sorted prefix sums `p`. The current implementation does not correctly simulate this process.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
