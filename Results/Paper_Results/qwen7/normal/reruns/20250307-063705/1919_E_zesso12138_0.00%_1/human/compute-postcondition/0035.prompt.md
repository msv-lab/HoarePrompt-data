Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `index` is `9 + 3*n`, `t` must be equal to 3, `n` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `p` is a list of `n` integers obtained by converting the substring of `data` from index `7 + 2*n` to index `7 + 3*n`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`, `results` is a list with the elements `result`, `result`, and `result`.

This means after the loop has executed all its iterations (in this case, 3 times), the `index` will be at the position `9 + 3*n` in the `data` list. The variable `t` will be set to 3 since the loop runs exactly 3 times. The variable `n` remains as the integer value of `data[2]`. The list `p` is updated to contain the integers from the substring of `data` starting at index `7 + 2*n` and ending at `7 + 3*n`. The variable `result` holds the return value of `func_1(n, p)` for the last iteration, and it is appended to the `results` list, making `results` a list with three identical elements, each being the return value of `func_1(n, p)`.
Code of the loop:
for res in results:
    print(res)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `res` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `res` is the next element in the `results` list

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `res` is the next element in the `results` list




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
