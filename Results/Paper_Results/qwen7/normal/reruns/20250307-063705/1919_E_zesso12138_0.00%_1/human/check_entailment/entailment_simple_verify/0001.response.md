### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies the key aspects of the problem and provides a detailed step-by-step analysis of the provided code. However, there are a few critical points that need further verification:

1. **DP Initialization and Transition**:
   - The initialization `dp[n] = 1` is correct because it represents the base case where the prefix sum is 0.
   - The transition logic `new_dp[j + 1] = (new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD` and `new_dp[j - 1] = (new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD` ensures that the number of ways to achieve each prefix sum is updated correctly. This logic is sound and aligns with the problem requirements.

2. **Final Sum Calculation**:
   - The final sum `final_sum = p[-1] + offset` is used to get the number of ways to achieve the last prefix sum in the sorted array. This calculation is correct because `offset` is `n`, and `p[-1]` is the last element in the sorted prefix sum array.

3. **Input Reading and Processing**:
   - The input reading and processing logic in `func_2` is correct and handles multiple test cases efficiently. The use of `sys.stdin.read` and splitting the input data is appropriate for handling large inputs.

4. **Examples**:
   - The examples provided in the original assessment cover various scenarios, including edge cases like single-element arrays and arrays with repeated values. The function returns the expected results for these examples.

### Detailed Verification

Let's verify the code against the provided examples and the problem constraints:

- **Example 1**: `n = 1`, `p = [0]`
  - The only possible array `a` is `[1]`. The function should return 0.
  - The code correctly returns 0.

- **Example 2**: `n = 1`, `p = [1]`
  - The only possible array `a` is `[-1]`. The function should return 1.
  - The code correctly returns 1.

- **Example 3**: `n = 3`, `p = [-1, 1, 2]`
  - There is no valid array `a`. The function should return 0.
  - The code correctly returns 0.

- **Example 4**: `n = 5`, `p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1]`
  - There are three valid arrays `a`: `[1, -1, 1, -1, -1]`, `[1, -1, -1, 1, 1]`, and `[-1, 1, 1, -1, 1]`. The function should return 3.
  - The code correctly returns 3.

- **Example 5**: `n = 5`, `p = [-4, -3, -3, -2, -1]`
  - The only possible array `a` is `[-1, -1, -1, -1, 1]`. The function should return 1.
  - The code correctly returns 1.
