Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head is `for j in range(2 * n + 1)`. The only variable that changes within this loop is `j`.

2. **Understand the Loop Execution:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `dp[0]` is greater than 0.
   - `new_dp[1]` is updated to `(`new_dp[1] + dp[0]) % MOD`.
   - If `j - 1` is greater than or equal to 0, then `new_dp[j - 1]` is further updated to `(`new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`.
   - Otherwise, `new_dp[j - 1]` retains its value as per the precondition.

3. **Determine the New Value of `j`:**
   - Since `j` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, if the loop has just finished an iteration where `j` was some value, the next value of `j` will be `j + 1`.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - The state `dp[0] > 0` remains unchanged because it is not affected by the loop.
   - The state `new_dp[1]` is updated to `(`new_dp[1] + dp[0]) % MOD`.
   - For the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` will be `j + 1`.
   - We need to check if `j - 1` is greater than or equal to 0 for the next iteration. If it is, then `new_dp[j - 1]` will be updated; otherwise, it will retain its value.

Given the above analysis, let's assume that `j` was the value that caused the last update (let's call this value `j_last`). For the next iteration, `j` will be `j_last + 1`.

Since we don't know the exact value of `j_last`, we'll consider the general case where `j` is incremented by 1.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **Increment `j`:**
   - `j` will be `j_last + 1`.

2. **Check Condition for Updating `new_dp[j - 1]`:**
   - If `j_last + 1 - 1 >= 0`, then `new_dp[j_last]` will be updated to `(`new_dp[j_last] + dp[j_last + 1]) % MOD`.
   - Otherwise, `new_dp[j_last]` retains its value.

### Final State:
- `dp[0]` remains greater than 0.
- `new_dp[1]` is updated to `(`new_dp[1] + dp[0]) % MOD`.
- `j` will be `j_last + 1`.
- `new_dp[j_last]` will be updated if `j_last + 1 - 1 >= 0`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`dp[0]` is greater than 0, `new_dp[1]` is updated to (`new_dp[1] + dp[0]) % MOD, `j` is `j_last + 1`, and `new_dp[j_last]` is updated if `j_last + 1 - 1 >= 0`**.
