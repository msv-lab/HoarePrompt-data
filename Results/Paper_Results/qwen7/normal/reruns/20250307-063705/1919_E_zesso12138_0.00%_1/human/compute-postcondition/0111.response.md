Output State: The final state of `dp` will be such that each element `dp[j]` (for all valid `j`) will be equal to the sum of all previous values of `dp[k]` (where `k` ranges from `n` to `2*n`) modulo `MOD`. This is because each iteration of the loop redistributes the values of `dp` to its neighboring indices, effectively accumulating the sum of all previous values into each position.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, every element in the `dp` list will hold the cumulative sum of all the original `dp` values starting from `dp[n]` to `dp[2*n]`, modulo `MOD`.
