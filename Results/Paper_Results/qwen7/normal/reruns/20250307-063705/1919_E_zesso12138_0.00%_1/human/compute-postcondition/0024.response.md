Output State: **`index` is 9 + n, `t` must be greater than 1, `n` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `p` is a list of `n` integers obtained by converting the substring of `data` from index `7 + n + n` to index `7 + 2*n`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`, `results` is a list with the element `result`, `n` is now the integer value of `data[index]`**

Explanation: The line `index += n` increments the value of `index` by `n`. The other variables (`t`, `p`, `result`, `results`, and the new value of `n`) remain unchanged. The updated value of `index` is `7 + n + n` (which simplifies to `7 + 2*n`) plus `n`, resulting in `9 + n`.
