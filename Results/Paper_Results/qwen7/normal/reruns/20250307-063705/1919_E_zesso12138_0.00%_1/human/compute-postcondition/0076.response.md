Output State: **`i` is 6; `dp` is equal to `new_dp` after updating based on the loop conditions; `new_dp` is a list of 0s with length 2 * n + 1.**

Explanation: The code initializes `new_dp` as a list of zeros with a length of `2 * n + 1`. Since `i` was initially 6 and no changes were made to it, its value remains the same. The value of `dp` remains unchanged and is still equal to `new_dp` after updating based on the loop conditions. The value of `new_dp` is explicitly set to a list of zeros with the specified length.
