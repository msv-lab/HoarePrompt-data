Output State: **`index` is 5 + `n`, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `p` is a list of `n` integers obtained by converting the substring of `data` from index 4 to index 4+n using `map(int)`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, and `results` is a list containing one element which is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`**.

Explanation: The code `results.append(result)` appends the value of `result` (which is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`) to the list `results`. Since `results` was initially an empty list, after appending `result`, `results` now contains one element, which is `result`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
