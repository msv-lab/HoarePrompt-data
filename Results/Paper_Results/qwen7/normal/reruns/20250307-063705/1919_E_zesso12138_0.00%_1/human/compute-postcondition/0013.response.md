Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for _ in range(t):`. The key variables here are `t`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `index` is 5 + `n`.
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `n` is the integer value of `data[2]`.
   - `p` is a list of `n` integers obtained by converting the substring of `data` from index 4 to index 4+n using `map(int)`.
   - `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.
   - `results` is a list containing one element which is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `t` is greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop condition depends on `t`, and `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again, we need to ensure that `t` is decremented by 1 after each iteration.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `t` should be `t - 1`.

5. **Construct the new state**:
   - `index` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.
   - `t` is decremented by 1.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `p` remains the same.
   - `data` remains the same.
   - `results` remains the same.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`index` is 5 + `n`, `t` must be greater than 1, `n` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `p` is a list of `n` integers obtained by converting the substring of `data` from index 4 to index 4+n using `map(int)`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, and `results` is a list containing one element which is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`**.
