Output State: **All elements in `new_dp` are equal to 0, `i` is 2**

Explanation: The code initializes a new list `new_dp` with zeros, where the length of `new_dp` is `2 * n + 1`. Since the initial state of `dp` was such that all its elements were equal to `dp[n]` modulo `MOD`, and `i` was 2, these values remain unchanged except for the creation of `new_dp`. Therefore, all elements in `new_dp` are set to 0, and `i` remains 2.
