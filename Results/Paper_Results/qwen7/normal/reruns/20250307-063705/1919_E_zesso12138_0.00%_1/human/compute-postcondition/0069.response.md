Postcondition: `dp[0]` is greater than 0, `new_dp[1]` is updated to (`new_dp[1] + dp[0]) % MOD`, `j` is `j_last + 1`, `new_dp[j - 1]` is updated to (`new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`, `new_dp[j + 1]` is updated to (`new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`, and `new_dp[j_last]` is updated if `j_last + 1 - 1 >= 0`. If `j - 1` is non-negative, then `new_dp[j - 1]` is additionally updated as described.
