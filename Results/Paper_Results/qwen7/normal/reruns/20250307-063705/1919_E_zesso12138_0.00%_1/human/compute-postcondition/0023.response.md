Output State: **`index` is 7 + n + n, `t` must be greater than 1, `n` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `p` is a list of `n` integers obtained by converting the substring of `data` from index `7 + n + n` to index `7 + 2*n`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`, `results` is a list with the element `result`, `n` is now the integer value of `data[index]`**.

Explanation: The code `p = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))` changes the value of `p` by converting the substring of `data` from `index` to `index + n` into a list of integers. The value of `index` remains `7 + n + n`. The value of `n` changes to the integer value of `data[index]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
