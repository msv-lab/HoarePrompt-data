Output State: **`index` is 6 + `n` + `n`, `t` must be greater than 1, `n` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `p` is a list of `n` integers obtained by converting the substring of `data` from index 4 to index 4+n using `map(int)`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`**.

Explanation: The code `result = func_1(n, p)` calls the function `func_1` with arguments `n` and `p`. The function call does not provide any specific return value or modify any other variables outside of `result`, so the only change is that `result` now holds the return value of `func_1(n, p)`. All other variables retain their previous states as described in the initial state.
