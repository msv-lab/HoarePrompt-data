You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, n is a positive integer representing the size of the hidden array a, and p is a list of n integers representing the sorted prefix sums of a. Each |p_i| ≤ n and p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ ... ≤ p_n.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        p = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        
        index += n
        
        result = func_1(n, p)
        
        results.append(result)
        
    #State: Output State: `index` is `9 + 3*n`, `t` must be equal to 3, `n` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `p` is a list of `n` integers obtained by converting the substring of `data` from index `7 + 2*n` to index `7 + 3*n`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`, `results` is a list with the elements `result`, `result`, and `result`.
    #
    #This means after the loop has executed all its iterations (in this case, 3 times), the `index` will be at the position `9 + 3*n` in the `data` list. The variable `t` will be set to 3 since the loop runs exactly 3 times. The variable `n` remains as the integer value of `data[2]`. The list `p` is updated to contain the integers from the substring of `data` starting at index `7 + 2*n` and ending at `7 + 3*n`. The variable `result` holds the return value of `func_1(n, p)` for the last iteration, and it is appended to the `results` list, making `results` a list with three identical elements, each being the return value of `func_1(n, p)`.
    for res in results:
        print(res)
        
    #State: `res` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)` from the last iteration, and `results` is a list containing three identical elements, each being the return value of `func_1(n, p)` from the last iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: t (a positive integer representing the number of test cases), n (a positive integer representing the size of the hidden array a), and p (a list of n integers representing the sorted prefix sums of a). The function returns a specific value based on the conditions provided.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
