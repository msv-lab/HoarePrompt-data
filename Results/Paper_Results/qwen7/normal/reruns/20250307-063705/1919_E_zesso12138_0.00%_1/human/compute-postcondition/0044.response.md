Output State: **`new_dp[j + 1]` is updated to (`new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]`) % MOD, and all other variables retain their values from the precondition, and the condition `j + 1 <= 2 * n` is still true.**

This means that the value of `new_dp[j + 1]` is now the sum of its original value and the value of `dp[j]`, modulo `MOD`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state, and the condition `j + 1 <= 2 * n` continues to hold true.
