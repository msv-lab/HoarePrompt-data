### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the number of ways to construct an array `a` of size `n` consisting of only 1 and -1 such that the sorted prefix sums match the given `p`.
   - The function uses dynamic programming to achieve this. It initializes a DP array `dp` where `dp[j]` represents the number of ways to achieve a prefix sum of `j - offset` (where `offset` is `n`).
   - The function iterates `n` times, updating the `dp` array based on the previous state. Each iteration doubles the contributions to adjacent positions in `dp`, effectively calculating the number of ways to achieve each prefix sum.
   - Finally, it returns `dp[final_sum]`, where `final_sum` is `p[-1] + offset`.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_2` processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases (`t`), the size of the hidden array (`n`), and the sorted prefix sums (`p`) for each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1` to compute the result and stores these results in a list `results`.
   - After processing all test cases, it prints the results.

3. **Problem Description and Constraints:**
   - The problem requires counting the number of initial arrays `a` such that the sorted prefix sums match the given `p`.
   - The solution provided correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to solve this problem.
   - The constraints are handled appropriately, and the results are printed modulo `998244353`.

4. **Execution States:**
   - The provided execution states in the comments accurately describe the state transitions within the functions.
   - The final output matches the expected results given in the examples.
