Output State: **`i` is 6, `new_dp` is a list of 0s with length 2 * n + 1, `j` is 1, and `new_dp[1]` is updated to `(new_dp[1] + dp[0]) % MOD`**.

Explanation:
- Initially, `j` is 0.
- The code updates `new_dp[j - 1]` which is `new_dp[0]` to `(new_dp[0] + dp[0]) % MOD`.
- After this update, `j` is incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 1.
- The precondition that `j + 1` is less than or equal to 2 * n remains valid.
- Therefore, the final state is `i` is 6, `new_dp` is a list of 0s with length 2 * n + 1, `j` is 1, and `new_dp[1]` is updated to `(new_dp[1] + dp[0]) % MOD`.
