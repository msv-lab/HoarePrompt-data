Output State: **`index` is 7 + n + n, `t` must be greater than 1, `n` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `p` is a list of `n` integers obtained by converting the substring of `data` from index 4 to index 4+n using `map(int)`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`, `results` is a list with the element `result`, `n` is now the integer value of `data[index]`**

Explanation: The code `index += 1` increments the value of `index` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the new value of `index` is updated to `7 + n + n`, while all other variables retain their previous states.
