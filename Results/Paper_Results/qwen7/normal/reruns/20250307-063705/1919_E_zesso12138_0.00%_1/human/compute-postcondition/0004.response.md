Output State: **`index` is 2, `t` is an integer obtained from `int(data[0])`, `n` is a positive integer representing the size of the hidden array `a`, `p` is a list of `n` integers representing the sorted prefix sums of `a`, each |`p_i`| ≤ `n` and `p_1` ≤ `p_2` ≤ ... ≤ `p_n`, and `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.**

Explanation: The value of `index` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The values of `t`, `n`, `p`, and `data` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet.
