Output State: **`i` is 6, `new_dp` is a list of 0s with length 2 * n + 1, `j` is 0, `new_dp[j + 1]` is `(new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `new_dp[j + 1]` by adding the value of `dp[j]` to it and then taking the modulo with `MOD`. Since `j` is 0, `new_dp[j + 1]` is equivalent to `new_dp[1]`. The initial value of `new_dp[1]` is 0, and `dp[j]` is greater than 0. Therefore, `new_dp[1]` is updated to `(0 + dp[0]) % MOD`. All other variables remain unchanged.
