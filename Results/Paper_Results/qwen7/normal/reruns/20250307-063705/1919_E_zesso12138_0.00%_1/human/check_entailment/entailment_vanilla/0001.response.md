Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to determine how many initial arrays `a` of size `n` (consisting of only 1 and -1) can produce a given sorted prefix sum array `p`.
   - The prefix sum array `p` is derived from `a`, and after sorting, it matches the given `p`.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - Each element in `p` represents the cumulative sum of the elements in `a` up to that point.
   - After sorting, the smallest value in `p` must be 0 because the prefix sums of an array of 1s and -1s will always include 0 at some point.
   - The difference between consecutive elements in `p` indicates the number of 1s and -1s added cumulatively.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function uses dynamic programming to count the number of ways to construct the original array `a` from the given sorted prefix sum `p`.
   - It initializes a DP array `dp` where `dp[j]` represents the number of ways to achieve a prefix sum `j - n`.
   - The function iterates through the elements of `p` and updates the DP array accordingly.

4. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the input and processes each test case using `func_1`.
   - It reads the number of test cases, the size of the array `n`, and the sorted prefix sum array `p`.
   - It then calls `func_1` for each test case and prints the result.

### Detailed Analysis

1. **Initialization and Base Case**:
   - `dp` is initialized with `dp[n] = 1`, indicating one way to have a prefix sum of 0 at the start.
   - The loop updates the DP array based on the current and previous values, considering the addition of 1 or -1.

2. **DP Transition**:
   - The transition `new_dp[j + 1] = (new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD` and `new_dp[j - 1] = (new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD` ensures that the number of ways to reach each prefix sum is updated correctly.
   - The final sum `final_sum = p[-1] + offset` is used to get the number of ways to achieve the last prefix sum in the sorted array.

3. **Input Reading and Processing**:
   - The input reading and processing logic in `func_2` is correct and handles multiple test cases efficiently.

### Verification

To verify the correctness, let's consider the examples provided in the problem statement:

- For `n = 1` and `p = [0]`, the only possible array `a` is `[1]`. The function should return 0.
- For `n = 1` and `p = [1]`, the only possible array `a` is `[-1]`. The function should return 1.
- For `n = 3` and `p = [-1, 1, 2]`, there is no valid array `a`. The function should return 0.
- For `n = 5` and `p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1]`, there are three valid arrays `a`: `[1, -1, 1, -1, -1]`, `[1, -1, -1, 1, 1]`, and `[-1, 1, 1, -1, 1]`. The function should return 3.
- For `n = 5` and `p = [-4, -3, -3, -2, -1]`, the only possible array `a` is `[-1, -1, -1, -1, 1]`. The function should return 1.

Given the detailed analysis and the examples, the provided code seems to correctly implement the solution.

Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem.
