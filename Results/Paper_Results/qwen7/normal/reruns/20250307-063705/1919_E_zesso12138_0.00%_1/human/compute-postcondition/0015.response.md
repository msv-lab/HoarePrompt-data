Output State: **`index` is 6 + `n`, `t` must be greater than 1, `n` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `p` is a list of `n` integers obtained by converting the substring of `data` from index 4 to index 4+n using `map(int)`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, and `n` is updated to the integer value of `data[index]`.**

Explanation: The line `index += 1` increments the value of `index` by 1. Initially, `index` was `5 + n`. After executing the line, `index` becomes `6 + n`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
