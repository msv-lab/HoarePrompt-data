Output State: **`index` is 6 + `n` + `n`, `t` must be greater than 1, `n` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `p` is a list of `n` integers obtained by converting the substring of `data` from index 4 to index 4+n using `map(int)`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`, `results` is a list with the element `result`.**

Explanation: The line `results.append(result)` appends the value of `result` to the list `results`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged. The value of `index` is still `6 + n + n`, `t` is still greater than 1, `n` is still the integer value of `data[2]`, `p` is still a list of `n` integers obtained by converting the substring of `data` from index 4 to index 4+n using `map(int)`, and `result` is still the return value of `func_1(n, p)`.
