Output State: **`res` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)` from the last iteration, and `results` is a list containing three identical elements, each being the return value of `func_1(n, p)` from the last iteration.**

Natural Language Explanation: After the loop has completed all its iterations (3 times), the variable `res` will hold the return value of `func_1(n, p)` from the last iteration. Since the loop simply prints each element of the `results` list without modifying it, the `results` list will still contain three identical elements, each representing the return value of `func_1(n, p)` from the last iteration of the loop.
