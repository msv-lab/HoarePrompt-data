Output State: **`index` is 1, `t` is an integer obtained from `int(data[0])`, `n` is a positive integer representing the size of the hidden array `a`, `p` is a list of `n` integers representing the sorted prefix sums of `a`, each |`p_i`| ≤ `n` and `p_1` ≤ `p_2` ≤ ... ≤ `p_n`, and `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.**

Explanation: The code updates `t` by converting `data[index]` (which is the first element of `data`) to an integer using `int()`. The index is incremented by 1 to move to the next element in the `data` list. All other variables remain unchanged.
