Output State: **The program returns dp[final_sum], where final_sum is p[-1] + offset, and each element in dp is equal to \(2^n\) modulo MOD.**

This means the program returns the value at index `final_sum` in the list `dp`. The value of `final_sum` is calculated as `p[-1] + offset`, and each element in `dp` is defined as \(2^n\) modulo `MOD`.
