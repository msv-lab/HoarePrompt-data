Output State: **`dp[0]` is greater than 0, `new_dp[1]` is updated to (`new_dp[1] + dp[0]`) % MOD, and `new_dp[j - 1]` is updated to (`new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`.**

Explanation: The code updates `new_dp[j - 1]` to (`new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`. Given the initial conditions, `dp[0]` is greater than 0, `new_dp[1]` is updated to (`new_dp[1] + dp[0]`) % MOD, and now `new_dp[j - 1]` is further updated to (`new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`. The other conditions and values remain unchanged.
