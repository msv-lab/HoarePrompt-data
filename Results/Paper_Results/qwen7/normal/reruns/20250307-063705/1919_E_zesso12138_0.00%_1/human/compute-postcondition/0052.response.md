Postcondition: `dp[j]` is greater than 0, and if `j - 1` is greater than or equal to 0, then `new_dp[j - 1]` is updated to (`new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]`) % MOD. Similarly, if `j + 1` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, then `new_dp[j + 1]` is updated to (`new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]`) % MOD. All other variables retain their values from the precondition.
