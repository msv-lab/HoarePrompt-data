To determine what will be printed, we need more information about the function `func_1(n, p)` and how it calculates the return value `res`. Since the initial state does not provide any details about the function's implementation, we cannot determine the exact value of `res`.

Given the lack of specific information about `func_1(n, p)`, the best we can do is describe the situation in a general way.

Output: **res (where res is the return value of func_1(n, p))**
