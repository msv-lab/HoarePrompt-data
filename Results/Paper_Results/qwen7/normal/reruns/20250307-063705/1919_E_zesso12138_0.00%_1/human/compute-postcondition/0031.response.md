Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for res in results:`. This means the variable `res` is being iterated over from the `results` list.

2. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `res` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`.
   - We need to determine what `res` was at the end of the previous iteration.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**: For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another element in the `results` list to iterate over. Therefore, `res` must be an element of the `results` list.

4. **Adjust the State**:
   - Since `res` is the current value being iterated over, at the start of the next iteration, `res` will be the next element in the `results` list.
   - The `results` list itself does not change; it remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

Given this analysis, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

- `res` will be the next element in the `results` list.
- The `results` list remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`res` is the next element in the `results` list**.
