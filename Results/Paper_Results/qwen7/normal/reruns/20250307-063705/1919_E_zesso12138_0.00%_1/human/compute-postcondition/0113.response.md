Output State: **Each element in `dp` is equal to \(2^n\) modulo `MOD`; `final_sum` is `p[-1] + offset`**.

Explanation: The loop in the initial state propagates the value \(2^n\) modulo `MOD` to each element in the list `dp`. After the loop, the value of `final_sum` is calculated as the last element of the list `p` plus `offset`. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `final_sum` and the unchanged property of `dp`.
