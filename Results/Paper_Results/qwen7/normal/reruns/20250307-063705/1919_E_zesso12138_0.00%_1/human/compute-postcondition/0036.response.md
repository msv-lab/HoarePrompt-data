Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: t (a positive integer representing the number of test cases), n (a positive integer representing the size of the hidden array a), and p (a list of n integers representing the sorted prefix sums of a). The function returns a specific value based on the conditions provided.**

- If `t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer, and `p` is a list of `n` integers where each `|p_i| ≤ n` and `p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ ... ≤ p_n`, the function processes these inputs according to the given constraints and returns a specific value.
