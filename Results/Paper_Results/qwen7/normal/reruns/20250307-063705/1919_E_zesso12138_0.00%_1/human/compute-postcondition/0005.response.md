Output State: **`index` is 2, `t` is an integer obtained from `int(data[0])`, `n` is a positive integer representing the size of the hidden array `a`, `p` is a list of `n` integers representing the sorted prefix sums of `a`, each |`p_i`| ≤ `n` and `p_1` ≤ `p_2` ≤ ... ≤ `p_n`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, and `results` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `results`. No changes are made to the existing variables (`index`, `t`, `n`, `p`, `data`). Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
