Postcondition: `i` is 6, `new_dp` is a list of 0s with length 2 * n + 1, `j` is 0, and if `j + 1` is less than or equal to 2 * n, then `new_dp[j + 1]` is updated to `(new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`. Since the if condition `(j - 1 >= 0)` is true, `j` is incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 1, and `new_dp[j]` is updated to `(new_dp[j] + dp[j - 1]) % MOD`.
