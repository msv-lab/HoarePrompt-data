Let's break down the task step by step:

1. Identify the variables in the loop head:
   - The loop iterates over the `results` list using the variable `res`.

2. Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration:
   - `res` is the next element in the `results` list.

3. Understand what needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time:
   - For the loop to continue, `res` should be set to the next element in the `results` list.

4. Formulate the new state:
   - `res` will now be the next element in the `results` list.

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`res` is the next element in the `results` list**
