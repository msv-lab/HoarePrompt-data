Output State: **`index` is 4, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `p` is a list of `n` integers representing the sorted prefix sums of `a`, each |`p_i`| ≤ `n` and `p_1` ≤ `p_2` ≤ ... ≤ `p_n`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, and `results` is an empty list.**

The value of `index` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 3 to 4. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
