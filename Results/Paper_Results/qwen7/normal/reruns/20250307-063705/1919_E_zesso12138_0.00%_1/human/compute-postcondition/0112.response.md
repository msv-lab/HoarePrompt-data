Output State: The final state of `dp` will be such that each element in `dp` is equal to \(2^n\) modulo `MOD`. This is because the given loop essentially performs a convolution operation on the initial condition where `dp[n]` is 1, spreading out the value symmetrically across the list `dp`. After `n` iterations, every position in `dp` will have been incremented according to the rules defined in the loop, resulting in each element being equivalent to \(2^n\) modulo `MOD`.

This outcome can be derived from observing that each iteration doubles the contributions to adjacent positions in `dp`, and since the loop runs for exactly `n` iterations, it fully propagates the initial value of 1 at `dp[n]` to all positions, scaled by \(2^n\) modulo `MOD`.
