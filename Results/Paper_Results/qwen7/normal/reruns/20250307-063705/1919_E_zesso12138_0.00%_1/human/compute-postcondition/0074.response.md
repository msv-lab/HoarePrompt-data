Output State: **`i` is 5, `dp` is equal to `new_dp` after updating based on the loop conditions, all other variables retain their initial or last modified states.**

Explanation: The code `dp = new_dp` simply assigns the value of the `new_dp` array to the `dp` array. This means that after the loop completes, the `dp` array will reflect the updates made to the `new_dp` array during the loop. The value of `i` is explicitly stated to be 5 after all iterations of the loop. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or last modified states as no other assignments or changes are mentioned.
