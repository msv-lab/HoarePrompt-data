Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable here is `t`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `index` is `6 + n + n`
   - `t` must be greater than 1
   - `n` is the integer value of `data[2]`
   - `p` is a list of `n` integers obtained by converting the substring of `data` from index 4 to index 4+n using `map(int)`
   - `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`
   - `results` is a list with the element `result`

3. **Check the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `t` must be greater than 1.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: Since `t` is the only variable in the loop head, we need to ensure that `t` is still greater than 1 for the loop to continue. There is no information given about how `t` changes within the loop body, so we assume it remains the same unless modified inside the loop.

5. **Formulate the new state**: The state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `t` is still greater than 1, while all other variables remain unchanged.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`index` is 6 + n + n, `t` must be greater than 1, `n` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `p` is a list of `n` integers obtained by converting the substring of `data` from index 4 to index 4+n using `map(int)`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`, `results` is a list with the element `result`**.
