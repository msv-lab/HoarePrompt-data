Output State: **`index` is 5 + `n`, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `p` is a list of `n` integers obtained by converting the substring of `data` from index 4 to index 4+n using `map(int)`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, and `results` is an empty list, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`**.

In this case, the code `result = func_1(n, p)` assigns the return value of the function `func_1` with arguments `n` and `p` to the variable `result`. However, since the function `func_1` is not defined, we cannot determine the exact value of `result`. The other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state.
