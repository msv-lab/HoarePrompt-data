Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution attempts to solve the problem using dynamic programming, but it does not correctly model the problem. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not accurately simulate the process of generating prefix sums from an array of 1s and -1s and then sorting them.

Here's why the current implementation is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect DP Transition**: The transition logic in `func_1` does not correctly simulate the generation of prefix sums from an array of 1s and -1s. It assumes a uniform distribution of values around the center, which is not how the prefix sums would behave when generated from 1s and -1s.

2. **Offset Handling**: The offset handling in the DP array is not appropriate for the problem at hand. The offset should be used to track the position of the prefix sums relative to the center, but the current implementation does not handle this correctly.

3. **Final Sum Calculation**: The final sum calculation in `func_1` does not correctly reflect the relationship between the given sorted prefix sums and the possible original arrays.

To correctly solve this problem, one would need to use combinatorial methods to count the number of ways to generate the given sorted prefix sums from an array of 1s and -1s. This involves checking the feasibility of the given prefix sums and counting the valid configurations.

Given the complexity and the nature of the problem, a more accurate approach would involve:

- Checking if the given sorted prefix sums are feasible.
- Using combinatorial methods to count the number of valid arrays.

The provided solution does not address these requirements and thus is incorrect.
