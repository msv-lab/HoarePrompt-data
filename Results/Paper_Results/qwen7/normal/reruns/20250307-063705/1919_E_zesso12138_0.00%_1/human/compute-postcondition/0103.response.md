Output State: **`i` is 6, `new_dp` is a list of 0s with length 2 * n + 1, `j` is 7, `new_dp[8]` is updated to `(new_dp[8] + dp[7]) % MOD`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `new_dp[j - 1]` which is `new_dp[6]` to `(new_dp[6] + dp[7]) % MOD`. Given that `j` is 7, `j - 1` is 6. Since the initial state of `new_dp` is a list of 0s with length 2 * n + 1, `new_dp[6]` was initially 0. The value of `dp[7]` is not specified, so it remains as is. Therefore, `new_dp[8]` is updated to `(0 + dp[7]) % MOD`, which simplifies to `(dp[7]) % MOD`. All other variables and their states remain unchanged.
