Output State: `index` is `9 + 3*n`, `t` must be equal to 3, `n` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `p` is a list of `n` integers obtained by converting the substring of `data` from index `7 + 2*n` to index `7 + 3*n`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`, `results` is a list with the elements `result`, `result`, and `result`.

This means after the loop has executed all its iterations (in this case, 3 times), the `index` will be at the position `9 + 3*n` in the `data` list. The variable `t` will be set to 3 since the loop runs exactly 3 times. The variable `n` remains as the integer value of `data[2]`. The list `p` is updated to contain the integers from the substring of `data` starting at index `7 + 2*n` and ending at `7 + 3*n`. The variable `result` holds the return value of `func_1(n, p)` for the last iteration, and it is appended to the `results` list, making `results` a list with three identical elements, each being the return value of `func_1(n, p)`.
