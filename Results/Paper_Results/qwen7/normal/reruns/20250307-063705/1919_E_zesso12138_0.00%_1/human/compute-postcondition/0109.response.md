Output State: The value of `i` remains 6, and `new_dp` is a list of 0s with a length of 2 * n + 1. After all iterations of the loop, for each valid index `j` (where `dp[j] > 0`), `new_dp[j + 1]` and `new_dp[j - 1]` are updated to `(new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD` and `(new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD` respectively, provided that the corresponding indices do not go out of bounds.

This means that after the loop completes, `new_dp` will have accumulated the contributions from `dp` at each step, adjusted by the modulo operation, for all valid indices within the range `[0, 2*n]`.
