Output State: **`index` is 6 + n + n, `t` must be greater than 1, `n` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `p` is a list of `n` integers obtained by converting the substring of `data` from index 4 to index 4+n using `map(int)`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`, `results` is a list with the element `result`, `n` is now the integer value of `data[index]`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `n` to be the integer value of `data[index]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state. Since `index` is initially defined as `6 + n + n`, the value of `index` does not change because `n` is reassigned within the same line. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `n` while keeping the rest of the variables as they were initially described.
