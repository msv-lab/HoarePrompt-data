Output State: **`i` is 6, `new_dp` is a list of 0s with length 2 * n + 1, `new_dp[j + 1]` is updated to `(new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `new_dp[j + 1]` by adding `dp[j]` to its current value and then taking the modulus with `MOD`. The values of `i` and the rest of the elements in `new_dp` remain unchanged.
