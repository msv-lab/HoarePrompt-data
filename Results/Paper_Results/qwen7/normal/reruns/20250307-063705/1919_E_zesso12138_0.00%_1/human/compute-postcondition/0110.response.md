Output State: **`i` remains 6, `new_dp` is now equal to `dp` after updating its values based on the conditions provided, and `dp` is now equal to `new_dp`.**

Explanation: The code `dp = new_dp` simply assigns the current state of `new_dp` to `dp`. Since the operations inside the loop have already updated `new_dp` according to the given rules, `dp` now holds these updated values. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 6.
