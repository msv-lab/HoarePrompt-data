Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given States Before the Loop Starts:
- `index` is `9 + 3*n`
- `t` must be equal to 3
- `n` is the integer value of `data[2]`
- `p` is a list of `n` integers obtained by converting the substring of `data` from index `7 + 2*n` to index `7 + 3*n`
- `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`
- `results` is a list with the elements `result`, `result`, and `result`

### Loop Head:
```
for res in results:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over the `results` list.
   - The variable `res` is used to represent each element in the `results` list during each iteration.

2. **States to Adjust:**
   - Since the loop is iterating over `results`, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the state of `res` within each iteration.
   - Initially, `results` contains three identical elements, each being the return value of `func_1(n, p)`.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute, the state of `res` must be one of the elements in the `results` list. Since `results` is a list with three identical elements, `res` will take on the value of `result` in each iteration.

### Final State Adjustment:
- `res` will take on the value of `result` in each iteration of the loop.

### Final Answer:
State: **`res` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`**

This means that in each iteration of the loop, `res` will hold the value of `result`, which is the return value of `func_1(n, p)` from the last iteration.
