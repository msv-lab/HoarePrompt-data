Output State: **`index` is 5, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `p` is a list of `n` integers obtained by converting the substring of `data` from index 4 to index 4+n using `map(int)`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, and `results` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code `p = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))` creates a new list `p` by converting the elements in the slice of `data` from `index` to `index + n` (which is `data[4:4+n]`) into integers using `map(int)`. After this operation, `index` is updated to `index + n`, which is `5` in this case. All other variables remain unchanged.
