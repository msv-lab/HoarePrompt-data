Output State: **`dp[j]` is greater than 0, `new_dp[j - 1]` is updated to (`new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]`) % MOD, `new_dp[j + 1]` is updated to (`new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]`) % MOD if `j + 1 <= 2 * n`, and `j - 1` is greater than or equal to 0.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `new_dp[j - 1]` to (`new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`. This means that the value of `new_dp[j - 1]` is now the old value of `new_dp[j - 1]` plus `dp[j]`, modulo `MOD`. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged from the initial state.
