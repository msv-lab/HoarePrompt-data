Output State: **`index` is 9 + n, `t` must be greater than 1, `n` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `p` is a list of `n` integers obtained by converting the substring of `data` from index `7 + n + n` to index `7 + 2*n`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`, `results` is a list with the elements `result` and `result`, `n` is now the integer value of `data[index]`**

Explanation: 
- The line `results.append(result)` appends the value of `result` to the list `results`. Since `results` was initially a list containing one element `result`, after appending `result` again, `results` now contains two elements, both of which are `result`.
- The values of `index`, `t`, `p`, and `n` remain unchanged because the code does not modify these variables.
- The value of `n` is updated to the integer value of `data[index]`, where `index` is `9 + n`.
