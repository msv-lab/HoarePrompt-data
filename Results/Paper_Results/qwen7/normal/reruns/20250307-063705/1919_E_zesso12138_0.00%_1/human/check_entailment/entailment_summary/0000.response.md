Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function is designed to simulate the process of generating prefix sums from an array of 1s and -1s and checking if the resulting sorted prefix sums match the given `p`.
   - It uses dynamic programming to count the number of ways to generate the prefix sums.
   - The function correctly initializes a DP array and updates it based on the rules of adding 1 or -1 to the prefix sum.
   - The final step of calculating `final_sum` and returning the value from the DP array is also correct.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function handles multiple test cases efficiently by reading all inputs at once and processing them.
   - It correctly extracts the necessary information for each test case (size of the array and the sorted prefix sums).
   - It calls `func_1` for each test case and collects the results.
   - It prints the results in the correct format.

3. **Overall Program Correctness**:
   - The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described in the problem statement.
   - The dynamic programming approach in `func_1` is appropriate for counting the number of valid arrays.
   - The input handling in `func_2` is efficient and correctly processes each test case.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
