Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n + 1`. This means `i` starts at `1` and increments by `1` until it reaches `n + 1`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - All elements in `dp` are equal to `dp[n]` modulo `MOD`.

4. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at `1` and increments by `1`, at the start of the first iteration, `i` is `1`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n + 1`.
   - Therefore, `i` will be `2` at the start of the next iteration.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - The value of `dp[n]` modulo `MOD` remains unchanged because the loop body is omitted and no modifications are made to `dp` in this context.
   - The only variable that changes is `i`, which will be `2` at the start of the next iteration.

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **All elements in `dp` are equal to `dp[n]` modulo `MOD`, `i` is 2**
