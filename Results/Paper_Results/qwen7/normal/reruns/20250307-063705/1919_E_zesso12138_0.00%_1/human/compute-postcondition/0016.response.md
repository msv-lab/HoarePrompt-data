Output State: **`index` is 6 + `n`, `t` must be greater than 1, `n` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `p` is a list of `n` integers obtained by converting the substring of `data` from index 4 to index 4+n using `map(int)`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, and `n` is updated to the integer value of `data[index]` and `p` is reassigned as a list of integers obtained by converting the substring of `data` from index `index` to index `index + n` using `map(int)`**.

Explanation: The code reassigns `p` as a list of integers obtained by converting the substring of `data` from index `index` to index `index + n` using `map(int)`. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `n` is updated to the integer value of `data[index]`, the new value of `p` is derived from this updated `n`.
