Output State: `index` is `9 + 2*n`, `t` is equal to 3, `n` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `p` is a list of `n` integers obtained by converting the substring of `data` from index `7 + 2*n` to index `7 + 3*n`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`, `results` is a list with the elements `result`, `result`, and `result`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations (which is 3 times in this case), the `index` variable will be at `9 + 2*n`, `t` will be 3, `n` will still hold the value it had initially (the integer value of `data[2]`), `p` will be updated to the new list of integers obtained from the substring of `data` starting from index `7 + 2*n` and ending just before the next element in `data`, `result` will contain the return value of `func_1(n, p)` for the last iteration, and `results` will be a list containing three elements, all of which are `result`.
