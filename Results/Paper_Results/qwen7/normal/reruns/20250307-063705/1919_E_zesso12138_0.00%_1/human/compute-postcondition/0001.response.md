Output State: **`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is a positive integer representing the size of the hidden array `a`, `p` is a list of `n` integers representing the sorted prefix sums of `a`, each |`p_i`| ≤ `n` and `p_1` ≤ `p_2` ≤ ... ≤ `p_n`, and `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of input using `input().split()`, which splits the input into a list of strings. This list is assigned to the variable `data`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `p` remain unchanged from their initial states.
