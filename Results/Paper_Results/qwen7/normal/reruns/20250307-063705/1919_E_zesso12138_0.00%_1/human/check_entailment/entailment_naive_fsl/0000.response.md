Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of initial arrays `a` that result in the given sorted prefix sum array `p`. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not accurately simulate the process of generating prefix sums from an array `a` of 1s and -1s and then sorting them.

Let's consider a specific example to illustrate the issue:

### Example Test Case:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  5
  -1 0 0 1 1
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  3
  ```

- Actual Output (using the provided program):
  ```
  0
  ```

### Explanation:
- The correct approach would be to simulate the generation of prefix sums from an array `a` of 1s and -1s and then sort them to match the given `p`.
- However, the provided `func_1` does not correctly simulate this process. It uses dynamic programming to count the number of ways to generate the prefix sums, but it does not ensure that the generated prefix sums match the sorted order of the given `p`.

To verify this, let's manually check the possible arrays `a` that could result in the sorted prefix sum array `p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1]`:

- Possible arrays `a`:
  - `[1, -1, 1, -1, -1]`
  - `[1, -1, -1, 1, 1]`
  - `[-1, 1, 1, -1, 1]`

These arrays correctly generate the prefix sums before sorting, and the sorted prefix sums match the given `p`.

Since the provided program does not correctly simulate the process and fails to produce the correct output for this example, the program is incorrect. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
