### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to determine the number of initial arrays `a` (consisting of only 1 and -1) that produce a given sorted prefix sum array `p`.
   - The function `func_1` aims to compute the number of such arrays using dynamic programming.
   - The function `func_2` reads the input and processes each test case using `func_1`.

2. **Dynamic Programming Explanation**:
   - The dynamic programming approach in `func_1` uses a DP table `dp` where `dp[j]` represents the number of ways to achieve a prefix sum `j - offset` with elements from the array `a`.
   - The loop iterates through each element of the array `a`, updating the DP table by considering both adding 1 and subtracting 1 from the current prefix sum.
   - Finally, the result is obtained by looking up the value in the DP table corresponding to the last element of the sorted prefix sum array `p`.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function correctly initializes the DP table and updates it based on the logic described.
   - It handles the modulo operation correctly to ensure the result fits within the required constraints.
   - The final result is computed correctly by accessing the appropriate position in the DP table.

4. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
   - It calls `func_1` for each test case and collects the results.
   - The results are printed correctly, ensuring the output format matches the problem requirements.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The provided examples cover various edge cases, including arrays of different sizes and different sorted prefix sum arrays.
   - The code handles these cases correctly, as demonstrated by the examples.

6. **Overall Correctness**:
   - The code logic is sound and correctly implements the solution to the problem.
   - The implementation handles all specified constraints and edge cases.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct based on the provided problem description and examples.

**Correctness: True**
