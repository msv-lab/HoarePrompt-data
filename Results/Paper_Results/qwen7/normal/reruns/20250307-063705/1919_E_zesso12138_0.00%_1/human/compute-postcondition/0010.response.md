Output State: **`index` is 5 + `n`, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `p` is a list of `n` integers obtained by converting the substring of `data` from index 4 to index 4+n using `map(int)`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, and `results` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The value of `index` is updated by adding `n` to its current value, which is 5. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
