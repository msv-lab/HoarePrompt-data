Output State: **`i` is 6, `new_dp` is a list of 0s with length 2 * n + 1, `new_dp[j - 1]` is updated to `(new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `new_dp[j - 1]` to `(new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`. Since the initial state specifies that `new_dp` is a list of 0s with length `2 * n + 1`, and `i` is 6, these values remain unchanged. The only change is that `new_dp[j - 1]` is updated according to the given formula.
