You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a hidden array a of size n consisting of only 1 and -1 . Let p be the
prefix sums of array a . More formally, p is an array of length n defined as
p_i = a_1 + a_2 + \ldots + a_i . Afterwards, array p is sorted in non-
decreasing order. For example, if a = [1, -1, -1, 1, 1] , then p = [1, 0, -1,
0, 1] before sorting and p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] after sorting.

You are given the prefix sum array p after sorting, but you do not know what
array a is. Your task is to count the number of initial arrays a such that the
above process results in the given sorted prefix sum array p . As this number
can be large, you are only required to find it modulo 998\,244\,353 .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 5000
) — the size of the hidden array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n
(|p_i| \le n ) — the n prefix sums of a sorted in non-decreasing order.

It is guaranteed that p_1 \le p_2 \le \ldots \le p_n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5000 .

Output

For each test case, output the answer modulo 998\,244\,353 .

Note

In the first two test cases, the only possible arrays a for n = 1 are a = [1]
and a = [-1] . Their respective sorted prefix sum arrays p are p = [1] and p =
[-1] . Hence, there is no array a that can result in the sorted prefix sum
array p = [0] and there is exactly 1 array a that can result in the sorted
prefix sum array p = [1] .

In the third test case, it can be proven that there is no array a that could
result in the sorted prefix sum array p = [-1, 1, 2] .

In the fourth test case, the 3 possible arrays a that could result in the
sorted prefix sum array p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] are:

  * a = [1, -1, 1, -1, -1] . The prefix sum array before sorting is p = [1, 0, 1, 0, -1] , which after sorting gives p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] . 
  * a = [1, -1, -1, 1, 1] . The prefix sum array before sorting is p = [1, 0, -1, 0, 1] , which after sorting gives p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] . 
  * a = [-1, 1, 1, -1, 1] . The prefix sum array before sorting is p = [-1, 0, 1, 0, 1] , which after sorting gives p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] . 

For the fifth test case, the only possible array a that could result in the
sorted prefix sum array p = [-4, -3, -3, -2, -1] is a = [-1, -1, -1, -1, 1] .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, p):
    dp = [0] * (2 * n + 1)
    offset = n
    dp[offset] = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        new_dp = [0] * (2 * n + 1)
        for j in range(2 * n + 1):
            if dp[j] > 0:
                if j + 1 <= 2 * n:
                    new_dp[j + 1] = (new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD
                if j - 1 >= 0:
                    new_dp[j - 1] = (new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD
        dp = new_dp
    final_sum = p[-1] + offset
    return dp[final_sum]

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        p = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = func_1(n, p)
        results.append(result)
    for res in results:
        print(res)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the size of the hidden array and its sorted prefix sums from input, calls another function `func_1` to compute a result, and stores these results in a list. After processing all test cases, it prints the computed results for each case.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to determine how many initial arrays `a` of size `n` (consisting of only 1 and -1) can produce a given sorted prefix sum array `p`.
   - The prefix sum array `p` is derived from `a`, and after sorting, it matches the given `p`.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - Each element in `p` represents the cumulative sum of the elements in `a` up to that point.
   - After sorting, the smallest value in `p` must be 0 because the prefix sums of an array of 1s and -1s will always include 0 at some point.
   - The difference between consecutive elements in `p` indicates the number of 1s and -1s added cumulatively.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function uses dynamic programming to count the number of ways to construct the original array `a` from the given sorted prefix sum `p`.
   - It initializes a DP array `dp` where `dp[j]` represents the number of ways to achieve a prefix sum `j - n`.
   - The function iterates through the elements of `p` and updates the DP array accordingly.

4. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the input and processes each test case using `func_1`.
   - It reads the number of test cases, the size of the array `n`, and the sorted prefix sum array `p`.
   - It then calls `func_1` for each test case and prints the result.

### Detailed Analysis

1. **Initialization and Base Case**:
   - `dp` is initialized with `dp[n] = 1`, indicating one way to have a prefix sum of 0 at the start.
   - The loop updates the DP array based on the current and previous values, considering the addition of 1 or -1.

2. **DP Transition**:
   - The transition `new_dp[j + 1] = (new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD` and `new_dp[j - 1] = (new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD` ensures that the number of ways to reach each prefix sum is updated correctly.
   - The final sum `final_sum = p[-1] + offset` is used to get the number of ways to achieve the last prefix sum in the sorted array.

3. **Input Reading and Processing**:
   - The input reading and processing logic in `func_2` is correct and handles multiple test cases efficiently.

### Verification

To verify the correctness, let's consider the examples provided in the problem statement:

- For `n = 1` and `p = [0]`, the only possible array `a` is `[1]`. The function should return 0.
- For `n = 1` and `p = [1]`, the only possible array `a` is `[-1]`. The function should return 1.
- For `n = 3` and `p = [-1, 1, 2]`, there is no valid array `a`. The function should return 0.
- For `n = 5` and `p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1]`, there are three valid arrays `a`: `[1, -1, 1, -1, -1]`, `[1, -1, -1, 1, 1]`, and `[-1, 1, 1, -1, 1]`. The function should return 3.
- For `n = 5` and `p = [-4, -3, -3, -2, -1]`, the only possible array `a` is `[-1, -1, -1, -1, 1]`. The function should return 1.

Given the detailed analysis and the examples, the provided code seems to correctly implement the solution.

Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem.
