Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `list2` is an empty list, `list1` is a list of sorted strings obtained by splitting the input string `b`.**

Explanation: The code `list1.sort()` sorts the list `list1` in ascending order. Since `list1` originally contains strings obtained by splitting the input string `b`, after sorting, `list1` will contain these strings in alphabetical order. The values of `a` and `list2` remain unchanged.
