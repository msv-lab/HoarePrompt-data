Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `list2` is an empty list, `list1` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string `b`, `b` is an input string**.

Explanation: The code `list1 = b.split()` splits the input string `b` into a list of substrings based on whitespace (default delimiter) and assigns this list to `list1`. The initial states of `a`, `list2`, and `b` remain unchanged.
