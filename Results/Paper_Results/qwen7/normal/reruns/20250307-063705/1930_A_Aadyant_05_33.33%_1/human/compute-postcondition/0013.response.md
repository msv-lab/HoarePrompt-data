Output State: **`list2` contains the element from `list1` at index 6 appended to it, `list1` remains unchanged, `i` is 3**.

Explanation: The code appends the element from `list1` at index `2 * i` (which is `2 * 3` or index 6) to `list2`. Since `list1` remains unchanged and `i` is still 3, the updated state includes that `list2` now contains the element from `list1` at index 6, while `list1` and `i` retain their original values.
