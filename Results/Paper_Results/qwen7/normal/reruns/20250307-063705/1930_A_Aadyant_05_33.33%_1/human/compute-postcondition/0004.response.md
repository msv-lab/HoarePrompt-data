Output State: **`int(num)` must be at least 1; `list2` is an empty list; `list1` is an empty list**

Explanation: The code initializes `list1` as an empty list. The initial conditions for `int(num)` and `list2` remain unchanged. Therefore, `int(num)` must still be at least 1, `list2` is still an empty list, and now `list1` is also an empty list.
