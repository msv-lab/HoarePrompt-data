Output State: **`list2` contains the element from `list1` at index 2 * i appended to it, and `list1` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code appends an element from `list1` to `list2` at the index `2 * i`. However, since the initial values of `list1` and `list2` are not specified, we can only state that `list2` now contains the element from `list1` at index `2 * i` appended to it, and `list1` remains unchanged.
