Output State: **list1 remains unchanged, list2 contains the elements from list1 at indices 0 and 2, repeated for each iteration where 2*i is within the bounds of list1, and out is a list containing the sum of elements in list2 for each valid i.**

Explanation: The code appends the sum of elements in `list2` to the `out` list. `list2` is constructed by taking elements from `list1` at indices 0 and 2, repeated for each iteration where `2*i` is within the bounds of `list1`. Since no specific values or changes to `list1` or `list2` are given, they remain as described in the initial state. The `out` list is newly created and contains the sums of the specified elements from `list2`.
