Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the variable `a`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `a` is an input integer.
   - `i` is the loop counter, which starts at 0 by default.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `a`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0, it will enter the loop if `0 < a`, which simplifies to `a > 0`.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that `a` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

5. **Final state adjustment**: We need to adjust the state such that the loop can start executing. This means `a` must be greater than 0.

**State:**
**`a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
