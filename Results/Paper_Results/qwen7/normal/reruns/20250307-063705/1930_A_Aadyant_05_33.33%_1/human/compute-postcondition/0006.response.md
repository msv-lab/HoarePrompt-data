Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `list2` is an empty list, `list1` is an empty list**

The code `a = int(a)` converts the string `a` into an integer. However, since the initial state of `a` is given as a string (input string), after executing the code, `a` will be converted to an integer. The other variables (`list2` and `list1`) remain unchanged as they were initially empty lists.
