Output State: **`list1` remains unchanged, `list2` contains the element from `list1` at index 6 and an additional element which is the integer value of the element from `list1` at index 6, `i` is 3, `a` must be greater than 3**

Explanation: The code appends to `list2` the integer value of the element at index `2 * i` of `list1`. Given that `i` is 3, `2 * i` equals 6. Therefore, `list2` appends the integer value of the element at index 6 of `list1`. The other variables (`list1`, `i`, and `a`) remain unchanged.
