Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for numbers in range(int(num))`.
   - The variables involved in this loop head are `numbers` and `int(num)`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of These Variables:**
   - `numbers` is the variable that will iterate over the range.
   - `int(num)` defines the upper limit of the range.

3. **Understand the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute, `int(num)` must be at least 1 because the `range()` function generates numbers from 0 up to but not including the given number.
   - `numbers` will take on values starting from 0 up to `int(num) - 1`.

4. **Adjust the States Based on the Loop Head:**
   - Since `numbers` will start from 0, there is no need to adjust its initial value.
   - We need to ensure that `int(num)` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.

5. **Consider the Given State Before the Loop:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
   - `num` is an input string.
   - `out` is an empty list.

6. **Adjust the Relevant States:**
   - We need to ensure that `int(num)` is at least 1.
   - The values of `t`, `num`, and `out` do not directly affect the loop's execution condition, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`int(num)` must be at least 1**
