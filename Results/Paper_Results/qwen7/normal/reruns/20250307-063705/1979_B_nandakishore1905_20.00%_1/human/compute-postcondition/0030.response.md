Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user split by space, `m` is an integer input from the user split by space, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `l` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`**.

Explanation: The code calculates the absolute difference `k` between `n` and `m`, converts `k` to its binary representation `l`, and then assigns the length of `l` to `p`. The lengths of `n` and `m` remain unchanged, and `k` and `l` retain their respective values.
