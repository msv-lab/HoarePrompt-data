Postcondition: `n` is an integer input from the user split by space, `m` is an integer input from the user split by space, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. The value of `k` is not a power of 2, and either `n` is not equal to 0 or `m` is even. If `n` equals 0 and `m` is even, the program does not change `k`. Otherwise, `l` is the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`, and `q` is 2.
