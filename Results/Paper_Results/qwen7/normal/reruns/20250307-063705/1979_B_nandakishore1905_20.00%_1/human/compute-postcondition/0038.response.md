Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers input from the user split by space, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `i` is incremented by 1, `x` is the input for the next iteration**.

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers separated by a space from the user input and assigns them to `n` and `m`. It does not directly assign a value to `k`, `l`, `p`, or `q`. However, `k` is defined as the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, which will be calculated later in the program. The variable `i` is incremented by 1, and `x` is set to the input for the next iteration. All other variables remain in their initial state or are yet to be assigned values.
