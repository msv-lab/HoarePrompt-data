Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two distinct non-negative integers `n` and `m`. For each test case, it calculates the absolute difference `k` between `n` and `m`. Based on the value of `k`, it prints one of the following outputs:
- If `k` is a power of 2, it prints `k`.
- If `k` is not a power of 2 and `n` is 0 while `m` is odd, it prints `1`.
- If `k` is not a power of 2 and `n` is 0 while `m` is even, it prints `2`.
- Otherwise, it converts `k` to its binary representation, calculates the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`, and prints `k` minus that power of 2.
The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.**
