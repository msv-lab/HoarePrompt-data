Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user split by space, `m` is an integer input from the user split by space, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the absolute difference between `n` and `m` and assigns it to `k`. Since `n` and `m` are inputs from the user split by space, their values remain unchanged. The value of `k` is now the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.
