Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user split by space, `m` is an integer input from the user split by space, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `l` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix.**

Explanation: The code converts the absolute difference `k` between `n` and `m` into its binary representation using the `bin()` function and removes the '0b' prefix using the `replace()` method. The resulting binary string is stored in the variable `l`. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged, and `k` retains its original value as the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.
