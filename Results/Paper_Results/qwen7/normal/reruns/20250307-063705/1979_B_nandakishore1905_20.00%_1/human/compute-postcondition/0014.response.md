Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user split by space, `m` is an integer input from the user split by space, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `l` is a binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix.**

Explanation: The code `l = bin(k).replace('0b', '')` converts the integer `k` (which is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`) into its binary representation and removes the '0b' prefix. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged. The new variable `l` holds the binary string representation of `k`.
