Postcondition: `n` is an integer input from the user split by space, `m` is an integer input from the user split by space, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. The value of `k` is not a power of 2, and either `n` is not equal to 0, `m` is not an odd number, or if `n` equals 0 and `m` is an even number, the value of `k` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `l` is the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, and `p` is the length of `l`, with `q` being 2.
