Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is an integer input from the user split by space.
   - `m` is an integer input from the user split by space.
   - `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.
   - If `k` is a power of 2, then `k` remains unchanged.
   - Otherwise, if `n` is not equal to 0 or `m` is even, `l` is the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, and `p` is the length of `l`, with `q` being 2.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs for `int(input())` iterations.
   - Each iteration of the loop does not modify the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `l`, `p`, or `q`.

3. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since the loop condition is based on user input (`int(input())`), the number of iterations is determined before the loop starts.
   - The loop itself does not change the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `l`, `p`, or `q`.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration of the loop are the same as the initial states because the loop does not modify them.

**State at the start of the next iteration**:
- `n` is an integer input from the user split by space.
- `m` is an integer input from the user split by space.
- `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.
- If `k` is a power of 2, then `k` remains unchanged.
- Otherwise, if `n` is not equal to 0 or `m` is even, `l` is the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, and `p` is the length of `l`, with `q` being 2.

Therefore, the state remains the same as the initial state.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` is an integer input from the user split by space, `m` is an integer input from the user split by space, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. If `k` is a power of 2, then `k` remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `n` is not equal to 0 or `m` is even, `l` is the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, and `p` is the length of `l`, with `q` being 2.**
