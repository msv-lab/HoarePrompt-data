Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user split by space, `m` is an integer input from the user split by space**.

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input from the user, splits it into two parts based on spaces, and converts each part into integers. These integers are then assigned to `n` and `m`. The initial state's information about other variables remains unchanged, but now `n` and `m` hold the integer values from the user's input.
