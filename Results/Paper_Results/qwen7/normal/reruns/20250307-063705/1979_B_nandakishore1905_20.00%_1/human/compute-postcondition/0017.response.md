Let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is an integer input from the user, split by space. Let's assume `n` is an integer like `10`.
   - `m` is an integer input from the user, split by space. Let's assume `m` is an integer like `8`.
   - `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. So, `k = |10 - 8| = 2`.
   - `l` is a binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix. So, `l = '10'`.
   - `p` is the length of `l`. So, `p = len('10') = 2`.
   - `q` is 2.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(k - q)
   ```

Given the values:
- `k = 2`
- `q = 2`

The expression `k - q` evaluates to `2 - 2 = 0`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **0**
