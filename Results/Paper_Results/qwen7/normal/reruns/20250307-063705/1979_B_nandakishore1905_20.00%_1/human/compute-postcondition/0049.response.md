Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `i` is incremented by 1. If `k` is a power of 2 (i.e., `k & k - 1 == 0`), then `l` is the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`, and `q` is 2. Otherwise, `l`, `p`, and `q` retain their original values.**
