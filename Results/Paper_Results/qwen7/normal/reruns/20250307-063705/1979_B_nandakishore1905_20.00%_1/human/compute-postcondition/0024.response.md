Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user split by space, `m` is an integer input from the user split by space, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, and `n, m` are converted to integers.**

The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated inputs from the user and converts them to integers, assigning them to `n` and `m` respectively. The variable `k` is defined based on the initial state but its value is not updated by this line of code. Therefore, the output state includes the new types and values of `n` and `m`, while `k` retains its initial definition.
