Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is an integer input from the user split by space.
- `m` is an integer input from the user split by space.
- `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.

The `print(2)` statement simply prints the integer `2` regardless of the values of `n` and `m`.
