Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user split by space, `m` is an integer input from the user split by space, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `l` is a binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the absolute difference between `n` and `m` to get `k`, then converts `k` to its binary representation and removes the '0b' prefix to get `l`. Finally, `p` is assigned the length of `l`. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `l` remain unchanged except that `p` is now the length of `l`.
