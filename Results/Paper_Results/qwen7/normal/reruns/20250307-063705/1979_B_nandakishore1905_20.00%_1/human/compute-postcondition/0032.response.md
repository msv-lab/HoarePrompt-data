Let's break down the initial state and the operations step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is an integer input from the user, split by space. This means `n` is a single integer.
   - `m` is an integer input from the user, split by space. Similarly, `m` is a single integer.
   - `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. So, `k = |n - m|`.
   - `l` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix. For example, if `k = 5`, then `l = "101"`.
   - `p` is the length of `l`. So, `p` is the number of digits in the binary representation of `k`. For example, if `k = 5`, then `l = "101"` and `p = 3`.
   - `q` is 2.

2. **Expression to Evaluate**:
   - The expression to evaluate is `k - q`.

Given these steps, let's express the final output:

- `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.
- `q` is 2.
- Therefore, `k - q` simplifies to `k - 2`.

So, the print statement will output the value of `k - 2`.

Output: **k - 2 (where k is the absolute difference between n and m)**
