Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes multiple test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) and two distinct non-negative integers `x` and `y` (0 <= x, y <= 10^9). For each test case, it returns either "x < y", "x > y", or "x = y" based on the comparison of `x` and `y`.**

This means the function processes a series of test cases, each containing a value of `t`, and two other numbers `x` and `y`. It then compares `x` and `y` and returns whether `x` is less than, greater than, or equal to `y`.
