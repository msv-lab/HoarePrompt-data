Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `i` is incremented by 1, `l` is a binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix.**

Explanation: The code `l = bin(k).replace('0b', '')` converts the integer `k` (which is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`) into its binary representation and removes the '0b' prefix. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged, while a new variable `l` is created with the binary representation of `k`.
