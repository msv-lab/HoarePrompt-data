Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user split by space, `m` is an integer input from the user split by space, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `l` is a binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`, `q` is 2 ** (`p` - 1)**.

Explanation: The code calculates the absolute difference between `n` and `m` to get `k`. It then converts `k` to its binary representation and removes the '0b' prefix to get `l`. The length of `l` is stored in `p`. Finally, `q` is assigned the value of `2 ** (p - 1)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
