You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, x and y are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        k = abs(n - m)
        
        if k & k - 1 == 0:
            print(k)
        elif n == 0 and m % 2 != 0:
            print(1)
        elif n == 0 and m % 2 == 0:
            print(2)
        else:
            l = bin(k).replace('0b', '')
            p = len(l)
            q = 2 ** (p - 1)
            print(k - q)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will continue to iterate based on the number of test cases provided as input. For each iteration, the values of `n` and `m` will be read as integers from the user, separated by a space. `k` will be calculated as the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. The output will depend on the value of `k`:
    #
    #- If `k` is a power of 2 (i.e., `k & k - 1 == 0`), the output will be `k`.
    #- If `k` is not a power of 2 and `n` is 0 while `m` is odd, the output will be `1`.
    #- If `k` is not a power of 2 and `n` is 0 while `m` is even, the output will be `2`.
    #- Otherwise, `l` will be the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `p` will be the length of `l`, and `q` will be `2 ** (p - 1)`. The output will be `k - q`.
    #
    #After all iterations of the loop have finished, the output state will include the final values of `n`, `m`, and `k` for each test case, along with the corresponding output printed for each iteration. The variable `i` will be incremented for each iteration but will not affect the final output state.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes multiple test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) and two distinct non-negative integers `x` and `y` (0 <= x, y <= 10^9). For each test case, it returns either "x < y", "x > y", or "x = y" based on the comparison of `x` and `y`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
