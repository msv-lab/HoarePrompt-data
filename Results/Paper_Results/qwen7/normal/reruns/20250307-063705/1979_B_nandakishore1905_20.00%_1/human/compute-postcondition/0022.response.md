Postcondition: **`n` is an integer input from the user split by space, `m` is an integer input from the user split by space, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. If `k` is a power of 2, then `k` remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `n` is not equal to 0 or `m` is even, `l` is the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, and `p` is the length of `l`, with `q` being 2.**
