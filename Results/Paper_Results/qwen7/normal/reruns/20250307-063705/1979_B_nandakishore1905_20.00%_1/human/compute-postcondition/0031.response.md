Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user split by space, `m` is an integer input from the user split by space, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `l` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`, `q` is 2 ** (p - 1)**.

Explanation: The code calculates the absolute difference `k` between `n` and `m`, then finds the binary representation `l` of `k` (without the '0b' prefix), and determines the length `p` of `l`. After that, `q` is assigned the value of `2 ** (p - 1)`. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `l`, and `p` remain unchanged from their previous states. The new variable `q` is introduced with the calculated value.
