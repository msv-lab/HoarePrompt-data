Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is an input integer.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.
- `i` is incremented by 1 (though `i` is not used in the print statement).

The print statement is `print(k)`, which will print the value of `k`.

Since `k` is defined as the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, the value of `k` will be the result of `abs(n - m)`.

Output: **abs(n - m)**
