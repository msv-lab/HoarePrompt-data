Output: **2**

Explanation: The initial state provides information about the variables `n` and `m`, but the `print` statement itself does not depend on these variables. It simply prints the number 2. The variables `k` and `i` are mentioned, but they are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is simply the number 2.
