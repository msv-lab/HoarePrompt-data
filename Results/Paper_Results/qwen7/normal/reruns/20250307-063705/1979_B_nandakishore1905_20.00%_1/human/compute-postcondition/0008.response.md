Output: **1**

Explanation: The initial state indicates that `n` is set to 0 and `m` is an odd number. The value of `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, but this value is not a power of 2. However, the print statement simply outputs the integer `1`, regardless of the values of `n` and `m`. Therefore, the output is **1**.
