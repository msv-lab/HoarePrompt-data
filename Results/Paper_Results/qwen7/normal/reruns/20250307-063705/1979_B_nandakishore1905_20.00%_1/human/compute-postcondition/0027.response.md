Output: **1**

Explanation: The initial state does not provide any specific values for `n` and `m`. It only states that `n` and `m` are integers input from the user split by space, and `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. The `print(1)` statement simply outputs the integer 1, regardless of the values of `n` and `m`. Therefore, the output is **1**.
