Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `i` is incremented by 1**.

Explanation: The code calculates the absolute difference between `n` and `m` and assigns it to `k`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` remain as they are, but `i` is now one more than its previous value.
