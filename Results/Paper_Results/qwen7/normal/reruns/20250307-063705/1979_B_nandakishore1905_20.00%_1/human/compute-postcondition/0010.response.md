Postcondition: `n` is an integer input from the user split by space, `m` is an integer input from the user split by space, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. The value of `k` is not a power of 2, and either `n` is not equal to 0 or `m` is even. Additionally, `n` equals 0 and `m` is even.
