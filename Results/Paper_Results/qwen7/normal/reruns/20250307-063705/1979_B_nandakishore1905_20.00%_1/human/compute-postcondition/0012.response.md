Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is an integer input from the user split by space. According to the precondition, `n` equals 0.
- `m` is an integer input from the user split by space. According to the precondition, `m` is even.
- `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. Since `n` is 0 and `m` is even, `k` is simply the absolute value of `m`.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
print(2)
```

This code directly prints the integer `2`.

Output: **2**
