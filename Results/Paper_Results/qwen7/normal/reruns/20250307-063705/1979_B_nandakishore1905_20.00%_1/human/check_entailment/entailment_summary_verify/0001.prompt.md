You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two distinct non-negative integers x and y . Consider two
infinite sequences a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots and b_1, b_2, b_3, \ldots , where

  * a_n = n \oplus x ; 
  * b_n = n \oplus y . 

Here, x \oplus y denotes the [bitwise
XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) operation of
integers x and y .

For example, with x = 6 , the first 8 elements of sequence a will look as
follows: [7, 4, 5, 2, 3, 0, 1, 14, \ldots] . Note that the indices of elements
start with 1 .

Your task is to find the length of the longest common subsegment^\dagger of
sequences a and b . In other words, find the maximum integer m such that a_i =
b_j, a_{i + 1} = b_{j + 1}, \ldots, a_{i + m - 1} = b_{j + m - 1} for some i,
j \ge 1 .

^\dagger A subsegment of sequence p is a sequence p_l,p_{l+1},\ldots,p_r ,
where 1 \le l \le r .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0 \le x, y \le
10^9, x \neq y ) — the parameters of the sequences.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the length of the longest common
subsegment.

Example

Input

    4
    
    0 1
    
    12 4
    
    57 37
    
    316560849 14570961

Output

    1
    8
    4
    33554432
    
Note

In the first test case, the first 7 elements of sequences a and b are as
follows:

a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,\ldots]

b = [0, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6,\ldots]

It can be shown that there isn't a positive integer k such that the sequence
[k, k + 1] occurs in b as a subsegment. So the answer is 1 .

In the third test case, the first 20 elements of sequences a and b are as
follows:

a = [56, 59, 58, 61, 60, 63, 62, 49, 48, 51, 50, 53, 52, 55, 54, \textbf{41,
40, 43, 42}, 45, \ldots]

b = [36, 39, 38, 33, 32, 35, 34, 45, 44, 47, 46, \textbf{41, 40, 43, 42}, 53,
52, 55, 54, 49, \ldots]

It can be shown that one of the longest common subsegments is the subsegment
[41, 40, 43, 42] with a length of 4 .

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        k = abs(n - m)
        if k & k - 1 == 0:
            print(k)
        elif n == 0 and m % 2 != 0:
            print(1)
        elif n == 0 and m % 2 == 0:
            print(2)
        else:
            l = bin(k).replace('0b', '')
            p = len(l)
            q = 2 ** (p - 1)
            print(k - q)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two distinct non-negative integers `n` and `m`. For each test case, it calculates the absolute difference `k` between `n` and `m`. Based on the value of `k`, it prints one of the following outputs:
- If `k` is a power of 2, it prints `k`.
- If `k` is not a power of 2 and `n` is 0 while `m` is odd, it prints `1`.
- If `k` is not a power of 2 and `n` is 0 while `m` is even, it prints `2`.
- Otherwise, it converts `k` to its binary representation, calculates the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`, and prints `k` minus that power of 2.
The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the length of the longest common subsegment between two sequences \(a\) and \(b\), where \(a_n = n \oplus x\) and \(b_n = n \oplus y\).

2. **Key Insight**: The key insight here is that the length of the longest common subsegment depends on the binary representation of the difference \(k = |x - y|\). Specifically, the length of the longest common subsegment is related to the highest power of 2 that divides \(k\).

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it calculates \(k = |x - y|\).
   - It checks if \(k\) is a power of 2 using the condition `k & k - 1 == 0`. If true, it prints \(k\).
   - If not, it further checks specific conditions involving \(n\) and \(m\):
     - If \(n == 0\) and \(m\) is odd, it prints 1.
     - If \(n == 0\) and \(m\) is even, it prints 2.
     - Otherwise, it converts \(k\) to its binary representation, counts the number of leading zeros, and calculates the length of the longest common subsegment accordingly.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic for checking if \(k\) is a power of 2 is correct.
   - The handling of specific conditions for \(n\) and \(m\) when \(n == 0\) is also correct.
   - However, the calculation of the length of the longest common subsegment using the binary representation and the power of 2 is incorrect. The program should directly calculate the highest power of 2 that divides \(k\) without converting to binary and counting leading zeros.

5. **Example Verification**:
   - For the example given in the problem, the program's output matches the expected results, but this does not guarantee correctness for all cases.

### Conclusion:
The program's logic for determining the length of the longest common subsegment is fundamentally flawed. While it correctly handles some edge cases, it incorrectly calculates the length for general cases. Therefore, the program is not fully correct.
