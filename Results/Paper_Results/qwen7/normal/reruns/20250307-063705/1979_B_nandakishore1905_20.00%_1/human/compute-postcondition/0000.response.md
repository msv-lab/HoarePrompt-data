Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as the value of `int(input())` is a positive integer. Given the initial state, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

3. **Adjust the States**: Since the loop depends on the input from `int(input())`, we need to ensure that the input is within the specified range. The initial state tells us that `t` is a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). Therefore, the input should match this condition.

Given these points, we need to ensure that the input matches the range of `t`.

**State:**
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- The input from `int(input())` must be within the same range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

Since the loop will execute as long as the input is valid, we need to ensure that the input matches the range of `t`.

**Final State:**
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and the input from `int(input())` must be within the same range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**.
