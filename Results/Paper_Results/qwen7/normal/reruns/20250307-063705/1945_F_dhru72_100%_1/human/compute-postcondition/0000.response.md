Output State: **`T` is a type variable, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `v` is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ v_i ≤ 10^9, and `p` is a permutation of numbers from 1 to n. Additionally, the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.**

Explanation: The line `T = TypeVar('T')` defines a type variable `T` which is used in generic programming. However, this line does not assign any value to any existing variable or change any existing values. It only introduces a new type variable `T`. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged.
