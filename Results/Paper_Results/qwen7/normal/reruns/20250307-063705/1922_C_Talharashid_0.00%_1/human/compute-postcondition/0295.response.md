Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `m` will be 0, `start` will be an input integer decremented by the total number of iterations times 2, `end` will be an input integer decremented by the total number of iterations times 1, `s` will be 0, `s2` will be the absolute difference between either `d2[start]` and `d2[end]` (if `start < end`) or `d1[start]` and `d1[end]` (if `start >= end`), `s1` will be the absolute difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[start]` if `start < end`, otherwise `s1` will be the absolute difference between `d2[end]` and `d2[start]`, and `i` will be incremented by the total number of iterations.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop, the loop variable `i` will have been incremented to `m` (which is now 0 since the loop has completed), `start` will have been decremented by twice the total number of iterations (since it starts at the same value as `end` and both are decremented each iteration), `end` will have been decremented by the total number of iterations (since it starts one less than `start` and both are decremented each iteration), and `s`, `s1`, and `s2` will still be 0 as they are reset to 0 at the beginning of each iteration. The values of `d1[start]`, `d2`, and the other variables not directly involved in the loop will remain as they were after the last iteration of the loop.
