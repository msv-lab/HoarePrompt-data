Output State: **`s` is increased by 1, `mini` is the minimum value between `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])`, `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])`, and 11111111, and `start` must be different from `end`.**

Explanation: The variable `s` is incremented by 1, while the values of `mini`, `lst`, `start`, and `end` remain unchanged according to the initial state.
