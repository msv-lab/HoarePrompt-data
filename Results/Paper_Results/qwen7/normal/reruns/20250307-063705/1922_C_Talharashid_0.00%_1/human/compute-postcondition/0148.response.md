Output State: **`i` is 2, `m` must be greater than 0, `start` is 1, `end` is decreased by 1, `s` is 0, `s1` is abs(`d2[end]` - `d2[start]`).**

Explanation: The code calculates the absolute difference between `d2[end]` and `d2[start]` and assigns it to `s1`. However, the initial values of `d2[start]` and `d2[end]` are not provided, so `s1` is expressed as the absolute difference between these two elements. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
