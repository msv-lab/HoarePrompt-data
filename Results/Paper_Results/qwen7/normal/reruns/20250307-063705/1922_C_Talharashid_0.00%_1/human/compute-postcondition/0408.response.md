Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `start` and `end` are integers obtained from the input split by space.**

Explanation: The code `start, end = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input separated by a space and assigns them to the variables `start` and `end`. The precondition that `m` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged. Therefore, `m` is still greater than 0, and `start` and `end` are the integers obtained from the input.
