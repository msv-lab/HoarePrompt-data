Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `m`, `m` must be greater than 0, `start` is 0, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `s` is 0, `s2` is either `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])` or `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])` depending on whether `start < end` or not; `d1` is initialized as a defaultdict of int, `d2` is a defaultdict of int, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from input, `inc` is 1.
Code of the loop:
while start != end:
    mini = 11111111
    if start + 1 < len(lst):
        mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1]), mini)
    if start - 1 > -1:
        mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1]), mini)
    if mini == abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc]):
        s += 1
    else:
        s += abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])
    start += inc
    d1[start] = s


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` and `mini`; `i` is `m`; `m` must be greater than 0; `start` is 1; `end` is `len(lst) - 1`; `s` is `abs(lst[0] - lst[1])`; `s2` is either `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])` or `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])` depending on whether `start < end` or not; `d1[start]` is `s`; `d2` is a defaultdict of integers; `n` is an input integer; `lst` is a list of integers obtained from input; `inc` is 1; `start - 1` is less than `len(lst)`; `mini` is updated to be the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` and `mini` if the condition `mini == abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` is true, otherwise `s` is set to `abs(lst[0] - lst[1])` and `mini` remains unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and `11111111`, `i` is `m`, `m` must be greater than 0, `start` is either 2 or 3, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `s` is `abs(lst[0] - lst[1]) + 1`, `d1[start]` is `s`, `d2` is a defaultdict of integers, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from input, `inc` is 1, `start - 1` is less than `len(lst)`
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `start` is `start + 1`, `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and the previous value of `mini` if `start - 1 > -1`, `i` is `m`, `m` must be greater than 0, `end` must be `len(lst) - 1`, `s` is `abs(lst[0] - lst[1]) + 1 + abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, `d1[start]` is `s + d1[start]`, `d2` is a defaultdict of integers, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from input, `inc` is 1, `start - 1` is less than `len(lst)` and `d1[start]` is updated to `s`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
