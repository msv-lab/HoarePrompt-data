Output State: **`m` is 0, `start` is an input integer decremented by the total number of iterations times 2, `end` is an input integer decremented by the total number of iterations times 1, `s` is 0, `d1` is an empty defaultdict, `d2` is a defaultdict initialized to int, `s2` is the absolute difference between either `d2[start]` and `d2[end]` (if `start < end`) or `d1[start]` and `d1[end]` (if `start >= end`), `s1` is the absolute difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[start]` if `start < end`, otherwise `s1` is the absolute difference between `d2[end]` and `d2[start]`, and `i` is incremented by the total number of iterations.**

Explanation: The code initializes `d2` as a defaultdict with an integer type. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
