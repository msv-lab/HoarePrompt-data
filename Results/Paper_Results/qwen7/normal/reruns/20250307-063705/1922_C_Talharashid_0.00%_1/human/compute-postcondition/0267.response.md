Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0; `start` is an input integer decremented by 2; `end` is an input integer decremented by 1; `s` is 0; `s2` is the absolute difference between `d1[start]` and `d1[end]`; `s1` is the absolute difference between `d2[end]` and `d2[start]**.

Explanation: The code assigns the absolute difference between `d1[start]` and `d1[end]` to `s2`. The values of `m`, `start`, `end`, `s`, and `s1` remain unchanged from their initial states.
