Postcondition: **`mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])` and `mini`, `i` is `m`, `m` must be greater than 0, `start` is 0, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `s` is 0, `s2` is either `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])` or `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])` depending on whether `start < end` or not; `d1` is initialized as a defaultdict of int, `d2` is a defaultdict of int, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from input, `inc` is 1, and `start + 1` is less than `len(lst)`**.

This postcondition summarizes that if `start + 1` is less than `len(lst)`, then `mini` is updated to be the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])` and the original `mini`, while other variables retain their initial or unchanged states.
