To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `start` and `end`.

Given the loop condition `while start != end:`:

1. The loop will continue as long as `start` is not equal to `end`.
2. For the loop to execute one more time, `start` must be incremented (or decremented, depending on the loop body) such that `start` becomes unequal to `end`.

From the provided information:
- `start` is initially `len(lst) - 3`.
- `end` is 0.

For the loop to execute one more time, `start` must be changed to a value that is still not equal to `end` (which is 0).

Since `start` starts at `len(lst) - 3` and the loop continues until `start` equals `end`, `start` must be decremented by 1 each iteration. Therefore, the next value of `start` should be `len(lst) - 4`.

No other states need to be adjusted because the loop condition only depends on `start` and `end`.

State: **`start` is `len(lst) - 4`, `end` is 0**
