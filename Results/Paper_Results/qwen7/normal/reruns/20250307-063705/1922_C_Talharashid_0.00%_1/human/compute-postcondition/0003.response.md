Output State: **`i` is 0; `t` must be a positive integer; `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory int; `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory int.**

Explanation: The code initializes `d2` as a defaultdict with an integer factory function. This means `d2` is now a dictionary-like object where any key that does not exist will automatically have an integer value (0) assigned to it. The values of `i`, `t`, and `d1` remain unchanged from their initial states.
