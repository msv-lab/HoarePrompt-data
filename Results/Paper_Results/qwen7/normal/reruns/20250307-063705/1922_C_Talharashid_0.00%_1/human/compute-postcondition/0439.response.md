Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `start` is `start - 1`, `end` is `end - 1`, `s` is 0, `s1` is the absolute difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[start]`, `s2` is the absolute difference between `d2[start - 1]` and `d2[end]`**.

Explanation: The code updates `s1` to be the absolute difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[start]`. The other variables (`m`, `i`, `start`, `end`, `s`, `s2`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
