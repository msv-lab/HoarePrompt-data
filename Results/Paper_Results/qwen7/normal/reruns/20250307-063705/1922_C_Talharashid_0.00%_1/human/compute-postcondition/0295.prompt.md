Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `mini` is the minimum distance found between any two consecutive elements in the list `lst` during the entire loop execution, `s` is the sum of distances as per the conditions inside the loop, `start` is equal to `end` (since the loop stops when `start == end`), `i` is `m` and must be greater than 0, `d1[start]` is 0, `d2` is a defaultdict where keys are indices up to `end` and values are corresponding `s` values, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from input, `inc` is -1, `m` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(m):
    start, end = map(int, input().split())
    start -= 1
    end -= 1
    s = 0
    if start < end:
        s1 = abs(d1[end] - d1[start])
        s2 = abs(d2[start] - d2[end])
    else:
        s1 = abs(d2[end] - d2[start])
        s2 = abs(d1[start] - d1[end])
    print(min(s1, s2))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `m` must be greater than 0; `start` is an input integer decremented by 2; `end` is an input integer decremented by 1; `s` is 0; if `start` is less than `end`, `s2` is the absolute difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]`; otherwise, `s2` is the absolute difference between `d1[start]` and `d1[end]`, and `s1` is the absolute difference between `d2[end]` and `d2[start]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `m` must be greater than 0; `start` is an input integer decremented by 6; `end` is an input integer decremented by 2; `s` is 0; `s2` is the absolute difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]` if `start < end`, otherwise `s2` is the absolute difference between `d1[start]` and `d1[end]`, and `s1` is the absolute difference between `d2[end]` and `d2[start]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `m` must be greater than 0, `start` is an input integer decremented by 8, `end` is an input integer decremented by 3, `s` is 0, `s2` is the absolute difference between either `d2[start]` and `d2[end]` (if `start < end`) or `d1[start]` and `d1[end]` (if `start >= end`), `s1` is the absolute difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[start]` if `start < end`, otherwise `s1` is the absolute difference between `d2[end]` and `d2[start]`, `i` is incremented by 1, `start` and `end` are updated to new integer values from user input, `end` is decremented by 1, and `s1` is recalculated as the absolute difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[start]` if `start < end`, otherwise `s1` is recalculated as `abs(d2[end] - d2[start])` based on the new values of `start` and `end`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
