Output State: **`start` is `len(lst) - 2`, `end` is 0, `d1[start]` contains the cumulative sum `s` which is now `s + 1`, `inc` is -1, `m` remains 0, `s` is either 1 or updated to `abs(lst[len(lst) - 3] - lst[len(lst) - 4])` and now is `s + 1`, `d2[start]` is equal to `s + 1`, and `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and 11111111. If `start - 1 > -1`, `mini` is updated to the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and 11111111. Otherwise, `mini` remains 11111111.**

In natural language, the output state is: `start` remains `len(lst) - 2`, `end` remains 0, the cumulative sum `s` is incremented by 1, `inc` remains -1, `m` remains 0, `s` (now `s + 1`) is either 1 or updated to `abs(lst[len(lst) - 3] - lst[len(lst) - 4])` and now is `s + 1`, `d2[start]` is now `s + 1`, and `mini` remains 11111111 unless `start - 1 > -1`, in which case `mini` is updated to the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and 11111111.
