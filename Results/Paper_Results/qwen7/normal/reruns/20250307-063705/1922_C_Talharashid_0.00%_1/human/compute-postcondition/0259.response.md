Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0; `start` is an input integer decremented by 2; `end` is an input integer decremented by 1**.

Explanation: The code `end -= 1` decrements the value of `end` by 1. Since `start` was already decremented by 1 before this line, it is now decremented by 2. The value of `m` remains unchanged as it was not affected by this line of code.
