Output State: **`i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `start` is start integer - 1, `end` is end integer - 1, `s` is 0, `s1` is abs(d2[end] - d2[start])**.

Explanation: The code calculates the absolute difference between `d2[end]` and `d2[start]` and assigns it to `s1`. The values of `i`, `m`, `start`, `end`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial states.
