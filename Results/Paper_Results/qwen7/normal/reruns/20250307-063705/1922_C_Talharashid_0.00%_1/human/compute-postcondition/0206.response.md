Output State: **`end` is 0, `start` is equal to `end - 1` which is -1, `mini` is the minimum distance found between any two consecutive elements in the list `lst` during the entire loop execution; `i` is `m` and must be greater than 0; `s` is the sum of all the distances calculated during each iteration of the loop; `d1[start]` is `s`; `d2` is a defaultdict of integers; `n` is an input integer; `lst` is a list of integers obtained from input; `inc` is 1.**

The code `end = 0` directly assigns the value 0 to the variable `end`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
