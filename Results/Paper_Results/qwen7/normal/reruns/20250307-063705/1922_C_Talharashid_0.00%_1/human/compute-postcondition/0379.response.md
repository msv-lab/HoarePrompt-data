Postcondition: `start` is `len(lst) - 2`, `end` is 0, `d1[start]` contains the cumulative sum `s` after all iterations, `inc` is -1, `m` remains 0, `s` is either 1 or updated to `abs(lst[len(lst) - 3] - lst[len(lst) - 4])`, `d2[start]` is equal to `s`, and `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])` and 11111111.

This postcondition summarizes that regardless of whether the condition `start + 1 < len(lst)` is true or false, the variables `start`, `end`, `d1[start]`, `inc`, `m`, `s`, `d2[start]`, and `mini` retain their respective states as described. If the condition is true, `mini` is updated to the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])` and 11111111. If the condition is false, `mini` remains 11111111.
