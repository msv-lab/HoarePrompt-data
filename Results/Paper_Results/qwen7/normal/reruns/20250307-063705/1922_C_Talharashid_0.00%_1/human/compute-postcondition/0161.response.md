Output State: **`i` is `m`, `m` must be greater than 0, `start` is 0, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `s` is 0, `s2` is either `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])` or `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])` depending on whether `start < end` or not; `d1` is initialized as a defaultdict of int, `d2` is a defaultdict of int, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from input, `inc` is 1.**

The variable `inc` is assigned the value 1, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
