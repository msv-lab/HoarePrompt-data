Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0; `start` is an input integer decremented by 2 and its current value is less than `end`, which is an input integer decremented by 1; `end` is an input integer decremented by 1; `s` is 0; `s2` is the absolute difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]`**

Explanation: The code calculates the absolute difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]` and assigns it to `s2`. Since `start` and `end` are input integers decremented by 2 and 1 respectively, and their relationship is preserved, `s2` is updated with the new value. All other variables remain unchanged.
