Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `start != end`.
2. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The variables involved in the loop head are `start` and `end`.
3. **Determine the current state of the variables**:
   - `d2[start]` is equal to `s`.
   - `start` is increased by `inc`.
   - `mini` is 11111111, unless `start - 1` is greater than or equal to 0, in which case `mini` is updated to the minimum value between `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and 11111111.
   - `s` is increased by `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` if the else part is executed, and incremented by 1 if the if part is executed.

4. **Check the loop condition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `start` must not be equal to `end`.

5. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - Since `start` is increased by `inc` in each iteration, for the loop to continue, `start` must still be less than `end`.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that `start < end` in the next iteration.

Given the current state:
- `d2[start]` is equal to `s`.
- `start` is increased by `inc`.
- `mini` is 11111111 (or possibly updated based on the condition).
- `s` is updated based on the conditions inside the loop.

To ensure the loop continues, we need to adjust `start` such that `start < end`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`d2[start]` is equal to `s`, `start` must be less than `end`, `mini` is 11111111 (or possibly updated), and `s` is updated based on the conditions inside the loop.**
