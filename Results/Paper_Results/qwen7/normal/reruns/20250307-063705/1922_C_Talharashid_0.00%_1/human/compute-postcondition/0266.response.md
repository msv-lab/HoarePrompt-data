Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0; `start` is an input integer decremented by 2; `end` is an input integer decremented by 1; `s` is 0; `s1` is the absolute difference between `d2[end]` and `d2[start]`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the absolute difference between the values of `d2[end]` and `d2[start]` and assigns it to `s1`. The other variables (`m`, `start`, `end`, and `s`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
