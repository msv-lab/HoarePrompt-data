Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `m`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i < m`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `m` must be greater than 0.
   - `start` is an input integer decremented by 6.
   - `end` is an input integer decremented by 2.
   - `s` is 0.
   - `s2` is the absolute difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]` if `start < end`, otherwise `s2` is the absolute difference between `d1[start]` and `d1[end]`.
   - `s1` is the absolute difference between `d2[end]` and `d2[start]`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i + 1` must be less than `m`. Therefore, `m` must remain the same and `i` must be incremented by 1.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - `m` remains unchanged (it must still be greater than 0).

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`m` must be greater than 0; `start` is an input integer decremented by 6; `end` is an input integer decremented by 2; `s` is 0; `s2` is the absolute difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]` if `start < end`, otherwise `s2` is the absolute difference between `d1[start]` and `d1[end]`; `s1` is the absolute difference between `d2[end]` and `d2[start]`; `i` is incremented by 1**.
