Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `s` is 0, `start` is -1, `mini` is the minimum distance found between any two consecutive elements in the list `lst` during the entire loop execution, `i` is `m` and must be greater than 0, `d1[start]` is 0, `d2` is a defaultdict of integers, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from input, `inc` is -1.
Code of the loop:
while start != end:
    mini = 11111111
    if start + 1 < len(lst):
        mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1]), mini)
    if start - 1 > -1:
        mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1]), mini)
    if mini == abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc]):
        s += 1
    else:
        s += abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])
    start += inc
    d2[start] = s


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `mini` is the minimum value between abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1]) and 11111111, `s` is 2, `start` is start + inc, `i` is `m` and must be greater than 0, `d1[start]` is 0, `d2[start]` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from input, `inc` is -1, and the current value of `start` is less than the length of `lst` - 1. If `start - 1 > -1`, then `start` is updated to `start - 1`. Otherwise, `start` remains unchanged. The condition mini is equal to the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc].
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `d2[start]` is equal to `s`, `start` is increased by `inc`, `mini` is 11111111, unless `start - 1` is greater than or equal to 0, in which case `mini` is updated to the minimum value between `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and 11111111. Additionally, `s` is increased by `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` if the else part is executed, and incremented by 1 if the if part is executed.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `d2[start]` is equal to `s`, `start` is increased by `inc`, `d2[start]` is equal to either `s + 1` or `s`, depending on whether `mini` is equal to `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, `start` must still be less than `end`, and `mini` remains the minimum value between `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and `11111111`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
