Postcondition: **`mini` is the minimum value between abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1]) and 11111111, `s` is 1, `start` is -1, `i` is `m` and must be greater than 0, `d1[start]` is 0, `d2` is a defaultdict of integers, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from input, `inc` is -1, and the current value of `start` is less than the length of `lst` - 1. If `start - 1 > -1`, then `start` is updated to `start - 1`. Otherwise, `start` remains unchanged. The condition mini is equal to the absolute difference between lst[start] and lst[start + inc].**

This postcondition summarizes both the if and else parts of the if-else block, ensuring that all variables retain their respective states as described in each case.
