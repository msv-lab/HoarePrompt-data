Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is 0, `t` must be a positive integer, `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory int, `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory int, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `inc` is 1, `s` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while start != end:
    mini = 11111111
    if start + 1 < len(lst):
        mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1]), mini)
    if start - 1 > -1:
        mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1]), mini)
    if mini == abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc]):
        s += 1
    else:
        s += abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])
    start += inc
    d1[start] = s


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `mini` is the minimum of abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1]) and the previous value of `mini`; `start` is less than `end`; `start` is less than len(lst) - 1; `start` is greater than 0; `start` is increased by `inc`; `s` is increased by either 1 (if `mini` equals abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])) or abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc]) (if `mini` does not equal abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])); `d1[start]` is equal to `s`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `d1[start]` is equal to `s`, `start` is increased by `inc`, `start + inc` is less than `end`, and `mini` is the minimum of abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1]) and the original `mini`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `d1[start]` is equal to `s`, `start` is increased by `inc`, `start + inc` is less than `end`, and `mini` is equal to the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and `11111111`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
