Output State: **`i` is 2, `m` must be greater than 0, `start` is 1, `end` is `end - 1`, `s` is 0, `s2` is abs(`d2[start]` - `d2[end]`).**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])` to `s2`. Since `start` is 1 and `end` is decreased by 1, `end` becomes `end - 1`. The values of `i`, `m`, `start`, `s`, and the expression for `s2` are updated accordingly. The precondition that `m` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged.
