Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `start` is `start - 3`, `end` is `end - 1`, `s` is 0, `s1` is the absolute difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[start]`, `s2` is the absolute difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]**'.

Explanation: The code updates `s2` to be the absolute difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]`. The other variables (`m`, `start`, `end`, `s`, `s1`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
