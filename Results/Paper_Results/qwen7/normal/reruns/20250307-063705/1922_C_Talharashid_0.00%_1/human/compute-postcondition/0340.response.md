To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the loop head, which consists of the variables `start` and `end`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `start != end`.
2. **Current States**:
   - `m` remains 0 (not relevant for the loop condition).
   - `start` is decremented by the total number of iterations times 2 plus 1.
   - `end` is decremented by the total number of iterations minus 1.
   - `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])` and 11111111.
   - `d1[start]` is assigned the value of either `s` or `s + 1`.
   - `start` must be different from `end`.
3. **Additional Conditions**:
   - If `start - 1 > -1`, then `start` is further decremented by 1, `end` is decremented by 1, and `mini` is updated to the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and 11111111.
   - If the if condition is false, `s` is incremented by `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])`; `start` is incremented by `inc`; `d1[start]` is now set to the value of either `s` or `s + 1`.

### Determining the Next Iteration:

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `start != end` must still hold true. Therefore, we need to ensure that `start` and `end` are not equal after the adjustments.

Given the current states:
- `start` is decremented by the total number of iterations times 2 plus 1.
- `end` is decremented by the total number of iterations minus 1.

Let's denote the total number of iterations as \( k \).

- Initial decrement of `start`: \( start \leftarrow start - (2k + 1) \)
- Initial decrement of `end`: \( end \leftarrow end - (k - 1) \)

If `start - 1 > -1`, additional decrements occur:
- Further decrement of `start`: \( start \leftarrow start - 1 \)
- Further decrement of `end`: \( end \leftarrow end - 1 \)

Thus, the final states before the loop check would be:
- Final `start`: \( start - (2k + 1) - 1 = start - (2k + 2) \) (if `start - 1 > -1`)
- Final `end`: \( end - (k - 1) - 1 = end - k - 1 \) (if `start - 1 > -1`)

To ensure `start != end`:
- We need to ensure that the final values of `start` and `end` are not equal.

### Conclusion:

The states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are `start` and `end`.

State: **`start` must be different from `end`**.

This ensures that the loop condition `start != end` holds true for the next iteration.
