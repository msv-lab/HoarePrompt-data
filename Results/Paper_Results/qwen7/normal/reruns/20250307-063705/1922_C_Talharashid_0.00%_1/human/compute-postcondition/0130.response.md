Output State: **`i` is 1, `m` must be greater than 0, `start` is an input integer, `end` is an input integer, `s` is 0, `s2` is either `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])` or `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])` depending on whether `start < end` or not.**

Explanation: The code `start, end = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `start` and `end` respectively. It does not affect the values of `i`, `m`, `s`, or `s2`. Therefore, `i` remains 1, `m` must still be greater than 0, `s` remains 0, and `s2` remains dependent on the conditions specified. The values of `start` and `end` are now input integers.
