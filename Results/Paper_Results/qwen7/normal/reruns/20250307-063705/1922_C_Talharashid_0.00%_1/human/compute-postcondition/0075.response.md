Postcondition: **`end` is 0, `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and `11111111`, `start` is equal to `len(lst) - 2`, `s` is 0, `d1[start]` is equal to `s`, `inc` is -1, and either `start - 1 > -1` is true making `start` equal to `len(lst) - 2` or `start - 1 <= -1` is true keeping `start` at `len(lst) - 1`, with `mini` being the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` and `11111111`.**
