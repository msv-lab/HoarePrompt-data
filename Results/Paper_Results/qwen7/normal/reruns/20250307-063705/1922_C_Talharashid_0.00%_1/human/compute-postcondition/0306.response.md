Output State: **`m` is 0, `start` is an input integer decremented by the total number of iterations times 2, `end` is an input integer minus the total number of iterations, and `mini` is 11111111.**

Explanation: The line `mini = 11111111` assigns the value `11111111` to the variable `mini`. No other changes are made to the variables `m`, `start`, or `end`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial conditions as described in the initial state.
