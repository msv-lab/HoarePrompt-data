Postcondition: `m` is 0, `start` is an input integer decremented by the total number of iterations times 2, `end` is an input integer minus the total number of iterations, and `mini` is the minimum of abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc]) and 11111111, provided that start - 1 is greater than -1. If start - 1 is not greater than -1, the values of `m`, `start`, `end`, and `mini` remain unchanged. Additionally, the condition mini equals abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc]) holds true.
