Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` must be a positive integer, `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory int, `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory int, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `lst` by mapping each element of the input (split by spaces) to an integer. The original values of `i`, `t`, `d1`, `d2`, and `n` remain unchanged. The new variable `lst` contains the integers from the input.
