Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0; `start` is an input integer decremented by 8; `end` is an input integer decremented by 3; `s` is 0; `s2` is the absolute difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]` if `start < end`, otherwise `s2` is the absolute difference between `d1[start]` and `d1[end]`; `s1` is the absolute difference between `d2[end]` and `d2[start]`; `i` is incremented by 1; `start` and `end` are updated to new integer values from user input; `end` is decremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `end -= 1` decrements the value of `end` by 1. Initially, `end` was an input integer decremented by 2. After executing the code, `end` becomes an input integer decremented by 3. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
