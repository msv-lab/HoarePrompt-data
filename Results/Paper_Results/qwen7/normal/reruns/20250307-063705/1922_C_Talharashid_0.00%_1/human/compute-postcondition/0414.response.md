Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `start` is `start - 1`, `end` is an integer obtained from the input split by space and decreased by 1, `s` is 0, `s2` is the absolute difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the absolute difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]` and assigns it to `s2`. The values of `m`, `start`, `end`, `s`, and `s1` remain unchanged from their initial states. The precondition that `m` must be greater than 0 and the definitions of `start` and `end` remain valid.
