Postcondition: `m` must be greater than 0, `start` is `start - 3`, `end` is `end - 1`, `s` is 0, `s1` is the absolute difference between either `d1[end]` and `d1[start]` or `d2[end]` and `d2[start]` depending on whether `start - 2 < end` or `start - 2 >= end`, and `s2` is the absolute difference between either `d2[start]` and `d2[end]` or `d1[start]` and `d1[end]` depending on whether `start - 2 < end` or `start - 2 >= end`.
