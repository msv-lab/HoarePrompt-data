Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `start` is an input integer decremented by 8, `end` is an input integer decremented by 3, `s` is 0, `s2` is the absolute difference between `d1[start]` and `d1[end]`, `s1` is the absolute difference between `d2[end]` and `d2[start]`, `i` is incremented by 1, `start` and `end` are updated to new integer values from user input, `end` is decremented by 1, `s1` is recalculated as `abs(d2[end] - d2[start])` based on the new values of `start` and `end`.**

Explanation: The code updates `s2` to the absolute difference between `d1[start]` and `d1[end]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states. The new values of `start` and `end` are not specified, so they are left as updated inputs.
