Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `start` is `start - 1`, `end` is an integer obtained from the input split by space and decreased by 1, `s` is 0, `s1` is the absolute difference between `d2[end]` and `d2[start]`, `s2` is the absolute difference between `d1[start]` and `d1[end]`, and `start` is greater than or equal to `end`**.

Explanation: The code calculates the absolute difference between `d1[start]` and `d1[end]` and assigns it to `s2`. Since `start` is already greater than or equal to `end`, no change is made to this condition. All other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state.
