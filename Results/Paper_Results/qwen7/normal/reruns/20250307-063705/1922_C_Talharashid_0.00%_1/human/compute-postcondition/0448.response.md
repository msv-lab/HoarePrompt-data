Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: t (an integer between 1 and 10^4), n (an integer between 2 and 10^5), a (a list of n integers in strictly increasing order between 0 and 10^9), and m (an integer between 1 and 10^5). For each query consisting of two distinct integers x_i and y_i (both between 1 and n), the function returns a value based on the elements a[x_i] and a[y_i] in the list a.**

Note: The specific return value based on the elements a[x_i] and a[y_i] is not detailed in the given information, so the functionality description focuses on the parameters and the nature of the queries.
