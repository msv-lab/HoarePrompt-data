Output State: **`mini` is the minimum of abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1]) and the previous value of `mini`; `start` is less than `end`; `start` is less than len(lst) - 1**.

Explanation: The code updates `mini` to be the minimum of the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + 1]` and the previous value of `mini`. All other variables remain unchanged. Since `start` is less than `end` and `start` is less than `len(lst) - 1`, these conditions still hold true.
