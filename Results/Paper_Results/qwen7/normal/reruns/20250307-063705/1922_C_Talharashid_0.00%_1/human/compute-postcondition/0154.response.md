Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `t`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `t`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `m-1`
   - `m` must be greater than 0
   - `start` is `start` - 1
   - `end` is an input integer - 1
   - `s` is 0
   - `s2` is either `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])` or `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])` depending on whether `start < end` or not.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from `m-1` and the loop increments `i` by 1 each time it runs, the new value of `i` will be `(m-1) + 1 = m`.
   - The value of `t` remains unchanged.
   - All other variables (`start`, `end`, `s`, `s2`) remain the same as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is `m`, `m` must be greater than 0, `start` is `start` - 1, `end` is an input integer - 1, `s` is 0, `s2` is either `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])` or `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])` depending on whether `start < end` or not**.
