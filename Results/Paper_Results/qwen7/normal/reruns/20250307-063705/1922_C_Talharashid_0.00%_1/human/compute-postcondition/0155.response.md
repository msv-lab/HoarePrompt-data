Output State: **`i` is `m`, `m` must be greater than 0, `start` is `start` - 1, `end` is an input integer - 1, `s` is 0, `s2` is either `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])` or `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])` depending on whether `start < end` or not; `d1` is initialized as a defaultdict of int.**

The code initializes `d1` as a defaultdict of type int, which does not affect the values of the existing variables (`i`, `m`, `start`, `end`, `s`, `s2`). Therefore, these variables retain their initial conditions.
