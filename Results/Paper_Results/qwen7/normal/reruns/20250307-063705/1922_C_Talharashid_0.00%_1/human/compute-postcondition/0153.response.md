Output State: **Postcondition: `i` is `m-1`, `m` must be greater than 0, `start` is `start` - 1, `end` is an input integer - 1, `s` is 0, and `s2` is either `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])` or `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])` depending on whether `start < end` or not.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the postcondition will be as follows: The loop variable `i` will be `m-1`, assuming `m` is greater than 0. The `start` and `end` values will be adjusted by subtracting 1 from their original input values. The variable `s` remains 0 because it is reinitialized to 0 at the beginning of each iteration. The variable `s2` will be either `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])` or `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`, depending on the condition `start < end`.
