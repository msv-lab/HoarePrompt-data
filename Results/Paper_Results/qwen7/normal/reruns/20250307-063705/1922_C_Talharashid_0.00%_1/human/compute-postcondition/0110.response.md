Output State: **`end` is 0, `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])` and 11111111, `start` is `len(lst) - 5` or `len(lst) - 4` and has been decremented by 1, `s` is updated to either `s + 1` or `s + abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, `d1[start]` is equal to `s`, `d2[start]` is `s`, `inc` is -1, `start` is updated to `start - 1` and `start` is incremented by -1.**

In simpler terms:
- `start` is decremented by 1 (or incremented by -1).
- All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
