Output State: **`i` is 2, `m` must be greater than 0, `start` is 1, `end` is decreased by 1, `s` is 0, `s1` is abs(`d1[end]` - `d1[start]`).**

Explanation: The code calculates the absolute difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[start]` and assigns it to `s1`. However, since `d1` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact value of `s1`. The other variables (`i`, `m`, `start`, `end`, and `s`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
