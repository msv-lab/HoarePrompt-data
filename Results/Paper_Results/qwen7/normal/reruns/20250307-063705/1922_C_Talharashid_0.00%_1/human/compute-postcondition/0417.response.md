Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `start` is `start - 1`, `end` is an integer obtained from the input split by space and decreased by 1, `s` is 0, `s1` is the absolute difference between `d2[end]` and `d2[start]`, and `start` is greater than or equal to `end`**.

Explanation: The code calculates the absolute difference between `d2[end]` and `d2[start]` and assigns it to `s1`. The other variables (`m`, `start`, `end`, and `s`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
