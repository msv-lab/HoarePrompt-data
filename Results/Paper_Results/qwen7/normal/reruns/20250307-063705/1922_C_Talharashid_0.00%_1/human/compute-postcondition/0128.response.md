Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 0.
- `m` is greater than 0.
- `start` is `start integer - 1`.
- `end` is `end integer - 1`.
- `s` is 0.
- `s2` is either `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])` or `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])` depending on whether `start < end` or not.

We need to determine the value of `min(s1, s2)`.

Given:
- `s` is 0, so `s1` is also 0.
- `s2` is either `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])` or `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`.

Since the actual values of `d1` and `d2` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `s2`. However, we know that `s2` is derived from the absolute difference between two elements in either `d1` or `d2` based on the condition `start < end`.

Therefore, the expression `min(s1, s2)` simplifies to `min(0, s2)`, which is `0` because `s2` is non-negative (absolute value).

Output: **0**
