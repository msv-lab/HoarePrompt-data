Output State: **`i` is 2, `m` must be greater than 0, `start` is 1, `end` is 0, `s` is 0, `s2` is abs(`d1[start]` - `d1[end]`).**

Explanation: The code calculates `s2` as the absolute difference between `d1[start]` and `d1[end]`. Given that `start` is 1 and `end` is decreased by 1 (making it 0), `s2` is calculated as `abs(d1[1] - d1[0])`. The values of `i`, `m`, `start`, `end`, `s`, and `s1` are updated accordingly. The precondition that `m` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged.
