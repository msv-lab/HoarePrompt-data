Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `start` is updated to the integer value of the first input, `end` is updated to the integer value of the second input, `s` is 0, `s1` is the absolute difference between either `d1[end]` and `d1[start]` or `d2[end]` and `d2[start]` depending on whether `start - 2 < end` or `start - 2 >= end`, `s2` is the absolute difference between either `d2[start]` and `d2[end]` or `d1[start]` and `d1[end]` depending on whether `start - 2 < end` or `start - 2 >= end`**.

This means that the variables `m`, `i`, `start`, and `end` have been updated to new values based on user input, while `s`, `s1`, and `s2` remain unchanged from their initial states, with `s1` and `s2` being dependent on the values of `start` and `end` relative to each other.
