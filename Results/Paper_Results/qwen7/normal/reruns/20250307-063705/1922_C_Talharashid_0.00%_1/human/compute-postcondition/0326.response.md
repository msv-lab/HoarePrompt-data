To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the loop head conditions. The loop condition is `start != end`.

Let's analyze the given states:

- `m` remains 0 (not relevant to the loop condition)
- `start` is decremented by the total number of iterations times 2 plus 1
- `end` is decremented by the total number of iterations minus 1
- `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` and 11111111 (not relevant to the loop condition)
- `d1[start]` is assigned the value of `s` (not relevant to the loop condition)

For the loop to continue executing, the condition `start != end` must be true. Therefore, we need to ensure that `start` is not equal to `end` after the adjustments.

Given the current states:
- `start` is decremented by the total number of iterations times 2 plus 1
- `end` is decremented by the total number of iterations minus 1

Let's denote the total number of iterations as `iter`. Then:
- `start` becomes `start - (iter * 2 + 1)`
- `end` becomes `end - (iter - 1)`

To ensure `start != end`, we need to guarantee that these two values are different. Since both `start` and `end` are being decremented, the key is to ensure that their difference remains non-zero.

Therefore, we need to adjust the states such that `start` and `end` are different after the decrement operations.

State: **`m` remains 0, `start` is decremented by the total number of iterations times 2 plus 1, `end` is decremented by the total number of iterations minus 1, `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` and 11111111, `d1[start]` is assigned the value of `s` and `start` must be different from `end`**
