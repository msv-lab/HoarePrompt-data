Postcondition: `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and `11111111`, `i` is `m`, `m` must be greater than 0, `start` is 1, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `s` is `abs(lst[0] - lst[1])`, `s2` is either `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])` or `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])` depending on whether `start < end` or not, `d1[start]` is `s`, `d2` is a defaultdict of integers, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from input, `inc` is 1, `start - 1` is less than `len(lst)`, and `mini` is updated to the minimum value between `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and `11111111`.
