Output State: **`start` is `start + 1`, `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and the previous value of `mini` if `start - 1 > -1`, `i` is `m`, `m` must be greater than 0, `end` must be `len(lst) - 1`, `s` is `abs(lst[0] - lst[1]) + 1 + abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, `d1[start]` is `s + d1[start]`, `d2` is a defaultdict of integers, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from input, `inc` is 1, `start - 1` is less than `len(lst)` and `d1[start]` is updated to `s`.**

Explanation: The line `d1[start] = s` updates the dictionary `d1` at key `start` with the value of `s`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
