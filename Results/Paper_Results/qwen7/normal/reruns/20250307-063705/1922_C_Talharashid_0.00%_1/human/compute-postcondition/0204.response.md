Output State: `mini` is the minimum distance found between any two consecutive elements in the list `lst` during the entire loop execution; `i` is `m` and must be greater than 0; `start` is equal to `end - 1`; `end` is `len(lst) - 1`; `s` is the sum of all the distances calculated during each iteration of the loop; `d1[start]` is `s`; `d2` is a defaultdict of integers; `n` is an input integer; `lst` is a list of integers obtained from input; `inc` is 1.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, `mini` will hold the smallest difference between any two consecutive elements in the list `lst`. The variable `start` will be one less than `end`, which is `len(lst) - 1`. The variable `s` will contain the cumulative sum of the absolute differences between each element and its next (or previous, depending on the direction of `inc`) element as the loop progresses. The dictionary `d1` will store the cumulative sum `s` at the final position of `start`. The other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop's body.
