Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `m`.
2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initialized to 0.
   - `m` is given as an input integer.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `m`.

Given the initial state:
- `end` is 0.
- `mini` is the minimum value found during the entire loop execution (not relevant for the loop head).
- `start` is 0.
- `s` is the sum of increments calculated throughout the loop (not relevant for the loop head).
- `d1[start]` is equal to `s` (not relevant for the loop head).
- `d2[start]` is `s` (not relevant for the loop head).
- `inc` is -1 (not relevant for the loop head).
- `m` is an input integer.

Since the loop will execute if `i < m`, we need to ensure that `i` is initialized to 0 and `m` is greater than 0.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `m`.

**State:**
- `i` is 0.
- `m` must be greater than 0.

So, the final answer is:
State: **`i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0**
