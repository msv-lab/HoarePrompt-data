Output State: **`i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `start` is start integer - 1, `end` is end integer - 1, `s` is 0, `s2` is abs(d1[start] - d1[end])**.

The code calculates `s2` as the absolute difference between `d1[start]` and `d1[end]`. Since `start` and `end` are defined as `start integer - 1` and `end integer - 1` respectively, `s2` is computed using these adjusted indices. The other variables (`i`, `m`, `s`, `start`, and `end`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
