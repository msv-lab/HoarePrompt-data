Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `start` is `start - 1`, `end` is `end - 1`, `s` is 0, `s1` is `abs(d2[end] - d2[start])`, `s2` is the absolute difference between either `d2[start - 1]` and `d2[end]` or `d1[start - 1]` and `d1[end]` depending on whether `start - 3 < end` or `start - 3 >= end`**

Explanation: The code updates `s1` to the absolute difference between `d2[end]` and `d2[start]`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
