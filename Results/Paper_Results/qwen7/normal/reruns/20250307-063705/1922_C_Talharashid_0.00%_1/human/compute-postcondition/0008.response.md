Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` must be a positive integer, `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory int, `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory int, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `inc` is 1.**

The code initializes the variable `inc` to 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
