Postcondition: `m` must be greater than 0, `start` is `start - 1`, `end` is an integer obtained from the input split by space and decreased by 1, `s` is 0, `s1` is the absolute difference between `d2[end]` and `d2[start]`, and `s2` is either the absolute difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]` (if `start < end`) or the absolute difference between `d1[start]` and `d1[end]` (if `start >= end`).
