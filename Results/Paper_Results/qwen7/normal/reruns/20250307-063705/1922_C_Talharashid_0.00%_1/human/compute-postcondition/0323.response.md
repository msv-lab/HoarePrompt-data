Postcondition: `m`, `start`, `end`, and `mini` are as follows:
- If `mini` equals `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, then `m` remains 0, `start` is decremented by the total number of iterations times 2 plus 1, `end` is decremented by the total number of iterations minus 1, and `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` and 11111111.
- Otherwise, `m` is updated to `s + abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, `start` is decremented by the total number of iterations times 2, `end` is decremented by the total number of iterations, and `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and 11111111, provided that `start - 1` is greater than -1. If `start - 1` is not greater than -1, the values of `m`, `start`, `end`, and `mini` remain unchanged. Additionally, `mini` is not equal to `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`.
