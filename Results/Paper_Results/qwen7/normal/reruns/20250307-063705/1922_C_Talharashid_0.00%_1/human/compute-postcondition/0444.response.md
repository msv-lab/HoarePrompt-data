Postcondition: `m` must be greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `start` and `end` are each decremented by 1, `s` is 0, `s1` is the absolute difference between either `d1[end]` and `d1[start]` or `d2[end]` and `d2[start]` depending on whether `start - 3 < end` or `start - 3 >= end`, `s2` is the absolute difference between either `d2[start]` and `d2[end]` or `d1[start]` and `d1[end]` depending on whether `start - 3 < end` or `start - 3 >= end`. If `start < end`, then `s1` is the absolute difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[start]`, and `s2` is the absolute difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]`. Otherwise, `s1` is `abs(d2[end] - d2[start])`, and `s2` is `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`.
