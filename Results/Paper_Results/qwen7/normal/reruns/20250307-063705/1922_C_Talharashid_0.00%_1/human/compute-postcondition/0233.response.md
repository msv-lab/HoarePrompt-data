Output State: **`s` is 1 more than its original value, `mini` is 11111111 unless `start - 1` is greater than or equal to 0, in which case `mini` is updated to the minimum value between `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and 11111111.**

Explanation: The variable `s` is incremented by 1, so `s` is now 1 more than its original value. The value of `mini` remains unchanged unless `start - 1` is greater than or equal to 0, in which case `mini` would be updated to the minimum value between `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and 11111111. Since no such update occurred, `mini` remains as per its initial condition.
