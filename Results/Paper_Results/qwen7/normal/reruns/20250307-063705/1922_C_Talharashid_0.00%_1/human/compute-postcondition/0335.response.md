Output State: **`m` remains 0, `start` is decremented by the total number of iterations times 2 plus 1, `end` is decremented by the total number of iterations minus 1, `mini` is the minimum of abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1]) and 11111111, `d1[start]` is assigned the value of `s`, and `start` must be different from `end`. If `start - 1 > -1`, then `start` is further decremented by 1, `end` is decremented by 1, and `mini` is updated to the minimum of abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1]) and 11111111. `s` is incremented by abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1]).**

Explanation: The code increments `s` by the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + 1]`. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged as per the initial postcondition.
