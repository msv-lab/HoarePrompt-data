Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; a is a list of n integers in strictly increasing order such that 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9; m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5; each query consists of two distinct integers x_i and y_i such that 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n.**
