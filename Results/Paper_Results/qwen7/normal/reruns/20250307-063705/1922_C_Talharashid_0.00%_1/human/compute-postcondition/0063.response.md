Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `start != end`.
2. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `end` is 0
   - `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and 11111111
   - `start` is equal to `len(lst) - 1`
   - `s` is 0
   - `d1[start]` is equal to `s`
   - `inc` is -1

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `start != end` must be true.
   - Currently, `end` is 0 and `start` is `len(lst) - 1`.
   - Since `start` is `len(lst) - 1` and `end` is 0, `start` is not equal to `end` unless `len(lst)` is 1 (which would make `start` and `end` both 0).

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - To ensure the loop executes the first time, `start` must not be equal to `end`. Given that `end` is 0, `start` must be something other than 0.
   - However, since `start` is already set to `len(lst) - 1`, and `len(lst)` is at least 2 (otherwise, `start` would be 0), the condition `start != end` is already satisfied.

Therefore, no additional adjustments are needed for the loop to execute the first time based on the given conditions.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`end` is 0, `mini` is the minimum of abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1]) and 11111111, `start` is equal to `len(lst) - 1`, `s` is 0, `d1[start]` is equal to `s`, `inc` is -1**
