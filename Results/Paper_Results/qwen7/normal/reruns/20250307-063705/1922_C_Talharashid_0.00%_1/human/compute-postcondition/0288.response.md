Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `start` is an input integer decremented by 8, `end` is an input integer decremented by 3, `s` is 0, `s2` is the absolute difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]` if `start < end`, otherwise `s2` is the absolute difference between `d1[start]` and `d1[end]`, `s1` is the absolute difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[start]`, `i` is incremented by 1, `start` and `end` are updated to new integer values from user input, `end` is decremented by 1, `s1` is now the absolute difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[start]`**.

This means that the value of `s1` has been updated to the absolute difference between the elements at the `end` and `start` indices in the list `d1`. All other variables retain their previous states.
