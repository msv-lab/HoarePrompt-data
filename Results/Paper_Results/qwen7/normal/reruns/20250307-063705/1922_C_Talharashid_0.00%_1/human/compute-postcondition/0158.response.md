Output State: **`i` is `m`, `m` must be greater than 0, `start` is `start` - 1, `end` is an input integer - 1, `s` is 0, `s2` is either `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])` or `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])` depending on whether `start < end` or not; `d1` is initialized as a defaultdict of int, `d2` is a defaultdict of int, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from input.**

Explanation: The code `lst = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, converts each integer to an int, and stores them in a list named `lst`. The other variables (`i`, `m`, `start`, `end`, `s`, `s2`, `d1`, `d2`, `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
