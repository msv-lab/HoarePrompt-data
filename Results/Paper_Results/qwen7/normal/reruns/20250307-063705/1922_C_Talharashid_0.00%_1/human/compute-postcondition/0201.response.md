Output State: **`start` is `start + 1`, `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and the previous value of `mini` if `start - 1 > -1`, `i` is `m`, `m` must be greater than 0, `end` must be `len(lst) - 1`, `s` is `abs(lst[0] - lst[1]) + 1 + abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, `d1[start]` is `s`, `d2` is a defaultdict of integers, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from input, `inc` is 1, `start - 1` is less than `len(lst)`.**

Explanation: The line `start += inc` increments the value of `start` by 1. Since `inc` is 1, `start` is updated to `start + 1`. The value of `mini` remains unchanged unless `start - 1 > -1`, in which case it is updated to be the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and its current value. All other variables remain in their previous states.
