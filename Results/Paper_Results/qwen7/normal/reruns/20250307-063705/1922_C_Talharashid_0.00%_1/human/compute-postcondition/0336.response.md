Postcondition: `m` remains 0, `start` is decremented by the total number of iterations times 2 plus 1, `end` is decremented by the total number of iterations minus 1, `mini` is the minimum of abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1]) and 11111111, `d1[start]` is either assigned the value of `s` or `s + 1`, and `start` must be different from `end`. If `start - 1 > -1`, then `start` is further decremented by 1, `end` is decremented by 1, and `mini` is updated to the minimum of abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1]) and 11111111. Additionally, if the condition `mini == abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` is true, `d1[start]` is assigned the value of `s`; otherwise, `d1[start]` is assigned the value of `s + 1`.
