Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `start` is an input integer decremented by 8, `end` is an input integer decremented by 3, `s` is 0, `s2` is the absolute difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]`, `s1` is the absolute difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[start]`, `i` is incremented by 1, `start` and `end` are updated to new integer values from user input, `end` is decremented by 1, `s1` is now the absolute difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[start]`**

Explanation: The code calculates `s2` as the absolute difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]`. The values of `m`, `start`, `end`, `s`, `s1`, `i`, `d1`, and `d2` remain unchanged except that `s2` is now set to the absolute difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]`. The values of `start` and `end` are updated to new integer values from user input, and `end` is then decremented by 1. After these operations, `s1` is updated to the absolute difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[start]`.
