Output State: **`i` is 1, `m` must be greater than 0, `start` is `start` - 1, `end` is an input integer - 1, `s` is 0, `s2` is either `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])` or `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])` depending on whether `start < end` or not.**

Explanation: The line `s = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `s`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `i`, `m`, `start`, `end`, and `s2` remain unchanged from their initial states.
