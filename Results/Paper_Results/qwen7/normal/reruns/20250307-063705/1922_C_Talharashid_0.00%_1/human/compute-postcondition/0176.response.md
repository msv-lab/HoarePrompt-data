Postcondition: **`mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` and `mini`; `i` is `m`; `m` must be greater than 0; `start` is 0; `end` is `len(lst) - 1`; `s` is either incremented by 1 or set to 1; `s2` is either `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])` or `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])` depending on whether `start < end` or not; `d1` is a defaultdict of integers; `d2` is a defaultdict of integers; `n` is an input integer; `lst` is a list of integers obtained from input; `inc` is 1; `start - 1` is less than `len(lst)`; `mini` is updated to be the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` and `mini` if the condition `mini == abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` is true, otherwise `s` is set to `abs(lst[0] - lst[1])` and `mini` remains unchanged.**
