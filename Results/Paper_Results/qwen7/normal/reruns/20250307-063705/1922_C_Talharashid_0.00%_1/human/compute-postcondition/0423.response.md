Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `start` is `start - 2`, `end` is an input integer minus 1, `s` is 0, `s1` is the absolute difference between `d2[end]` and `d2[start - 2]`, `s2` is either the absolute difference between `d2[start - 2]` and `d2[end]` (if `start - 2 < end`) or the absolute difference between `d1[start - 2]` and `d1[end]` (if `start - 2 >= end`).**

Explanation:
- The line `start, end = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input separated by a space and assigns them to `start` and `end` respectively. It does not affect the values of `m`, `s`, `s1`, or `s2`. The value of `start` is updated to `start - 2`, and `end` is updated to the input integer minus 1. The conditions for `s1` and `s2` remain unchanged, but their values will be calculated based on the new `start` and `end` values once they are used in the code.
