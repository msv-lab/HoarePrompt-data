Output State: **`mini` is the minimum of abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1]) and the previous value of `mini`; `start` is less than `end`; `start` is less than len(lst) - 1; `start` is greater than 0; `s` is increased by abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc]); `mini` is not equal to abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])**.

Explanation: The code updates the variable `s` by adding the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged from the initial state.
