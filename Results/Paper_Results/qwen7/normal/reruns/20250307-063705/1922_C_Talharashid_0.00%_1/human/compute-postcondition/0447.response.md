Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` will be 0, `m` will be 0, `start` will be `start - t * 2`, `end` will be `end - t * 1`, `s` will be 0, `s1` will be the absolute difference between either `d1[end]` and `d1[start]` or `d2[end]` and `d2[start]` depending on whether `start - t * 2 < end` or `start - t * 2 >= end`, and `s2` will be the absolute difference between either `d2[start]` and `d2[end]` or `d1[start]` and `d1[end]` depending on whether `start - t * 2 < end` or `start - t * 2 >= end`.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished:
- The variable `t` which controls the number of loop iterations will be 0.
- The variable `m` will also be 0 as it gets exhausted in the loop.
- The `start` index will be adjusted by subtracting twice the number of iterations (`2 * t`) from its initial value.
- The `end` index will be adjusted by subtracting the number of iterations (`t`) from its initial value.
- The variable `s` remains 0 as it is reset to 0 at the beginning of each iteration.
- The variables `s1` and `s2` will hold the absolute differences calculated based on the adjusted `start` and `end` indices relative to the last iteration of the loop.
