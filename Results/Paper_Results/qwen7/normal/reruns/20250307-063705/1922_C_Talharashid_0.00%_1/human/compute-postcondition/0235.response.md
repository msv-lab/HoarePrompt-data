Postcondition: `mini` is 11111111, unless `start - 1` is greater than or equal to 0, in which case `mini` is updated to the minimum value between `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and 11111111. Additionally, `s` is increased by `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` if the else part is executed, or it is increased by 1 if the if part is executed.
