Output State: **`i` is 1, `m` must be greater than 0, `start` is `start` - 1, `end` is an input integer - 1, `s` is 0, `s2` is `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])`**.

Explanation: The code updates `s2` to be the absolute difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
