Output State: **`m` remains 0, `start` is decremented by the total number of iterations times 2 plus 1, `end` is 0, `d1[start]` contains the cumulative sum `s` after all iterations, `mini` remains the minimum value between `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])`, `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])`, and 11111111, `s` is the final value accumulated after all iterations; `start` is set to `len(lst) - 1`, `inc` is -1.**

The variable `inc` is assigned the value `-1`. All other variables retain their previous states.
