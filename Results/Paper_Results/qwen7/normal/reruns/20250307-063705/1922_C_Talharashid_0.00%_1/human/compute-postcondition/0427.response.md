Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `start` is `start - 3`, `end` is `end - 1`, `s` is 0, `s1` is the absolute difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[start]`, `s2` is either the absolute difference between `d2[start - 2]` and `d2[end]` (if `start - 2 < end`) or the absolute difference between `d1[start - 2]` and `d1[end]` (if `start - 2 >= end`).**

Explanation: The code updates `s1` to be the absolute difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[start]`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
