Postcondition: `m` must be greater than 0; `start` is an input integer decremented by 2; `end` is an input integer decremented by 1; `s` is 0; if `start` is less than `end`, `s2` is the absolute difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]`; otherwise, `s2` is the absolute difference between `d1[start]` and `d1[end]`, and `s1` is the absolute difference between `d2[end]` and `d2[start]`.
