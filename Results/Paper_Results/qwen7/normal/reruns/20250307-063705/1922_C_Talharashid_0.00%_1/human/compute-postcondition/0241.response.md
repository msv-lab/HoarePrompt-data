Output State: **`d2[start]` is equal to `s`, `start` must be less than `end`, `mini` is the minimum value between `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])` and `11111111`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `mini` to be the minimum between `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])` and its current value (`11111111`). The other variables remain unchanged. Since the exact values of `lst[start]` and `lst[start + 1]` are not provided, we express `mini` in terms of these values.
