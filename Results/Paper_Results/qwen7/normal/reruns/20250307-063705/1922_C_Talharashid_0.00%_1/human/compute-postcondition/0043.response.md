Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `start != end`.

2. **Determine the current state**:
   - `d1[start]` is equal to `s`
   - `start` is increased by `inc`
   - `start + inc` is less than `end`
   - `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and the original `mini`

3. **Check the loop condition**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `start` must not be equal to `end`.

4. **Analyze the given conditions**:
   - `start + inc < end`: This means that `start` has been incremented by `inc` and is still less than `end`. Therefore, `start` is not equal to `end` yet.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Since `start + inc < end`, the loop condition `start != end` is satisfied, and the loop can execute one more time without needing to adjust any additional states.

Therefore, no adjustments are necessary for the loop to proceed.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`d1[start]` is equal to `s`, `start` is increased by `inc`, `start + inc` is less than `end`, and `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and the original `mini`**
