Output State: **`i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `start` is start integer - 1, `end` is an input integer**.

The value of `start` is decremented by 1, while the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `start` is now one less than its original value, which is the input integer provided minus 1.
