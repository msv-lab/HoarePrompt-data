Postcondition: **`mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and 11111111, `start` is `len(lst) - 3`, `end` is 0, `d1[start]` contains the cumulative sum `s` after all iterations, `inc` is -1, `m` remains 0, `s` is reset to 0, `mini` is not equal to `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`**
