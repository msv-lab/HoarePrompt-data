Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `m` is 0, `start` is an input integer decremented by the total number of iterations times 2, `end` is an input integer minus the total number of iterations, `s` is 0, `d1` is an empty defaultdict, `d2` is a defaultdict initialized to int, `s2` is the absolute difference between either `d2[start]` and `d2[end]` (if `start < end`) or `d1[start]` and `d1[end]` (if `start >= end`), `s1` is the absolute difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[start]` if `start < end`, otherwise `s1` is the absolute difference between `d2[end]` and `d2[start]`, and `i` is an input integer plus 1.
Code of the loop:
while start != end:
    mini = 11111111
    if start + 1 < len(lst):
        mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1]), mini)
    if start - 1 > -1:
        mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1]), mini)
    if mini == abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc]):
        s += 1
    else:
        s += abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])
    start += inc
    d1[start] = s


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `m` remains 0, `start` is decremented by the total number of iterations times 2 plus 1, `end` is decremented by the total number of iterations minus 1, `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` and 11111111, `d1[start]` is assigned the value of `s`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `m` remains 0, `start` is decremented by the total number of iterations times 2 plus 1, `end` is decremented by the total number of iterations minus 1, `mini` is the minimum of abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1]) and 11111111, `d1[start]` is assigned the value of either `s` or `s + 1`, and `start` must be different from `end`. If `start - 1 > -1`, then `start` is further decremented by 1, `end` is decremented by 1, and `mini` is updated to the minimum of abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1]) and 11111111. Additionally, if the if condition is false, `s` is incremented by abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1]); `start` is incremented by `inc`. `d1[start]` is now set to the value of either `s` or `s + 1`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `d1[start]` is assigned the value of `s`, `mini` remains the minimum value between `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])`, `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])`, and 11111111, and `start` must still be different from `end`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
