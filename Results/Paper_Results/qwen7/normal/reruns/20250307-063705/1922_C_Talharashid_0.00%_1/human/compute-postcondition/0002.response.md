Output State: **`i` is 0; `t` must be a positive integer; `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory int.**

Explanation: The code initializes a `defaultdict` with an integer factory function. This means that `d1` is now a dictionary-like object where any key that does not exist will default to an integer value (0). The values of `i` and `t` remain unchanged from their initial states.
