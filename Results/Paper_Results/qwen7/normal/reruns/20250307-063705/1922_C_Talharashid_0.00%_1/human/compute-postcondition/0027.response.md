Output State: **`mini` is the minimum of abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1]) and the previous value of `mini`; `start` is less than `end`; `start` is less than len(lst) - 1; `start` is greater than 0; `start` is increased by `inc`; `s` is increased by either 1 (if `mini` equals abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])) or abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc]) (if `mini` does not equal abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])).**

This means that the variable `start` has been incremented by `inc`. All other conditions and relationships between variables remain the same as before the execution of the code.
