Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `m`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i < m`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `m` must be greater than 0.
   - `start` is `start - 1`.
   - `end` is an integer obtained from the input split by space and decreased by 1.
   - `s` is 0.
   - `s1` is the absolute difference between `d2[end]` and `d2[start]`.
   - `s2` is either the absolute difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]` (if `start < end`) or the absolute difference between `d1[start]` and `d1[end]` (if `start >= end`).

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must still be less than `m`. Therefore, `m` remains unchanged.

Given these points, we can now formulate the new state for the start of the next iteration:

- `m` remains greater than 0.
- `start` is updated to `start - 1`.
- `end` remains the same as it was obtained from the input and does not change within the loop.
- `s` remains 0.
- `s1` remains the same as it was calculated based on the previous values of `start` and `end`.
- `s2` remains the same as it was calculated based on the previous values of `start` and `end`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `start` is `start - 1 - 1` (i.e., `start - 2`), `end` is an integer obtained from the input split by space and decreased by 1, `s` is 0, `s1` is the absolute difference between `d2[end]` and `d2[start - 2]`, `s2` is either the absolute difference between `d2[start - 2]` and `d2[end]` (if `start - 2 < end`) or the absolute difference between `d1[start - 2]` and `d1[end]` (if `start - 2 >= end`).**
