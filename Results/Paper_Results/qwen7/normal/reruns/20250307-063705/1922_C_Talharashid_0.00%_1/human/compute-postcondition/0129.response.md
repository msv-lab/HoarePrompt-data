Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variables `i` and `m`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `m`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `m` must be greater than 0
   - `start` is start integer - 1
   - `end` is end integer - 1
   - `s` is 0
   - `s2` is either `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])` or `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])` depending on whether `start < end` or not.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and the loop continues as long as `i < m`, after the first iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it `i = 1`.
   - The value of `m` remains unchanged as it is a condition for the loop to continue, but it must still be greater than 0.
   - The values of `start`, `end`, `s`, and `s2` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head and their values are determined outside the loop.

5. **State at the start of the next iteration**:
   - `i` is now 1 (since it was incremented by 1 from the previous iteration).
   - `m` must still be greater than 0.
   - `start` remains start integer - 1.
   - `end` remains end integer - 1.
   - `s` remains 0.
   - `s2` remains either `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])` or `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])` depending on whether `start < end` or not.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is 1, `m` must be greater than 0, `start` is start integer - 1, `end` is end integer - 1, `s` is 0, `s2` is either `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])` or `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])` depending on whether `start < end` or not.**
