Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0; `start` is an input integer decremented by 6; `end` is an input integer decremented by 2; `s` is 0; `s2` is the absolute difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]` if `start < end`, otherwise `s2` is the absolute difference between `d1[start]` and `d1[end]`; `s1` is the absolute difference between `d2[end]` and `d2[start]`; `i` is incremented by 1; `start` and `end` are updated to new integer values from user input.**

Explanation: The code `start, end = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `start` and `end`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the values of `m`, `s`, `s2`, `s1`, and `i` stay the same, but `start` and `end` are now updated to the new integer values provided by the user.
