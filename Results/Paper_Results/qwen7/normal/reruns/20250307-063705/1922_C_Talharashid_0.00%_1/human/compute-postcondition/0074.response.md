Postcondition: `end` is 0, `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and `11111111`, `start` is equal to `len(lst) - 2`, `s` is 0, `d1[start]` is equal to `s`, `inc` is -1, and `start` is less than `len(lst)` - 1.

This postcondition summarizes that regardless of whether the condition `start - 1 > -1` is true or false, the final state of the variables will be as described. If the condition is true, `start` will be set to `len(lst) - 2`. If the condition is false, `start` remains as `len(lst) - 1`, but the other variables' values remain unchanged according to the given preconditions.
