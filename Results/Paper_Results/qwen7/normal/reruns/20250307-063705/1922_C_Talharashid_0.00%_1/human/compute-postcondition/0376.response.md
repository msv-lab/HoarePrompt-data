Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is `while start != end:`. Therefore, the variables that can be adjusted are `start` and `end`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: For the loop to continue, `start` must not be equal to `end`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `start` is `len(lst) - 2`
   - `end` is 0
   - `d1[start]` contains the cumulative sum `s` after all iterations
   - `inc` is -1
   - `m` remains 0
   - `s` is either 1 or updated to `abs(lst[len(lst) - 3] - lst[len(lst) - 4])`
   - `d2[start]` is equal to `s`
   - `mini` is equal to `abs(lst[len(lst) - 3] - lst[len(lst) - 2])` if the if condition was true, otherwise `mini` is equal to `abs(lst[len(lst) - 3] - lst[len(lst) - 4])`

4. **Check the current values**:
   - `start` is `len(lst) - 2`
   - `end` is 0

5. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - Since `start` is `len(lst) - 2` and `end` is 0, `start` is not equal to `end`. However, to ensure the loop continues, we need to make sure that `start` and `end` are such that they do not become equal in the next iteration.

Given that `start` is `len(lst) - 2` and `end` is 0, the loop will continue as long as `start` is not equal to `end`. No adjustment is needed because the loop condition is already satisfied.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`start` is `len(lst) - 2`, `end` is 0, `d1[start]` contains the cumulative sum `s` after all iterations, `inc` is -1, `m` remains 0, `s` is either 1 or updated to `abs(lst[len(lst) - 3] - lst[len(lst) - 4])`, `d2[start]` is equal to `s`, and `mini` is equal to `abs(lst[len(lst) - 3] - lst[len(lst) - 2])` if the if condition was true, otherwise `mini` is equal to `abs(lst[len(lst) - 3] - lst[len(lst) - 4])`**
