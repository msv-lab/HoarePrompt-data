Output State: **`i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `start` is start integer - 1, `end` is end integer - 1**

Explanation: The code `end -= 1` decrements the value of `end` by 1. The other variables (`i`, `m`, and `start`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes `end` being reduced by 1 from its original value.
