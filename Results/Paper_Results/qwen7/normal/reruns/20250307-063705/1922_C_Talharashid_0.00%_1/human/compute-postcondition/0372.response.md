Output State: **`mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[len(lst) - 3] - lst[len(lst) - 4])` and 11111111, `start` is `len(lst) - 3`, `end` is 0, `d1[start]` contains the cumulative sum `s` after all iterations, `inc` is -1, `m` remains 0, `s` is updated to `abs(lst[len(lst) - 3] - lst[len(lst) - 4])`, `mini` is not equal to `abs(lst[len(lst) - 3] - lst[len(lst) - 2])`**

Explanation:
- The variable `s` is updated by adding the absolute difference between `lst[start]` (which is `lst[len(lst) - 3]`) and `lst[start + inc]` (where `inc` is -1, so it's `lst[len(lst) - 4]`). This means `s` now holds the value of `abs(lst[len(lst) - 3] - lst[len(lst) - 4])`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
