Output State: **`i` is 1, `m` must be greater than 0, `start` is `start` - 1, `end` is an input integer - 1, `s` is 0, `s1` is `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])`, `s2` is `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `s2` to `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the updated state includes the new value for `s2` while keeping the rest of the variables in their original conditions.
