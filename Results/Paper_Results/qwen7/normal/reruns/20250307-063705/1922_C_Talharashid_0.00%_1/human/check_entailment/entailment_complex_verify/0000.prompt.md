You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n cities located on the number line, the i -th city is in the point
a_i . The coordinates of the cities are given in ascending order, so a_1 < a_2
< \dots < a_n .

The distance between two cities x and y is equal to |a_x - a_y| .

For each city i , let's define the closest city j as the city such that the
distance between i and j is not greater than the distance between i and each
other city k . For example, if the cities are located in points [0, 8, 12, 15,
20] , then:

  * the closest city to the city 1 is the city 2 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 2 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 3 is the city 4 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 4 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 5 is the city 4 . 

The cities are located in such a way that for every city, the closest city is
unique. For example, it is impossible for the cities to be situated in points
[1, 2, 3] , since this would mean that the city 2 has two closest cities (1
and 3 , both having distance 1 ).

You can travel between cities. Suppose you are currently in the city x . Then
you can perform one of the following actions:

  * travel to any other city y , paying |a_x - a_y| coins; 
  * travel to the city which is the closest to x , paying 1 coin. 

You are given m queries. In each query, you will be given two cities, and you
have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from
one city to the other city.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case is given in the following format:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains one integer m (1 \le m \le 10^5 ); 
  * then m lines follow; the i -th of them contains two integers x_i and y_i (1 \le x_i, y_i \le n ; x_i \ne y_i ), denoting that in the i -th query, you have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from the city x_i to the city y_i . 

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 ; 
  * the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 . 

Output

For each query, print one integer — the minimum number of coins you have to
spend.

Example

Input

    1
    
    5
    
    0 8 12 15 20
    
    5
    
    1 4
    
    1 5
    
    3 4
    
    3 2
    
    5 1

Output

    3
    8
    1
    4
    14
    
Note

Let's consider the first two queries in the example from the statement:

  * in the first query, you are initially in the city 1 . You can travel to the closest city (which is the city 2 ), paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 3 ) again, paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 4 ) again, paying 1 coin. In total, you spend 3 coins to get from the city 1 to the city 4 ; 
  * in the second query, you can use the same way to get from the city 1 to the city 4 , and then spend 5 coins to travel from the city 4 to the city 5 .

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of queries on a given list of integers. It first calculates the number of adjacent pairs with a specific difference for the entire list and for its reverse. Then, for each query, it determines the minimum count of such pairs between two specified indices. The function outputs the result for each query.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Specifically, the program attempts to precompute distances to the closest city for each city but does not actually solve the problem as described. Here’s why:

1. **Incorrect Precomputation**: The program tries to precompute distances to the closest city using `d1` and `d2`, but these computations do not align with the problem requirements. The logic inside the loops is flawed and does not correctly determine the closest city for each position.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Queries**: After precomputing, the program attempts to handle queries by comparing values in `d1` and `d2`. However, this approach does not account for the actual closest city for each query, leading to incorrect results.

3. **Lack of Closest City Identification**: The program does not properly identify the closest city for each position. Instead, it seems to be calculating some kind of cumulative distance, which is not relevant to the problem.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
- Identify the closest city for each city.
- Handle queries by determining the minimum cost to travel between two cities using the closest city rule.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def closest_city(a):
    n = len(a)
    closest = [-1] * n
    for i in range(n):
        min_dist = float('inf')
        closest_city_index = -1
        for j in range(n):
            if i != j:
                dist = abs(a[i] - a[j])
                if dist < min_dist:
                    min_dist = dist
                    closest_city_index = j
        closest[i] = closest_city_index
    return closest

def min_coins_to_travel(a, closest, x, y):
    if x == y:
        return 0
    if x < y:
        return 1 + min_coins_to_travel(a, closest, closest[x], y)
    else:
        return 1 + min_coins_to_travel(a, closest, closest[y], x)

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        m = int(input())
        closest = closest_city(a)
        for _ in range(m):
            x, y = map(int, input().split())
            x -= 1
            y -= 1
            print(min_coins_to_travel(a, closest, x, y))

func()
```

This corrected program correctly identifies the closest city for each city and handles queries by determining the minimum cost to travel between two cities using the closest city rule.
