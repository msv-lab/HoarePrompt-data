Postcondition: **`mini` is the minimum of abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1]) and the original `mini`, `start` is less than `end`, `start` is less than len(lst) - 1, `start` is greater than 0, `start` is increased by `inc`, `s` is increased by either 1 (if `mini` equals abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])) or abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc]) (if `mini` does not equal abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])), `d1[start]` is equal to `s`, `start + inc` is less than `end`**.

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block. It indicates that `mini` is updated to be the minimum of its original value and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + 1]`, while other conditions and variable updates remain unchanged as specified in both the if and else parts.
