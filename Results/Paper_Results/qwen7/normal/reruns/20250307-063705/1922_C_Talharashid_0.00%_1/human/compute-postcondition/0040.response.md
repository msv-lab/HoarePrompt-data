Postcondition: `mini` is the minimum of abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1]) and the original `mini`, `start` is less than `end`, `start` is less than len(lst) - 1, `start` is greater than 0, `start` is increased by `inc`, `d1[start]` is equal to `s`, `start + inc` is less than `end`, and `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]` are used to update `mini` if the condition `start - 1 > -1` is true. If `mini` equals abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc]), `s` is increased by 1; otherwise, `s` is increased by abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc]).
