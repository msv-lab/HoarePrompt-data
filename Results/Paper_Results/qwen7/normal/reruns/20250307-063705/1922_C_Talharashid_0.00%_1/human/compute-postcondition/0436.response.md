Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `start` is `start - 1`, `end` is the integer value of the second input, `s` is 0, `s1` is the absolute difference between either `d1[end]` and `d1[start - 1]` or `d2[end]` and `d2[start - 1]` depending on whether `start - 3 < end` or `start - 3 >= end`, `s2` is the absolute difference between either `d2[start - 1]` and `d2[end]` or `d1[start - 1]` and `d1[end]` depending on whether `start - 3 < end` or `start - 3 >= end`**

Explanation: The line `start -= 1` decrements the value of `start` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The conditions for `s1` and `s2` are adjusted according to the new value of `start`.
