Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `m`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < m`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `m` must be greater than 0.
   - `start` is an input integer decremented by 2.
   - `end` is an input integer decremented by 1.
   - `s` is 0.
   - If `start` is less than `end`, `s2` is the absolute difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]`; otherwise, `s2` is the absolute difference between `d1[start]` and `d1[end]`, and `s1` is the absolute difference between `d2[end]` and `d2[start]`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, `i` will be `i + 1` in the next iteration.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must still be less than `m`. Therefore, `m` remains unchanged.

5. **Update the other states**:
   - `start` and `end` remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop.
   - `s` remains 0 because it is not modified within the loop.
   - `s1` and `s2` remain as they were in the previous iteration unless the loop body modifies them, but since the loop body is omitted, these values remain the same.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `m` remains greater than 0.
- `start` remains an input integer decremented by 2.
- `end` remains an input integer decremented by 1.
- `s` remains 0.
- `s1` and `s2` remain as they were in the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`m` must be greater than 0; `start` is an input integer decremented by 2; `end` is an input integer decremented by 1; `s` is 0; `s1` and `s2` remain as they were in the previous iteration.**
