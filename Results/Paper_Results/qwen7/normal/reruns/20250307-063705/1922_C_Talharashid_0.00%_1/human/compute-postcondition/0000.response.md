Output State: **t is an input integer, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, a is a list of n integers in strictly increasing order such that 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9, m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5.**

The code `t = int(input())` takes an input and converts it to an integer, updating the value of `t`. The other variables (`n`, `a`, and `m`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
