Output State: **`end` is 0, `mini` is 11111111, `start` is equal to `len(lst) - 1`, `s` is 0, `d1[start]` is equal to `s`, `inc` is -1**

Explanation: The line `mini = 11111111` updates the value of `mini` to 11111111, overriding its previous value which was the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and 11111111. All other variables remain unchanged.
