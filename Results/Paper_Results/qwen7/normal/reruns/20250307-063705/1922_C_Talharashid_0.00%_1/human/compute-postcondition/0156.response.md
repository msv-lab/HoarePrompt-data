Output State: **`i` is `m`, `m` must be greater than 0, `start` is `start` - 1, `end` is an input integer - 1, `s` is 0, `s2` is either `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])` or `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])` depending on whether `start < end` or not; `d1` is initialized as a defaultdict of int, `d2` is a defaultdict of int.**

Explanation: The code initializes `d2` as a defaultdict of int. This means that `d2` is now a dictionary that automatically assigns an integer value (defaulting to 0) when a key is accessed that does not already exist in the dictionary. The values of other variables remain unchanged.
