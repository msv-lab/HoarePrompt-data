Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0; `start` is an input integer decremented by 4; `end` is an input integer decremented by 2; `s` is 0; `start` is decreased by 2.**

Explanation: The code `end -= 1` decrements the value of `end` by 1. Initially, `end` was an input integer decremented by 1. After the decrement, `end` is now an input integer decremented by 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
