Output State: **`mini` is the minimum of abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1]) and the previous value of `mini`; `start` is less than `end`; `start` is less than len(lst) - 1; `start` is greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code updates `mini` to be the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and the previous value of `mini`. The other conditions and the value of `start` remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes the new value of `mini` based on the comparison, while the other conditions and `start` value are preserved.
