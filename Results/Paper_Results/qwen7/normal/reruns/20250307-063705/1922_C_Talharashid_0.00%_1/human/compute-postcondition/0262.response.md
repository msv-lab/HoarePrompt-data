Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0; `start` is an input integer decremented by 2 and its current value is less than `end`, which is an input integer decremented by 1; `end` is an input integer decremented by 1; `s` is 0; `s1` is the absolute difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[start]`**.

Explanation: The code calculates the absolute difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[start]` and assigns it to `s1`. However, since `d1` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot provide a specific numerical value for `s1`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
