Output State: **`d2[start]` is equal to `s + 1`, `start` must be less than `end`, and `mini` is the minimum value between `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and `11111111`.**

Explanation: The value of `s` is incremented by 1, so `d2[start]` now equals `s + 1`. The conditions involving `start`, `end`, and `mini` remain unchanged.
