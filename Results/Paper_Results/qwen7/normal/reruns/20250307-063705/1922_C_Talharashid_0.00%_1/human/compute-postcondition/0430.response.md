Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `start` is `start - 3`, `end` is `end - 1`, `s` is 0, `s1` is the absolute difference between `d2[end]` and `d2[start]`, `s2` is the absolute difference between `d1[start]` and `d1[end]`**.

Explanation: The code updates `s2` to be the absolute difference between `d1[start]` and `d1[end]`. The values of `m`, `start`, `end`, `s`, `s1`, and `d2` remain unchanged from their initial conditions. The precondition that `m` must be greater than 0, `start` is `start - 3`, and `end` is `end - 1` still holds true. The value of `s1` remains as the absolute difference between `d2[end]` and `d2[start]`, and now `s2` is updated to the absolute difference between `d1[start]` and `d1[end]`.
