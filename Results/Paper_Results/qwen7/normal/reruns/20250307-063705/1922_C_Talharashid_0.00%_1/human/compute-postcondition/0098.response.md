To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition of the `while` loop, which is `start != end`.

Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `end` is 0.
   - `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])`, `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])`, and `11111111`.
   - `start` is equal to `len(lst) - 3` or `len(lst) - 2`.
   - `s` is either `s + 1` or `2 * abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`.
   - `d1[start]` is equal to `s`.
   - `d2[start]` is `s`.
   - `inc` is -1.
   - `start` is updated to `start - 1`.
   - `d2[start]` is set to `s`.

2. **Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop continues as long as `start != end`.
   - Given that `end` is 0, the loop will continue as long as `start` is not 0.

3. **Current Value of `start`:**
   - `start` is either `len(lst) - 3` or `len(lst) - 2`.

4. **Adjusting the State:**
   - To ensure the loop executes one more time, `start` must be decremented from its current value to a value that is still not equal to `end` (which is 0).
   - Since `start` is either `len(lst) - 3` or `len(lst) - 2`, decrementing `start` by 1 will result in `start` being `len(lst) - 4` or `len(lst) - 3`, respectively, both of which are not equal to 0.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `start` to ensure it is not equal to `end`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`end` is 0, `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])`, `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])`, and `11111111`, `start` must be `len(lst) - 3` or `len(lst) - 2` and decremented by 1, `s` is either `s + 1` or `2 * abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, `d1[start]` is equal to `s`, `d2[start]` is `s`, `inc` is -1, `start` is updated to `start - 1`, `d2[start]` is set to `s**
