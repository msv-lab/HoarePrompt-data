Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `t`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `t`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `m` will be 0.
   - `start` will be an input integer decremented by the total number of iterations times 2.
   - `end` will be an input integer decremented by the total number of iterations times 1.
   - `s` will be 0.
   - `s2` will be the absolute difference between either `d2[start]` and `d2[end]` (if `start < end`) or `d1[start]` and `d1[end]` (if `start >= end`).
   - `s1` will be the absolute difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[start]` if `start < end`, otherwise `s1` will be the absolute difference between `d2[end]` and `d2[start]`.
   - `i` will be incremented by the total number of iterations.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by the total number of iterations at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by the total number of iterations from the previous state.
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is the upper limit of the loop.

Given that `i` is incremented by the total number of iterations at the end of each iteration, let's denote the total number of iterations as `k`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + k`.

Since the loop condition is `i < t`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i + k` must still be less than `t`.

**State at the start of the next iteration**:
- `m` is still 0.
- `start` is still the input integer decremented by the total number of iterations times 2.
- `end` is still the input integer decremented by the total number of iterations times 1.
- `s` is still 0.
- `s2` is still the absolute difference between either `d2[start]` and `d2[end]` (if `start < end`) or `d1[start]` and `d1[end]` (if `start >= end`).
- `s1` is still the absolute difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[start]` if `start < end`, otherwise `s1` is the absolute difference between `d2[end]` and `d2[start]`.
- `i` will be incremented by the total number of iterations, so `i` becomes `i + k`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`m` is 0, `start` is an input integer decremented by the total number of iterations times 2, `end` is an input integer decremented by the total number of iterations times 1, `s` is 0, `s2` is the absolute difference between either `d2[start]` and `d2[end]` (if `start < end`) or `d1[start]` and `d1[end]` (if `start >= end`), `s1` is the absolute difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[start]` if `start < end`, otherwise `s1` is the absolute difference between `d2[end]` and `d2[start]`, and `i` is incremented by the total number of iterations.**

In a more concise format:
State: **`m` is 0, `start` is an input integer decremented by the total number of iterations times 2, `end` is an input integer decremented by the total number of iterations times 1, `s` is 0, `s2` is the absolute difference between either `d2[start]` and `d2[end]` (if `start < end`) or `d1[start]` and `d1[end]` (if `start >= end`), `s1` is the absolute difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[start]` if `start < end`, otherwise `s1` is the absolute difference between `d2[end]` and `d2[start]`, and `i` is incremented by the total number of iterations.**
