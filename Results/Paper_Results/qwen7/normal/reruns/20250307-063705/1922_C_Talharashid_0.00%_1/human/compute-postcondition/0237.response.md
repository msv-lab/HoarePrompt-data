Output State: **`start` is increased by `inc`, `mini` is 11111111, unless `start - 1` is greater than or equal to 0, in which case `mini` is updated to the minimum value between `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and 11111111. Additionally, `s` is increased by `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` if the else part is executed, and incremented by 1 if the if part is executed.**

Explanation: The code `start += inc` increments the value of `start` by `inc`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. The conditions related to `mini` and `s` remain as they were before the execution of this line, meaning `mini` will only be updated if `start - 1` is greater than or equal to 0, and `s` will be updated based on the conditions specified in the postcondition.
