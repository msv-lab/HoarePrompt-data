Output State: **`s` is `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, `start` is `-1`, `i` is `m`, `d1[start]` is `0`, `d2` is a defaultdict of integers, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from input, `inc` is `-1`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `s` by adding the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`. Given the initial state, `start` is `-1`, and `inc` is `-1`, which means `start + inc` would be `-2`, which is out of bounds for the list `lst` (since the current value of `start` is less than the length of `lst` - 1). Therefore, the value of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` is considered as `0` because `lst[start + inc]` does not exist and the operation defaults to `0`. All other variables remain unchanged.
