Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `start` is `start - 3`, `end` is an input integer minus 1, `s` is 0, `s1` is the absolute difference between `d2[end]` and `d2[start - 2]`, `s2` is either the absolute difference between `d2[start - 2]` and `d2[end]` (if `start - 2 < end`) or the absolute difference between `d1[start - 2]` and `d1[end]` (if `start - 2 >= end`).**

Explanation: The line `start -= 1` decrements the value of `start` by 1. Initially, `start` was `start - 2`. After decrementing, `start` becomes `start - 3`. All other variables remain unchanged.
