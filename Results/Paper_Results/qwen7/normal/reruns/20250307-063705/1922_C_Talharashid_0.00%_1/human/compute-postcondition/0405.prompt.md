Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `m` remains 0, `start` is decremented by the total number of iterations times 2 plus 1, `end` is 0, `d1[start]` contains the cumulative sum `s` after all iterations, `mini` remains the minimum value between `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])`, `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])`, and 11111111, `s` is reset to 0, `start` is set to `len(lst) - 1`, `inc` is -1.
Code of the loop:
while start != end:
    mini = 11111111
    if start + 1 < len(lst):
        mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1]), mini)
    if start - 1 > -1:
        mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1]), mini)
    if mini == abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc]):
        s += 1
    else:
        s += abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])
    start += inc
    d2[start] = s


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `start` is `len(lst) - 2`, `end` is 0, `d1[start]` contains the cumulative sum `s` after all iterations, `inc` is -1, `m` remains 0, `s` is either 1 or updated to `abs(lst[len(lst) - 3] - lst[len(lst) - 4])`, `d2[start]` is equal to `s`, and `mini` is equal to `abs(lst[len(lst) - 3] - lst[len(lst) - 4])` if the if condition was true, otherwise `mini` is equal to `abs(lst[len(lst) - 3] - lst[len(lst) - 2])`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `start` is `len(lst) - 3`, `end` is 0, `d1[start]` contains the cumulative sum `s`, `inc` is -1, `m` remains 0, `s` is either 1 or updated to `abs(lst[len(lst) - 3] - lst[len(lst) - 4])` and can be `s + 1` or `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, `d2[start]` is equal to `s`, and `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and 11111111. If `start - 1 > -1`, `mini` is updated to the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and 11111111. Otherwise, `mini` remains 11111111. `d2[start]` is now equal to `s`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `start` is `len(lst) - 4 + inc`, `end` is 0, `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[len(lst) - 4 + inc] - lst[len(lst) - 3])`, `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])`, and `11111111`, `d2[start]` is `1`, and `s` remains unchanged (which is 1).


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
