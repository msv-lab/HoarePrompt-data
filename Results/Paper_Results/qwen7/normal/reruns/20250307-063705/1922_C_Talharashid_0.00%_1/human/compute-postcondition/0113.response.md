Output State: `end` is 0, `mini` is the minimum value found during the entire loop execution, `start` is 0, `s` is the sum of increments calculated throughout the loop, `d1[start]` is equal to `s`, `d2[start]` is `s`, `inc` is -1.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `start` will eventually reach 0 (since it starts from `len(lst) - 1` and decrements by 1 each iteration). The variable `mini` will hold the minimum value of the absolute differences between consecutive elements found during the loop execution. The variable `s` accumulates the sum of increments based on the comparison of `mini` with `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`. The dictionaries `d1` and `d2` are updated with the value of `s` at each `start` position. The variable `inc` remains -1 as specified in the loop initialization.
