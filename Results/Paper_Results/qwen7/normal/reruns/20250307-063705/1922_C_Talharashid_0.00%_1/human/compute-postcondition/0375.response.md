Output State: **`start` is `len(lst) - 2`, `end` is 0, `d1[start]` contains the cumulative sum `s` after all iterations, `inc` is -1, `m` remains 0, `s` is either 1 or updated to `abs(lst[len(lst) - 3] - lst[len(lst) - 4])`, `d2[start]` is equal to `s`, and `mini` is equal to `abs(lst[len(lst) - 3] - lst[len(lst) - 4])` if the if condition was true, otherwise `mini` is equal to `abs(lst[len(lst) - 3] - lst[len(lst) - 2])`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `s` to `d2[start]`. Since `start` is `len(lst) - 2`, `d2[len(lst) - 2]` is set to `s`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
