Postcondition: `m` must be greater than 0, `start` is `start - 1`, `end` is an integer obtained from the input split by space and decreased by 1, `s` is 0, and either `s2` is the absolute difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]` if `start < end`, or `s1` is the absolute difference between `d2[end]` and `d2[start]`, and `s2` is the absolute difference between `d1[start]` and `d1[end]`, and `start` is greater than or equal to `end`.
