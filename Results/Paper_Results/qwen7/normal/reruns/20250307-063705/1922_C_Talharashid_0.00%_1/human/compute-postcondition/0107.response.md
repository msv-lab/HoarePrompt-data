Output State: **`end` is 0, `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])` and 11111111, `start` is `len(lst) - 5` or `len(lst) - 4` and has been decremented by 1, `s` is now `s + abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, `d1[start]` is equal to `s`, `d2[start]` is `s`, `inc` is -1, `start` is updated to `start - 1`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `s` by adding `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` to the current value of `s`. Since `inc` is -1, it means we are looking at `lst[start + (-1)]` which is `lst[start - 1]`. The values of other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state, except for `s`, which is now `s + abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])`.
