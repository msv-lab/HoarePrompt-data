Output State: **Postcondition: `m` must be greater than 2, `start` is `start - 3`, `end` is `end - 2`, `s` is 0, `s1` is the absolute difference between either `d1[end]` and `d1[start]` or `d2[end]` and `d2[start]` depending on whether `start - 3 < end` or `start - 3 >= end`, and `s2` is the absolute difference between either `d2[start]` and `d2[end]` or `d1[start]` and `d1[end]` depending on whether `start - 3 < end` or `start - 3 >= end`.**

In this final output state, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `m` will be greater than 2 because the loop runs `m` times. The `start` and `end` values will have been decremented by 3 and 2 respectively for each iteration, leading to the described values. The variable `s` remains 0 as it is reinitialized to 0 at the beginning of each iteration. The values of `s1` and `s2` depend on the relative positions of `start` and `end` after all iterations, following the logic provided in the problem description.
