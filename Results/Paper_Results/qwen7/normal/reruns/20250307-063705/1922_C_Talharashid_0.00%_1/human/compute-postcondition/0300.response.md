Output State: **`m` is 0, `start` is an input integer decremented by the total number of iterations times 2, `end` is an input integer decremented by the total number of iterations times 1, `s` is 0, `d1` is an empty defaultdict, `d2` is a defaultdict initialized to int, `s2` is the absolute difference between either `d2[start]` and `d2[end]` (if `start < end`) or `d1[start]` and `d1[end]` (if `start >= end`), `s1` is the absolute difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[start]` if `start < end`, otherwise `s1` is the absolute difference between `d2[end]` and `d2[start]`, and `i` is an input integer plus 1; a list of integers is taken as input.**

Explanation: The code `lst = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from the input, converts each integer to an int, and stores them in a list named `lst`. This operation does not affect the values of the existing variables (`m`, `start`, `end`, `s`, `d1`, `d2`, `s2`, `s1`, `i`). Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged, and the list `lst` is created based on the input.
