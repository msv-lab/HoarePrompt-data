Output State: `m` remains 0, `start` is decremented by the total number of iterations times 2 plus 1, `end` is decremented by the total number of iterations minus 1, `s` is the sum of the absolute differences calculated during each iteration of the loop, `d1` is a dictionary where the keys are the values of `start` after each iteration and the values are the corresponding sums of `s` calculated up to that point, `d2` is a dictionary initialized to int, `s2` is the absolute difference between either `d2[start]` and `d2[end]` (if `start < end`) or `d1[start]` and `d1[end]` (if `start >= end`), `s1` is the absolute difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[start]` if `start < end`, otherwise `s1` is the absolute difference between `d2[end]` and `d2[start]`, and `i` is the input integer plus 1.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, `m` stays the same, `start` and `end` are adjusted based on the total number of iterations, `s` contains the cumulative sum of the absolute differences calculated during the loop, `d1` records the value of `s` at each step of `start`, and `d2` and `s1`, `s2` are used to track additional differences as described but do not change significantly unless explicitly updated within the loop.
