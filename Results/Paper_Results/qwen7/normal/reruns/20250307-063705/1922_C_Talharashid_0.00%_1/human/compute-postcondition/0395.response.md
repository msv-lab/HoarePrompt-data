Output State: **`start` is `len(lst) - 4`, `end` is 0, `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[len(lst) - 4] - lst[len(lst) - 3])` and `11111111`, and `mini` is updated to `min(abs(lst[len(lst) - 4] - lst[len(lst) - 3]), mini)`**.

This means that the value of `mini` is now the minimum between its previous value (which was the minimum of `abs(lst[len(lst) - 4] - lst[len(lst) - 3])` and `11111111`) and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
