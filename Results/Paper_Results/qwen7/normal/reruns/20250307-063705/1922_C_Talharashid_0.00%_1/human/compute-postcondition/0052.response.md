Output State: **`d1[start]` is equal to `s + abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, `start` is increased by `inc`, `start + inc` is less than `end`, and `mini` is equal to the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and `11111111`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `s` is updated by adding the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]` to the current value of `s`.
- The variable `start` is increased by `inc`.
- The condition `start + inc < end` remains true.
- The variable `mini` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. It is still the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and `11111111`.
