Output State: **`mini` is the minimum distance found between any two consecutive elements in the list `lst` during the entire loop execution, `s` is the sum of distances as per the conditions inside the loop, `start` is equal to `end` (since the loop stops when `start == end`), `i` is `m` and must be greater than 0, `d1[start]` is 0, `d2` is a defaultdict where keys are indices up to `end` and values are corresponding `s` values, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from input, `inc` is -1, `m` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `m = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `m`. This changes the value of `m` to the input integer, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
