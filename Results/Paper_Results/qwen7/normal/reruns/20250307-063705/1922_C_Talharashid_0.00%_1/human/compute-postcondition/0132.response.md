Output State: **`i` is 1, `m` must be greater than 0, `start` is `start` - 1, `end` is an input integer - 1, `s` is 0, `s2` is either `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])` or `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])` depending on whether `start < end` or not.**

Explanation: The code `end -= 1` decrements the value of `end` by 1. Since `end` was originally an input integer, now it is one less than the original input integer. All other variables (`i`, `m`, `start`, `s`, and `s2`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
