Postcondition: `m` must be greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `start` is `start - 1`, `end` is `end - 1`, `s` is 0, `s1` is the absolute difference between either `d1[end]` and `d1[start]` or `d2[end]` and `d2[start]` depending on whether `start - 3 < end` or `start - 3 >= end`, `s2` is the absolute difference between either `d2[start]` and `d2[end]` or `d1[start]` and `d1[end]` depending on whether `start - 3 < end` or `start - 3 >= end`.

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block. If `start < end`, `s1` is the absolute difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[start]` or `d2[end]` and `d2[start]` based on the condition `start - 3 < end` or `start - 3 >= end`. Similarly, `s2` is the absolute difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]` or `d1[start]` and `d1[end]` based on the same condition. If `start >= end`, `s1` becomes `abs(d2[end] - d2[start])` and `s2` becomes `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`.
