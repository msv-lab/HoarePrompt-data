Postcondition: **`mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])` and `11111111`, `i` is `m`, `m` must be greater than 0, `start` must be 2, `end` must be `len(lst) - 1`, `s` is `abs(lst[0] - lst[1]) + 1`, `d1[start]` is `s`, `d2` is a defaultdict of integers, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from input, `inc` is 1, `start - 1` is less than `len(lst)`**.

This postcondition indicates that after the execution of the if-else block, `mini` will be updated to the minimum value between `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])` and `11111111`, while all other variables retain their initial conditions as specified in the precondition, unless explicitly modified within the if block.
