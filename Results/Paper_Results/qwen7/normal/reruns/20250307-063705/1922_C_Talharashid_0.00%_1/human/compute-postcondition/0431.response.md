Postcondition: `m` must be greater than 0, `start` is `start - 3`, `end` is `end - 1`, `s` is 0, `s1` is the absolute difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[start]` if `start < end`, otherwise `s1` is the absolute difference between `d2[end]` and `d2[start]`, and `s2` is the absolute difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]` if `start - 2 < end`, otherwise `s2` is the absolute difference between `d1[start]` and `d1[end]`.
