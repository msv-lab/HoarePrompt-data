To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the condition of the `while` loop head, which is `start != end`.

Here are the relevant states before the loop:
- `m` is 0
- `start` is an input integer decremented by the total number of iterations times 2
- `end` is an input integer minus the total number of iterations
- `s` is 0
- `d1` is an empty defaultdict
- `d2` is a defaultdict initialized to int
- `s2` is the absolute difference between either `d2[start]` and `d2[end]` (if `start < end`) or `d1[start]` and `d1[end]` (if `start >= end`)
- `s1` is the absolute difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[start]` if `start < end`, otherwise `s1` is the absolute difference between `d2[end]` and `d2[start]`
- `i` is an input integer plus 1

The loop will execute the first time if `start` is not equal to `end`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `start` and `end` are different.

Given that `start` is an input integer decremented by the total number of iterations times 2, and `end` is an input integer minus the total number of iterations, we need to make sure that these two values are not equal.

Since the exact values of the input integers are not specified, we can assume that the initial values of `start` and `end` are such that they are different. However, to ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure that the initial conditions do not result in `start == end`.

Thus, the only states that need to be adjusted are related to `start` and `end`. We need to ensure that `start` and `end` are not equal.

State: **`m` is 0, `start` is an input integer decremented by the total number of iterations times 2, `end` is an input integer minus the total number of iterations, and `start` must not be equal to `end`**
