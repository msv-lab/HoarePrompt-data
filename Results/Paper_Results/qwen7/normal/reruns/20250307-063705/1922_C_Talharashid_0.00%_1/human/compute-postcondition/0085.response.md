Output State: **`end` is 0, `mini` is 11111111, `start` is equal to `len(lst) - 3` or `len(lst) - 2`, `s` is either 1 or `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, `d1[start]` is equal to `s`, `d2[start]` is `s`, `inc` is -1**

Explanation: The line `mini = 11111111` assigns the value 11111111 to the variable `mini`. This changes the value of `mini` from its previous value, which was the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` and `11111111`, to 11111111. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
