Output State: **`end` is 0, `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])` and 11111111, `start` is `len(lst) - 5` or `len(lst) - 4`, `s` is updated to either `s + 1` or `s + abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, `d1[start]` is equal to `s`, `d2[start]` is `s`, `inc` is -1, `start` is updated to `start - 1`, `start` is incremented by -1, `d2[start]` is `s`**.

Explanation: The code `d2[start] = s` updates the value of `d2[start]` to the current value of `s`. Since `start` was already decremented and then incremented by -1, the value of `start` remains the same as before the decrement and increment operations. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
