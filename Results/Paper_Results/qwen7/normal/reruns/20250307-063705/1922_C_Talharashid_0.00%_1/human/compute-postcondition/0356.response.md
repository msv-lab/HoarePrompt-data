Output State: **`m` remains 0, `start` is decremented by the total number of iterations times 2 plus 1, `end` is decremented by the total number of iterations minus 1, `d1[start]` contains the cumulative sum `s` after all iterations, `mini` remains the minimum value between `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])`, `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])`, and 11111111, and `s` is the final value accumulated after all iterations; `start` is set to `len(lst) - 1`.**

This means that the variable `start` is now set to `len(lst) - 1`, while the other variables retain their respective states as described in the initial output state.
