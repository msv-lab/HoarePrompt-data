Postcondition: `end` is 0, `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])` and 11111111, `start` is `len(lst) - 5` or `len(lst) - 4` and has been decremented by 1, `s` is either `s + 1` or `2 * abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])`, `d1[start]` is equal to `s`, `d2[start]` is `s`, `inc` is -1, `start` is updated to `start - 1`.
