Postcondition: `m` is 0, `start` is an input integer decremented by the total number of iterations times 2, `end` is an input integer minus the total number of iterations, and `mini` is the minimum of abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1]) and 11111111, provided that start + 1 is less than the length of `lst`. If start + 1 is not less than the length of `lst`, the values of `m`, `start`, `end`, and `mini` remain unchanged. Additionally, `start` is greater than 0.
