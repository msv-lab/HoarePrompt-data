Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `start` is `start - 1`, `end` is `end - 1`, `s` is 0, `s1` is `abs(d2[end] - d2[start])`, `s2` is `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `s2` to be the absolute difference between `d1[start]` and `d1[end]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the updated values are as stated above.
