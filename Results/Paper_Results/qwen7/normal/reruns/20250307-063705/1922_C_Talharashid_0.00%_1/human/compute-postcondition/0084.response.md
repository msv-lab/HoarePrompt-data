To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition and the current state:

### Loop Condition Analysis
The loop condition is `start != end`.

### Current States
- `end` is 0.
- `start` is either `len(lst) - 3` or `len(lst) - 2`.
- `s` is either 1 or `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`.
- `d1[start]` is equal to `s`.
- `d2[start]` is `s`.
- `inc` is -1.

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `start` is not equal to `end`.
2. **Current Values**:
   - `end` is 0.
   - `start` can be either `len(lst) - 3` or `len(lst) - 2`.

For the loop to continue, `start` must be different from `end`. Since `end` is 0, `start` must be either `len(lst) - 3` or `len(lst) - 2` to satisfy the condition `start != end`.

### Adjusting the States
- The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `start`.
- To ensure the loop executes one more time, `start` must be different from `end`, which is 0.

Since `start` can be either `len(lst) - 3` or `len(lst) - 2`, and both values are different from 0, no adjustment is necessary for `start` to meet the loop condition.

### Conclusion
No adjustments are needed for the states to ensure the loop executes one more time because the current values of `start` already satisfy the loop condition `start != end`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`end` is 0, `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` and `11111111`, `start` is equal to `len(lst) - 3` or `len(lst) - 2`, `s` is either 1 or `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, `d1[start]` is equal to `s`, `d2[start]` is `s`, `inc` is -1**
