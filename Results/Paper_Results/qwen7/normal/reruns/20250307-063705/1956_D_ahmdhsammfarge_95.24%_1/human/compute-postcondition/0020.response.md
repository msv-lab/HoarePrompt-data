Output State: **`over_sum` is equal to `sm`, `r` is now `i`, `l` is now `j + 1`**.

Explanation: The line `over_sum = sm` assigns the value of `sm` to `over_sum`. The values of `r` and `l` remain unchanged as they are reassigned to `i` and `j + 1` respectively, but the assignment of `over_sum` to `sm` updates `over_sum` to hold the value of `sm`.
