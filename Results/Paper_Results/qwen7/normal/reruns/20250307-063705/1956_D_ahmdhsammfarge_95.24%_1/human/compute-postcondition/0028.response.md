Postcondition: **`r` and `l` will store the pair of indices that give the highest value of `sm`, `over_sum` will contain the maximum value of `sm` encountered during the loop's execution, `i` is 6, `j` is 7, `sm` is the sum(lst[:6]) + sum(lst[8:]) + (7 - 6 + 1), and the current value of `sm` is greater than `over_sum`.**
