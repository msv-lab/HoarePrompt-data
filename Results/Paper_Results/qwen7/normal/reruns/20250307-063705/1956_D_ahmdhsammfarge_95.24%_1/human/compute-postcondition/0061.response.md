Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for j in range(i + 1, len(lst)):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `j` and `i`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `r` is `[i, j]`
   - `l` is `len(lst) - 1`
   - `over_sum` is `sm`
   - `i` is less than `len(lst) - 1`
   - `j` is `i + 1`
   - `sm` is the sum of elements from the start of `lst` to index `i-1` plus the sum of elements from index `j+1` to the end of `lst` plus `(j - i + 1)`
   - If `sm` is greater than `over_sum`, then `r` is updated to `[i, j]` and `over_sum` remains unchanged.

3. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `j` starting from `i + 1` up to `len(lst) - 1`, the variable `j` will be incremented by 1 in each iteration.
   - The variable `i` remains unchanged because it is not being modified within the loop head.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `j < len(lst)`, so `j` must be less than `len(lst)`.

Given these points, let's update the states:

- `i` remains the same as it was in the previous iteration.
- `j` is incremented by 1.
- `r` remains the same unless `sm` is greater than `over_sum` in the current iteration, but since we are only adjusting the states for the next iteration, we assume `r` remains `[i, j]`.
- `over_sum` remains the same unless `sm` is greater than `over_sum` in the current iteration, but again, we are only adjusting the states for the next iteration, so `over_sum` remains `sm`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`r` is `[i, j]`, `l` is `len(lst) - 1`, `over_sum` is `sm`, `i` is less than `len(lst) - 1`, `j` is `i + 1`, and `j` is incremented by 1**.

However, to provide a clear and concise answer in the required format:

State: **`r` is `[i, j + 1]`, `l` is `len(lst) - 1`, `over_sum` is `sm`, `i` is less than `len(lst) - 1`, `j` is `i + 1`**.
