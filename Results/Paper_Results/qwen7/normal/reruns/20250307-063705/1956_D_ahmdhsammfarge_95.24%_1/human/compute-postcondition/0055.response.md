Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `j`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `j` in the range from `i + 1` to `len(lst)`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `r` is `[i, j]`
   - `l` is `len(lst) - 1`
   - `over_sum` is `sm`
   - `i` is less than `len(lst) - 1`
   - `j` is `len(lst) - 1`
   - `sm` is the sum of elements from the start of `lst` to index `i-1` plus the sum of elements from index `j+1` to the end of `lst` plus `(j - i + 1)`
   - `sm` is greater than `over_sum`

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop runs for `j` in the range from `i + 1` to `len(lst)`, the value of `j` will change in each iteration.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `len(lst) - 1`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `len(lst)`.
   - However, since the loop condition is `j in range(i + 1, len(lst))`, `j` cannot be equal to `len(lst)` because the upper bound is exclusive.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The only variable that changes in the loop head is `j`.
   - Therefore, `j` should be set to `i + 1` to start the next iteration.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`r` is `[i, i + 1]`, `l` is `len(lst) - 1`, `over_sum` is `sm`, `i` is less than `len(lst) - 1`, `j` is `i + 1`, `sm` is the sum of elements from the start of `lst` to index `i-1` plus the sum of elements from index `j+1` to the end of `lst` plus `(j - i + 1)`, and `sm` is greater than `over_sum`**.
