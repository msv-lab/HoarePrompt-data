Output State: **`r` and `l` store the indices that maximize the value of `sm`, which is the sum of elements from the start of `lst` to index `i-1` plus the sum of elements from index `j+1` to the end of `lst` plus the square of `(j - i + 1)`. `over_sum` holds the maximum value of `sm` found during the loop's execution. `i` and `j` will be the last values they were set to before the loop terminated. `lst` remains unchanged from its initial state.**

In more detail:
- The loop iterates through all possible pairs of indices `(i, j)` where `i < j` to find the pair that maximizes the value of `sm`.
- `r` and `l` will store the indices of the segment that gives the highest value of `sm`.
- `over_sum` will contain the maximum value of `sm` encountered during the entire execution of the loop.
- `i` will be the last value it was set to before the loop terminated.
- `j` will be the last value it was set to before the loop terminated.
- `lst` will remain unchanged from its initial state.
