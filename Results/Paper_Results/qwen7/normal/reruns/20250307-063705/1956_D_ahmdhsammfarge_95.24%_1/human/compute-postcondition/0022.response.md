Postcondition: **`sm` is the sum of elements from the start of `lst` to index `i-1` plus the sum of elements from index `j+1` to the end of `lst` plus the square of `(j - i + 1)`. If `sm` is greater than `over_sum`, then `over_sum` is set to `sm`, `r` is set to `i`, and `l` is set to `j + 1`. Otherwise, `over_sum`, `r`, and `l` remain unchanged.**
