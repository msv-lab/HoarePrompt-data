### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given code and its functions to ensure they meet the requirements of the problem.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function aims to find the indices `r` and `l` that maximize the value of `sm`, defined as the sum of elements from the start of `lst` to index `i-1` plus the sum of elements from index `j+1` to the end of `lst` plus the square of `(j - i + 1)`.
   - However, the problem requires us to maximize the sum of the array elements by setting a segment of the array to the MEX (Minimum EXcluded) value of that segment. The current implementation of `func_1` does not align with this requirement. Instead, it seems to be trying to optimize some other metric, which is not relevant to the problem at hand.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function is supposed to generate a sequence of operations. However, its recursive nature and the way it appends operations to `ops` do not seem to directly relate to the MEX operation required by the problem. The function appears to be generating a sequence of operations without considering the MEX value.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function correctly implements the MEX operation. Given indices `r` and `l`, it sets the elements from `r` to `l` to the MEX value of the segment `lst[r:l+1]`. It also appends the operation to `ops`.
   - The function correctly updates the array and appends the necessary operations to achieve the MEX value.

4. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic uses `func_1` to find the optimal segment to operate on, but as explained, `func_1` is not aligned with the problem requirements.
   - The main loop continues to find and apply operations using `func_3` until the entire array is filled with the same value. This part of the logic is correct in terms of applying the MEX operation.

### Conclusion:
The primary issue lies in the choice of the segment to operate on, which is determined by `func_1`. Since `func_1` does not correctly identify the segment that maximizes the sum by setting it to the MEX value, the overall solution is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program is incorrect because the function `func_1` does not correctly identify the segment to maximize the sum of the array by setting it to the MEX value.
