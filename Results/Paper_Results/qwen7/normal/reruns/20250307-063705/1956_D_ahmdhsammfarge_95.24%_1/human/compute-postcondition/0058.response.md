Output State: **`r` is `[i, j]`, `l` is `len(lst) - 1`, `over_sum` is `sm`, `i` is less than `len(lst) - 1`, `j` is `i + 1`, `sm` is the sum of elements from the start of `lst` to index `i-1` plus the sum of elements from index `j+1` to the end of `lst` plus `(j - i + 1), over_sum` is equal to `sm`.**

Explanation: The line `over_sum = sm` assigns the value of `sm` to `over_sum`. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, `over_sum` now holds the value of `sm`, while `r`, `l`, `i`, `j`, and `sm` retain their original values and conditions.
