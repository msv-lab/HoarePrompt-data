Postcondition: `r` is `i`, `l` is `len(lst) - 1`, `over_sum` is the maximum value of `sm` encountered during the loop's execution, `i` is less than `len(lst) - 1`, `j` is `len(lst) - 1`, `sm` is greater than `over_sum`, `sm` is the sum of elements from the start of `lst` to index `i-1` plus the sum of elements from index `j+1` to the end of `lst` plus `(j - i + 1)`
