Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `lst`, which is a list of non-negative integers with a length between 1 and 18. It returns two indices `r` and `l` that maximize the value of `sm`, which is calculated as the sum of elements from the start of `lst` to index `i-1` plus the sum of elements from index `j+1` to the end of `lst` plus the square of `(j - i + 1)`. The function also returns the maximum value of `sm` found during the loop's execution, and the last values of `i` and `j` before the loop terminated.**
