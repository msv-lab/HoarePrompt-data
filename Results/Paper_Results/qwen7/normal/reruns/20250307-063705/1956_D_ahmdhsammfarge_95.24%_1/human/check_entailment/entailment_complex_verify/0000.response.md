### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the problem description to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We have an array of integers \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\) of length \(n\).
- We can perform up to \(5 \times 10^5\) operations, where each operation sets a subarray \(a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r\) to the MEX value of that subarray.
- The goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array.

#### Provided Functions Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function aims to find the indices \(r\) and \(l\) that maximize the value of \(sm\), defined as the sum of elements from the start to index \(i-1\) plus the sum of elements from index \(j+1\) to the end plus the square of \((j - i + 1)\).
   - However, this definition of \(sm\) does not align with the problem's requirement to maximize the sum of the array by setting subarrays to their MEX values.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function recursively appends operations to the `ops` list, but it doesn't perform the actual MEX operation.
   - It simply appends subarrays without changing the array itself.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function attempts to set a subarray to its MEX value.
   - However, it does not correctly compute the MEX value and does not ensure that the subarray is set to the correct value.

#### Annotated Code Analysis:
- The main logic of the program seems to involve finding indices using `func_1`, then performing operations using `func_3`, and finally ensuring all zeros are replaced with 1s.
- The `func_1` function does not correctly identify the optimal subarray to maximize the sum.
- The `func_3` function does not correctly compute the MEX value and does not ensure the subarray is set to the correct value.

Given these observations, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The functions do not follow the problem description and do not use the operation to set subarrays to their MEX values to maximize the sum of the array.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
