Output State: **`ops` is a list containing the sublists `[n + 1, n + 1]`, `[n + 1, n + 1]`, `[n + 1, n + 1]`, and `[n + 1, n + 1]; `lst` is a list where the elements from index `r` to `l` (inclusive) are replaced by a list of `n` elements, each element being `n`.**

Explanation:
- Initially, `ops` contains sublists `[r + 1, l + 1]`, `[r + 1, l + 1]`, `[r + 1, r + 1]`, and `[r + 1, l + 1]`.
- The variable `n` is defined as `l - r + 1`.
- The line `lst[r:l + 1] = [n for _ in range(n)]` replaces the slice of `lst` from index `r` to `l` (inclusive) with a list of `n` elements, each being `n`.

Since `n` is `l - r + 1`, the slice `lst[r:l + 1]` is replaced by a list of `l - r + 1` elements, each being `l - r + 1`. The `ops` list remains unchanged.
