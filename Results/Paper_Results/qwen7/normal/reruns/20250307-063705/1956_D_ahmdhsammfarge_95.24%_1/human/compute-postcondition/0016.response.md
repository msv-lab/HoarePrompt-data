Postcondition: `sm` is the sum of elements from the start of `lst` to index `i-1` plus the sum of elements from index `j+1` to the end of `lst` plus the square of `(j - i + 1)`, `r` remains unchanged as `i`, `l` remains unchanged as `j`, and if `sm` is greater than `over_sum`, then `over_sum` is set to `sm`.
