Output State: **`r` is `[i, i + 1]`, `l` is `len(lst) - 1`, `over_sum` is `sm`, `i` is less than `len(lst) - 1`, `j` is `i + 1`, `sm` is the sum of elements from the start of `lst` to index `i-1` plus the sum of elements from index `j+1` to the end of `lst` plus `(j - i + 1) ** 2`, and `sm` is now equal to `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `sm` to be the sum of elements from the start of `lst` to index `i-1` plus the sum of elements from index `j+1` to the end of `lst` plus `(j - i + 1) ** 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
