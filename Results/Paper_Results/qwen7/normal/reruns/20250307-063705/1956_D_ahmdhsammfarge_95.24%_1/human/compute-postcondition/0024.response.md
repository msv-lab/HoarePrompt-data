Output State: The final values of `r` and `l` will be the indices that maximize the value of `sm`, which is defined as the sum of elements from the start of `lst` to index `i-1` plus the sum of elements from index `j+1` to the end of `lst` plus the square of `(j - i + 1)`. The variable `over_sum` will hold the maximum value of `sm` found during the entire execution of the loop. All other variables and their states will remain unchanged from their initial or previous iteration states.

In more detail:
- `r` and `l` will store the pair of indices that give the highest value of `sm`.
- `over_sum` will contain the maximum value of `sm` encountered during the loop's execution.
- `i` will be the last value it was set to before the loop terminated.
- `j` will be the last value it was set to before the loop terminated.
- `lst` will remain unchanged from its initial state.
