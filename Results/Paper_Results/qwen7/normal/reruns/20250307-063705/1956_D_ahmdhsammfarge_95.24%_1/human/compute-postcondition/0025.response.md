Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(len(lst))`. The only variable that changes within the loop is `i`.

2. **Determine the Current State of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was the last value it was set to before the loop terminated. This means `i` will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.

3. **Adjust the State**: Since `i` is the only variable in the loop head that can change, we need to update its value. The new value of `i` will be the previous value of `i` plus 1.

Given that `i` was the last value it was set to before the loop terminated, let's denote this value as `i_prev`. For the next iteration, `i` will be `i_prev + 1`.

Since no other variables in the loop head (`r`, `l`, `over_sum`, `j`, `lst`) are mentioned as needing adjustment, they will remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`r` and `l` will store the pair of indices that give the highest value of `sm`, `over_sum` will contain the maximum value of `sm` encountered during the loop's execution, `i` will be `i_prev + 1`, `j` will be the last value it was set to before the loop terminated, and `lst` will remain unchanged from its initial state.**

To provide a concrete example, if `i_prev` was 5, then:

State: **`r` and `l` will store the pair of indices that give the highest value of `sm`, `over_sum` will contain the maximum value of `sm` encountered during the loop's execution, `i` will be 6, `j` will be the last value it was set to before the loop terminated, and `lst` will remain unchanged from its initial state.**
