Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is `for j in range(i + 1, len(lst)):`. The variables involved in this loop head are `j` and the bounds of the range, which are `i + 1` and `len(lst)`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `j`**: According to the given state before the loop, `j` is set to `len(lst) - 1`.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `j` is greater than or equal to `i + 1` and less than `len(lst)`. Given that `i` is `i + 1`, `i` should be initialized to a value such that `i + 1` is less than `len(lst)`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - `j` is already set to `len(lst) - 1`.
   - For the loop to start, `i` must be such that `i + 1` is less than `len(lst)`. This means `i` must be less than `len(lst) - 1`.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `j`.

Therefore, the final state after adjusting for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`r` is `i`, `l` is `len(lst) - 1`, `over_sum` is the maximum value of `sm` encountered during the loop's execution, `i` is less than `len(lst) - 1`, `j` is `len(lst) - 1`**
