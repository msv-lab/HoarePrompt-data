Output State: **`sm` is the sum of elements from the start of `lst` to index `i-1` plus the sum of elements from index `j+1` to the end of `lst` plus the square of `(j - i + 1)`, `r` is now `i`, `l` is now `j + 1`**.

Explanation: The code `r, l = [i, j]` updates the values of `r` and `l`. Specifically, `r` is set to `i` and `l` is set to `j + 1`. The value of `sm` remains unchanged as it was defined before the code execution.
