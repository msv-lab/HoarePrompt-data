Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `j`. The loop iterates over the range from `i + 1` to `len(lst)`.

2. **Understand the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the postcondition is given as follows:
   - `sm` is the sum of elements from the start of `lst` to index `i-1` plus the sum of elements from index `j+1` to the end of `lst` plus the square of `(j - i + 1)`.
   - `r` remains unchanged as `i`.
   - `l` remains unchanged as `j`.
   - If `sm` is greater than `over_sum`, then `over_sum` is set to `sm`.

3. **Determine the Next State**: For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, the new value of `j` will be `j + 1`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` remains unchanged.
   - `j` changes to `j + 1`.
   - `r` remains unchanged as `i`.
   - `l` remains unchanged as `j`.

5. **Formulate the New State**: The new state should reflect these adjustments.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`sm` is the sum of elements from the start of `lst` to index `i-1` plus the sum of elements from index `j+2` to the end of `lst` plus the square of `(j - i + 2)`, `r` remains unchanged as `i`, `l` remains unchanged as `j + 1`**.
