Output State: **`r` is `[i, j]`, `l` is `len(lst) - 1`, `over_sum` is `sm`, `i` is less than `len(lst) - 1`, `j` is `i + 1`, `sm` is `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1)**

Explanation: The code updates the list `r` from `[i, j + 1]` to `[i, j]`. All other variables (`l`, `over_sum`, `i`, `j`, and `sm`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
