Output State: **`ops` is a list containing the sublist `[r + 1, l + 1]`, `r` is an integer such that `0 <= r < len(lst)`, `l` is an integer such that `0 <= l <= r < len(lst)`, and `lst` is a list of non-negative integers.**

This means that the operation `[r + 1, l + 1]` has been appended to the list `ops`. The values of `r` and `l` remain unchanged, and `lst` remains a list of non-negative integers with the same constraints.
