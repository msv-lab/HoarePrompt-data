### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the annotated program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the input and initializes the list `lst` and the operations list `ops`.
   - The function `func_1` is called to find the indices `r` and `l` that maximize the value of `sm`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function aims to find the optimal segment to apply the operation to maximize the sum of the array.
   - However, the logic inside `func_1` seems flawed. It calculates `sm` as the sum of elements from the start of `lst` to index `i-1` plus the sum of elements from index `j+1` to the end of `lst` plus the square of `(j - i + 1)`. This does not align with the problem statement, which requires maximizing the sum of the subarray by setting all elements in the subarray to the MEX of that subarray.
   - The function should instead calculate the MEX of the subarray and set all elements in the subarray to that MEX value.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function is not used in the provided code and is not relevant to the current analysis.

4. **Function `func_3`:**
   - This function is supposed to set all elements in the subarray from index `r` to `l` to the MEX of that subarray.
   - However, the implementation is incorrect. It appends `[r + 1, l + 1]` multiple times and does not actually compute the MEX.
   - The correct approach would be to find the MEX of the subarray `lst[r:l + 1]` and set all elements in that subarray to the MEX.

5. **Main Loop:**
   - The main loop calls `func_1` to get the indices `r` and `l` and then calls `func_3` to update the array.
   - The loop continues until `r` equals `l`, meaning the entire array has been processed.

6. **Final Processing:**
   - After the main loop, the program tries to set the first occurrence of `0` in the array to `1` and append the corresponding operation to `ops`.
   - This ensures that any remaining zeros in the array are handled.

### Conclusion:

Given the above analysis, the provided code does not correctly implement the required logic to maximize the sum of the array by setting elements to the MEX of their subarrays. The functions `func_1` and `func_3` have incorrect implementations, leading to an incorrect solution.

### Correctness:
**False**
