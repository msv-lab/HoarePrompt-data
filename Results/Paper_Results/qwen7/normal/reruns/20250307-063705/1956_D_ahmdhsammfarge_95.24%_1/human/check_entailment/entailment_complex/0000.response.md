Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function aims to find the indices `r` and `l` that maximize the value of `sm`, which is defined as the sum of elements from the start of `lst` to index `i-1` plus the sum of elements from index `j+1` to the end of `lst` plus the square of `(j - i + 1)`.
   - The logic seems correct as it iterates through all possible pairs of indices `(i, j)` to find the one that maximizes `sm`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function is called recursively to generate a series of operations. However, there is a logical error in the function. It should append `[r + 1, l + 1]` once, but instead, it appends it twice, leading to redundant operations.
   - The function should be corrected to append `[r + 1, l + 1]` only once.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function performs the actual operation to update the list `lst` and record the operation in `ops`.
   - If the minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is 0, it appends `[r + 1, l + 1]` again, which is unnecessary and redundant.
   - The function correctly updates the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` to `[n for _ in range(n)]`, where `n` is the length of the range from `l` to `r`.

4. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main program logic uses `func_1` to find the optimal indices, then uses `func_3` to perform the operations, and finally prints the result.
   - The logic to handle the case where the minimum value in the sublist is 0 is redundant and should be removed.

Given these observations, the current implementation has redundant operations due to the incorrect handling in `func_2` and `func_3`. Therefore, the program is not fully correct as it performs unnecessary operations.

Correctness: **False**
