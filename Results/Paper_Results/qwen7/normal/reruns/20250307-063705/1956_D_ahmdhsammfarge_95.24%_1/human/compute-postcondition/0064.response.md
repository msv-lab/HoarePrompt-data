Output State: **`r` is `[i, j]`, `l` is `len(lst) - 1`, `over_sum` is `sm`, `i` is less than `len(lst) - 1`, `j` is `i + 1`, `sm` is `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1), `over_sum` is `sm`**.

Explanation: The line `over_sum = sm` assigns the value of `sm` to `over_sum`. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
