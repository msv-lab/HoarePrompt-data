Output State: **`r` is `i`, `l` is `i + 3`, `over_sum` is `sm`, `i` is the same as before, `j` is `i + 3`, `sm` is sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1)**

Explanation: The line `over_sum = sm` assigns the current value of `sm` to `over_sum`. This means that `over_sum` now holds the value of `sm`, which is defined as `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
