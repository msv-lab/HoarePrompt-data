Output State: `r` is `5`, `l` is `9`, `over_sum` is the maximum value of `sm` encountered during the loop's execution, `i` is `6`, `j` is `len(lst) - 1`, and `sm` is the sum of elements from the start of `lst` up to index `i-1` plus the sum of elements from index `j+1` to the end of `lst` plus `(j - i + 1)`. If `sm` is greater than `over_sum`, then `over_sum` is updated to `sm`.

To understand this, let's break it down:

- The loop iterates over `j` starting from `i + 1` to the length of `lst`.
- For each `j`, it calculates `sm` as the sum of elements from the start of `lst` up to `i-1` plus the sum of elements from `j+1` to the end of `lst` plus `(j - i + 1)^2`.
- The loop updates `r` and `l` to the current `i` and `j` if `sm` is greater than the current `over_sum`.
- After all iterations, `r` and `l` will hold the indices that maximize `sm`, and `over_sum` will hold the maximum value of `sm` encountered.

Since the loop terminates when `j` reaches the last index of `lst`, `i` remains `6` and `j` becomes `len(lst) - 1`. The final values of `r` and `l` are determined by the iteration that maximizes `sm`, resulting in `r` being `5` and `l` being `9`.
