Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `r` and `l` will store the pair of indices that give the highest value of `sm`, `over_sum` will contain the maximum value of `sm` encountered during the loop's execution, `i` will be 6, `j` will be the last value it was set to before the loop terminated, and `lst` will remain unchanged from its initial state.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(i + 1, len(lst)):
    sm = sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2
    if sm > over_sum:
        r, l = [i, j]
        over_sum = sm


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `r` is 6, `l` is 7, and `over_sum` is the maximum value of `sm` encountered during the loop's execution, which remains unchanged since the condition `sm > over_sum` is not met in the given scenario.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `r` is `i`, `l` is `j`, `over_sum` is the maximum value of `sm` encountered during the loop's execution, `i` is the same as before, `j` is `i + 2`, `sm` is the sum of elements from the start of `lst` up to index `i-1` plus the sum of elements from index `j+2` to the end of `lst` plus `(j - i + 1), and `over_sum` is updated to `sm` if `sm > over_sum`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `r` is `i`, `l` is `i + 3`, `over_sum` is the maximum value of `sm` encountered during the loop's execution, `i` is the same as before, `j` is `i + 3`, `sm` is sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1). If `sm` is greater than `over_sum`, then `over_sum` is updated to `sm`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
