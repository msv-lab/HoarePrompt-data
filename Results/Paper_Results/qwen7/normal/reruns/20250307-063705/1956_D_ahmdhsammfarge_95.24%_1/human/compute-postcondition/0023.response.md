Output State: The final values of `r` and `l` will be the indices that maximize the value of `sm`, which is defined as the sum of elements from the start of `lst` to index `i-1` plus the sum of elements from index `j+1` to the end of `lst` plus the square of `(j - i + 1)`. `over_sum` will hold the maximum value of `sm` found during the loop's execution. All other variables and their values from the initial state will remain unchanged.

In more detail:
- `r` and `l` will contain the pair of indices that give the highest value of `sm`.
- `over_sum` will be the maximum value of `sm` calculated for any `i` and `j` within the loop.
- `i` and `j` will have been incremented through all possible valid pairs, but their final values will not be relevant to the output state since only `r`, `l`, and `over_sum` are affected by the loop.
