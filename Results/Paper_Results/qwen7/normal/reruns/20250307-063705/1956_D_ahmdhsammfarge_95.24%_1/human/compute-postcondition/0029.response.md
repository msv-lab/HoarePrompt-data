Output State: **`r` is 6, `l` is 7, `over_sum` will contain the maximum value of `sm` encountered during the loop's execution, `i` is 6, `j` is 7, and `sm` is the sum(lst[:6]) + sum(lst[8:]) + (7 - 6 + 1).**

Explanation: The code assigns the values of `i` and `j` to `r` and `l` respectively. Since `i` is 6 and `j` is 7, `r` becomes 6 and `l` becomes 7. The other variables (`over_sum`, `sm`) remain unchanged as they were not directly affected by the assignment.
