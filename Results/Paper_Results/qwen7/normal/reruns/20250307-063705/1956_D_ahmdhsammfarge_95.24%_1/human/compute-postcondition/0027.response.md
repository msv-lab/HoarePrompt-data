Output State: **`r` and `l` will store the pair of indices that give the highest value of `sm`, `over_sum` will contain the maximum value of `sm` encountered during the loop's execution, `i` is 6, `j` is 7, `sm` is the sum(lst[:6]) + sum(lst[8:]) + (7 - 6 + 1) ** 2.**

Explanation: The code calculates the value of `sm` using the formula `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2`. Given the initial values of `i` as 6 and `j` as 7, the expression simplifies to `sum(lst[:6]) + sum(lst[8:]) + (7 - 6 + 1) ** 2`. This value is assigned to `sm`. The other variables (`r`, `l`, `over_sum`, and `lst`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
