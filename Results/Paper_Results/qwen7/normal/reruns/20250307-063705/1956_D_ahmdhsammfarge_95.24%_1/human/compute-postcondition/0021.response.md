Postcondition: `sm` is the sum of elements from the start of `lst` to index `i-1` plus the sum of elements from index `j+1` to the end of `lst` plus the square of `(j - i + 1)`, `r` is now `i`, and `l` is now `j + 1` if `sm` is greater than `over_sum`. Otherwise, `sm`, `r`, and `l` remain unchanged.
