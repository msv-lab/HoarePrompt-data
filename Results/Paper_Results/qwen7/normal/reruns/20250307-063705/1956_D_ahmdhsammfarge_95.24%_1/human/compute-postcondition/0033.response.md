Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `j` and `i`.

2. **Determine the initial values at the start of the loop**:
   - `i` is not explicitly mentioned in the state at the end of the previous iteration, but it is used in the range function `range(i + 1, len(lst))`. Therefore, `i` must be known or can be inferred from the context.
   - `j` starts from `i + 1` and goes up to `len(lst) - 1`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `j` is less than `len(lst)`.

4. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `r` is 6.
   - `l` is 7.
   - `over_sum` is the maximum value of `sm` encountered during the loop's execution, which remains unchanged since the condition `sm > over_sum` is not met.

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts from `i + 1`, at the end of the previous iteration, `j` would be `i + 1`.
   - For the next iteration, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes `i + 2`.
   - `i` remains unchanged as it is used in the range function and does not change within the loop itself.

Given the above points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`r` is 6, `l` is 7, `over_sum` is the maximum value of `sm` encountered during the loop's execution, `i` is the same as before, and `j` is `i + 2`**.
