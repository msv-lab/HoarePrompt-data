Output State: **`r` is `[i, j + 1]`, `l` is `len(lst) - 1`, `over_sum` is `sm`, `i` is less than `len(lst) - 1`, `j` is `i + 1`, `sm` is `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2`**

Explanation: The code calculates `sm` as the sum of elements from the start of the list up to index `i-1`, plus the sum of elements from index `j+2` to the end of the list, plus the square of the number of elements between `i` and `j` inclusive. The values of `r`, `l`, `over_sum`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.
