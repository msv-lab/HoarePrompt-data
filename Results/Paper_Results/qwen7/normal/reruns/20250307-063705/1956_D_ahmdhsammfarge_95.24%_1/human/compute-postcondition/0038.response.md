Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in the given for loop is `j`. The loop starts from `i + 1` and goes up to `len(lst) - 1`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `r` is `i`
   - `l` is `j`
   - `over_sum` is the maximum value of `sm` encountered during the loop's execution
   - `i` is the same as before
   - `j` is `i + 2`
   - `sm` is the sum of elements from the start of `lst` up to index `i-1` plus the sum of elements from index `j+2` to the end of `lst` plus `(j - i + 1)`
   - `over_sum` is updated to `sm` if `sm > over_sum`

3. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop starts from `i + 1`, the new value of `j` will be `i + 2` (as it was in the previous iteration).
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `len(lst)`. Therefore, the new value of `j` should be `i + 3`.

4. **Adjust the other states**:
   - `r` remains `i` because it is not affected by the loop.
   - `l` becomes `i + 3` because `j` is incremented by 1.
   - `over_sum` remains the same unless the new `sm` calculated in the next iteration is greater than `over_sum`.
   - `i` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.
   - `sm` will be recalculated based on the new value of `j` in the next iteration.
   - `over_sum` will be updated if the new `sm` is greater than the current `over_sum`.

5. **Final state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - `r` is `i`
   - `l` must be `i + 3`
   - `over_sum` is the maximum value of `sm` encountered during the loop's execution
   - `i` is the same as before
   - `j` is `i + 3`
   - `sm` is yet to be calculated for the new value of `j`
   - `over_sum` is updated to `sm` if `sm > over_sum`

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`r` is `i`, `l` is `i + 3`, `over_sum` is the maximum value of `sm` encountered during the loop's execution, `i` is the same as before, `j` is `i + 3`, `sm` is yet to be calculated for the new value of `j`, and `over_sum` is updated to `sm` if `sm > over_sum`**.
