Output State: **The program returns the indices `r` and `l` that maximize the value of `sm`, which is the sum of elements from the start of `lst` to index `i-1` plus the sum of elements from index `j+1` to the end of `lst` plus the square of `(j - i + 1)`. The variables `over_sum`, `i`, and `j` hold the maximum value of `sm` found during the loop's execution, and the last values they were set to before the loop terminated, respectively.**

This means that the program returns the pair of indices (`r`, `l`) that resulted in the highest value of `sm` during the execution of the loop, along with the maximum value of `sm` (`over_sum`) and the last values of `i` and `j` that were used in the calculation.
