### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and its functions in detail to determine if they correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We have an array \( a \) of integers.
- We can perform up to \( 5 \times 10^5 \) operations, where each operation sets a subarray \( a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r \) to the MEX (minimum excluded value) of that subarray.
- The goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array.

#### Function Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function aims to find the optimal subarray indices \( (r, l) \) that maximize the sum of the array by considering all possible subarrays.
   - The logic inside the function is complex and involves nested loops to calculate the sum of subarrays and compare them.
   - However, the function does not actually perform any operations to set the subarray to the MEX value. Instead, it seems to be trying to find a subarray that maximizes a different condition (the sum of the subarray plus the square of its length).

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function is a recursive helper function that constructs a sequence of operations.
   - It does not perform any operations itself but is used to build the list of operations `ops`.

3. **Function `func_3`:**
   - This function is supposed to replace the elements in the subarray from index `r` to `l` with the MEX value of that subarray.
   - However, the function does not correctly implement the MEX value calculation. Instead, it sets the subarray to a constant value `n` (where `n` is the length of the subarray), which is not the correct MEX value.
   - The function also appends operations to the `ops` list, but these operations are not based on the MEX value of the subarray.

Given the above analysis, the functions do not correctly implement the required logic to solve the problem. They do not set the subarray to the MEX value of that subarray, which is essential to maximize the sum of the array. Instead, they attempt to find a subarray that maximizes a different condition, leading to incorrect results.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
