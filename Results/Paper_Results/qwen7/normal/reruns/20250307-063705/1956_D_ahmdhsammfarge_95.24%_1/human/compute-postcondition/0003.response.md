Output State: **`ops` is a list containing the sublist `[r + 1, l + 1]` appended with another sublist `[r + 1, l + 1]`, `r` is an integer such that `0 <= r < len(lst)`, `l` is an integer such that `0 <= l <= r < len(lst)`, and `lst` is a list of non-negative integers. The minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is 0.**

Explanation: The code appends the sublist `[r + 1, l + 1]` to the list `ops`. The values of `r` and `l` remain unchanged, and the conditions on them and the properties of `lst` remain the same.
