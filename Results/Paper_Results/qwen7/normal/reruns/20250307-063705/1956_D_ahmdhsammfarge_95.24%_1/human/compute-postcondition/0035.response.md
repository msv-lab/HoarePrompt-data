Output State: **`r` is `i`, `l` is `j`, `over_sum` is the maximum value of `sm` encountered during the loop's execution, `i` is the same as before, `j` is `i + 2`, `sm` is the sum of elements from the start of `lst` up to index `i-1` plus the sum of elements from index `j+2` to the end of `lst` plus `(j - i + 1)**

Explanation: The code `r, l = [i, j]` updates the values of `r` and `l` to be `i` and `j` respectively. The values of `over_sum`, `i`, `j`, and `sm` remain unchanged from their previous states.
