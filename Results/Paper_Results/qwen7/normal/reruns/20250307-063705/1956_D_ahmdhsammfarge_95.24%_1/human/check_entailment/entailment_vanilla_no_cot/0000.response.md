Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in `func_1` is flawed and does not aim to maximize the sum of the array by setting segments to the MEX value. Instead, it seems to be trying to find a subarray that maximizes a certain sum condition, which is irrelevant to the problem's requirements.

The MEX operation needs to be applied to segments of the array to set all elements in those segments to the MEX value of that segment. The provided functions do not implement this logic correctly. Specifically:

- `func_1` attempts to find a subarray that maximizes a sum condition, which is not related to the MEX operation.
- `func_2` and `func_3` do not correctly handle the MEX operation or the updating of the array segments.

To solve this problem correctly, one would need to identify segments of the array and apply the MEX operation to those segments to maximize the sum of the array. This involves iterating through possible segments and applying the MEX operation to each segment to see the effect on the overall sum.
