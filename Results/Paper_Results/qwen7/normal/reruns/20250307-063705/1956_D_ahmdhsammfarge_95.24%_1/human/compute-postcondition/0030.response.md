Output State: **`r` is 6, `l` is 7, `over_sum` is 21, `i` is 6, `j` is 7, and `sm` is 21**.

Explanation: The line `over_sum = sm` assigns the value of `sm` to `over_sum`. Given that `sm` is defined as `sum(lst[:6]) + sum(lst[8:]) + (7 - 6 + 1)`, and assuming `lst` is such that `sum(lst[:6]) + sum(lst[8:]) + 2` equals 21 (since `7 - 6 + 1` equals 2), `over_sum` is set to 21. All other variables (`r`, `l`, `i`, `j`) remain unchanged.
