Output State: **`r` is `[i, j]`, `l` is `len(lst) - 1`, `over_sum` is `sm`, `i` is less than `len(lst) - 1`, `j` is `len(lst) - 1`, `sm` is greater than `over_sum`, `sm` is the sum of elements from the start of `lst` to index `i-1` plus the sum of elements from index `j+1` to the end of `lst` plus `(j - i + 1)`**

Explanation: The line `over_sum = sm` updates the value of `over_sum` to be equal to the current value of `sm`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `over_sum` now holds the value of `sm`, which was previously the maximum value encountered during the loop's execution.
