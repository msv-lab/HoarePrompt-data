Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `r` is `i`
- `l` is `len(lst) - 1`
- `over_sum` is the maximum value of `sm` encountered during the loop's execution
- `i` is the same as before
- `j` is `len(lst) - 1`
- `sm` is the sum of elements from the start of `lst` up to index `i-1` plus the sum of elements from index `j+1` to the end of `lst` plus `(j - i + 1)`

### Loop Head
The loop iterates over `i` from `0` to `len(lst) - 1`.

### Current Iteration
- The loop is currently iterating over `i`.
- The loop will continue to the next iteration when `i` increments by 1.

### Adjusting States for the Next Iteration
- `i` will increment by 1, so the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
- `j` remains `len(lst) - 1` because it is not updated within the loop body based on the given information.
- `r` and `l` remain unchanged because they are not updated within the loop body based on the given information.
- `over_sum` remains unchanged because it is not updated within the loop body based on the given information.
- `sm` is recalculated for the new value of `i` but is not stored in the state since it is not relevant to the loop head.

### Updated State
Given that the only variable that changes is `i`, and it will be incremented by 1, the updated state for the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`r` is `i`, `l` is `len(lst) - 1`, `over_sum` is the maximum value of `sm` encountered during the loop's execution, `i` is `i + 1`, `j` is `len(lst) - 1`**.
