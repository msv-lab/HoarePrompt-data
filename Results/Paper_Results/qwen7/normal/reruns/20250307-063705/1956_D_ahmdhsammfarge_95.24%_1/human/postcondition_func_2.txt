The function `func_3` accepts four parameters: `r`, `l`, `lst`, and `ops`. It replaces the elements in `lst` from index `r` to `l` (inclusive) with a list of `n` elements, each being `n`, where `n` is the length of the range from `l` to `r`. The rest of the list remains unchanged, and then returns the modified list `lst`. Additionally, it appends specific sublists to the `ops` list based on certain conditions.
