Output State: **The program returns a list 'lst' where the elements from index r to l (inclusive) are replaced by a list of n elements, each element being n, and the rest of the list remains unchanged.**

Given the initial state, `ops` is a list containing four sublists, each with two elements, both being `n + 1`. However, these sublists do not affect the content of `lst` directly. The relevant information is about `lst` and the indices `r` and `l`.

- `lst` is a list where elements from index `r` to `l` (inclusive) are replaced by a list of `n` elements, each element being `n`.

Since the code snippet only includes a return statement for `lst`, the program returns the modified `lst` as described above.
