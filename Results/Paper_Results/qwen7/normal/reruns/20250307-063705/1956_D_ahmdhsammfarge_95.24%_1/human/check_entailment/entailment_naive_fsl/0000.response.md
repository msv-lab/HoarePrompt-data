Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` do not follow the problem description. Specifically, they do not use the operation described (choosing two integers \( l \) and \( r \) to set the subarray from \( a_l \) to \( a_r \) to the MEX value of that subarray) to maximize the sum of the array. Instead, they seem to be attempting to find a subarray that maximizes a different condition, which is not relevant to the problem.

For example, consider the input:
```
4
1 100 2 1
```
The correct approach would be to set the entire array to the MEX value of the array, which is 0, resulting in the array `[0, 0, 0, 0]` with a sum of 0. However, the provided functions do not achieve this. They instead attempt to find a subarray that maximizes a different condition, leading to incorrect results. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
