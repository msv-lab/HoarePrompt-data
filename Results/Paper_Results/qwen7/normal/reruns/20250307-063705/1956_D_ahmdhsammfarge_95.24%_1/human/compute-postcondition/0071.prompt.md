You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of non-negative integers of length n, where 1 <= n <= 18.
def func_1(lst):
    r = l = 0
    over_sum = sum(lst)
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(lst)):
            sm = sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2
            if sm > over_sum:
                r, l = [i, j]
                over_sum = sm
        
    #State: `r` and `l` store the indices that maximize the value of `sm`, which is the sum of elements from the start of `lst` to index `i-1` plus the sum of elements from index `j+1` to the end of `lst` plus the square of `(j - i + 1)`. `over_sum` holds the maximum value of `sm` found during the loop's execution. `i` and `j` will be the last values they were set to before the loop terminated. `lst` remains unchanged from its initial state.
    return r, l
    #The program returns the indices `r` and `l` that maximize the value of `sm`, which is the sum of elements from the start of `lst` to index `i-1` plus the sum of elements from index `j+1` to the end of `lst` plus the square of `(j - i + 1)`. The variables `over_sum`, `i`, and `j` hold the maximum value of `sm` found during the loop's execution, and the last values they were set to before the loop terminated, respectively.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `lst`, which is a list of non-negative integers with a length between 1 and 18. It returns two indices `r` and `l` that maximize the value of `sm`, which is calculated as the sum of elements from the start of `lst` to index `i-1` plus the sum of elements from index `j+1` to the end of `lst` plus the square of `(j - i + 1)`. The function also returns the maximum value of `sm` found during the loop's execution, and the last values of `i` and `j` before the loop terminated.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the indices `r` and `l` that maximize the value of `sm`, which is the sum of elements from the start of `lst` to index `i-1` plus the sum of elements from index `j+1` to the end of `lst` plus the square of `(j - i + 1)`. The variables `over_sum`, `i`, and `j` hold the maximum value of `sm` found during the loop's execution, and the last values they were set to before the loop terminated, respectively.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
