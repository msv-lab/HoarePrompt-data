Output State: **`r` is the pair of indices that maximize the value of `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2`, `l` is `len(lst) - 1`, `over_sum` is the maximum value of `sm` encountered during the loop's execution, `i` is `len(lst) - 1`, `j` is `len(lst) - 1`, and `sm` is the final value of `sm` calculated before the loop terminates.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `r` will hold the pair of indices that give the highest value when used in the formula `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2`. The variable `l` remains as `len(lst) - 1`, indicating the original length of the list minus one. The variable `over_sum` will contain the maximum value of `sm` found during the entire execution of the loop. Both `i` and `j` will be set to `len(lst) - 1`, as the loop will terminate when `i` reaches the length of the list. The variable `sm` will hold the last computed value of the formula before the loop ends.
