Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `i`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `j` is within the range from `i + 1` to `len(lst)`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `r` is `[i, j]`
   - `l` is `len(lst) - 1`
   - `over_sum` is `sm`
   - `i` is less than `len(lst) - 1`
   - `j` is `i + 1`
   - `sm` is the sum of elements from the start of `lst` to index `i-1` plus the sum of elements from index `j+1` to the end of `lst` plus `(j - i + 1)`
   - If `sm` is greater than `over_sum`, then `r` is updated to `[i, j]` and `over_sum` remains unchanged.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` is currently `i + 1`, the next value of `j` should be `i + 2` for the loop to continue.
   - `i` remains the same as it is not incremented or modified within the loop head.
   - `l` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop head.
   - `over_sum` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop head.
   - `sm` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop head.

5. **Construct the new state**:
   - `r` will remain `[i, j]` since `j` is not updated yet.
   - `j` will be `i + 2`.
   - All other variables (`l`, `over_sum`, `sm`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `r` is `[i, j]`, `l` is `len(lst) - 1`, `over_sum` is `sm`, `i` is less than `len(lst) - 1`, `j` is `i + 2`, `sm` is the sum of elements from the start of `lst` to index `i-1` plus the sum of elements from index `j+1` to the end of `lst` plus `(j - i + 1)`**.
