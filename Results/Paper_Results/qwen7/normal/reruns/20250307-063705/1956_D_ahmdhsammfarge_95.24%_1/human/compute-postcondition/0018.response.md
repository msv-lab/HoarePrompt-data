Output State: **`sm` is the sum of elements from the start of `lst` to index `i-1` plus the sum of elements from index `j+1` to the end of `lst` plus the square of `(j - i + 1)`, `r` remains unchanged as `i`, `l` remains unchanged as `j + 1`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `sm` to be the sum of elements from the start of `lst` to index `i-1`, plus the sum of elements from index `j+1` to the end of `lst`, plus the square of `(j - i + 1)`. The values of `r` and `l` remain unchanged as `i` and `j + 1`, respectively.
