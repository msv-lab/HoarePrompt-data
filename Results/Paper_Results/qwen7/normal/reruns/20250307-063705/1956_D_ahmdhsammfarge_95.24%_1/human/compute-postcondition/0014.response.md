Output State: **`sm` is the sum of elements from the start of `lst` to index `i-1` plus the sum of elements from index `j+1` to the end of `lst` plus the square of `(j - i + 1)`, `r` is `i`, `l` is `j`, `over_sum` is equal to `sm`.**

Explanation: The line `over_sum = sm` assigns the value of `sm` to the variable `over_sum`. No other changes are made to the values of `sm`, `r`, or `l`. Therefore, these variables retain their original values.
