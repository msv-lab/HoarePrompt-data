Output State: **`r` is `i`, `l` is `i + 3`, `over_sum` is the maximum value of `sm` encountered during the loop's execution, `i` is the same as before, `j` is `i + 3`, `sm` is sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2, and `over_sum` is updated to `sm` if `sm > over_sum`.**

This means that the value of `sm` is calculated as the sum of elements from the start of the list up to index `i-1`, plus the sum of elements from index `j+2` to the end of the list, plus the square of the difference between `j` and `i` plus one. The values of `r`, `l`, `i`, `j`, and `over_sum` remain as per the initial conditions, except that `over_sum` is now potentially updated to the new value of `sm` if `sm` is greater than the previous `over_sum`.
