Output State: **`r` is `i`, `l` is `len(lst) - 1`, `over_sum` is the maximum value of `sm` encountered during the loop's execution, `i` is less than `len(lst) - 1`, `j` is `len(lst) - 1`, `sm` is the sum of elements from the start of `lst` to index `i-1` plus the sum of elements from index `j+1` to the end of `lst` plus `(j - i + 1) ** 2`**

Explanation: The code calculates the value of `sm` based on the current values of `i` and `j`. It sums the elements from the start of the list up to index `i-1`, adds the elements from index `j+1` to the end of the list, and adds `(j - i + 1) ** 2`. The values of `r`, `l`, `over_sum`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged from their initial states.
