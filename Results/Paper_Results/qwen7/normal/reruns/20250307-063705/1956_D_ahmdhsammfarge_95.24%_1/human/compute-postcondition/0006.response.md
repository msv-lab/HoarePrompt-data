Output State: **`ops` is a list containing the sublist `[r + 1, l + 1]` appended with another sublist `[r + 1, l + 1]`, and an additional sublist `[r + 1, r + 1]` is appended to `ops`.**

Explanation: The code appends the sublist `[r + 1, r + 1]` to the list `ops`. The conditions for the sublist `[r + 1, l + 1]` being appended to `ops` remain unchanged, meaning if the minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is 0, then `ops` contains an additional sublist `[r + 1, l + 1]`. The value of `r` and `l` also remain within their specified ranges, and `lst` remains a list of non-negative integers.
