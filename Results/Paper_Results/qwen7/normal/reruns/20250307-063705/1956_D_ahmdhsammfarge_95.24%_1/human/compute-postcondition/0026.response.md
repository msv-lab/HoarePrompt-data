Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for j in range(i + 1, len(lst)):`. The variables involved here are `j` and `i`.

2. **Determine the initial values of these variables**:
   - From the given state, `i` is already set to 6.
   - The variable `j` is set to the last value it was before the loop terminated. Since the loop hasn't started yet, we don't know what `j` was before the loop, but we need to ensure that the loop can start.

3. **Condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute if `i + 1` is less than or equal to `len(lst)`. Given that `i` is 6, the loop will execute as long as `6 + 1 <= len(lst)` or `7 <= len(lst)`.

4. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - We need to ensure that `j` is initialized properly for the loop to start. Since `j` is set to the last value it was before the loop, and we don't have that information, we can assume it should be initialized to `i + 1` (which is 7) for the loop to start.
   - We also need to ensure that `len(lst)` is at least 7 for the loop to execute.

Given these considerations, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` is 6.
- `j` should be initialized to `i + 1`, which is 7.
- `len(lst)` must be at least 7.

So, the final state is:

**`r` and `l` will store the pair of indices that give the highest value of `sm`, `over_sum` will contain the maximum value of `sm` encountered during the loop's execution, `i` is 6, `j` is 7, and `lst` will remain unchanged from its initial state.**

State: **`r` and `l` will store the pair of indices that give the highest value of `sm`, `over_sum` will contain the maximum value of `sm` encountered during the loop's execution, `i` is 6, `j` is 7, and `lst` will remain unchanged from its initial state.**
