Output State: **`r` is `[i, j]`, `l` is `len(lst) - 1`, `over_sum` is the maximum value of `sm` encountered during the loop's execution, `i` is less than `len(lst) - 1`, `j` is `len(lst) - 1`, `sm` is greater than `over_sum`, `sm` is the sum of elements from the start of `lst` to index `i-1` plus the sum of elements from index `j+1` to the end of `lst` plus `(j - i + 1)`**

Explanation: The code `r, l = [i, j]` assigns the list `[i, j]` to the variables `r` and `l`. The values of `over_sum`, `i`, `j`, `sm`, and `l` remain unchanged from their previous states.
