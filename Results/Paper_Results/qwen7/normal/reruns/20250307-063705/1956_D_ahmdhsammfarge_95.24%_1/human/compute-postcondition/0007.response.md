Output State: **`ops` is a list containing the sublists `[r + 1, l + 1]`, `[r + 1, l + 1]`, and `[r + 1, r + 1]`.**

Explanation: The function `func_2(r, l, ops)` is called with parameters `r`, `l`, and `ops`. However, the function `func_2` is not defined in the provided code snippet, so no changes are made to the `ops` list within the given code. Therefore, the `ops` list remains unchanged from its initial state, which includes the sublists `[r + 1, l + 1]`, `[r + 1, l + 1]`, and `[r + 1, r + 1]`.
