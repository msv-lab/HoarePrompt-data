Output State: **`r` is 6, `l` is 7, `over_sum` is the maximum value of `sm` encountered during the loop's execution, `i` is the same as before, `j` is `i + 2`, `sm` is the sum of elements from the start of `lst` up to index `i-1` plus the sum of elements from index `j+2` to the end of `lst` plus `(j - i + 1) ** 2`.**

This means that the value of `sm` is calculated based on the specified formula using the indices `i` and `j`, and the list `lst`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
