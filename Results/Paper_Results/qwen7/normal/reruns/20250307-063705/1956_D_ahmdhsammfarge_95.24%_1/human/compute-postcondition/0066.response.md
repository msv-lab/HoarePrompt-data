Output State: `r` is the pair of indices that maximize the expression `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2` for any `i` and `j` where `i < len(lst)` and `j > i`, `l` is `len(lst) - 1`, `over_sum` is the maximum value of `sm` encountered during the loop's execution, `i` is `len(lst)`, and `j` is `len(lst) - 1`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `r` will hold the indices of the two elements in the list `lst` that, when split, result in the highest possible value of the given expression. The variable `l` remains unchanged as it was set to `len(lst) - 1` initially and is not modified within the loop. `over_sum` will contain the maximum value of `sm` found during the loop's execution. Both `i` and `j` will be equal to `len(lst)`, as the loop increments `i` until it reaches the length of the list and then stops.
