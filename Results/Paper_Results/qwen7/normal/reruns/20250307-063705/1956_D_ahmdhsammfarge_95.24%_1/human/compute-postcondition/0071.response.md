Functionality: **The function accepts a list of non-negative integers (`lst`) and returns two indices (`r` and `l`) that maximize the value of `sm`. The value of `sm` is calculated as the sum of elements from the start of `lst` to index `i-1` plus the sum of elements from index `j+1` to the end of `lst` plus the square of `(j - i + 1)`. After the function executes, `lst` remains unchanged, and the returned indices correspond to the pair that yields the highest possible value of `sm`.**
