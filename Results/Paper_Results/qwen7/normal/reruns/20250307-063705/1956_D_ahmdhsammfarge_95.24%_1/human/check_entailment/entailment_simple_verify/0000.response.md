### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the problem requirements.

#### Function 1 (`func_1`)
This function aims to find the indices `r` and `l` that maximize the value of `sm`, which is defined as the sum of elements from the start of `lst` to index `i-1` plus the sum of elements from index `j+1` to the end of `lst` plus the square of `(j - i + 1)`. This definition does not align with the problem statement, which requires setting a subarray to the MEX value of that subarray to maximize the sum.

#### Function 2 (`func_2`)
This function recursively appends operations to the list `ops`. However, the operations it appends do not correspond to setting a subarray to the MEX value of that subarray. Instead, it seems to be appending operations that do not make sense in the context of the problem.

#### Function 3 (`func_3`)
This function also attempts to append operations to `ops`, but again, these operations do not correspond to setting a subarray to the MEX value of that subarray. The logic inside the function does not reflect the problem requirements.

#### Main Code
The main code reads the input, initializes the `ops` list, and calls `func_1` to find the indices `r` and `l` that maximize the value of `sm`. It then enters a loop where it repeatedly calls `func_3` to modify the array, but the modifications do not follow the problem's requirement of setting a subarray to the MEX value of that subarray.

Given the above analysis, the code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` do not follow the problem description and do not use the operation described (setting a subarray to the MEX value of that subarray) to maximize the sum of the array.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
