The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `r`, `l`, and `ops`. It does not return any value. If `r` equals `l`, it appends `[r + 1, l + 1]` to the `ops` list and returns. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself twice with `l - 1`, appending `[r + 1, l + 1]` to the `ops` list after each call. The final state of the program is that the `ops` list contains specific operations based on the values of `r` and `l`.
