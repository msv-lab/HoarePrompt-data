Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `r` is 0, `l` is 0, `over_sum` is the sum of all elements in `lst`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(lst)):
    for j in range(i + 1, len(lst)):
        sm = sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2
        if sm > over_sum:
            r, l = [i, j]
            over_sum = sm


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: The final values of `r` and `l` will be the indices that maximize the value of `sm`, which is defined as the sum of elements from the start of `lst` to index `i-1` plus the sum of elements from index `j+1` to the end of `lst` plus the square of `(j - i + 1)`. The variable `over_sum` will hold the maximum value of `sm` found during the entire execution of the loop. All other variables and their states will remain unchanged from their initial or previous iteration states.

In more detail:
- `r` and `l` will store the pair of indices that give the highest value of `sm`.
- `over_sum` will contain the maximum value of `sm` encountered during the loop's execution.
- `i` will be the last value it was set to before the loop terminated.
- `j` will be the last value it was set to before the loop terminated.
- `lst` will remain unchanged from its initial state.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `r` is `i`, `l` is `len(lst) - 1`, `over_sum` is the maximum value of `sm` encountered during the loop's execution, `i` is the same as before, `j` is `len(lst) - 1`, `sm` is the sum of elements from the start of `lst` up to index `i-1` plus the sum of elements from index `j+1` to the end of `lst` plus `(j - i + 1)`. If `sm` is greater than `over_sum`, then `over_sum` is updated to `sm`.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, `r` and `l` will store the indices that maximize the value of `sm`, which is the sum of elements on either side of the segment defined by these indices plus the squared length of the segment. The loop iterates through possible segment endpoints (`j`) starting from `i + 1` to the end of the list, updating `r`, `l`, and `over_sum` whenever a new maximum `sm` is found. Since the loop continues until `j` reaches the last index of `lst`, the final values of `r` and `l` will be the indices that define the segment with the highest `sm` value.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `r` is the pair of indices that maximize the value of `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1)




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
