### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program based on the problem description and the provided annotations.

#### Problem Description Recap
- We need to maximize the sum of the array by performing operations where we choose a subarray and set all elements in that subarray to the MEX (minimum excluded value) of that subarray.
- The operations can be performed up to \(5 \times 10^5\) times.
- The goal is to find the maximum sum and the sequence of operations that achieves this sum.

#### Function Analysis

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
   - The function aims to find the optimal subarray `[l, r]` to maximize the sum of the array.
   - It iterates through all possible subarrays and calculates the new sum if the subarray is replaced by the MEX of that subarray.
   - The logic is flawed because it does not correctly calculate the MEX and the new sum. Specifically, the sum calculation is incorrect and does not reflect the actual MEX value.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
   - This function is supposed to recursively construct a sequence of operations to achieve the desired subarray.
   - However, the function does not seem to be used effectively in the context of finding the MEX or updating the array.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`):**
   - This function updates the array and records operations.
   - The logic inside `func_3` is also flawed. The condition `if min(lst[r:l + 1]) == 0:` is unnecessary and incorrect. The MEX of any subarray will never be 0 if the subarray contains 0.

#### Correct Approach
To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Identify the MEX of a subarray.
2. Update the subarray with the MEX value.
3. Record the operations.

Here is a corrected approach:
1. **Calculate MEX:** For a given subarray, the MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray.
2. **Update Subarray:** Set all elements in the subarray to the MEX value.
3. **Record Operations:** Keep track of the operations performed.

#### Corrected Code
```python
def mex(subarray):
    seen = set(subarray)
    i = 0
    while i in seen:
        i += 1
    return i

def func_1(lst):
    r = l = 0
    over_sum = sum(lst)
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(lst)):
            sm = sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) * mex(lst[i:j + 1])
            if sm > over_sum:
                r, l = i, j
                over_sum = sm
    return r, l

def func_3(r, l, lst, ops):
    ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    if min(lst[r:l + 1]) == 0:
        ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    ops.append([r + 1, r + 1])
    func_2(r, l, ops)
    ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    n = l - r + 1
    lst[r:l + 1] = [mex(lst[r:l + 1])] * (l - r + 1)
    return lst

def func_2(r, l, ops):
    if r == l:
        ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
        return
    func_2(r, l - 1, ops)
    ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    func_2(r, l - 1, ops)

def solve():
    n = int(input())
    lst = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ops = []
    (r, l) = func_1(lst)
    while r != l:
        lst = func_3(r, l, lst, ops)
        (r, l) = func_1(lst)
    try:
        while True:
            i = lst.index(0) + 1
            lst[i - 1] = 1
            ops.append([i, i])
    except ValueError:
        pass
    print(sum(lst), len(ops))
    for r in ops:
        print(*r)

solve()
```

### Final Evaluation

The original assessment was accurate in identifying the flaws in the provided program. However, the provided code can be corrected to meet the requirements of the problem. Therefore, the original assessment was correct in identifying the issues but not in the final conclusion.

**Final: False**
