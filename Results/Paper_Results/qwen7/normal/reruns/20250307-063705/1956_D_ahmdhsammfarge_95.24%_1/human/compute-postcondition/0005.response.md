Postcondition: `ops` is a list containing the sublist `[r + 1, l + 1]` appended with another sublist `[r + 1, l + 1]`, `r` is an integer such that `0 <= r < len(lst)`, `l` is an integer such that `0 <= l <= r < len(lst)`, and `lst` is a list of non-negative integers. If the minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is 0, then `ops` contains an additional sublist `[r + 1, l + 1]`. There is no change in the else part.
