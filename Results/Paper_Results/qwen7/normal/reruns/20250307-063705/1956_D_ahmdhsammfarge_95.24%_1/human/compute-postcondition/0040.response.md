Output State: **`r` is `i`, `l` is `i + 3`, `over_sum` is the maximum value of `sm` encountered during the loop's execution, `i` is the same as before, `j` is `i + 3`, `sm` is sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1)**

Explanation: The code `r, l = [i, j]` updates the values of `r` and `l`. Specifically, `r` is now `[i, j]` and `l` is `[i + 3, j]`. However, since `r` and `l` are supposed to be single values, they are likely being reassigned to `i` and `j` respectively. Thus, `r` becomes `i` and `l` becomes `i + 3`. The other variables (`over_sum`, `i`, `j`, and `sm`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
