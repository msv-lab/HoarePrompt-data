The function `func_3` accepts four parameters: `r`, `l`, `lst`, and `ops`. `r` and `l` are integers such that `0 <= l <= r < len(lst)`, and `lst` is a list of non-negative integers. `ops` is a list that will store the operations performed. After executing the function body, the function modifies the list `lst` by replacing the elements from index `r` to `l` (inclusive) with a list of `n` elements, each element being `n`, where `n` is the length of the range from `l` to `r`. The rest of the list remains unchanged. The function then returns the modified list `lst`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `r`, `l`, `lst`, and `ops`.
