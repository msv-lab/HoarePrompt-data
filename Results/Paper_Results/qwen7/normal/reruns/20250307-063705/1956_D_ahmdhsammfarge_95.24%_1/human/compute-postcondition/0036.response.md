Output State: **`r` is `i`, `l` is `j`, `over_sum` is `sm`, `i` is the same as before, `j` is `i + 2`, `sm` is the sum of elements from the start of `lst` up to index `i-1` plus the sum of elements from index `j+2` to the end of `lst` plus `(j - i + 1), `over_sum` is now equal to `sm`.**

Explanation: The line `over_sum = sm` assigns the current value of `sm` to `over_sum`. This does not change the values of `r`, `l`, `i`, `j`, or `sm`. The value of `over_sum` is updated to be the same as `sm`.
