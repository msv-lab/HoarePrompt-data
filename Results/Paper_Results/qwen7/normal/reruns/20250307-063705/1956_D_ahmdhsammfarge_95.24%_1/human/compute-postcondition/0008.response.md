Output State: **`ops` is a list containing the sublists `[r + 1, l + 1]`, `[r + 1, l + 1]`, `[r + 1, r + 1]`, and `[r + 1, l + 1]`.**

Explanation: The code appends a new sublist `[r + 1, l + 1]` to the list `ops`. Initially, `ops` contains three sublists: `[r + 1, l + 1]`, `[r + 1, l + 1]`, and `[r + 1, r + 1]`. After executing the code, the new sublist is added to the end of `ops`, resulting in four sublists in total.
