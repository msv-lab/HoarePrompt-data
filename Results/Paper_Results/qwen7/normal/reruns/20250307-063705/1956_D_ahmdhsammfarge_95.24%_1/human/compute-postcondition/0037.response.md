Postcondition: **`r` is `i`, `l` is `j`, `over_sum` is the maximum value of `sm` encountered during the loop's execution, `i` is the same as before, `j` is `i + 2`, `sm` is the sum of elements from the start of `lst` up to index `i-1` plus the sum of elements from index `j+2` to the end of `lst` plus `(j - i + 1), and `over_sum` is updated to `sm` if `sm > over_sum`.**
