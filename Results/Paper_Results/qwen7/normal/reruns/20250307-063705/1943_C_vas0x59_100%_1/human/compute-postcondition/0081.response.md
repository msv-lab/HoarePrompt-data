To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the operations step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `ops` is a list of tuples.
   - `d` is the result of BFS starting from `a`.
   - `previous` is the parent node array from BFS.
   - `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`.
   - `path_ba` is a list containing the shortest path from `b` back to `a` in the BFS traversal.
   - `n` is the parent node of `path_ba[-1]` in the `previous` array.
   - `ci2` is half the length (integer division) of `path_ba`.
   - `ci1` is `ci2 - 1`.
   - `c1` is the element at index `ci1` in `path_ba`.
   - `c2` is the element at index `ci2` in `path_ba`.

2. **Determining `ops` Content:**
   - If `len(path_ba)` is odd, `ops` contains tuples `(c, i)` for every integer `i` from `0` to `ci`, where `ci` is a non-negative integer and at least 1.
   - If `len(path_ba)` is even, `ops` contains tuples `(c1, 1)`, `(c2, 1)`, `(c1, 3)`, `(c2, 3)`, ..., up to `(c1, len(path_ba) - ci1 - 1)`, `(c2, len(path_ba) - ci1 - 1)`, where `ci1` is `ci2 - 1` and `ci2` is half the length of `path_ba` (integer division).

3. **Printing the Tuples:**
   - The `print` statement uses `map` with a lambda function to format each tuple in `ops` as a string and then prints them separated by newlines.

Given the complexity, let's assume a specific example to illustrate:

- Suppose `path_ba = [1, 2, 3]` (odd length).
- `ci2` would be `1` (half of 3, integer division).
- `ci1` would be `0` (`ci2 - 1`).
- `c1` would be `1` (element at index `0`).
- `c2` would be `2` (element at index `1`).

So, `ops` would be `[('1', 0), ('2', 1), ('1', 2)]`.

The `print` statement would output:
```
1 0
2 1
1 2
```

Therefore, the output is:
Output: **1 0\n2 1\n1 2**
