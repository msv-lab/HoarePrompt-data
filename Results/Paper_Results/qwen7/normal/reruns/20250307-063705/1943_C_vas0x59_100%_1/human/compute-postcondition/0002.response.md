Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and the range function, which uses the variable `n - 1`.

2. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - The loop will iterate from `0` to `n - 2` because `range(n - 1)` generates numbers from `0` to `n - 2`.
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least `1` (since `n - 1` should be non-negative).
   - The variable `_` is a throwaway variable and doesn't require adjustment.

3. **Consider the initial state**:
   - The initial state is given as: `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^3\), and `u2vs` is a list of length `n` where each element is an empty list.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since the loop requires `n - 1` iterations, `n` must be at least `2` (the smallest value that allows `n - 1` to be positive).
   - The state of `u2vs` does not affect the loop execution directly, but it remains as given.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is that `n` must be at least `2`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` must be at least 2**
