Output State: **`i` is 1, `ci` must be a non-negative integer and at least 1, `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(ci, 1)`**.

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(c, i)` to the list `ops`. Given that `c` is equal to `ci` and `i` is 1, the list `ops` now contains the tuple `(ci, 1)`. The values of `i` and `ci` remain unchanged.
