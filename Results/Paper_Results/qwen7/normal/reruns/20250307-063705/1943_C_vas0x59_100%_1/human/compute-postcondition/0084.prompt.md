You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^3. u2vs is a list of length n where each element is a list representing the neighbors of the corresponding vertex in the tree. The input describes the edges of the tree, and the tree is guaranteed to be valid (i.e., it forms a connected acyclic graph).
def func_2():
    n = int(input())
    u2vs = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for _ in range(n - 1):
        u, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        
        u -= 1
        
        v -= 1
        
        u2vs[u].append(v)
        
        u2vs[v].append(u)
        
    #State: Output State: The value of `n` must be at least 2. For each `i` from 0 to `n-2`, `u2vs[i]` contains a list of integers representing the indices of nodes connected to node `i`. Specifically, if the loop has executed `n-1` times, then for each `i` from 0 to `n-2`, `u2vs[i]` will contain a list of length at least 2, starting from `i-1` (if `i > 0`) and including `i+1`. Each `u2vs[j]` for `j` from 0 to `n-1` will also include `i` if `i < j` and `i > 0`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `u2vs` will represent an adjacency list for a graph with `n` nodes, where each node `i` (from 0 to `n-1`) is connected to nodes `i-1` (if `i > 0`) and `i+1`.
    d, _ = bfs(0)
    a = func_1(d)
    d, previous = bfs(a)
    b = func_1(d)
    path_ba = [b]
    while True:
        n = previous[path_ba[-1]]
        
        if n == -1:
            break
        
        path_ba.append(n)
        
    #State: Output State: `d` is the result of BFS starting from `a`, `previous` is the parent node array from BFS, `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the shortest path from `b` back to `a` in the BFS traversal, and `n` is the parent node of `path_ba[-1]` in the `previous` array, which eventually becomes -1 when the loop breaks.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `path_ba` will contain the full path from node `b` back to the starting node `a` through the parent pointers in the `previous` array. The loop continues appending parent nodes to `path_ba` until it reaches the root node `a` (or node `-1`), at which point the loop terminates.
    ops = []
    if (len(path_ba) % 2 == 1) :
        ci = len(path_ba) // 2
        c = path_ba[ci]
        for i in range(ci + 1):
            ops.append((c, i))
            
        #State: Output State: `i` is equal to `ci`; `ci` must be a non-negative integer and at least 1; `ops` is a list containing tuples where each tuple has the form `(c, i)` for every integer `i` from `0` to `ci`.
        #
        #In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `ci`, which is a non-negative integer and at least 1. The list `ops` will contain tuples `(c, i)` for every integer `i` ranging from `0` to `ci`.
    else :
        ci2 = len(path_ba) // 2
        ci1 = ci2 - 1
        c1 = path_ba[ci1]
        c2 = path_ba[ci2]
        for i in range(1, len(path_ba) - ci1, 2):
            ops.append((c1, i))
            
            ops.append((c2, i))
            
        #State: Output State: `ops` is a list containing tuples `(c1, i)`, `(c2, i)`, and additional tuples generated by the loop for each iteration. The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `len(path_ba) - ci1` with a step of 2. Given that `ci1` is `ci2 - 1` and `ci2` is half the length of `path_ba` (integer division), the loop will continue until `i` reaches the second-to-last element of `path_ba`. 
        #
        #Since `path_ba` has a length of `len(path_ba)`, and `ci2` is half of this length, `i` will increment by 2 each time, starting from 1 up to `len(path_ba) - ci1 - 2`. This means if `path_ba` has an even length, `i` will go up to `len(path_ba) - 2`, and if it has an odd length, `i` will go up to `len(path_ba) - 3`.
        #
        #For example, if `path_ba` has 7 elements, then `ci2` would be 3 (since 7 // 2 = 3), and `ci1` would be 2. The loop would run for `i = 1, 3, 5`, generating the tuples `(c1, 1)`, `(c2, 1)`, `(c1, 3)`, `(c2, 3)`, `(c1, 5)`, and `(c2, 5)`.
        #
        #Therefore, `ops` will contain these tuples plus the initial tuples `(c1, 1)` and `(c2, 1)`.
        #
        #The final state of `ops` will be a list containing all these tuples. The other variables (`d`, `previous`, `b`, `path_ba`, `n`, `ci2`, `ci1`, `c1`, `c2`) will retain their last known values from the third iteration, as they are not modified within the loop.
        #
        #Output State: `ops` is a list containing tuples `(c1, 1)`, `(c2, 1)`, `(c1, 3)`, `(c2, 3)`, ..., up to `(c1, len(path_ba) - ci1 - 1)`, `(c2, len(path_ba) - ci1 - 1)`. `d` is the result of BFS starting from `a`, `previous` is the parent node array from BFS, `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the shortest path from `b` back to `a` in the BFS traversal, `n` is the parent node of `path_ba[-1]` in the `previous` array, `ci2` is half the length (integer division) of `path_ba`, `ci1` is `ci2 - 1`, `c1` is the element at index `ci1` in `path_ba`, `c2` is the element at index `ci2` in `path_ba`.
    #State: `ops` is a list containing tuples. If `len(path_ba)` is odd, `ops` contains tuples `(c, i)` for every integer `i` from `0` to `ci`, where `ci` is a non-negative integer and at least 1. If `len(path_ba)` is even, `ops` contains tuples `(c1, 1)`, `(c2, 1)`, `(c1, 3)`, `(c2, 3)`, ..., up to `(c1, len(path_ba) - ci1 - 1)`, `(c2, len(path_ba) - ci1 - 1)`, where `ci1` is `ci2 - 1` and `ci2` is half the length of `path_ba` (integer division). `d` is the result of BFS starting from `a`, `previous` is the parent node array from BFS, `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the shortest path from `b` back to `a` in the BFS traversal, `n` is the parent node of `path_ba[-1]` in the `previous` array, `ci2` is half the length (integer division) of `path_ba`, `ci1` is `ci2 - 1`, `c1` is the element at index `ci1` in `path_ba`, and `c2` is the element at index `ci2` in `path_ba`.
    print(len(ops))
    #This is printed: ci2 (where ci2 is half the length of path_ba, integer division)
    print(*map(lambda x: f'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}', ops), sep='\n')
    #This is printed: 1 0\n2 1\n1 2
    return None
    #The program returns None
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and returns None.
