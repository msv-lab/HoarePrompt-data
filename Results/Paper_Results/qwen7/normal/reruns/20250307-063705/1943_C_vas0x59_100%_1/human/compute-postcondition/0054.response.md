Output State: **`i` is 0; `ci` must be a non-negative integer; `ops` is a list containing one tuple `(c, 0)`**.

In this case, the code appends a tuple `(c, i)` to the list `ops`. Given that `i` is initially 0, the tuple added to `ops` is `(c, 0)`. The value of `ci` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the operation.
