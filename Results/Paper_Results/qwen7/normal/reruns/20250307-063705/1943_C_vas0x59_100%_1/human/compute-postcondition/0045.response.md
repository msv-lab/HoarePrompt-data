Output State: **`d` is the result of BFS starting from `a`, `previous` is the parent node array from BFS, `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing `b` and `n` with `n` appended as the parent node of `path_ba[-1]` in the BFS traversal, and `n` is updated to be the parent node of `path_ba[-1]` in the `previous` array.**

Explanation: The code `path_ba.append(n)` appends the value of `n` to the list `path_ba`. Given the initial conditions, `path_ba` now contains `b` and `n`, with `n` being the parent node of `path_ba[-1]` in the BFS traversal. The variable `n` is also updated to be the parent node of `path_ba[-1]` in the `previous` array. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
