Output State: **`d` is the result of BFS starting from `a`, `previous` is the parent node array from BFS, `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing `b` and `n`, and `n` is now set to the parent node of `path_ba[-1]` in the BFS traversal, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change any variable values but instead breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. All the variables retain their previous values as described in the initial state.
