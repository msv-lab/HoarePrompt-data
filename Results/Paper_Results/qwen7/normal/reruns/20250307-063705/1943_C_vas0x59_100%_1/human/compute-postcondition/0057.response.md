Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `ci`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = ci`. This means that for each iteration, `i` increases by 1 until it reaches `ci`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `ci` must be a non-negative integer and at least 1.
   - `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(ci, 1)`.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increases by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 2.
   - For the loop to continue executing, `i` must be less than `ci + 1`. Given that `i` is now 2, `ci` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute again.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `ci` must still be a non-negative integer and at least 2.
   - The value of `ops` does not change based on the loop head variables, so it remains as `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(ci, 1)`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `i` is 2, `ci` must be a non-negative integer and at least 2, `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(ci, 1)`**
