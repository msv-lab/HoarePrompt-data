Output State: **`ops` is an empty list, `d` is the result of BFS starting from `a`, `previous` is the parent node array from BFS, `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the shortest path from `b` back to `a` in the BFS traversal, and `ci` is the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2.**

Explanation: The code assigns `ci` the value of `len(path_ba) // 2`, which is the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2. Since the length of `path_ba` is odd, `len(path_ba) // 2` will be the integer part of half the length of `path_ba`. All other variables remain unchanged.
