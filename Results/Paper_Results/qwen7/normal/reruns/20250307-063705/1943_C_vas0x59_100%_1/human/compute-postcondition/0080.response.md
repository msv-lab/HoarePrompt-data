To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the conditions given:

1. **`ops` List Construction**:
   - If `len(path_ba)` is odd, `ops` contains tuples `(c, i)` for every integer `i` from `0` to `ci`, where `ci` is a non-negative integer and at least 1.
   - If `len(path_ba)` is even, `ops` contains tuples `(c1, 1)`, `(c2, 1)`, `(c1, 3)`, `(c2, 3)`, ..., up to `(c1, len(path_ba) - ci1 - 1)`, `(c2, len(path_ba) - ci1 - 1)`, where `ci1` is `ci2 - 1` and `ci2` is half the length of `path_ba` (integer division).

2. **Values of Variables**:
   - `d` is the result of BFS starting from `a`.
   - `previous` is the parent node array from BFS.
   - `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`.
   - `path_ba` is a list containing the shortest path from `b` back to `a` in the BFS traversal.
   - `n` is the parent node of `path_ba[-1]` in the `previous` array.
   - `ci2` is half the length (integer division) of `path_ba`.
   - `ci1` is `ci2 - 1`.
   - `c1` is the element at index `ci1` in `path_ba`.
   - `c2` is the element at index `ci2` in `path_ba`.

Given these details, let's consider the two cases for `len(path_ba)`:

- **Case 1: `len(path_ba)` is odd**:
  - `ops` would contain tuples `(c, i)` for every integer `i` from `0` to `ci`.
  - Since `ci` is a non-negative integer and at least 1, the number of tuples in `ops` would be `ci + 1`.

- **Case 2: `len(path_ba)` is even**:
  - `ops` would contain tuples `(c1, 1)`, `(c2, 1)`, `(c1, 3)`, `(c2, 3)`, ..., up to `(c1, len(path_ba) - ci1 - 1)`, `(c2, len(path_ba) - ci1 - 1)`.
  - Here, `ci1` is `ci2 - 1` and `ci2` is half the length of `path_ba` (integer division).
  - The number of tuples in `ops` would be `ci2`.

Since the exact value of `len(path_ba)` is not specified, we need to consider both cases. However, the number of tuples in `ops` will always be either `ci + 1` (if `len(path_ba)` is odd) or `ci2` (if `len(path_ba)` is even).

Given that `ci2` is half the length of `path_ba` (integer division), and `ci1` is `ci2 - 1`, the number of tuples in `ops` will be `ci2` if `len(path_ba)` is even.

Therefore, the number of tuples in `ops` will be `ci2`.

Output: **ci2 (where ci2 is half the length of path_ba, integer division)**
