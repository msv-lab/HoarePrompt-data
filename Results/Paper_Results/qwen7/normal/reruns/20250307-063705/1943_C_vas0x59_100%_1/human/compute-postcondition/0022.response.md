Output State: **`d` is the shortest distance from node 0 to all other nodes in the graph represented by `u2vs`, and `_` is the parent array used in BFS which is not needed for further calculation.**

Explanation: The code `d, _ = bfs(0)` calls the breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm starting from node 0. The BFS algorithm calculates the shortest path distances from the starting node (node 0) to all other nodes in the graph. The function returns two values: `d`, which is a list containing the shortest distances from node 0 to each node, and `_` (an underscore), which is typically used to represent an ignored return value in Python. Since the underscore is not needed for further calculation, it is mentioned here but not included in the final output state. The adjacency list `u2vs` is updated to represent the graph structure after the loop completes, and the values of `n` and `u2vs` remain unchanged.
