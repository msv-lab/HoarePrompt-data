Output State: **`d` is the result of BFS starting from `a`, `previous` is the parent node array from BFS, and `a` is the return value of `func_1(d)`**.

Explanation: The code `d, previous = bfs(a)` performs a Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from the node represented by `a`. The BFS function returns two values: `d`, which represents the shortest distance from the start node (`a`) to all other nodes in the graph, and `previous`, which is an array indicating the parent node of each node in the shortest path tree. The variable `a` retains its value as the return value of `func_1(d)`.
