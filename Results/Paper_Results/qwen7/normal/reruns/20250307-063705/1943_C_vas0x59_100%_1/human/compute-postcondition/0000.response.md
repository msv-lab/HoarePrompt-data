Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^3, `u2vs` is a list of length `n` where each element is a list representing the neighbors of the corresponding vertex in the tree.**

Explanation: The code reads an integer `n` from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This changes the value of `n` but does not affect the list `u2vs`. The precondition that `u2vs` is a list of length `n` where each element is a list representing the neighbors of the corresponding vertex in the tree remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `n` and the unchanged state of `u2vs`.
