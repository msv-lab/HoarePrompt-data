Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is defined as `for _ in range(n - 1):`. The key variables here are `n` and the loop counter (which is `_` but doesn't affect the state directly).

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue if `n - 1` is greater than 0, meaning `n` must be at least 2.

3. **Analyze the given state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` must be at least 2.
   - `u` is `u - 1`.
   - `v` is `v - 1`.
   - `u2vs[v].append(u)`

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating `n - 1` times, after each iteration, `n` decreases by 1.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `n` should be decreased by 1 from its current value.
   - The values of `u` and `v` will also decrease by 1 as per the given information.
   - The operation `u2vs[v].append(u)` will append the new value of `u` to the list `u2vs[v]`.

Given that `n` must be at least 2, after one iteration, `n` will be `n - 1`. If `n` was initially at least 2, it will still be at least 1 after one iteration, allowing the loop to continue.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `n` will be `n - 1`.
- `u` will be `u - 1` (decreased by 1).
- `v` will be `v - 1` (decreased by 1).
- `u2vs[v].append(u)` will append the new value of `u` to the list `u2vs[v]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` must be at least 1, `u` is `u - 1`, `v` is `v - 1`; `u2vs[v].append(u)`**
