Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `u` is `u - 1`, `v` is `v - 1`; `u2vs[u]` contains `[v]`**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `v` to the list `u2vs[u]`. Given the initial state where `u` is `u - 1` and `v` is `v - 1`, after executing the line `u2vs[u].append(v)`, the list `u2vs[u]` will contain the value `[v]`. All other variables remain in their initial relative states.
