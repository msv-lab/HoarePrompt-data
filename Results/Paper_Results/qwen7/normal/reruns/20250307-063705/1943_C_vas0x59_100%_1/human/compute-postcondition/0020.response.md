Output State: The value of `n` must be at least 2, `u` is an input integer decreased by 1, `v` is an input integer decreased by 1, `u2vs[u]` contains a list of all `v` values (decreased by 1) from the inputs provided during the loop's iterations, and `u2vs[v]` contains a list of all `u` values (decreased by 1) from the inputs provided during the loop's iterations. Each `u2vs[v]` will also contain `u` itself since each pair `(u, v)` is bidirectionally added to each other's lists.

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, `u2vs` will represent an adjacency list for a graph where each edge is bidirectional. The list at index `i` in `u2vs` will contain all nodes connected to node `i` through edges defined by the inputs given during the loop's iterations.
