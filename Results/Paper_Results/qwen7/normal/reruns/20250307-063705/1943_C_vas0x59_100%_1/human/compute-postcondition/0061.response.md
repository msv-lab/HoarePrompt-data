Output State: `i` is equal to `ci`; `ci` must be a non-negative integer and at least 1; `ops` is a list containing tuples where each tuple has the form `(c, i)` for every integer `i` from `0` to `ci`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `ci`, which is a non-negative integer and at least 1. The list `ops` will contain tuples `(c, i)` for every integer `i` ranging from `0` to `ci`.
