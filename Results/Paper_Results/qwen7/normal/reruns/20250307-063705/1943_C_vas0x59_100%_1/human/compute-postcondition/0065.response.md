Output State: **`ops` is an empty list, `d` is the result of BFS starting from `a`, `previous` is the parent node array from BFS, `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the shortest path from `b` back to `a` in the BFS traversal, `n` is the parent node of `path_ba[-1]` in the `previous` array, `ci2` is half the length (integer division) of `path_ba`, `ci1` is `ci2 - 1`.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns `ci1` the value of `ci2 - 1`. Since `ci2` is half the length of `path_ba` (integer division), `ci1` is now one less than `ci2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
