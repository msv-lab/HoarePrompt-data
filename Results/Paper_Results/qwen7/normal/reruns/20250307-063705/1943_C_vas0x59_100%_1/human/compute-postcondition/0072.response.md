Output State: **`ops` is a list containing tuples `(c1, i)`, `(c2, i)` and the new tuple `(c1, i)`, `d` is the result of BFS starting from `a`, `previous` is the parent node array from BFS, `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the shortest path from `b` back to `a` in the BFS traversal, `n` is the parent node of `path_ba[-1]` in the `previous` array, `ci2` is half the length (integer division) of `path_ba`, `ci1` is `ci2 - 1`, `c1` is the element at index `ci1` in `path_ba`, `c2` is the element at index `ci2` in `path_ba`, `i` is `ci1 + 2`**.

In natural language: The list `ops` now includes an additional tuple `(c1, i)`. All other variables retain their previous values and states. Specifically, `ops` now contains tuples involving `c1` and `i`, `d` is the result of BFS starting from `a`, `previous` holds the parent node array from BFS, `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` contains the shortest path from `b` back to `a` in the BFS traversal, `n` is the parent node of the last element in `path_ba` according to the `previous` array, `ci2` is half the length of `path_ba` (integer division), `ci1` is `ci2 - 1`, `c1` is the element at index `ci1` in `path_ba`, `c2` is the element at index `ci2` in `path_ba`, and `i` is `ci1 + 2`.
