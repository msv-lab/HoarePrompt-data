For the given `while True` loop, there are no conditions specified in the loop head that would determine whether the loop can execute another iteration. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to any of the states provided, as the loop will continue to execute indefinitely.

However, since the problem requires us to modify the program state so that the next iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, and considering the nature of the `while True` loop, we can assume that the loop will always proceed to the next iteration without any condition checks.

Given the current states:
- `d` is the result of BFS starting from `a`
- `previous` is the parent node array from BFS
- `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`
- `path_ba` is a list containing `b` and `n`
- `n` is the parent node of `b` in the BFS traversal

Since the loop is `while True`, no changes are required to these states for the loop to proceed to the next iteration.

State: **`d` is the result of BFS starting from `a`, `previous` is the parent node array from BFS, `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing `b` and `n`, and `n` is the parent node of `b` in the BFS traversal**
