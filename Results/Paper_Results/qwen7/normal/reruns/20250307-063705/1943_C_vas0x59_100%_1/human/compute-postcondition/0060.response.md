Output State: `i` is equal to `ci`; `ci` must be a non-negative integer and at least 1; `ops` is a list containing tuples where each tuple has the form `(c, i)` for every integer `i` from `0` to `ci`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `ci`, which means it has reached the maximum integer value it could take based on the condition `ci`. The list `ops` will contain tuples `(c, i)` for every integer `i` starting from `0` up to and including `ci`.
