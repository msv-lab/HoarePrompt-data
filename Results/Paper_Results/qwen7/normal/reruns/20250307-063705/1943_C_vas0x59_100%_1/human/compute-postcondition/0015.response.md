Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `u2vs[u]` contains `[u - 2, v - 2]`, `u2vs[v - 2].append(u)` has appended `u` to the list at index `v - 2` in `u2vs`**.

Explanation: The code reads two integers from input and assigns them to `u` and `v`. The initial conditions for `u` and `v` being `u - 4` and `v - 4` respectively, and the list `u2vs` are preserved. The new values of `u` and `v` are the inputs provided by the user.
