Output State: **`d` is the result of BFS starting from `a`, `previous` is the parent node array from BFS, `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing `b`.**

Explanation: The code snippet initializes a list `path_ba` with the value of `b`. The values of `d`, `previous`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial states.
