Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^3, `u2vs` is a list of length `n` where each element is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes `u2vs` as a list of length `n`, where each element is an empty list. This means that for every index `i` in the range from `0` to `n-1`, `u2vs[i]` is `[]`. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and the structure of `u2vs` is now a list of `n` empty lists.
