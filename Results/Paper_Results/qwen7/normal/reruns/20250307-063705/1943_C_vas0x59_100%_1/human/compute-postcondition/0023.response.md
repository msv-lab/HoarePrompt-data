Output State: **`d` is the shortest distance from node 0 to all other nodes in the graph represented by `u2vs`, `a` is the return value of `func_1(d)`**.

This means that the function `func_1` has been called with `d` as its argument, and it has returned some value which is now stored in `a`. The value of `d` remains unchanged from its initial state, and the parent array `_` is not needed for further calculation.
