Postcondition: **`ops` is a list containing tuples. If `len(path_ba)` is odd, `ops` contains tuples `(c, i)` for every integer `i` from `0` to `ci`, where `ci` is a non-negative integer and at least 1. If `len(path_ba)` is even, `ops` contains tuples `(c1, 1)`, `(c2, 1)`, `(c1, 3)`, `(c2, 3)`, ..., up to `(c1, len(path_ba) - ci1 - 1)`, `(c2, len(path_ba) - ci1 - 1)`, where `ci1` is `ci2 - 1` and `ci2` is half the length of `path_ba` (integer division). `d` is the result of BFS starting from `a`, `previous` is the parent node array from BFS, `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the shortest path from `b` back to `a` in the BFS traversal, `n` is the parent node of `path_ba[-1]` in the `previous` array, `ci2` is half the length (integer division) of `path_ba`, `ci1` is `ci2 - 1`, `c1` is the element at index `ci1` in `path_ba`, and `c2` is the element at index `ci2` in `path_ba`.**
