Postcondition: **`d` is the result of BFS starting from `a`, `previous` is the parent node array from BFS, `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing `b`, and `n` is the parent node of `b` in the BFS traversal. If `n` equals `-1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
