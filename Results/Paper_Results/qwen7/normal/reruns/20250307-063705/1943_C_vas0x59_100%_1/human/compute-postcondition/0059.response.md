Output State: **`i` is 2; `ci` must be a non-negative integer and at least 1; `ops` is a list containing the tuples `[(ci, 1), (ci, 2)]**.

Explanation: The code appends a new tuple `(ci, i)` to the list `ops`. Given that `i` is 2 and `ci` must be a non-negative integer and at least 1, the list `ops` now contains two tuples: the original one `(ci, 1)` and the new one `(ci, 2)`. The value of `i` remains unchanged.
