Output State: **`d` is the result of BFS starting from `a`, `previous` is the parent node array from BFS, `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing `b` and `n`, and `n` is now set to the parent node of `path_ba[-1]` in the BFS traversal.**

Explanation: The code `n = previous[path_ba[-1]]` updates the value of `n` to be the parent node of the last element in `path_ba`. Since `path_ba` contains `b` and `n`, the last element in `path_ba` is `n`. Therefore, `n` is updated to be the parent node of `n` in the BFS traversal. All other variables remain unchanged.
