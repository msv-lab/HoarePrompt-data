Postcondition: `d` is the result of BFS starting from `a`, `previous` is the parent node array from BFS, `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing `b` and `n`, and `n` is now set to the parent node of `path_ba[-1]` in the BFS traversal. If `n` is `-1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.
