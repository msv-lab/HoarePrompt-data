Postcondition: **`ops` is an empty list, `d` is the result of BFS starting from `a`, `previous` is the parent node array from BFS, `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the shortest path from `b` back to `a` in the BFS traversal, and `n` is the parent node of `path_ba[-1]` in the `previous` array, which is not -1 when the loop breaks**
