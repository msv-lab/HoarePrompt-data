Output State: The value of `n` must be at least 2. For each `i` from 0 to `n-2`, `u2vs[i]` contains a list of integers representing the indices of nodes connected to node `i`. Specifically, if the loop has executed `n-1` times, then for each `i` from 0 to `n-2`, `u2vs[i]` will contain a list of length at least 2, starting from `i-1` (if `i > 0`) and including `i+1`. Each `u2vs[j]` for `j` from 0 to `n-1` will also include `i` if `i < j` and `i > 0`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `u2vs` will represent an adjacency list for a graph with `n` nodes, where each node `i` (from 0 to `n-1`) is connected to nodes `i-1` (if `i > 0`) and `i+1`.
