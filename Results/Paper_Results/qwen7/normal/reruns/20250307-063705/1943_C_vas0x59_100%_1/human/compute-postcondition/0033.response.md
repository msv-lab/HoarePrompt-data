Output State: **`d` is the result of BFS starting from `a`, `previous` is the parent node array from BFS, `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing `b` and `n`, and `n` is the parent node of `b` in the BFS traversal.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `n` to the list `path_ba`. Since `n` is the parent node of `b` in the BFS traversal, the list `path_ba` now contains `b` and its parent node `n`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
