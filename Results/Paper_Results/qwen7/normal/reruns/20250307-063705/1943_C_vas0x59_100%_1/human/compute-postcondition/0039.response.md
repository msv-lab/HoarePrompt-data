Output State: **`d` is the result of BFS starting from `a`, `previous` is the parent node array from BFS, `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing `b` and `n` with `n` appended as the parent node of `path_ba[-1]` in the BFS traversal, and if `n` equals -1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

In this output state, the `path_ba` list is updated by appending the parent node of `path_ba[-1]` (which is the last element in the list) in the BFS traversal. If `n` is -1, it means the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
