Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i`, `len(path_ba)`, `ci1`, and `ci2`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop starts with `i = 1` and increments by 2 each time.
   - The loop continues as long as `i < len(path_ba) - ci1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ops` is a list containing tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)`.
   - `d` is the result of BFS starting from `a`.
   - `previous` is the parent node array from BFS.
   - `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`.
   - `path_ba` is a list containing the shortest path from `b` back to `a` in the BFS traversal.
   - `n` is the parent node of `path_ba[-1]` in the `previous` array.
   - `ci2` is half the length (integer division) of `path_ba`.
   - `ci1` is `ci2 - 1`.
   - `c1` is the element at index `ci1` in `path_ba`.
   - `c2` is the element at index `ci2` in `path_ba`.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 2.
   - Therefore, `i` is now `ci1 + 2` (since `i` started at 1 and incremented by 2).
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `len(path_ba) - ci1`.
   - Hence, `len(path_ba) - ci1` must be greater than `ci1 + 2`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be `ci1 + 2`.
   - `len(path_ba)` remains unchanged.
   - `ci1` remains unchanged.
   - `ci2` remains unchanged.

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`ops` is a list containing tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)`, `d` is the result of BFS starting from `a`, `previous` is the parent node array from BFS, `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the shortest path from `b` back to `a` in the BFS traversal, `n` is the parent node of `path_ba[-1]` in the `previous` array, `ci2` is half the length (integer division) of `path_ba`, `ci1` is `ci2 - 1`, `c1` is the element at index `ci1` in `path_ba`, `c2` is the element at index `ci2` in `path_ba`, `i` is `ci1 + 2`**.
