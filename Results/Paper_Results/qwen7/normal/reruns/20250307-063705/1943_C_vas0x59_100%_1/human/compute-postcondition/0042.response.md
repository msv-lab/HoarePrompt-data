Output State: **`d` is the result of BFS starting from `a`, `previous` is the parent node array from BFS, `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing `b` and `n` with `n` appended as the parent node of `path_ba[-1]` in the BFS traversal, and `n` is updated to be the parent node of `path_ba[-1]` in the `previous` array, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This means that the `break` statement has been executed, which exits the current loop or conditional block without further execution of the subsequent statements. All the variables retain their values as they were before the `break` statement was encountered, except for the fact that we are now outside the loop or conditional block where the `break` was used.
