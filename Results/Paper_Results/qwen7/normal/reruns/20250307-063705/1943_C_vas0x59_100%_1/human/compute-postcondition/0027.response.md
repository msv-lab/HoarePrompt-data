For the given `while True` loop, there are no conditions in the loop head that depend on any variables. The loop will always execute as long as it is encountered, because it is a `while True` loop.

Since there are no conditions to check and no variables to adjust based on the loop head, no modifications are necessary to the program state for the loop to proceed.

State: **`d` is the result of BFS starting from `a`, `previous` is the parent node array from BFS, `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing `b`**
