Output State: **`ops` is an empty list, `d` is the result of BFS starting from `a`, `previous` is the parent node array from BFS, `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the shortest path from `b` back to `a` in the BFS traversal, and `n` is the parent node of `path_ba[-1]` in the `previous` array, `ci2` is half the length (integer division) of `path_ba`.**

Explanation: The code `ci2 = len(path_ba) // 2` calculates `ci2` as half the length of `path_ba` using integer division. The length of `path_ba` is not specified, but `ci2` is set to half of it. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
