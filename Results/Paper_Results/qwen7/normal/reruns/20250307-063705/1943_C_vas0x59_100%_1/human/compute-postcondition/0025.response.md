Output State: **`d` is the result of BFS starting from `a`, `previous` is the parent node array from BFS, `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`**.

Explanation: The code `b = func_1(d)` assigns the return value of `func_1(d)` to the variable `b`. Since `d` is the result of BFS starting from `a` and `previous` is the parent node array from BFS, these values remain unchanged. The function `func_1(d)` returns a value, which is assigned to `b`. Therefore, `b` now holds the return value of `func_1(d)`.
