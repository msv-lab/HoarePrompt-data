Output State: **`n` must be at least 1, `u` is `u - 1`, `v` is `v - 1`; `u2vs[v].append(u)`, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `u` and `v`. These values replace the previous values of `u` and `v`, which were `u - 1` and `v - 1` respectively. The precondition that `n` must be at least 1 remains unchanged. The list `u2vs[v]` now appends the new value of `u` to it.
