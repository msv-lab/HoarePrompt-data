Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `u` is an input integer decreased by 1, `v` is an input integer decreased by 1, `u2vs[u]` contains `[u - 3, v - 2, v, u - 1]`, `u2vs[v - 2]` contains `[u - 1, u]`**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `u` to the list `u2vs[v]`. Initially, `u2vs[v]` contains `[u - 3, v - 2, v]`. After appending `u`, the list becomes `[u - 3, v - 2, v, u]`. The values of `n`, `u`, `v`, and `u2vs[v - 2]` remain unchanged.
