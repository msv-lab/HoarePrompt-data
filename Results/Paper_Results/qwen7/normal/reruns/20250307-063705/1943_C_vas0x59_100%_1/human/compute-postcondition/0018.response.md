Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `u` is an input integer decreased by 1, `v` is an input integer decreased by 1, `u2vs[u]` contains `[u - 3, v - 2, v], `u2vs[v - 2]` contains `[u - 1, u]**

Explanation: The code `u2vs[u].append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the list at index `u` in `u2vs`. Given the initial state, `u` is an input integer decreased by 1, and `v` is an input integer decreased by 1. The initial state also mentions that `u2vs[u - 1]` contains `[u - 3, v - 2]` and `u2vs[v - 2].append(u - 1)`. After executing the code, `u2vs[u]` will contain `[u - 3, v - 2, v]` because `v` is appended to the list at index `u` in `u2vs`. Additionally, since `u2vs[v - 2]` previously contained `[u - 1]`, after appending `u` to it, it now contains `[u - 1, u]`.
