Output State: **`n` must be at least 1, `u` is `u - 2`, `v` is `v - 2`, `u2vs[v]` contains `[u - 1]`**

Explanation: The code `v -= 1` decrements the value of `v` by 1. Given the initial state where `v` is `v - 1`, after executing the code, `v` becomes `v - 2`. The value of `u` remains unchanged from its initial state, which is `u - 1 - 1`, simplifying to `u - 2`. The list `u2vs[v]` initially contains `[u - 1]` (from the initial state), and since no additional elements are appended, it remains `[u - 1]`.
