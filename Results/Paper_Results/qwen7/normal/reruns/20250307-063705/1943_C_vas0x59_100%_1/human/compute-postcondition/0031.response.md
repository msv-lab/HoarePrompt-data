Output State: **`d` is the result of BFS starting from `a`, `previous` is the parent node array from BFS, `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing `b`, `n` is the parent node of `b` in the BFS traversal, and the current value of `n` is `-1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `d`, `previous`, `b`, `path_ba`, or `n`. It only indicates that the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was inside. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged.
