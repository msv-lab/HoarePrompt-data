Output State: `d` is the result of BFS starting from `a`, `previous` is the parent node array from BFS, `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the shortest path from `b` back to `a` in the BFS traversal, and `n` is the parent node of `path_ba[-1]` in the `previous` array, which eventually becomes -1 when the loop breaks.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `path_ba` will contain the full path from node `b` back to the starting node `a` through the parent pointers in the `previous` array. The loop continues appending parent nodes to `path_ba` until it reaches the root node `a` (or node `-1`), at which point the loop terminates.
