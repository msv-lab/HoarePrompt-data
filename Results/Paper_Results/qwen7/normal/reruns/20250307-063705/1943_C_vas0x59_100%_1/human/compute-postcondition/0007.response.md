Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `u` is `u - 1`, `v` is `v - 1`; `u2vs[v].append(u)`**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `u` to the list `u2vs[v]`. Initially, `u2vs[v]` contains `[v]`. After executing `u2vs[v].append(u)`, the list `u2vs[v]` will contain both `v` and `u`. The values of `n`, `u`, `v`, and the structure of `u2vs` are updated accordingly.
