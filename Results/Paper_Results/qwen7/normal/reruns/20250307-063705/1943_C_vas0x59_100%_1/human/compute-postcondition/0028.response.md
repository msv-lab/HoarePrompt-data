Output State: **`d` is the result of BFS starting from `a`, `previous` is the parent node array from BFS, `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing `b`, `n` is the parent node of `b` in the BFS traversal.**

Explanation: The code `n = previous[path_ba[-1]]` assigns the value of the parent node of `b` (which is the last element in the `path_ba` list) to `n`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
