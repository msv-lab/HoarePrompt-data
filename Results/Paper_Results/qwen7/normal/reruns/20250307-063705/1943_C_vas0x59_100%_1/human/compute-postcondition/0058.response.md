Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(ci + 1)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `ci`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `ci` must be a non-negative integer and at least 1.
   - `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(ci, 1)`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < ci + 1`.

4. **Calculate the new value of `i` for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2.

5. **Determine the new condition for `ci`**:
   - Since `i` is now 2, the loop will continue if `2 < ci + 1`.
   - This implies that `ci` must be at least 1 (which it already is) but could be any value such that `ci >= 1`.

6. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `ci` must still be a non-negative integer and at least 1.
   - `ops` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 2, `ci` must be a non-negative integer and at least 1, `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(ci, 1)`**.
