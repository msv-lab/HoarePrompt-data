Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `u` and `v` are integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting it to integers using map and tuple.**

Explanation: The code `u, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))` takes a single line of input, splits it into two parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns them to `u` and `v`. The precondition that `n` must be at least 2 remains unchanged. The values of `u` and `v` are determined by the input, but since the input is not specified, they are described in terms of being integers resulting from the split and conversion process.
