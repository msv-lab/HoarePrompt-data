Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `u` is an input integer decreased by 1, `v` is an input integer decreased by 1, `u2vs[u - 1]` contains `[u - 3, v - 2]`, `u2vs[v - 2].append(u - 1)` has appended `u - 1` to the list at index `v - 2` in `u2vs`**

Explanation: The code `v -= 1` decreases the value of `v` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `v` is now an input integer decreased by 1 instead of just being an input integer.
