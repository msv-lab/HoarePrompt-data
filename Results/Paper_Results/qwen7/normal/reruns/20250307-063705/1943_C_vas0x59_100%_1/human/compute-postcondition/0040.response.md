The `while True` loop does not depend on any specific condition other than continuing indefinitely until explicitly broken out of. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to any variables or states for the loop to continue executing.

However, since the loop head itself does not contain any variables that can be adjusted, we can conclude that no changes are necessary to proceed to the next iteration of the loop.

State: **`d` is the result of BFS starting from `a`, `previous` is the parent node array from BFS, `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing `b` and `n` with `n` appended as the parent node of `path_ba[-1]` in the BFS traversal, and if `n` equals -1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
