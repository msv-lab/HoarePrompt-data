Output State: **`ops` is an empty list, `d` is the result of BFS starting from `a`, `previous` is the parent node array from BFS, `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the shortest path from `b` back to `a` in the BFS traversal, `n` is the parent node of `path_ba[-1]` in the `previous` array, `ci2` is half the length (integer division) of `path_ba`, `ci1` is `ci2 - 1`, `c1` is the element at index `ci1` in `path_ba`, `c2` is the element at index `ci2` in `path_ba`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of the element at index `ci2` in `path_ba` to `c2`. The value of `ci2` is half the length (integer division) of `path_ba`, and `ci1` is `ci2 - 1`. The value of `c1` is the element at index `ci1` in `path_ba`. All other variables remain unchanged.
