Output State: `d` is the result of BFS starting from `a`, `previous` is the parent node array from BFS, `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the shortest path from `b` back to `a` in the BFS traversal, and the loop terminates when `n` equals -1, indicating that the path from `b` back to `a` has been fully constructed.

This final output state describes that after the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `path_ba` contains the complete path from node `b` back to the starting node `a` as determined by the BFS traversal. The loop continues to append parent nodes to `path_ba` until it reaches the starting node `a`, at which point `n` becomes -1 and the loop breaks.
