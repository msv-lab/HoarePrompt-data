Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variables `i` and `ci`.

2. **Understand the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < ci + 1`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `ci` must be a non-negative integer.
   - `ops` is a list containing one tuple `(c, 0)`.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` is currently 0, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 1.
   - The condition `i < ci + 1` must still hold true. Therefore, `ci` must be at least 1 (since `i` is now 1).

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented from 0 to 1.
   - `ci` must be a non-negative integer and at least 1.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 1, `ci` must be a non-negative integer and at least 1, `ops` is a list containing one tuple `(c, 0)`**
