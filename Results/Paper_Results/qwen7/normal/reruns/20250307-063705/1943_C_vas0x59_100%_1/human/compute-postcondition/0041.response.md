Output State: **`d` is the result of BFS starting from `a`, `previous` is the parent node array from BFS, `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing `b` and `n` with `n` appended as the parent node of `path_ba[-1]` in the BFS traversal, and `n` is updated to be the parent node of `path_ba[-1]` in the `previous` array.**

In this output state, the variable `n` is updated to be the parent node of the last element in the `path_ba` list according to the `previous` array. All other variables retain their initial conditions or relationships as described in the initial state.
