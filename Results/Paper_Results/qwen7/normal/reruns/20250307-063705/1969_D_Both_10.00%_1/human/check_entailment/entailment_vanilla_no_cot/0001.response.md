Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Import Statements**:
   ```python
   import heapq
   import sys
   ```
   These imports are not used in the functions provided, so they can be removed without affecting the logic.

2. **Function Definitions**:
   ```python
   def func_1():
       return int(putin())

   def func_2():
       return map(int, putin().split())
   ```
   - `func_1` and `func_2` are defined but not used in the main logic. They seem to be placeholders for reading input, but their names suggest they might be part of a larger context or framework not provided here. We can assume these functions correctly read an integer and a space-separated list of integers, respectively.

3. **Main Function**:
   ```python
   def func_3(main_ar, sec_arr):
       sub_summ = 0
       for val_a in sec_arr:
           sub_summ += val_a[0]
       for val_b in main_ar:
           if val_b[0] + val_b[1] >= 0:
               sub_summ += val_b[0] + val_b[1]
       return sub_summ
   ```
   - The function `func_3` is supposed to calculate the sum of certain values from `main_ar` and `sec_arr`.
   - `sub_summ` is initialized to 0.
   - It iterates over `sec_arr` and adds the first element of each tuple to `sub_summ`.
   - It iterates over `main_ar` and checks if the sum of the first and second elements of each tuple is non-negative. If true, it adds the sum of those two elements to `sub_summ`.

### Correctness Analysis

#### Problem Description Recap
- Alice wants to maximize her profit.
- Bob will take either all items or the k cheapest items for free.
- Alice's profit is calculated as the difference between what Bob pays her and what she spends.

#### Issues with `func_3`
- The function `func_3` does not account for Bob's strategy of taking the k cheapest items for free.
- It simply sums up the first elements of `sec_arr` and the sums of the first and second elements of `main_ar` if they are non-negative.
- This approach does not consider the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob to maximize/minimize Alice's profit.

### Conclusion
Given the analysis, the function `func_3` does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

### Final Answer
```plaintext
Correctness: **False**
