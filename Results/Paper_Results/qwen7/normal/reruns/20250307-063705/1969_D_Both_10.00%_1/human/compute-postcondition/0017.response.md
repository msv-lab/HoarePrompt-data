Output State: **`sec_arr` must have at least one element, `sub_summ` is equal to `val_b[0] + val_b[1]` if the sum of the first two elements of `val_b` is greater than or equal to 0, and `sub_summ` is increased by `val_b[0] + val_b[1]`.**

Explanation: The code updates `sub_summ` by adding the sum of the first two elements of `val_b` to its current value. Since `sub_summ` was initially set to `val_b[0] + val_b[1]` if the sum of the first two elements of `val_b` was greater than or equal to 0, the new value of `sub_summ` is the original value plus the sum of the first two elements of `val_b`. The conditions and the existence of `sec_arr` remain unchanged.
