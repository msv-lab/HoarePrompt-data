Output State: **`sub_summ` is `val_a[0] + val_a[1] + val_a[0]`, `val_a` is the third element in `sec_arr`, `sec_arr` must have at least 3 elements.**

Explanation: The value of `sub_summ` is updated by adding `val_a[0]` to its current value. Initially, `sub_summ` was `val_a[0] + val_a[1]`. After adding `val_a[0]` again, `sub_summ` becomes `val_a[0] + val_a[1] + val_a[0]`. The values of `val_a` and `sec_arr` remain unchanged.
