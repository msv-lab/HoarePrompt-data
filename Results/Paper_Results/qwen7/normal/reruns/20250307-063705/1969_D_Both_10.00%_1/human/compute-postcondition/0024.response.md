Output State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, `sub_summ` will contain the sum of all `val_b[0] + val_b[1]` for each `val_b` in `main_ar` where the sum of the first two elements of `val_b` is greater than or equal to 0. `val_a` will hold the last tuple `val_b` processed in the loop, which is the last tuple in `sec_arr`. `sec_arr` will contain all tuples from `main_ar` that satisfy the condition `val_b[0] + val_b[1] >= 0`.**

In simpler terms, `sub_summ` will be the total sum of the first two elements of all tuples in `main_ar` that meet the condition of having a non-negative sum. `val_a` will be the last tuple from `main_ar` that met this condition. `sec_arr` will list all such tuples.
