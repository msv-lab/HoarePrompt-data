Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `main_ar`, a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers representing prices for Alice and Bob, and `sec_arr`, a list of integers. It returns `sub_summ`, which is the sum of all `val_b[0] + val_b[1]` for each `val_b` in `main_ar` where the sum of the first two elements of `val_b` is greater than or equal to 0. Additionally, `val_a` holds the last tuple `val_b` processed in the loop, and `sec_arr` contains all tuples from `main_ar` that satisfy the condition `val_b[0] + val_b[1] >= 0`.**
