State: **`sub_summ` is 0, `val_a` is undefined, `sec_arr` must have at least 1 element** 

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains three variables: `val_a`, which is the iterator variable, `sec_arr`, which is the iterable, and the loop control variable (which is implicitly handled by Python's `enumerate` or similar mechanism).
2. For the loop to execute, `sec_arr` must contain at least one element. If `sec_arr` is empty, the loop will not execute.
3. The initial value of `sub_summ` (0) does not affect whether the loop executes or not.
4. The value of `val_a` is not specified initially and will take on the values from `sec_arr` during each iteration, but its initial state before the loop is "undefined."

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `sec_arr` (to ensure it has at least one element), `val_a` (which is undefined before the loop starts), and no adjustment needed for `sub_summ` as it does not impact the loop's execution condition.
