Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function reads the number of test cases `t`. It correctly returns an integer value obtained from the input.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function reads the values of `n` and `k` followed by the lists `a` and `b`. It correctly returns a map object, which is then converted to a list of integers. However, the use of `map(int, putin().split())` is not ideal because it does not handle spaces properly. A better approach would be to use `list(map(int, putin().split()))`.

3. **Function `func_3`**: This function is problematic. It incorrectly processes the input lists `main_ar` and `sec_arr`. The function is supposed to calculate Alice's profit under optimal conditions, but the logic in `func_3` does not align with the problem statement. Specifically:
   - It sums all elements in `sec_arr` without any condition, which is irrelevant to the problem.
   - It iterates over `main_ar` and adds `val_b[0] + val_b[1]` to `sub_summ` if the sum is non-negative, which is also not aligned with the problem requirements.

Given the above issues, especially with `func_3`, the overall logic of the program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The program attempts to calculate Alice's profit, but the method used in `func_3` is flawed and does not reflect the optimal strategy described in the problem.

Correctness: **False**
