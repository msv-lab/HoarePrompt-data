Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `val_a` and `sec_arr`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in `sec_arr` to iterate over.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `sub_summ` is the sum of `0 + val_a[0] + val_a[1]`.
   - `val_a` is the second element in `sec_arr`.
   - `sec_arr` must have at least 2 elements.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `val_a` is the second element in `sec_arr`, the loop will move to the next element in `sec_arr` for the next iteration.
   - Therefore, `val_a` will now be the third element in `sec_arr`.
   - For the loop to continue, `sec_arr` must still have at least 2 elements (it will have at least 3 elements since it had at least 2 before and one was just used).

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `sub_summ` remains unchanged because the loop body is omitted and no new values are added to `sub_summ` in this context.
   - `val_a` changes to the third element in `sec_arr`.
   - `sec_arr` must have at least 3 elements to ensure the loop can continue.

Based on the above reasoning, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `sub_summ` is 0 + `val_a[0]` + `val_a[1]`, `val_a` is the third element in `sec_arr`, `sec_arr` must have at least 3 elements**
