#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple lists and integers (n, k, a, and b) provided as part of the test case. It returns an integer value obtained from the function `putin()` for each test case.

def func_2():

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes an input string by splitting it and converting each element into an integer, returning a map object containing these integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: main_ar is a list of pairs (tuples) (a_i, b_i), where a_i is an integer representing the price of the i-th item for Alice and b_i is an integer representing the price of the i-th item for Bob; sec_arr is a list of integers representing additional parameters needed for the calculation, but its use in the provided function is not clear from the problem description and does not seem to be relevant to the game scenario described.

    #State: Output State: `sub_summ` is the sum of all elements in `sec_arr`, `val_a` is the last element in `sec_arr`, `sec_arr` must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations the loop executed.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `sub_summ` will contain the total sum of all the first elements from each tuple in `sec_arr`. The variable `val_a` will hold the last element processed in the loop, which is the last tuple in `sec_arr`, and `sec_arr` should have at least as many elements as there were iterations of the loop.

        if val_b[0] + val_b[1] >= 0:
            sub_summ += val_b[0] + val_b[1]
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `sub_summ` will contain the sum of all `val_b[0] + val_b[1]` for each `val_b` in `main_ar` where the sum of the first two elements of `val_b` is greater than or equal to 0. `val_a` will hold the last tuple `val_b` processed in the loop, which is the last tuple in `sec_arr`. `sec_arr` will contain all tuples from `main_ar` that satisfy the condition `val_b[0] + val_b[1] >= 0`.
    return sub_summ
    #The program returns `sub_summ`, which is the sum of all `val_b[0] + val_b[1]` for each `val_b` in `main_ar` where the sum of the first two elements of `val_b` is greater than or equal to 0. Additionally, `val_a` holds the last tuple `val_b` processed in the loop, which is the last tuple in `sec_arr`, and `sec_arr` contains all tuples from `main_ar` that satisfy the condition `val_b[0] + val_b[1] >= 0`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters: `main_ar`, a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers representing prices for Alice and Bob, and `sec_arr`, a list of integers. It calculates the sum of all `val_b[0] + val_b[1]` for each `val_b` in `main_ar` where the sum of the first two elements of `val_b` is greater than or equal to 0. Additionally, it updates `val_a` to hold the last tuple `val_b` processed in the loop, and `sec_arr` is modified to contain only the tuples from `main_ar` that satisfy the condition `val_b[0] + val_b[1] >= 0`. The function returns `sub_summ`, which is the computed sum.
