Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` do not seem to address the core logic required to solve the problem.

- **Function `func_1`**: This function returns an integer value, but it is not clear what `putin()` is or how it is supposed to be used. It seems like this function is not relevant to solving the problem.
  
- **Function `func_2`**: This function returns a tuple of integers, which also does not seem to be related to the problem. Again, it is unclear what `putin()` is and how it is supposed to be used.

- **Function `func_3`**: This function takes two arrays (`main_ar` and `sec_arr`) and calculates a sum based on certain conditions. However, it does not implement the logic required to solve the problem. The problem requires finding the optimal strategy for Alice to maximize her profit, considering Bob's actions. The function `func_3` does not account for the different scenarios where Bob might take items for free or pay for them, nor does it handle the optimization aspect for Alice.

Given these observations, the program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem, and thus it is incorrect.
