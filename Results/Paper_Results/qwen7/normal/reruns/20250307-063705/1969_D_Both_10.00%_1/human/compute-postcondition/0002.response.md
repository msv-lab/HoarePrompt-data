Output State: **`sub_summ` is 0 + `val_a[0]`, `val_a` is undefined, `sec_arr` must have at least 1 element**

The code updates `sub_summ` by adding the first element of `val_a` (i.e., `val_a[0]`) to its current value. Since `sub_summ` was initially 0, it now becomes `0 + val_a[0]`. The other variables remain unchanged, with `val_a` still being undefined and `sec_arr` maintaining its requirement of having at least one element.
