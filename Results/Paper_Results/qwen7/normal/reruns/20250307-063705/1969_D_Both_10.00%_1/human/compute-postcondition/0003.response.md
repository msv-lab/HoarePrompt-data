Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for val_a in sec_arr:`. The variables involved here are `val_a` and `sec_arr`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `sec_arr` has at least one element.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `sub_summ` is `0 + val_a[0]`, meaning `sub_summ` is the sum of the first element of `val_a` (which is currently undefined).
   - `val_a` is undefined.
   - `sec_arr` must have at least 1 element.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `sec_arr` must still have at least one element.
   - Since `val_a` is now defined as the current element from `sec_arr`, it will be used in the loop body.
   - After the first iteration, `val_a` will be the first element of `sec_arr`, and `sub_summ` will be updated accordingly.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `val_a` will be the first element of `sec_arr`.
   - `sub_summ` will be updated to include the value of the first element of `sec_arr`.
   - `sec_arr` will have one less element since the first element has been processed.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `sub_summ` is `0 + val_a[0] + val_a[0]`, `val_a` is the first element of `sec_arr`, `sec_arr` must have at least 0 elements**.

However, since `sec_arr` must have at least 1 element initially, after the first iteration, it must have at least 0 elements to continue the loop. Therefore, the correct state is:

**State: `sub_summ` is `0 + val_a[0]`, `val_a` is the first element of `sec_arr`, `sec_arr` must have at least 0 elements**.

But to be precise and align with the initial condition, the correct state should reflect that `sec_arr` must still have at least 1 element to continue the loop:

**State: `sub_summ` is `0 + val_a[0]`, `val_a` is the first element of `sec_arr`, `sec_arr` must have at least 1 element**.

Since the first element is already taken, the correct state for the next iteration should be:

**State: `sub_summ` is `0 + val_a[0]`, `val_a` is the first element of `sec_arr`, `sec_arr` must have at least 0 elements**.

But to ensure clarity and correctness based on the initial condition:

**State: `sub_summ` is `0 + val_a[0]`, `val_a` is the first element of `sec_arr`, `sec_arr` must have at least 1 element**.
