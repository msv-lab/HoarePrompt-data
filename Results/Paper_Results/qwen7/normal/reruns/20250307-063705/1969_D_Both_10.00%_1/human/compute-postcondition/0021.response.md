Output State: **`sub_summ` is increased by the sum of `val_b[0]` and `val_b[1]`.**

This means that the value of `sub_summ` has been updated to include the sum of the first and second elements of `val_b`. The initial values of `main_ar` and `val_b` remain unchanged, and `sub_summ` now holds its original value plus the sum of `val_b[0]` and `val_b[1]`.
