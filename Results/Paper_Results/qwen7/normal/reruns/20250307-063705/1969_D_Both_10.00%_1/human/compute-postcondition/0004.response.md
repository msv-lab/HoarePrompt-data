Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for val_a in sec_arr:`. This means the variables involved in the loop head are `val_a` and `sec_arr`.

2. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `sub_summ` is `0 + val_a[0]`, meaning `sub_summ` is the sum of the first element of `val_a` (which is `val_a[0]`).
   - `val_a` is undefined, indicating it hasn't been assigned a value yet in this context.
   - `sec_arr` must have at least 1 element.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `sec_arr` must have at least 2 elements because the loop will pick the next element from `sec_arr` and assign it to `val_a`.
   - After the loop picks the next element from `sec_arr`, `val_a` will be defined as the current element of `sec_arr`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `sub_summ` remains the same because it is dependent on the previous value of `val_a[0]`.
   - `val_a` will be defined as the next element in `sec_arr`.
   - `sec_arr` must have at least 2 elements for the loop to continue.

Given these points, the updated state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `sub_summ` is 0 + `val_a[0]`, `val_a` is the next element in `sec_arr`, `sec_arr` must have at least 2 elements**
