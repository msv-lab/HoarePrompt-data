Output State: `sub_summ` is the sum of all elements in `sec_arr`, `val_a` is the last element in `sec_arr`, `sec_arr` must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations the loop executed.

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `sub_summ` will hold the total sum of all the `val_a[0]` values from each element in `sec_arr`. The variable `val_a` will be set to the last element of `sec_arr` that was processed by the loop, and `sec_arr` should contain at least as many elements as there were iterations of the loop.
