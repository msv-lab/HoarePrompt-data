Reasoning:

1. **Function Definitions and Input Handling**: The program correctly defines three functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`) and reads the input values as expected. The input handling logic is correct.

2. **Sorting and Heap Operations**: The program sorts the items based on their prices for Bob (`b_i`). It then uses a heap to manage the top `k` items that Bob might take for free. This approach is correct for managing the items that Bob might take for free.

3. **Profit Calculation Logic**:
   - The program calculates the initial profit by considering the best possible scenario where Bob takes the `k` most expensive items for free. This is done using the `heapq.heappushpop` method.
   - The program then iteratively removes the least beneficial items (those with the smallest `b_i - a_i` values) from the remaining items and updates the profit accordingly. This ensures that the remaining items are the ones that provide the maximum profit for Alice.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The program handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately, such as when `k` is zero, or when there are fewer than `k` items.
   - The logic for updating the profit and managing the heap is consistent with the problem statement.

5. **Output**: The program prints the final profit for each test case, which is calculated correctly based on the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
