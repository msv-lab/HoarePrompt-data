Output State: **`sub_summ` is equal to `val_b[0] + val_b[1]`, `sec_arr` must have at least one element, the sum of the first two elements of `val_b` is greater than or equal to 0.**

Explanation: The code adds the first two elements of `val_b` and assigns the result to `sub_summ`. The other conditions and the state of `sec_arr` remain unchanged.
