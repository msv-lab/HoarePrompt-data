Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `sec_arr` must have at least one element.
- `sub_summ` is increased by `val_b[0] + val_b[1]` if the sum of the first two elements of `val_b` is greater than or equal to 0. Otherwise, `sub_summ` remains unchanged.

### Loop Head
```python
for val_b in main_ar:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each element in `main_ar`.
2. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variable in the loop head is `val_b`.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning
- At the end of the previous iteration, `val_b` is the current element being processed in the loop.
- For the loop to continue, `main_ar` must still contain at least one element.

### Adjusted States
- Since `val_b` is the current element being processed, it will change in the next iteration.
- `main_ar` must still have at least one element for the loop to continue.

### Conclusion
- `sec_arr` does not need to be adjusted as it is not part of the loop head.
- `sub_summ` might change depending on the value of `val_b[0] + val_b[1]`, but its exact value cannot be determined without knowing the specific value of `val_b` for the next iteration.
- `main_ar` must have at least one element for the loop to continue.

### Final State
State: **`sec_arr` must have at least one element, `main_ar` must have at least one element**.

However, since the problem specifies that only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted, and the only object in the loop head is `val_b`, the state adjustment should reflect the necessary condition for the loop to continue.

### Correct Final State
State: **`val_b` is the next element in `main_ar`, `main_ar` must have at least one element**.

Given the problem constraints, the most accurate and concise answer would be:

State: **`main_ar` must have at least one element**.

This reflects the necessary condition for the loop to continue executing.
