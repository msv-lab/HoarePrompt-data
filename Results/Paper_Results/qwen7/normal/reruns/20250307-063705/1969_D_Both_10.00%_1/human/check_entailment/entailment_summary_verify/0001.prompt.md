You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game in the shop. There are n items in the shop;
each item has two parameters: a_i (item price for Alice) and b_i (item price
for Bob).

Alice wants to choose a subset (possibly empty) of items and buy them. After
that, Bob does the following:

  * if Alice bought less than k items, Bob can take all of them for free; 
  * otherwise, he will take k items for free that Alice bought (Bob chooses which k items it will be), and for the rest of the chosen items, Bob will buy them from Alice and pay b_i for the i -th item. 

Alice's profit is equal to \sum\limits_{i \in S} b_i - \sum\limits_{j \in T}
a_j , where S is the set of items Bob buys from Alice, and T is the set of
items Alice buys from the shop. In other words, Alice's profit is the
difference between the amount Bob pays her and the amount she spends buying
the items.

Alice wants to maximize her profit, Bob wants to minimize Alice's profit. Your
task is to calculate Alice's profit if both Alice and Bob act optimally.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ; 0 \le k \le n ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9
).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n (1 \le b_i \le 10^9 ).

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases doesn't
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer — Alice's profit if both Alice and
Bob act optimally.

    7 6 8 10 6 8

Output

Note

In the first test case, Alice should buy the 2 -nd item and sell it to Bob, so
her profit is 2 - 1 = 1 .

In the second test case, Alice should buy the 1 -st, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd
item; then Bob takes the 1 -st item for free and pays for the 2 -nd and the 3
-rd item. Alice's profit is (3+2) - (1+2+1) = 1 . Bob could take 2 -nd item
for free instead; this does not change Alice's profit. Bob won't take the 3
-rd item for free, since this would lead to a profit of 2 .

- Program:
import heapq
import sys
#Function 1:
def func_1():
    return int(putin())

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    return map(int, putin().split())

#Function 3:
def func_3(main_ar, sec_arr):
    sub_summ = 0
    for val_a in sec_arr:
        sub_summ += val_a[0]
    for val_b in main_ar:
        if val_b[0] + val_b[1] >= 0:
            sub_summ += val_b[0] + val_b[1]
    return sub_summ



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 3 : The function accepts two parameters: `main_ar`, a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers representing prices for Alice and Bob, and `sec_arr`, a list of integers. It calculates the sum of all `val_b[0] + val_b[1]` for each `val_b` in `main_ar` where the sum of the first two elements of `val_b` is greater than or equal to 0. Additionally, it updates `val_a` to hold the last tuple `val_b` processed in the loop, and `sec_arr` is modified to contain only the tuples from `main_ar` that satisfy the condition `val_b[0] + val_b[1] >= 0`. The function returns `sub_summ`, which is the computed sum.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function Definitions**:
   - `func_1()`: This function is supposed to read an integer from input.
   - `func_2()`: This function is supposed to read multiple integers separated by spaces and return them as a tuple.
   - `func_3(main_ar, sec_arr)`: This function is supposed to compute a sum based on the elements of `main_ar` and `sec_arr`.

2. **Problem Understanding**:
   - Alice wants to maximize her profit.
   - Bob wants to minimize Alice's profit.
   - The profit calculation involves choosing items such that the difference between the total cost Bob pays Alice and the total cost Alice incurs is maximized for Alice.

3. **Key Points**:
   - Alice needs to select items to maximize her profit considering Bob's actions.
   - Bob will either take all items for free if Alice buys fewer than \(k\) items, or he will take \(k\) items for free and charge for the rest.

4. **Algorithm**:
   - To solve this, we need to prioritize items that have a high positive difference between \(b_i\) and \(a_i\).
   - We should sort items based on \(b_i - a_i\) in descending order.
   - If Alice buys more than \(k\) items, Bob will take \(k\) items for free, and Alice will only get paid for the remaining items.

5. **Implementation**:
   - The given code does not correctly implement the solution. It does not handle sorting or prioritizing items based on the profit margin \(b_i - a_i\).
   - The `func_3` function does not reflect the logic needed to solve the problem.

### Correct Solution Outline
- Read the input values \(n\) and \(k\).
- Read the prices \(a_i\) and \(b_i\) for each item.
- Calculate the profit margin \(b_i - a_i\) for each item.
- Sort the items based on the profit margin in descending order.
- Determine the optimal strategy based on the value of \(k\):
  - If Alice buys fewer than \(k\) items, Bob takes all items for free.
  - If Alice buys more than \(k\) items, Bob takes \(k\) items for free and charges for the rest.

### Conclusion
The given program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the provided program is incorrect.
