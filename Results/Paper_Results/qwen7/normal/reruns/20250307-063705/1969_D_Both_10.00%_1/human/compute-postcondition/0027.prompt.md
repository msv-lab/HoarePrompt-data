You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: main_ar is a list of pairs (tuples) (a_i, b_i), where a_i is an integer representing the price of the i-th item for Alice and b_i is an integer representing the price of the i-th item for Bob; sec_arr is a list of integers representing additional parameters needed for the calculation, but its use in the provided function is not clear from the problem description and does not seem to be relevant to the game scenario described.
def func_3(main_ar, sec_arr):
    sub_summ = 0
    for val_a in sec_arr:
        sub_summ += val_a[0]
        
    #State: Output State: `sub_summ` is the sum of all elements in `sec_arr`, `val_a` is the last element in `sec_arr`, `sec_arr` must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations the loop executed.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `sub_summ` will contain the total sum of all the first elements from each tuple in `sec_arr`. The variable `val_a` will hold the last element processed in the loop, which is the last tuple in `sec_arr`, and `sec_arr` should have at least as many elements as there were iterations of the loop.
    for val_b in main_ar:
        if val_b[0] + val_b[1] >= 0:
            sub_summ += val_b[0] + val_b[1]
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `sub_summ` will contain the sum of all `val_b[0] + val_b[1]` for each `val_b` in `main_ar` where the sum of the first two elements of `val_b` is greater than or equal to 0. `val_a` will hold the last tuple `val_b` processed in the loop, which is the last tuple in `sec_arr`. `sec_arr` will contain all tuples from `main_ar` that satisfy the condition `val_b[0] + val_b[1] >= 0`.
    return sub_summ
    #The program returns `sub_summ`, which is the sum of all `val_b[0] + val_b[1]` for each `val_b` in `main_ar` where the sum of the first two elements of `val_b` is greater than or equal to 0. Additionally, `val_a` holds the last tuple `val_b` processed in the loop, which is the last tuple in `sec_arr`, and `sec_arr` contains all tuples from `main_ar` that satisfy the condition `val_b[0] + val_b[1] >= 0`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: `main_ar`, a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers representing prices for Alice and Bob, and `sec_arr`, a list of integers. It returns `sub_summ`, which is the sum of all `val_b[0] + val_b[1]` for each `val_b` in `main_ar` where the sum of the first two elements of `val_b` is greater than or equal to 0. Additionally, `val_a` holds the last tuple `val_b` processed in the loop, and `sec_arr` contains all tuples from `main_ar` that satisfy the condition `val_b[0] + val_b[1] >= 0`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns `sub_summ`, which is the sum of all `val_b[0] + val_b[1]` for each `val_b` in `main_ar` where the sum of the first two elements of `val_b` is greater than or equal to 0. Additionally, `val_a` holds the last tuple `val_b` processed in the loop, which is the last tuple in `sec_arr`, and `sec_arr` contains all tuples from `main_ar` that satisfy the condition `val_b[0] + val_b[1] >= 0`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Use Natural language easily understandable by humans and strictly reply with the format: Functionality: ** your response here **
