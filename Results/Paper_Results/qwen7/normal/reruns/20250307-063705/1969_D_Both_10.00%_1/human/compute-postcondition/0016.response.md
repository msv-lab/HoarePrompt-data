Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `val_b`.

2. **Understand the postcondition at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `sec_arr` must have at least one element.
   - `sub_summ` is equal to `val_b[0] + val_b[1]` if the sum of the first two elements of `val_b` is greater than or equal to 0.

3. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as there are elements left in `main_ar` to iterate over.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `val_b` from `main_ar`, the next value of `val_b` will be the next element in `main_ar`.
   - We need to ensure that `sec_arr` still has at least one element, and `sub_summ` is updated based on the new `val_b`.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `sec_arr` must still have at least one element.
   - `sub_summ` will now be based on the new `val_b`, which is the next element in `main_ar`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`sec_arr` must have at least one element, and `sub_summ` is equal to `val_b[0] + val_b[1]` if the sum of the first two elements of `val_b` is greater than or equal to 0, where `val_b` is the next element in `main_ar`**.
