Output State: `sub_summ` is the sum of all elements in `sec_arr`, `val_a` is the last element in `sec_arr`, `sec_arr` must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations the loop executed.

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `sub_summ` will contain the total sum of all the first elements from each tuple in `sec_arr`. The variable `val_a` will hold the last element processed in the loop, which is the last tuple in `sec_arr`, and `sec_arr` should have at least as many elements as there were iterations of the loop.
