Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over `main_ar` using the variable `val_b`.
   - The loop body is omitted, but we know that `val_b` is used in some way within the loop.

2. **Understand the Final State Requirements:**
   - After the loop completes, `sub_summ` should be the sum of all elements in `sec_arr`.
   - `val_a` should be the last element in `sec_arr`.
   - `sec_arr` must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations the loop executed.

3. **Determine the Initial State Adjustments:**
   - Since `val_b` is used in the loop, it doesn't directly affect `sub_summ`, `val_a`, or `sec_arr` in the initial state.
   - However, we need to ensure that `sec_arr` has enough elements for the loop to execute properly.

Given these points, let's adjust the state:

- `sub_summ` and `val_a` are not directly influenced by the initial state of `val_b`.
- `sec_arr` must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations the loop will execute. This means `sec_arr` must have at least one element (since the loop will iterate at least once).

Therefore, the state adjustments needed are:

- Ensure `sec_arr` has at least one element.
- `sub_summ` and `val_a` are not specified in the initial state since they depend on the loop body, which is omitted.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`sec_arr` must have at least one element**
