Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `sub_summ` is the sum of all elements in `sec_arr`, `val_a` is the last element in `sec_arr`, `sec_arr` must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations the loop executed.

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `sub_summ` will contain the total sum of all the first elements from each tuple in `sec_arr`. The variable `val_a` will hold the last element processed in the loop, which is the last tuple in `sec_arr`, and `sec_arr` should have at least as many elements as there were iterations of the loop.
Code of the loop:
for val_b in main_ar:
    if val_b[0] + val_b[1] >= 0:
        sub_summ += val_b[0] + val_b[1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `sec_arr` must have at least one element, and `sub_summ` is equal to `val_b[0] + val_b[1]` if the sum of the first two elements of `val_b` is greater than or equal to 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `sec_arr` must have at least one element, and `sub_summ` is increased by `val_b[0] + val_b[1]` if the sum of the first two elements of `val_b` is greater than or equal to 0. If the sum of the first two elements of `val_b` is less than 0, `sub_summ` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `main_ar` must have at least one element. If `val_b[0] + val_b[1]` is greater than or equal to 0, then `sub_summ` is increased by the sum of `val_b[0]` and `val_b[1]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
