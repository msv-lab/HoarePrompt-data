Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `val_a` and `sec_arr`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in `sec_arr` to iterate over.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `sub_summ` is `0 + val_a[0] + val_a[1]`.
   - `val_a` is the second element in `sec_arr`.
   - `sec_arr` must have at least 2 elements.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `val_a` is the second element in `sec_arr`, the loop will continue if there are more elements in `sec_arr` after the current element.
   - Therefore, `sec_arr` must have at least 3 elements for the loop to execute one more time.
   - The next value of `val_a` will be the third element in `sec_arr`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `sub_summ` remains unchanged because it is calculated based on the previous values of `val_a`.
   - `val_a` will now be the third element in `sec_arr`.
   - `sec_arr` must have at least 3 elements.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`sub_summ` is 0 + `val_a[0]` + `val_a[1]`, `val_a` is the third element in `sec_arr`, `sec_arr` must have at least 3 elements**
