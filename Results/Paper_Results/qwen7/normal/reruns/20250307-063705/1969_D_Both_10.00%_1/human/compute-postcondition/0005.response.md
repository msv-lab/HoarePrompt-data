Output State: **`sub_summ` is 0 + `val_a[0]` + `val_a[1]`, `val_a` is the second element in `sec_arr`, `sec_arr` must have at least 2 elements**

Explanation:
- The line `sub_summ += val_a[0]` adds the first element of `val_a` to `sub_summ`. Since `sub_summ` was previously `0 + val_a[0]`, now it becomes `0 + val_a[0] + val_a[1]` after adding the second element of `val_a` (which is `val_a[1]`).
- `val_a` is now the second element in `sec_arr` because the loop moves to the next element in the array.
- `sec_arr` must have at least 2 elements for the loop to continue, ensuring there is a second element to be assigned to `val_a`.
