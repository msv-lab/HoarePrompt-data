Postcondition: `a` is the character at index `l - 1` in the string `s` plus `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, `i` is `n - 2`, `n` is the length of the string `s`, and the character at index `i` in `s` is not '>', `b` is the character at index `r - l` in the string `B` minus `(idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)`, and `l` is greater than 0, and the difference between `r` and `l` is greater than or equal to 0.
