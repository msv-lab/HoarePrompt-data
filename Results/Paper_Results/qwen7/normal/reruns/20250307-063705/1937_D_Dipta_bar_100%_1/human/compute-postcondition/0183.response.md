Postcondition: `i` is either `n - 2` or `n - 3`, `n` is the length of the string `s`, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is the character at index `l - 1` of the string `s` plus `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, and `b` is the character at index `r` of the string `B` minus the character at index `r - l` of the string `B` minus `(idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)` plus `(idx_B[r] - i) * l` if `l != 0`; otherwise, `i` is `n - 2` and `r` is decreased by 1.
