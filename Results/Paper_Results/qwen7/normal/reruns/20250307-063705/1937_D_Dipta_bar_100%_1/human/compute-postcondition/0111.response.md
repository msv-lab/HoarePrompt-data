Output: **n - 1**

Explanation: 
- The variable `i` is given as `n - 2`, where `n` is the length of the string `s`.
- Therefore, `i + 1` would be `(n - 2) + 1`, which simplifies to `n - 1`.
- The `end=' '` parameter in the `print` function ensures that the output is followed by a space, but since we are only focusing on what is printed, we do not include this in the final output description.
