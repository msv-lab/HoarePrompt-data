Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is either `n - 2` or `n - 3`
   - `n` is the length of the string `s`
   - `l` and `r` are updated according to specific rules depending on the value of `s[i]`

2. **Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` from `0` to `n - 1`.

3. **Conditions to Consider:**
   - If `i` is `n - 2` or `n - 3`, we need to determine the new state of `i`, `l`, `r`, and other relevant variables for the next iteration.

4. **Analyzing the Conditions:**
   - If `i` is `n - 2`:
     - `s[i]` could be `'>` or `'<` based on the given conditions.
     - If `s[i] == '>'` and `l < r`, then `l` is incremented by 1, and `b` is adjusted based on the value of `x`.
     - If `s[i] == '>'` and `l >= r`, then `i` remains `n - 1`, `l` and `r` remain unchanged, and `b` is adjusted based on the values of `idx_A` and `idx_B`.
     - If `s[i] != '>'`, then `r` is decreased by 1, and `a` and `b` are updated as described.
   - If `i` is `n - 3`:
     - Similar logic applies, but we need to consider the value of `s[i]` and the conditions accordingly.

5. **Determining the Next State:**
   - Since `i` is either `n - 2` or `n - 3`, the next value of `i` will be `n - 1`.
   - We need to check the conditions for `i = n - 1` to determine the new values of `l` and `r`.

6. **Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `i` will be `n - 1`.
   - Depending on the value of `s[n - 1]`, we need to update `l` and `r` accordingly.

Given these considerations, the final state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is the length of the string `s`, `l` and `r` are updated according to the conditions specified for `i = n - 1`**.

Since the exact values of `l` and `r` depend on the conditions in the loop body, we cannot specify them precisely without knowing the exact values of `s[n - 1]`, `l`, and `r` from the previous iteration. However, we know that `i` will be `n - 1` for the next iteration.

Therefore, the final state is:

State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is the length of the string `s`, `l` and `r` are updated according to the conditions specified for `i = n - 1`**.
