Output State: **`a` is the character at index `l - 1` in the string `s` plus `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, `i` is `n - 2`, `n` is the length of the string `s`, and the character at index `i` in `s` is not '>', `b` is the character at index `r - l` in the string `B`, and `l` is greater than 0, and the difference between `r` and `l` is greater than or equal to 0.**

Explanation: The code `b = b - B[r - l]` subtracts the character at index `r - l` in string `B` from `b`. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition that `l` is greater than 0 and the difference between `r` and `l` is greater than or equal to 0 remains valid. The value of `a` is not affected by this operation.
