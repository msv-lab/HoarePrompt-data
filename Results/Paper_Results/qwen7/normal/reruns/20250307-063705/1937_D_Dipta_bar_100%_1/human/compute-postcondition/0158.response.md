Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is the length of the string `s`, `a` is `A[l]`, `x` is `r - (l + 2)`, `b` is `b + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)` if `x >= 0`, or `b` remains unchanged if `x < 0`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b` by adding `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)` to the current value of `b`. The value of `i` remains `n - 1`, `n` remains the length of the string `s`, `a` remains `A[l]`, and `x` remains `r - (l + 2)`. The condition for `b` being updated or remaining unchanged based on `x` is preserved.
