Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is the length of the string `s`, `x` is `r - (l + 2)`, `b` is `B[r - 1] - B[x]`**

Explanation: The code `b = b - B[x]` subtracts the value of `B[x]` from `b`. Given the initial state, `b` was previously `B[r - 1]`, so after executing the code, `b` becomes `B[r - 1] - B[x]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
