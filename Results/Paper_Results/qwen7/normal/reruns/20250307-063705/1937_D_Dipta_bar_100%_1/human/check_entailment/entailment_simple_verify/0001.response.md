### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires calculating the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell. The pinball's movement is determined by the direction (`<` or `>`) at each cell, and the direction changes after each move.

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the grid and the string representing the directions.
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to compute the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid from each cell.

3. **Key Components of `func_1`**:
   - **Forward Calculation (`A`)**:
     - This part calculates the time taken for the pinball to reach the right boundary starting from the leftmost cell where the direction is `>` until the current cell.
     - It uses the indices of cells with `>` to compute the cumulative time.
   - **Backward Calculation (`B`)**:
     - This part calculates the time taken for the pinball to reach the left boundary starting from the rightmost cell where the direction is `<` until the current cell.
     - It uses the indices of cells with `<` to compute the cumulative time.
   - **Final Computation**:
     - The main loop iterates through each cell, using the forward and backward calculations to determine the total time taken for the pinball to leave the grid.
     - The logic involves adjusting the times based on the direction and position of the pinball.

4. **Verification**:
   - The code correctly handles the forward and backward calculations.
   - The logic for determining the time taken for each cell is sound and matches the problem statement.
   - The code accounts for the changing direction of the pinball and the cumulative effect on the time taken.
   - However, upon closer inspection, there are issues with the way the forward and backward calculations are handled, particularly in the final computation.

5. **Issues Identified**:
   - The logic for adjusting the times based on the direction and position of the pinball is overly complex and does not correctly reflect the simple movement rules.
   - The code attempts to handle edge cases but fails to do so in a straightforward manner.
   - The main loop logic is convoluted and does not correctly simulate the pinball's movement and direction changes.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not correctly handle cases where the pinball starts from the boundary cells or when there are no cells with the opposite direction.
   - The logic ensures that the pinball leaves the grid within a finite number of steps, but the implementation is flawed.

### Conclusion:
After reviewing the code and the annotated version, the original assessment is inaccurate. The code does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. The logic for determining the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid is flawed and does not match the expected behavior.

### Final:
**False**
