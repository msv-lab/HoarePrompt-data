Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head involves the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Conditions for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop condition is `i < n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0.

3. **Determine the New Values for `i`:**
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and the loop increments `i` by 1 each time, the new value of `i` will be `0 + 1 = 1`.

4. **Determine the Condition for `n`:**
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Given that `i` is now 1, `n` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

5. **Adjust the States:**
   - `i` changes to 1.
   - `n` must remain greater than 1.

6. **Consider Additional Information:**
   - The variable `idx_A` and its relationship to `i` and `A` are not directly relevant to the loop condition but might be important for other parts of the program. However, since they are not part of the loop head, they do not need to be adjusted here.

7. **Final State:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1**
