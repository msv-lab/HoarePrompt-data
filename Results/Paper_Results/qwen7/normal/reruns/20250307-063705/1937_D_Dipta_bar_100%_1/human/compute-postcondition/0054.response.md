Output State: **`n` is the length of the string `s`, `j` is 2, `i` is `n - 2`, `x` is undefined, `idx_B` contains `[n - 2]` if the character at index `n - 2` of string `s` is `<`, otherwise `idx_B` does not contain `[n - 2]`, and `B` is a list containing `x`.**

Explanation: The code `B.append(x)` appends the value of `x` to the list `B`. However, since `x` is undefined, `B` will be a list containing `None`. The values of `n`, `j`, `i`, and `idx_B` remain unchanged from their initial states.
