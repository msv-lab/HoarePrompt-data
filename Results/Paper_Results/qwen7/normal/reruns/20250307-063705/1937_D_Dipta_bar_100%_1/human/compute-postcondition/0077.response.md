Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is the length of the string `s`, the character at index `i` of `s` is '>', `l` is less than `r`, `a` is `A[l]`, `x` is `r - (l + 2)`, `b` is `B[r - 1]`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `B[r - 1]` to the variable `b`. No other variables are affected. The conditions and values of the other variables remain unchanged.
