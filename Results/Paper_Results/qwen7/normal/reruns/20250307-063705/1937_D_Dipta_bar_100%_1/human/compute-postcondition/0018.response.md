Output State: **`i` is 1 + (len(idx_A) - 1), `n` is greater than 1, `x` is A[len(A) - 1] + (1 - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `x` based on the last index of list `A` and `idx_A`. However, the values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states. The new value of `x` is calculated as the last element of `A` plus the product of the difference between 1 and the last element of `idx_A` and the length of `idx_A`.
