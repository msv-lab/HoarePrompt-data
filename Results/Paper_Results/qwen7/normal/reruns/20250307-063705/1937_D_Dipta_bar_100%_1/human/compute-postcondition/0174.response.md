Output State: **`i` is `n - 3`, `n` is the length of the string `s`, `a` is the character at index `l - 1` of the string `s`, `r` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `a` is assigned the character at index `l - 1` of the string `s`. The value of `i` is updated to `n - 3` because `i` was initially `n - 2` and no other operations affected it. The value of `n` remains the length of the string `s`. The variable `r` is mentioned to be decreased by 1, but since there's no direct operation on `r` in the given code snippet, it implies that `r` has already been decremented elsewhere in the code.
