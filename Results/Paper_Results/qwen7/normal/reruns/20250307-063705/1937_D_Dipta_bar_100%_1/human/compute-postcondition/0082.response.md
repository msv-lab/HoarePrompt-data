Postcondition: `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is the length of the string `s`, the character at index `i` of `s` is '>', `l` is less than `r`, `a` is `A[l]`, `x` is `r - (l + 2)`, and `b` is either `B[r - 1] - B[x] - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)` if `x` is greater than or equal to 0, or `b` remains as `B[r - 1]` if `x` is less than 0.
