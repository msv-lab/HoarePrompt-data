Output State: **`n` is the length of the string `s`, `j` is 0, `i` is `n - 1 - j`, the character at index `i` of string `s` is `<`, `x` is `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`**.

Explanation: The code calculates the value of `x` using the formula `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`. Since `i` is `n - 1 - j` and `j` is 0, `i` simplifies to `n - 1`. Therefore, `x` becomes `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - (n - 1)) * len(idx_B)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
