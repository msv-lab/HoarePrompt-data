Postcondition: `i` is `n - 2`, `n` is the length of the string `s`, the character at index `i` in `s` is not '>', `l` is greater than `r`. If `r` is 0, then `r` remains 0. Otherwise, `r` is not 0, `a` is the character at index `r` in `s`, `b` is the character at index `l - 1` in `s` minus the ASCII value of the character at index `l - r - 2` in `s` minus `(idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)` if `l - r - 1 > 0`, otherwise `b` remains unchanged; `b` is updated by adding `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)` to its current value.
