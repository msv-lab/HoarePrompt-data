Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` is the length of the string `s`, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is the character at index `l - 1` of the string `s` plus `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `a` by adding `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l` to the current value of `a`. The value of `i` remains `n - 2`, `n` remains the length of the string `s`, `r` is decreased by 1, and `a` is the character at index `l - 1` of the string `s`.
