Output State: **`n` is the length of the string `s`, `j` is 2, `i` is `n - 2`, if the character at index `n - 2` of string `s` is `<`, then `idx_B` contains `[n - 2]` and `x` remains undefined. Otherwise, `idx_B` does not contain `[n - 2]` and `x` remains undefined.**

Explanation: The code `i = n - 1 - j` updates the value of `i` by setting it to `n - 1 - j`. Given that `j` was initially 1, the new value of `i` is `n - 1 - 1`, which simplifies to `n - 2`. The other variables (`n`, `j`, `idx_B`, and `x`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
