Output State: **`i` is `n - 1 - (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, `b` is `b - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`, `n` is the length of the string `s`, `l` and `r` are unchanged.**

Explanation: The variable `b` was updated by adding `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r` to its previous value. The other variables (`i`, `a`, `n`, `l`, and `r`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
