Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is the length of the string `s`, `x` is `r - (l + 2)`, `b` is `b - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b` by subtracting `(idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)` from the current value of `b`. Since the exact values of `idx_B[x]`, `idx_B[r - 1]`, `x`, and `b` are not specified, we cannot simplify further. However, we know that `i` remains `n - 1`, `n` is the length of the string `s`, `x` is `r - (l + 2)`, and `b` is updated according to the given formula.
