Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` is the length of the string `s`, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is the character at index `l - 1` of the string `s` plus `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, `b` is the character at index `r` of the string `B` minus `B[r - l]` minus `(idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)` plus `(idx_B[r] - i) * l` if `r - l >= 0`, otherwise `b` remains unchanged.**

This means that `i` remains `n - 2`, `n` remains the length of the string `s`, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` remains the character at index `l - 1` of the string `s` plus `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, and `b` is updated to the character at index `r` of the string `B` minus `B[r - l]` minus `(idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)` plus `(idx_B[r] - i) * l` if `r - l >= 0`, otherwise `b` remains the same as its previous value.
