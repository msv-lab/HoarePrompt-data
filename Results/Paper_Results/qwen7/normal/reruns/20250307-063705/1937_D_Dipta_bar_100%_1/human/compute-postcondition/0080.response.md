Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is the length of the string `s`, the character at index `i` of `s` is '>', `l` is less than `r`, `a` is `A[l]`, `x` is `r - (l + 2)`, `b` is `B[r - 1] - B[x] - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)`, and `x` is greater than or equal to 0.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b` by subtracting `(idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)` from the current value of `b`. Since `x` is defined as `r - (l + 2)`, and `x` is greater than or equal to 0, the updated value of `b` is `B[r - 1] - B[x] - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
