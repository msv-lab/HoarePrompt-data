Output State: **`a` is the character at index `l - 1` in the string `s` plus `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, `i` is `n - 2`, `n` is the length of the string `s`, and the character at index `i` in `s` is not '>', `l` is greater than 0, `r` has any value.**

Explanation: The variable `a` is updated to be the original value of `a` plus the product of `(i - idx_A[l - 1])` and `l`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
