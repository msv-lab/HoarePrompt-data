Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `i` is `n - 2`, where `n` is the length of the string `s`.
   - `r` is decreased by 1 (though `r` is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for now).
   
2. **Print Statement**:
   - The expression to be evaluated is `n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2`.

Given `i = n - 2`, let's substitute this into the expression:
- `n - i` becomes `n - (n - 2) = 2`.
- Now, the expression simplifies to `2 + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2`.

Since `i = n - 2`, the term `(i - idx_A[l - 1])` becomes `(n - 2 - idx_A[l - 1])`.

Therefore, the full expression becomes:
\[ 2 + (n - 2 - idx_A[l - 1]) \times 2 \]

Without knowing the exact value of `idx_A[l - 1]`, we can express the final result in terms of `n` and `idx_A[l - 1]`.

So, the print statement will output:
\[ 2 + (n - 2 - idx_A[l - 1]) \times 2 \]

Output: **2 + (n - 2 - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2**
