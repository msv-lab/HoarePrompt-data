Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, the character at index `i` of `s` is '>', the length of `idx_A` is not 0, `x` is `A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`**.

This means that the variable `x` is calculated as the last element of `A` plus `(i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1])` times the length of `idx_A`. All other variables retain their initial conditions.
