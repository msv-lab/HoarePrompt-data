Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is the length of the string `s`, `a` is `A[l]`, `x` is `r - (l + 2)`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `r - (l + 2)` to the variable `x`. The values of `i`, `n`, `a`, `l`, `r` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the updated state includes the new value for `x`.
