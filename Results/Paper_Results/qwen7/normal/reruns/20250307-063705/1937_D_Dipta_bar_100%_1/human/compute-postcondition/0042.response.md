Output State: **`n` is the length of the string `s`, `j` is 0, `i` is `n - 1 - j`, the list `idx_B` is `[0]`, the character at index `i` of string `s` is `<`.**

Explanation: The code `B.append(0)` appends the value `0` to the list `idx_B`. The values of `n`, `j`, `i`, and the character at index `i` of string `s` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `n` is still the length of the string `s`, `j` is still `0`, `i` is still `n - 1 - j`, the list `idx_B` now contains `[0]`, and the character at index `i` of string `s` remains `<`.
