Output State: **`n` is the length of the string `s`, `j` is 2, `i` is `n - 2`, `x` remains undefined, `idx_B` contains `[n - 2]`**.

Explanation: The code `idx_B.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `idx_B`. Given the initial state, `i` is `n - 2`. Since the character at index `n - 2` of string `s` was previously checked to determine whether `idx_B` should contain `[n - 2]`, and it did, appending `i` (which is `n - 2`) to `idx_B` maintains that condition. All other variables remain unchanged.
