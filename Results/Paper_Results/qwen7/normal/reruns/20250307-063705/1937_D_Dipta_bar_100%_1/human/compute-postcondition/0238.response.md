Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` is the length of the string `s`, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is the character at index `r-1` of the string `s`, `b` is the character at index `l - 1` of the string `s`, `b` is decremented by the ASCII value of the character at index `l - r - 2` of the string `s`, `b` is equal to `b - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b` by subtracting the product of the difference between the ASCII values of the characters at indices `l - 1` and `l - r - 2` of the string `s` and the difference between `l` and `r`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
