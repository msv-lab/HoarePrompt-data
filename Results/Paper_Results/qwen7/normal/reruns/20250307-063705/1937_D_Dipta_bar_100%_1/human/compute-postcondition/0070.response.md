Output State: **`l` is 0, `n` is the length of the string `s`, `j` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, the list `idx_B` contains all indices in `s` where the character is '<', `B` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the distances from the last occurrence of '>' up to the current index `i`, adjusted by the length of `idx_A`, `r` is the length of the list `B`.**

The code `r = len(B)` calculates the length of the list `B` and assigns it to the variable `r`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
