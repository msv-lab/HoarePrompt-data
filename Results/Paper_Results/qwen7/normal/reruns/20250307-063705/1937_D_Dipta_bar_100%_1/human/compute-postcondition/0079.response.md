Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is the length of the string `s`, the character at index `i` of `s` is '>', `l` is less than `r`, `a` is `A[l]`, `x` is `r - (l + 2)`, `b` is `B[r - 1] - B[x]`, and `x` is greater than or equal to 0.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b` by subtracting `B[x]` from its current value. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `x` is `r - (l + 2)`, which remains the same after the operation. The value of `b` changes to `B[r - 1] - B[x]`.
