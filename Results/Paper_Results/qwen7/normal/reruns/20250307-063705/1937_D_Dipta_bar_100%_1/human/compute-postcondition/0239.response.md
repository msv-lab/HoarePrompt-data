Postcondition: `i` is `n - 2`, `n` is the length of the string `s`, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is the character at index `r-1` of the string `s`, `b` is the character at index `l - 1` of the string `s`, and if `l - r - 1` is greater than 0, then `b` is decremented by the ASCII value of the character at index `l - r - 2` of the string `s`, resulting in `b` being equal to `b - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)`. If `l - r - 1` is not greater than 0, the value of `b` remains unchanged.
