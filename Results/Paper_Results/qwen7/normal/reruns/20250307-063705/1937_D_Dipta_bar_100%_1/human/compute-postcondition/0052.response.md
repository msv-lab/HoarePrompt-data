Output State: **`n` is the length of the string `s`, `j` is 2, `i` is `n - 2`, `B` is `[0]`, `idx_B` does not contain `[n - 2]`, and `x` remains undefined.**

Explanation: The code `B.append(0)` appends the value `0` to the list `B`. The value of `n` remains the length of the string `s`, `j` remains `2`, `i` remains `n - 2`, `idx_B` does not contain `[n - 2]` because the condition for including `[n - 2]` in `idx_B` was the character at index `n - 2` being `<`, which is not affected by the code, and `x` remains undefined.
