Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i`, `n`, `l`, `r`, `s`, `a`, `b`, `x`, `idx_A`, and `idx_B`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**:
   - The loop condition is `for i in range(0, n)`.
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

3. **Analyze the Given Postcondition**:
   - `i` is either `n - 2` or `n - 3`.
   - `n` is the length of the string `s`.
   - `l` and `r` are updated based on the conditions inside the loop.

4. **Consider Each Case for the Next Iteration**:
   - **Case 1**: If `i` is `n - 2`:
     - For the loop to continue, `i` should be incremented to `n - 1`.
     - `l` and `r` remain unchanged.
     - `b` is adjusted based on the values of `idx_A` and `idx_B`.
   - **Case 2**: If `i` is `n - 3`:
     - For the loop to continue, `i` should be incremented to `n - 2`.
     - `l` and `r` remain unchanged.
     - `b` is adjusted based on the values of `idx_A` and `idx_B`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `i` can be either `n - 2` or `n - 3`, it will be incremented to `n - 1` or `n - 2` respectively.
   - `l` and `r` remain unchanged.
   - `b` is adjusted based on the values of `idx_A` and `idx_B`.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `i` is incremented to `n - 1` or `n - 2` depending on the initial value of `i`.
- `l` and `r` remain unchanged.
- `b` is adjusted based on the values of `idx_A` and `idx_B`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `i` is either `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `n` is the length of the string `s`, `l` and `r` are unchanged, and `b` is adjusted based on the values of `idx_A` and `idx_B`.**
