### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic of the program step-by-step to ensure correctness:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the grid and the string `s` representing the grid.
   - The function `func_1` is called with the string `s`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function calculates the time taken for a pinball starting at each position to leave the grid.
   - It uses two lists, `A` and `B`, to store cumulative distances and indices of specific characters ('>' and '<').

3. **Calculating `A`:**
   - `A` is populated by iterating through the string `s` from left to right.
   - For each occurrence of '>', it calculates the cumulative distance from the last occurrence of '>', adjusted by the number of '>' characters seen so far.
   - This ensures that the distance is correctly accumulated as the pinball moves.

4. **Calculating `B`:**
   - `B` is populated by iterating through the string `s` from right to left.
   - Similar to `A`, but for occurrences of '<'.
   - This ensures that the distance is correctly accumulated as the pinball moves in the opposite direction.

5. **Final Calculation and Output:**
   - The main loop iterates through each position `i` in the string `s`.
   - Depending on whether the character at `i` is '>' or '<', it calculates the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid using the precomputed values in `A` and `B`.
   - The calculations involve adjusting the distances based on the cumulative counts of '>' and '<' characters.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Correctness of `A` and `B`:**
  - Both `A` and `B` are correctly computed based on the problem requirements.
  - The cumulative distances are correctly adjusted by the number of occurrences of the respective characters.

- **Final Calculation:**
  - The final calculations for each position `i` are correct. The logic handles both directions (left to right and right to left) and correctly accounts for the distances and adjustments.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The code handles edge cases such as when there are no '>' or '<' characters in the string, ensuring that the pinball leaves the grid in the minimum possible time.

### Conclusion:

Given the detailed analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to calculate the time taken for a pinball to leave the grid for each position. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
