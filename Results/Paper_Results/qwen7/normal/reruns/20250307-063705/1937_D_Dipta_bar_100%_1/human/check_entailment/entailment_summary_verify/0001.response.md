### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires calculating the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell. The pinball's movement is determined by the direction (`<` or `>`) at each cell, and the direction changes after each move.

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the grid and the string representing the directions.
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to compute the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid from each cell.

3. **Key Components of `func_1`**:
   - **Forward Calculation (`A`)**:
     - This part calculates the time taken for the pinball to reach the right boundary starting from the leftmost cell where the direction is `>` until the current cell.
     - It uses the indices of cells with `>` to compute the cumulative time.
   - **Backward Calculation (`B`)**:
     - This part calculates the time taken for the pinball to reach the left boundary starting from the rightmost cell where the direction is `<` until the current cell.
     - It uses the indices of cells with `<` to compute the cumulative time.
   - **Final Computation**:
     - The main loop iterates through each cell, using the forward and backward calculations to determine the total time taken for the pinball to leave the grid.
     - The logic involves adjusting the times based on the direction and position of the pinball.

4. **Verification**:
   - The code correctly handles the forward and backward calculations.
   - However, the logic for determining the time taken for each cell is flawed. Specifically, the formulas used to compute the times do not accurately reflect the movement of the pinball.
   - The code incorrectly assumes that the time taken is proportional to the distance and the count of characters encountered, which does not match the actual movement pattern described in the problem statement.
   - For example, consider the string `"><<"`:
     - For the first cell (`i=0`), the pinball should take 3 seconds to leave the grid, but the code might incorrectly compute this value.
     - Similarly, for the second cell (`i=1`), the pinball should take 6 seconds, but the code might compute a different value due to the incorrect formula.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles edge cases such as when the pinball starts from the boundary cells or when there are no cells with the opposite direction.
   - However, the logic for handling these edge cases is also flawed, leading to incorrect results.

Given the analysis, the provided code does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. The formulas used to compute the times are incorrect, and the logic does not accurately reflect the movement of the pinball.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The code is incorrect and does not accurately compute the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid from each cell.

Final: **False**
