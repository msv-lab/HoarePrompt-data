Postcondition: **`i` is either `n - 2` or `n - 1`, `n` is the length of the string `s`, and `l` and `r` are updated according to the following rules:
- If the character at index `i` in `s` is '>', then `l` is incremented by 1.
- If the character at index `i` in `s` is not '>', then:
  - If `l <= r`, then:
    - If `l` equals 0, `r` is greater than or equal to `l`.
    - Otherwise, `a` is the character at index `l - 1` in `s` plus `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, `b` is the character at index `r - l` in `s` minus `(idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)` plus `(idx_B[r] - i) * l`, and `l` is greater than 0 with the difference between `r` and `l` being greater than or equal to 0.
  - If `l > r`, then:
    - If `r` is 0, `r` is 0.
    - Otherwise, `r` is not 0, `a` is the character at index `r` in `s`, `b` is the character at index `l - 1` in `s` minus the ASCII value of the character at index `l - r - 2` in `s` minus `(idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)` if `l - r - 1 > 0`, otherwise `b` remains unchanged; `b` is updated by adding `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)` to its current value.**
