Let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n - 2`, where `n` is the length of the string `s`.
   - The character at index `i` in `s` is not '>'.
   - `l` is greater than `r`.
   - `r` is not equal to 0.
   - `a` is the character at index `r` in `s`.
   - `b` is the character at index `l - 1` in `s` minus the ASCII value of the character at index `l - r - 2` in `s` minus `(idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)` if `l - r - 1 > 0`, otherwise `b` remains unchanged.
   - `b` is updated by adding `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)` to its current value.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i), end=' ')
   ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

- **Character `a`:**
  - `a` is the character at index `r` in `s`.

- **Character `b`:**
  - Initially, `b` is the character at index `l - 1` in `s` minus the ASCII value of the character at index `l - r - 2` in `s` minus `(idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)` if `l - r - 1 > 0`, otherwise `b` remains unchanged.
  - After this calculation, `b` is further updated by adding `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)` to its current value.

- **Value of `n - i`:**
  - Since `i` is `n - 2`, `n - i` is `2`.

### Calculating `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)`:

- `a * 2`: This is simply twice the ASCII value of the character at index `r` in `s`.
- `b * 2`: This is twice the final value of `b` after all the operations.
- `(n - i)`: As calculated above, this is `2`.

So, the expression `a * 2 + b * 2 + 2` will be evaluated.

### Final Output:

Given the initial conditions and the operations performed, the final output will be:

Output: **2 * ASCII_value_of_a + 2 * ASCII_value_of_b + 2**
