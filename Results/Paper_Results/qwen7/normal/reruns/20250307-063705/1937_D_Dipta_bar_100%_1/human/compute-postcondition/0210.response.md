Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `i` is set to `n - 1`.
   - `n` is the length of the string `s`.
   - `l` and `r` are updated according to the conditions specified for `i = n - 1`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(n - i, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis**:
   - Since `i` is explicitly given as `n - 1`, we can directly substitute this into the expression `n - i`.
   - Substituting `i` with `n - 1` in `n - i` gives us `n - (n - 1)`, which simplifies to `1`.

Therefore, the expression `n - i` evaluates to `1`.

Output: **1**
