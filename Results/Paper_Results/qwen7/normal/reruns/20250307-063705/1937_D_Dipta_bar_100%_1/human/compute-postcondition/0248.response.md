Output State: **i is 0, l is n, r is 0.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will have reached the beginning of the string `s`, i.e., `i` is 0. The variable `l` will have incremented by one for each '>' character encountered in the string `s`, and since the loop continues until `i` reaches 0, `l` will be equal to the total count of '>' characters in `s`. The variable `r` will be 0 because it is decremented by 1 in each iteration and will eventually reach 0 when `i` is 0. All other variables and their relationships will remain consistent with the final state of the loop.
