### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the annotated program step-by-step to determine if it correctly calculates the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for each query.

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the grid and the string `s` representing the grid.
   - It calls the function `func_1(s)` to process the string and prints the results.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function processes the string `s` to calculate the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell.
   - It maintains two lists `A` and `B` to store the cumulative distances and times for pinballs moving right and left, respectively.
   - It also maintains two lists `idx_A` and `idx_B` to store the indices of the characters `>` and `<` in the string `s`.

3. **Calculating Cumulative Distances and Times:**
   - For each character `>` in the string, it updates the cumulative distance and time in list `A`.
   - Similarly, for each character `<` in the string, it updates the cumulative distance and time in list `B`.

4. **Processing Each Query:**
   - For each query, it iterates through the string `s` and calculates the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell.
   - It uses the precomputed values in lists `A` and `B` to calculate the time efficiently.
   - The calculations involve adjusting the cumulative distances and times based on the position of the pinball and the direction of movement.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases where the pinball starts at the boundary cells (leftmost or rightmost).
   - It correctly adjusts the calculations for these cases.

### Analysis of the Code:

- **Initialization and Parsing:**
  - The code correctly initializes and parses the input.
  - The function `func_1` processes the string `s` and computes the necessary cumulative distances and times.

- **Cumulative Distance and Time Calculation:**
  - The logic for calculating cumulative distances and times is sound and correctly implemented.
  - The use of lists `A` and `B` and their respective indices (`idx_A` and `idx_B`) ensures that the calculations are accurate.

- **Query Processing:**
  - The code correctly processes each query and prints the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell.
  - The edge cases are handled appropriately, ensuring that the calculations are correct even for boundary cells.

### Conclusion:

After analyzing the code, it appears that the program correctly implements the logic to calculate the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for each query. The calculations are performed accurately, and the edge cases are handled properly.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
