Output State: **`i` is \(2 + (\text{length of } \text{idx\_A} - 1)\), `n` is still greater than 1, `A` is a list with an additional element 0 appended to it.**

Explanation: The code `A.append(0)` appends the value `0` to the list `A`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `i` is still \(2 + (\text{length of } \text{idx\_A} - 1)\) and `n` is still greater than 1. The list `A` now contains an additional element `0`.
