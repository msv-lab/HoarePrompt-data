Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `s` is a string of length `n`; `n` is the length of string `s`; `A` is an empty list; `idx_A` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n):
    if s[i] == '>':
        if len(idx_A) == 0:
            A.append(0)
        else:
            x = A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)
            A.append(x)
        idx_A.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `idx_A` contains either the element 0 or an additional element `x` where `x = A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`, depending on whether the length of `idx_A` is 0 or not, and the character at index `i` of `s` is '>', if `s[i]` is '>'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 1 + (length of `idx_A` - 1), `n` is still greater than 1, `A` now contains 0 and an additional element `x`, where `x` is calculated as `A[len(A) - 1] + (1 - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is \(3 + (\text{length of } \text{idx\_A} - 1)\), `n` is still greater than 1, `idx_A` is a list with an additional element `i` appended to it, `A` is now a list with length 10.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
