Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is the length of the string `s`.
   - `j` is 0.
   - `i` is `n - 1 - j`.
   - If the character at index `i` of string `s` is `<`, then `idx_B` contains `[i]` and `x` is undefined. Otherwise, `idx_B` does not contain `[i]` and `x` remains undefined.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for j in range(0, n):
   ```

3. **Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The only variables in the loop head are `j`.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since `j` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `j + 1`.
   - The value of `i` is determined by `i = n - 1 - j`, so it will change based on the new value of `j`.

5. **New Values:**
   - After the previous iteration, `j` was 0, so now `j` will be `0 + 1 = 1`.
   - Therefore, `i` will be `n - 1 - 1 = n - 2`.

6. **Postconditions for the Next Iteration:**
   - The postcondition for the next iteration will depend on the character at index `i` (which is now `n - 2`).
   - If the character at index `n - 2` of string `s` is `<`, then `idx_B` will contain `[n - 2]` and `x` will be undefined. Otherwise, `idx_B` will not contain `[n - 2]` and `x` will remain undefined.

7. **Final State:**
   - `n` remains the same as it is not modified inside the loop.
   - `j` is now 1.
   - `i` is now `n - 2`.
   - `idx_B` and `x` will be updated based on the character at index `n - 2`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`n` is the length of the string `s`, `j` is 1, `i` is `n - 2`, if the character at index `n - 2` of string `s` is `<`, then `idx_B` contains `[n - 2]` and `x` is undefined. Otherwise, `idx_B` does not contain `[n - 2]` and `x` remains undefined.**
