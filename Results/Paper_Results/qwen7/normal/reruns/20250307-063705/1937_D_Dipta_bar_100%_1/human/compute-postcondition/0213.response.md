Output State: **`i` is `n - 1 - (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, `b` is `A[l - r - 2]`, `n` is the length of the string `s`, `l` and `r` are updated according to the conditions specified for `i = n - 1`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b` by subtracting `A[l - r - 1]` from its current value. Since `b` was previously `A[l - 1]`, after the subtraction, `b` becomes `A[l - r - 2]`. The values of `i`, `a`, `n`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet.
