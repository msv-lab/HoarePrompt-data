Output State: **`i` is 0; `n` must be greater than 0; the character at index `i` of `s` is '>'; and the length of `idx_A` is 0; `A` contains the element 0.**

Explanation: The code `A.append(0)` adds the element `0` to the list `A`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `s`, and `idx_A`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
