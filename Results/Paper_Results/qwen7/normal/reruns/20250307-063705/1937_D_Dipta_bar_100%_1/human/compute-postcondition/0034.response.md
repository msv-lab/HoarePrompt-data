Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning `i` is equal to `n`. The variable `n` is the length of the string `s`. The list `A` contains `n` elements, where each element is calculated based on the conditions inside the loop. Specifically, each element in `A` represents the cumulative sum of the indices of '>' characters encountered so far, adjusted by the length of `idx_A` and the difference between the current index and the last index of '>' in `idx_A`.

The list `idx_A` contains all the indices of '>' characters found in the string `s`. Therefore, the output state is characterized by `i` being equal to `n`, `n` being the length of the string `s`, `A` containing `n` elements representing the described cumulative sums, and `idx_A` containing all indices of '>' characters in `s`.
