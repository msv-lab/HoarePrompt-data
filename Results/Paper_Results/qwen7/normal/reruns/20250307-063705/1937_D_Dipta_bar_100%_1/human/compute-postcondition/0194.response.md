Postcondition: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` is the length of the string `s`, `r` is decreased by 1. If `r` equals 0, then `r` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is the character at index `r-1` of the string `s`, `b` is the character at index `l - 1` of the string `s`, and `b` is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`**.
