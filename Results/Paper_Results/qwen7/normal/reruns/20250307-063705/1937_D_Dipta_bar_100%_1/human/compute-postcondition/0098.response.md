Postcondition: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is the length of the string `s`, and the character at index `i` of `s` is '>', `r` is not equal to 0, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)` if `l - r > 0`. Otherwise, `a` remains as `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r` and `b` remains as `A[l - 1]`.**
