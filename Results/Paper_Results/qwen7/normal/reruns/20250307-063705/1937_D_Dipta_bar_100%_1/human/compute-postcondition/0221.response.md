Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is the length of the string `s`, `l` is `l + 1`, `r` and `x` are unchanged, `b` is unchanged, `a` is unchanged, `idx_B` and `idx_A` are unchanged.**

Explanation: The line `l += 1` increments the value of `l` by 1. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `r`, `x`, `b`, `a`, `idx_B`, and `idx_A`) remain unchanged. The updated value of `l` is `l + 1`.
