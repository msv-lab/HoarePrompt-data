Postcondition: `i` is \(2 + (\text{length of } \text{idx\_A} - 1)\), `n` is still greater than 1. If `idx_A` is empty, `A` is a list with an additional element 0 appended to it. Otherwise, `x` is `A[9] + (i - idx_A[8]) * 9`, `A` is now `[x]` appended, and `A` has one more element compared to the original list.
