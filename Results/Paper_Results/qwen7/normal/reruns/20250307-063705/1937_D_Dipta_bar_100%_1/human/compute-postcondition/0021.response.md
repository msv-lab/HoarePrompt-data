Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `A` is a list. If `idx_A` is empty, then `i` remains 1, `n` is still greater than 1, and `A` contains 0. Otherwise, `i` becomes 1 + (length of `idx_A` - 1), `n` remains greater than 1, `x` is calculated as `A[len(A) - 1] + (1 - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`, and `A` has an additional element `x`.
