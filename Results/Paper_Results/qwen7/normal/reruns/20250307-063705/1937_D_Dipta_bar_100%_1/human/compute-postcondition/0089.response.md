Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `i` is `n - 1`, where `n` is the length of the string `s`.
   - The character at index `i` of `s` is `'>'`.
   - `r` is `0`.
   - The condition `(l >= r)` is true (though `l` is not explicitly mentioned, we assume it's not relevant for this specific print statement).

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(n - i, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Calculation**:
   - Since `i` is `n - 1`, substituting this into the expression `n - i` gives us `n - (n - 1)`, which simplifies to `1`.

4. **Output**:
   - The `print` statement will output `1` followed by a space (due to the `end=' '` parameter).

Output: **1 **
