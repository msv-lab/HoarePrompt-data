Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` is the length of the string `s`, the character at index `i` in `s` is not '>', `l` is greater than `r`, and `r` is not equal to 0; `a` is the character at index `r` in `s`.**

Explanation: The code `a = B[r]` assigns the character at index `r` in the string `s` to the variable `a`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged from the initial state.
