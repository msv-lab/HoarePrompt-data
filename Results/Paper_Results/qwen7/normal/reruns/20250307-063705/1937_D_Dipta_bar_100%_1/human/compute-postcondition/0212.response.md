Output State: **`i` is `n - 1 - (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, `b` is `A[l - 1]`, `n` is the length of the string `s`, `l` and `r` are updated according to the conditions specified for `i = n - 1`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `A[l - 1]` to the variable `b`. This means that `b` now holds the value of `A[l - 1]`. The values of `i`, `a`, `n`, `l`, `r`, and the string `s` remain unchanged from their initial states.
