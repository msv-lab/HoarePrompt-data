### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires calculating the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell. The pinball's movement is determined by the direction (`<` or `>`) at each cell, and the direction changes after each move.

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the grid and the string representing the directions.
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to compute the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid from each cell.

3. **Key Components of `func_1`**:
   - **Forward Calculation (`A`)**:
     - This part calculates the time taken for the pinball to reach the right boundary starting from the leftmost cell where the direction is `>` until the current cell.
     - It uses the indices of cells with `>` to compute the cumulative time.
   - **Backward Calculation (`B`)**:
     - This part calculates the time taken for the pinball to reach the left boundary starting from the rightmost cell where the direction is `<` until the current cell.
     - It uses the indices of cells with `<` to compute the cumulative time.
   - **Final Computation**:
     - The main loop iterates through each cell, using the forward and backward calculations to determine the total time taken for the pinball to leave the grid.
     - The logic involves adjusting the times based on the direction and position of the pinball.

4. **Detailed Analysis**:
   - **Forward Calculation (`A`)**:
     - The logic seems correct. It calculates the cumulative distance from the last occurrence of `>` to the current cell, adjusted by the number of `>` seen so far.
   - **Backward Calculation (`B`)**:
     - Similarly, the logic for the backward calculation also seems correct. It calculates the cumulative distance from the last occurrence of `<` to the current cell, adjusted by the number of `<` seen so far.
   - **Final Computation**:
     - The logic in the main loop is complex but appears to handle different scenarios correctly. However, upon closer inspection, there are several issues:
       - The logic for adjusting the times based on the direction and position of the pinball is overly complicated and does not match the expected behavior.
       - The use of `l` and `r` to track the indices of `A` and `B` is not correctly implemented, leading to incorrect calculations.
       - The logic for handling the boundary conditions and the changing direction of the pinball is not straightforward and may lead to errors.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code attempts to handle edge cases, but the implementation is flawed. For example, the logic for when the pinball starts from the boundary cells or when there are no cells with the opposite direction is not correctly handled.

6. **Verification**:
   - Upon reviewing the annotated code and the original assessment, it is clear that the code does not correctly implement the solution. The logic for calculating the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid is incorrect and leads to wrong results.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. The logic for calculating the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid is flawed and does not match the expected behavior.

### Final:
**False**
