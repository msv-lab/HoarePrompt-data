Postcondition: `i` is `n - 2`, `n` is the length of the string `s`, the character at index `i` in `s` is not '>', `l` is greater than `r`, and `r` is not equal to 0; `a` is the character at index `r` in `s`; `b` is the character at index `l - 1` in `s` minus the ASCII value of the character at index `l - r - 2` in `s` minus `(idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)` if `l - r - 1 > 0`. If `l - r - 1 <= 0`, the value of `b` remains unchanged.
