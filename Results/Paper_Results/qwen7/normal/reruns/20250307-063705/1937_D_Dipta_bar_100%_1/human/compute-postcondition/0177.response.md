Output State: **`i` is `n - 3`, `n` is the length of the string `s`, `a` is the character at index `l - 1` of the string `s` plus `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, `r` is decreased by 1 (now `r - 1`), `b` is the character at index `r` of the string `B` minus the character at index `r - l` of the string `B`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b` by subtracting the character at index `r - l` of string `B` from the current value of `b`. All other variables remain unchanged.
