Postcondition: `i` is `n - 2`, `n` is the length of the string `s`, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is the character at index `l - 1` of the string `s` plus `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, `b` is the character at index `r` of the string `B` minus `B[r - l]` minus `(idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)` if `r - l >= 0`. If `r - l < 0`, the values of `i`, `n`, `r`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
