Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is the length of the string `s`, and the character at index `i` of `s` is '>', and `(l - r > 0)`. `r` is not equal to 0; `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`; `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1]`**.

Explanation: The code subtracts `A[l - r - 1]` from `b`. Given the initial conditions, `b` was originally `A[l - 1]`. After executing the line `b = b - A[l - r - 1]`, `b` now becomes `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
