Postcondition: `i` is `n - 2`, `n` is the length of the string `s`, and the character at index `i` in `s` is not '>', `l` is less than or equal to `r`. If `l` equals 0, then `r` is greater than or equal to `l`. Otherwise, `a` is the character at index `l - 1` in the string `s` plus `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, `b` is the character at index `r - l` in the string `B` minus `(idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)` plus `(idx_B[r] - i) * l`, and `l` is greater than 0 with the difference between `r` and `l` being greater than or equal to 0.
