Output State: **`n` is the length of the string `s`, `j` is 3, `i` is `n - 4`, `idx_B` does not contain `[n - 2]`, `x` is `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`, and `B` has appended the value `x`.**

Explanation: The code `B.append(x)` appends the value of `x` to the list `B`. The value of `x` is given by the formula `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`. Since no specific values are provided for `B` and `idx_B`, we keep the expressions as they are. All other variables remain unchanged.
