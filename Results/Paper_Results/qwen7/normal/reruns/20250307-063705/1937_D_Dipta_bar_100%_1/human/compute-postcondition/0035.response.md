Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning `i` is equal to `n`. The variable `n` is the length of the string `s`. The list `A` contains `n` elements, where each element is calculated based on the conditions within the loop. Specifically, each element in `A` represents the cumulative sum of the distances from the last occurrence of '>' up to the current index `i`, adjusted by the length of `idx_A`. The list `idx_A` contains all indices in `s` where the character is '>', and its length is equal to the number of '>' characters in `s`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, `A` will have `n` elements reflecting the described calculation, and `idx_A` will contain all positions in `s` where the character is '>'.
