Output State: **`l` is 0, `n` is the length of the string `s`, `j` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, the list `idx_B` contains all indices in `s` where the character is '<', and `B` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the distances from the last occurrence of '>' up to the current index `i`, adjusted by the length of `idx_A`.**

Explanation: The line `l = 0` initializes the variable `l` to 0. This does not affect the values of `n`, `j`, `i`, `idx_B`, or `B`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions except for the new value of `l`.
