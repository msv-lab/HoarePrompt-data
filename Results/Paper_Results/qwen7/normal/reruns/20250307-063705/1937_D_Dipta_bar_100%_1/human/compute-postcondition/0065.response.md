Output State: **`n` is the length of the string `s`, `j` is 3, `i` is `n - 4`, `idx_B` contains `[n - 2, i]`, `x` is `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`, and `B` has appended the value `x`.**

Explanation: The code `idx_B.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `idx_B`. Given the initial conditions, `i` is `n - 4`. Therefore, `idx_B` changes from containing `[n - 2]` to `[n - 2, i]`, which means `[n - 2, n - 4]`. The value of `x` remains unchanged as the calculation for `x` was done before appending `i` to `idx_B`. Hence, the updated state includes the new value of `idx_B` and the unchanged value of `x`.
