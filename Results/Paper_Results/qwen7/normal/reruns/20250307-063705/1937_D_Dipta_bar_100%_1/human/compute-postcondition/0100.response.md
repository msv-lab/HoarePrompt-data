Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n - 1`, where `n` is the length of the string `s`.
   - The character at index `i` of `s` is '>'.
   - `r` is not equal to 0.
   - `a` is calculated as `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`.
   - `b` is calculated as follows:
     - If `l - r > 0`, then `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`.
     - Otherwise, `a` and `b` remain as their initial values.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i), end=' ')
   ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

- **Value of `i`:**
  - Since `i` is `n - 1`, it means `i` is the last index of the string `s`.

- **Value of `a`:**
  - `a` is calculated as `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`.
  - Given `i = n - 1`, this becomes `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - (n - 1)) * r`.

- **Value of `b`:**
  - Since `r` is not equal to 0, let's assume `l` is such that `l - r > 0` for simplicity (if `l - r <= 0`, the value of `b` would remain the same).
  - `b` is calculated as `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`.
  - Substituting `i = n - 1`, this becomes `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + ((n - 1) - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`.

- **Expression to be printed:**
  - The expression to be printed is `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)`.
  - Substituting `i = n - 1`, this simplifies to `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - (n - 1))`, which further simplifies to `a * 2 + b * 2 + 1`.

### Final Output:
Given the values of `a` and `b` as described above, the expression `a * 2 + b * 2 + 1` will be evaluated and printed.

Output: **a * 2 + b * 2 + 1 (where a = B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - (n - 1)) * r and b = A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + ((n - 1) - idx_A[l - 1]) * r)**
