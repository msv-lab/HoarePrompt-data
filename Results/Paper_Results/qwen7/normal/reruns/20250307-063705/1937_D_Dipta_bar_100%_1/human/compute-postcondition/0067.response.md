Postcondition: `n` is the length of the string `s`, `j` is 3, `i` is `n - 4`, `idx_B` contains `[n - 2, i]`, and `x` is defined as follows: if `s[i] == '<'`, then `x` is `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`, and `B` has appended the value `x`. If `s[i] != '<'`, then `x` remains undefined.
