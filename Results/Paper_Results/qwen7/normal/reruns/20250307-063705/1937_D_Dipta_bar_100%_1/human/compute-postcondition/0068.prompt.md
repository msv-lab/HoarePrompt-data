Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning `i` is equal to `n`; the variable `n` is the length of the string `s`; the list `A` contains `n` elements, where each element is calculated based on the conditions within the loop; specifically, each element in `A` represents the cumulative sum of the distances from the last occurrence of '>' up to the current index `i`, adjusted by the length of `idx_A`; the list `idx_A` contains all indices in `s` where the character is '>'; its length is equal to the number of '>' characters in `s`; the list `B` is an empty list; `idx_B` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(0, n):
    i = n - 1 - j
    if s[i] == '<':
        if len(idx_B) == 0:
            B.append(0)
        else:
            x = B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)
            B.append(x)
        idx_B.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `n` is the length of the string `s`, `j` is 0, `i` is `n - 1 - j`. If the character at index `i` of string `s` is `<`, then `idx_B` contains `[i]` and `x` is undefined. Otherwise, `idx_B` does not contain `[i]` and `x` remains undefined.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `n` is the length of the string `s`, `j` is 2, `i` is `n - 2`, if the character at index `n - 2` of string `s` is `<`, then `idx_B` contains `[n - 2]` and `x` remains undefined. Otherwise, `idx_B` does not contain `[n - 2]` and `x` remains undefined.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `n` is the length of the string `s`, `j` is 3, `i` is `n - 4`, `idx_B` contains `[n - 2, i]`, and `x` is defined as follows: if `s[i] == '<'`, then `x` is `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`, and `B` has appended the value `x`. If `s[i] != '<'`, then `x` remains undefined.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
