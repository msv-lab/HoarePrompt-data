Output State: **`i` is `n - 1 - (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, `b` is `b - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)`, `n` is the length of the string `s`, `l` and `r` are unchanged.**

Explanation: The variable `b` is updated by subtracting `(idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)` from its current value. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `n`, `i`, `a`, `l`, and `r` retain their initial states.
