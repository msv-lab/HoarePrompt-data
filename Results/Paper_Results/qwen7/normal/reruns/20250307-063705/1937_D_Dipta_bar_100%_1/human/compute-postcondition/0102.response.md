Postcondition: `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is the length of the string `s`, and the character at index `i` of `s` is '>'. Additionally, if `r` is 0, then `(l >= r)` holds true. Otherwise, `r` is not equal to 0, and the following conditions are met: `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, and `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r` if `l - r > 0`. Otherwise, `a` and `b` remain unchanged as `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`.
