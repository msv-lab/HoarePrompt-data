Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is the length of the string `s`, `a` is `A[l]`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `A[l]` to the variable `a`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `r` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `i` is still `n - 1`, `n` is still the length of the string `s`, and `a` is now `A[l]`.
