Output State: **`x` is `A[9] + (i - idx_A[8]) * 9`, `i` is `2 + (len(idx_A) - 1)`, `n` is still greater than 1.**

Explanation:
- The initial state of `i` is given as \(2 + (\text{length of } \text{idx\_A} - 1)\).
- The initial state of `n` is given as being greater than 1.
- The code calculates `x` using the formula `A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`.
  - Since `A[len(A) - 1]` refers to the last element of list `A`, let's assume `len(A)` is 10, so `A[9]` is used.
  - `idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]` refers to the last element of list `idx_A`, which is `idx_A[8]` assuming `len(idx_A)` is 9.
  - Therefore, `x` is calculated as `A[9] + (i - idx_A[8]) * 9`.
- The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
