Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n - 2`
   - `n` is the length of the string `s`
   - `r` is decreased by 1 (though `r` is not used in the print statement)

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - `n` is the length of the string `s`. Let's denote it as `len(s)`.
   - `i` is `n - 2`, so if `n` is the length of `s`, then `i = len(s) - 2`.
   - `idx_A[l - 1]` is a term that needs more context. Since `idx_A` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value without additional information. However, we know it is an index in the list `idx_A`.

Given these points, let's express the print statement in terms of the known and unknown values:

- `n - i` simplifies to `len(s) - (len(s) - 2) = 2`.
- `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2` is a term that depends on the value of `idx_A[l - 1]`.

Since `idx_A[l - 1]` is not specified, we can only say it is an index in the list `idx_A`. Therefore, the expression `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2` will be some integer value depending on the specific value of `idx_A[l - 1]`.

Putting it all together, the print statement will output the sum of `2` and the value of `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2`.

Output: **2 + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2 (where i = n - 2 and idx_A[l - 1] is an index in the list idx_A)**
