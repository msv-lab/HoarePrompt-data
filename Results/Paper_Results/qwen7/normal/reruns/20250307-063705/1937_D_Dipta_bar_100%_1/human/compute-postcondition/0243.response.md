Postcondition: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` is the length of the string `s`, `r` is decreased by 1. If `r` equals 0, then `a` and `b` are undefined. Otherwise, `a` is the character at index `r-1` of the string `s`, `b` is the character at index `l - 1` of the string `s`, and `b` is incremented by `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`**.
