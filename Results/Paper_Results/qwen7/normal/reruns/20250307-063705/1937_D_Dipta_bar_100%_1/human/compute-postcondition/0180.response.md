Postcondition: `i` is `n - 3`, `n` is the length of the string `s`, `a` is the character at index `l - 1` of the string `s` plus `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, `r` is `r - 1`, `b` is the character at index `r` of the string `B` minus the character at index `r - l` of the string `B` minus `(idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)`.
