Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n - 2`, where `n` is the length of the string `s`.
   - `r` is decreased by 1 (though the value of `r` itself is not explicitly given).
   - `a` is the character at index `r-1` of the string `s`.
   - `b` is the character at index `l - 1` of the string `s`.
   - `b` is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`, where `idx_A[l - 1]` is not explicitly defined but assumed to be a valid index in the string `s`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i), end=' ')
   ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

- **Value of `i`:**
  - Since `i` is `n - 2`, if `n` is the length of the string `s`, then `i` is the index of the second-to-last character in the string `s`.

- **Value of `r`:**
  - `r` is not explicitly given, but it is mentioned that `r` is decreased by 1. Without loss of generality, let's assume `r` is some valid index in the string `s`.

- **Value of `a`:**
  - `a` is the character at index `r-1` of the string `s`.

- **Value of `b`:**
  - Initially, `b` is the character at index `l - 1` of the string `s`.
  - After updating, `b` becomes `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`. Here, `idx_A[l - 1]` is not specified, so we cannot determine the exact value of `b` without more information. However, we know that `b` is updated based on the difference between `i` and `idx_A[l - 1]`, multiplied by `(r + 1)`.

- **Expression to be printed:**
  - The expression to be printed is `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)`.
  - Given `i = n - 2`, the term `(n - i)` simplifies to `2`.
  - Therefore, the expression becomes `a * 2 + b * 2 + 2`.

### Conclusion:

Given the above analysis, the print statement will output a string where `a` and `b` are characters from the string `s`, and the expression `a * 2 + b * 2 + 2` is evaluated.

Output: **2*a + 2*b + 2 (where a is the character at index r-1 and b is the character at index l-1 after the update)**
