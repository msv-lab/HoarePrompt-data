Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` is the length of the string `s`, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is the character at index `r-1` of the string `s`, `b` is the character at index `l - 1` of the string `s`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the character at index `l - 1` of the string `s` to the variable `b`. Since the other variables (`i`, `n`, `r`, and `a`) are not affected by this line of code, their states remain unchanged.
