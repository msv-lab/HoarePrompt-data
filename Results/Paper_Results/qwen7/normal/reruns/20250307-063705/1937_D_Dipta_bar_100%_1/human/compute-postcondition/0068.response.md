Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `n` is the length of the string `s`, `j` is 0, and `i` is `n - 1`. The list `idx_B` contains all indices in `s` where the character is '<', and `B` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the distances from the last occurrence of '>' up to the current index `i`, adjusted by the length of `idx_A`.**

In more detail, after the loop completes all its iterations:
- The variable `i` will start from `n - 1` and decrement until it reaches 0, meaning `i` will be 0 after the loop.
- The variable `j` will increment from 0 to `n - 1`, meaning `j` will be `n - 1` after the loop.
- The list `idx_B` will contain all indices in `s` where the character is '<'.
- The list `B` will contain the cumulative sums of the distances from the last occurrence of '>' up to the current index `i`, adjusted by the length of `idx_A`. Each element in `B` is calculated based on the condition inside the loop, where `x` is updated accordingly when `s[i]` is '<'.
