Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is the length of the string `s`, and the character at index `i` of `s` is '>', and `(l >= r)`. `r` is not equal to 0; `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`; `b` is `A[l - 1]`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `A[l - 1]` to the variable `b`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged. The value of `i`, `n`, the character at index `i` of `s`, the condition `(l >= r)`, `r`, and the expression for `a` are all kept as they were in the initial state.
