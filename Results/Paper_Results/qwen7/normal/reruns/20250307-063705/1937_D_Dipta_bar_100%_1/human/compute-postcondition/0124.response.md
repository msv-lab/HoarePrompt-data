Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `a` is the character at index `l - 1` in the string `s` plus `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`.
   - `i` is `n - 2`.
   - `n` is the length of the string `s`.
   - The character at index `i` in `s` is not `'>'`.
   - `b` is the character at index `r - l` in the string `B` minus `(idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)` plus `(idx_B[r] - i) * l`.
   - `l` is greater than 0.
   - The difference between `r` and `l` is greater than or equal to 0.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - Since `i` is `n - 2`, it means `i` is the second last index of the string `s`.
   - The character at index `i` in `s` is not `'>'`, so let's denote this character as `c_i`.
   - `a` is calculated as the character at index `l - 1` in `s` plus some adjustment based on the indices and lengths. Let's denote the character at index `l - 1` in `s` as `c_{l-1}`.
     \[
     a = c_{l-1} + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l
     \]
   - `b` is calculated as the character at index `r - l` in `B` minus some adjustment based on the indices and lengths, plus another adjustment based on the indices and lengths. Let's denote the character at index `r - l` in `B` as `c_{r-l}`.
     \[
     b = c_{r-l} - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l
     \]

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - The expression to be printed is `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1`.
   - Substituting the values:
     \[
     a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1 = (c_{l-1} + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l) * 2 + (c_{r-l} - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + (idx_B[r] - i) * l) * 2 + (n - 2) + 1
     \]
   - Simplifying further:
     \[
     = 2c_{l-1} + 2(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l + 2c_{r-l} - 2(idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + 2(idx_B[r] - i) * l + n - 2 + 1
     \]
     \[
     = 2c_{l-1} + 2c_{r-l} + 2(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l - 2(idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + 2(idx_B[r] - i) * l + n - 1
     \]

Given the complexity and the lack of specific values for `c_{l-1}`, `c_{r-l}`, `idx_A[l - 1]`, `idx_B[r - l]`, and `idx_B[r]`, the exact numerical value cannot be determined without these values. However, the structure of the expression is clear.

Output: **2*c_{l-1} + 2*c_{r-l} + 2*(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l - 2*(idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l) + 2*(idx_B[r] - i) * l + n - 1**
