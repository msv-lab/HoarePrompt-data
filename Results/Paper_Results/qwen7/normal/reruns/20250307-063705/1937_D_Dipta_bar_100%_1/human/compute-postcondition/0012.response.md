Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, the character at index `i` of `s` is '>', and either the length of `idx_A` is 0, in which case `A` contains the element 0, or the length of `idx_A` is not 0, in which case `x` is `A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`, and `A` has one more element which is `x`.
