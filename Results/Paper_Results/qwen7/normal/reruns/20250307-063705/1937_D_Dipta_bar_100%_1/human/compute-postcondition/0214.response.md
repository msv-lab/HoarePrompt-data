Output State: **`i` is `n - 1 - (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, `b` is `A[l - r - 2] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)`, `n` is the length of the string `s`, `l` and `r` are updated according to the conditions specified for `i = n - 1`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b` by subtracting `(idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)` from its current value. All other variables remain unchanged. The updated value of `b` is expressed in terms of the original value of `b` and the new subtraction term.
