Output State: **`n` is the length of the string `s`, `j` is 2, `i` is `n - 2`, `x` is undefined, and if the character at index `n - 2` of string `s` is `<`, then `idx_B` contains `[n - 2]`, otherwise `idx_B` does not contain `[n - 2]`.**

Explanation: The code `x = B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)` tries to assign a value to `x`, but there are several issues:

1. The variable `B` is not defined in the given initial state.
2. The variable `idx_B` is only defined if the character at index `n - 2` of string `s` is `<`, otherwise it is not defined.
3. The expression `idx_B[len(B) - 1]` would cause an error because `idx_B` is not a list or sequence and cannot be indexed.

Since these conditions are not met, the variable `x` remains undefined. All other variables (`n`, `j`, `i`, and `idx_B`) retain their initial states.
