Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is the length of the string `s`, and the character at index `i` of `s` is '>', `r` is not equal to 0, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r` if `l - r > 0`. Otherwise, `a` remains as `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r` and `b` remains as `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b` by adding `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r` to its current value. Since `i` is `n - 1` and the character at index `i` of `s` is '>', the value of `i` does not change. The value of `r` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The value of `a` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The value of `b` is updated based on the condition involving `l` and `r`.
