Output State: **`i` is \(2 + (\text{length of } \text{idx\_A} - 1) + 1\), `n` is still greater than 1, `idx_A` is a list with an additional element `i` appended to it, `A` is now a list with length 10.**

Explanation:
- Initially, `i` is calculated as \(2 + (\text{length of } \text{idx\_A} - 1)\).
- After executing `idx_A.append(i)`, the length of `idx_A` increases by 1, so `i` is updated to \(2 + (\text{length of } \text{idx\_A} - 1) + 1\).
- The value of `n` remains unchanged and is still greater than 1.
- `idx_A` is modified to include the new value of `i`.
- Since `A` was previously a list with length 10, appending does not change its length, but the content changes to reflect the new value of `x` which is not relevant here as it is not used in the given code snippet.
