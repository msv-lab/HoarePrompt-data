Postcondition: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is the length of the string `s`. If `l < r`, then `a` is either `A[l]` or `A[l]` with an additional adjustment based on `x`, `b` is updated accordingly based on the value of `x`. If `l >= r`, then `i` remains `n - 1`, `l` and `r` remain unchanged, and `b` is adjusted based on the values of `idx_A` and `idx_B`.**
