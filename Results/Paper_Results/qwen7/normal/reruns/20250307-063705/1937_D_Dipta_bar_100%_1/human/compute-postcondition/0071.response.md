Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(0, n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to `n - 1`.
   - `n` is the length of the string `s`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop starts with `i = n - 1`, the loop will execute once because `i` will be compared against `n` (which is the length of the string `s`).
   - After the first iteration, `i` will be decremented by 1, so the loop will continue until `i` becomes less than `n`.

Given this analysis, the only variables that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`. We need to ensure that `i` is initialized to `n - 1` and `n` is the length of the string `s`.

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is the length of the string `s`**
