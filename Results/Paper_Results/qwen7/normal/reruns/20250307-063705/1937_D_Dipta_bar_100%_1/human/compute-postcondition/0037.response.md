Output State: **The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning `i` is equal to `n`; the variable `n` is the length of the string `s`; the list `A` contains `n` elements, where each element is calculated based on the conditions within the loop; specifically, each element in `A` represents the cumulative sum of the distances from the last occurrence of '>' up to the current index `i`, adjusted by the length of `idx_A`; the list `idx_A` contains all indices in `s` where the character is '>'; its length is equal to the number of '>' characters in `s`; the list `B` is an empty list; `idx_B` is an empty list.**

This output state reflects that the assignment of `idx_B = []` does not change the values of any existing variables but initializes `idx_B` as an empty list. All other conditions and values remain unchanged from the initial state.
