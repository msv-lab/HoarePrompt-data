Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current values**:
   - `i` is currently set to \(1 + (\text{length of } \text{idx\_A} - 1)\).
   - `n` is still greater than 1.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is \(1 + (\text{length of } \text{idx\_A} - 1)\).
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes \(2 + (\text{length of } \text{idx\_A} - 1)\).
   - Since `n` is still greater than 1, it remains unchanged.

5. **State the new conditions**:
   - `i` should be \(2 + (\text{length of } \text{idx\_A} - 1)\).
   - `n` should still be greater than 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is \(2 + (\text{length of } \text{idx\_A} - 1)\), `n` is still greater than 1**.
