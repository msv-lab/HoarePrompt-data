Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` is the length of the string `s`, the character at index `i` in `s` is not '>', `l` is greater than `r`, and `r` is not equal to 0; `a` is the character at index `r` in `s`; `b` is the character at index `l - 1` in `s` minus the ASCII value of the character at index `l - r - 2` in `s` minus `(idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b` by subtracting `(idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)` from its current value. All other variables remain unchanged. The initial conditions and their relationships are preserved, and only the value of `b` is updated based on the given expression.
