Reasoning:
The given program aims to calculate the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell. The program uses a two-pass approach: one from the left and one from the right, to compute the required times. Here's a detailed breakdown of the logic:

1. **Left Pass (`func_1`):**
   - The program iterates through the string from left to right.
   - For each position where the character is '>', it calculates the distance to the last '<' seen so far, adjusted by the count of '>' characters seen up to that point.
   - This calculation helps in determining the time taken for a pinball starting at that position to move to the right boundary.

2. **Right Pass:**
   - Similarly, the program iterates through the string from right to left.
   - For each position where the character is '<', it calculates the distance to the last '>' seen so far, adjusted by the count of '<' characters seen up to that point.
   - This calculation helps in determining the time taken for a pinball starting at that position to move to the left boundary.

3. **Combining Results:**
   - The program combines the results from both passes to compute the final time for each starting position.
   - It handles edge cases where the pinball might start at the boundary itself or where there are no opposite direction characters between the current position and the boundary.

Given the problem statement and the execution summary, the program correctly implements the logic to calculate the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell. The calculations are consistent with the rules provided, and the program processes the string efficiently using the two-pass method.

Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description and the provided execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
