Let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n - 1`, where `n` is the length of the string `s`.
   - The character at index `i` of `s` is '>'.
   - `l` is less than `r`.
   - `a` is `A[l]`.
   - `x` is `r - (l + 2)`.
   - `b` is defined as follows:
     - If `x` is greater than or equal to 0, then `b = (B[r - 1] - B[x] - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)) + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`.
     - If `x` is less than 0, then `b = B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Calculation:**
   - Since `i` is `n - 1`, and `n` is the length of the string `s`, `i` is the last index of `s`.
   - The character at index `i` of `s` is '>', but this information is not directly used in the calculation of `a` and `b`.
   - `l` is less than `r`, so let's assume specific values for `l` and `r` to proceed with the calculation. For example, let's say `l = 2` and `r = 5`.
   - `a` is `A[l]`, which is `A[2]`.
   - `x` is `r - (l + 2)`, which is `5 - (2 + 2) = 1`.
   - Since `x` is greater than or equal to 0, `b` is calculated as:
     \[
     b = (B[r - 1] - B[x] - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)) + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)
     \]
     Substituting the values:
     \[
     b = (B[4] - B[1] - (idx_B[1] - idx_B[4]) * 2) + (idx_B[4] - (n - 1)) * 3
     \]

4. **Final Expression:**
   - The expression to be printed is `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1`.
   - Substituting the values:
     \[
     \text{Output} = A[2] * 2 + \left( (B[4] - B[1] - (idx_B[1] - idx_B[4]) * 2) + (idx_B[4] - (n - 1)) * 3 \right) * 2 + (n - 1) + 1
     \]

Given the complexity and the lack of specific values for `A`, `B`, and `idx_B`, we can represent the final output in a general form.

Output: **A[2] * 2 + ((B[4] - B[1] - (idx_B[1] - idx_B[4]) * 2) + (idx_B[4] - (n - 1)) * 3) * 2 + n**
