Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is the length of the string `s`, `a` is `A[l]`, `x` is `r - (l + 2)`, `b` is `B[r - 1]`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `B[r - 1]` to the variable `b`. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, `a`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states.
