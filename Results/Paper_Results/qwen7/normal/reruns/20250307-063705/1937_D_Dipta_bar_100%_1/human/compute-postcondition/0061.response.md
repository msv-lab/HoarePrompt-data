Output State: **`n` is the length of the string `s`, `j` is 3, `i` is `n - 4`, `idx_B` does not contain `[n - 2]`, and `B` contains `[0]`.**

Explanation: The code `B.append(0)` appends the value `0` to the list `B`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the updated state includes the new element in list `B`.
