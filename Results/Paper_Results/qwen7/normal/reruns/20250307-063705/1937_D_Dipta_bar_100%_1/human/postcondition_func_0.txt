The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` consisting of characters '<' and '>', and calculates and prints a series of values based on the balance of '<' and '>' characters in the string. Specifically, it computes and prints values derived from the cumulative distances of '<' and '>' characters from their last occurrences, adjusting these distances by the count of such characters encountered so far. The function processes the string from both ends, considering the distances in both directions, and outputs the calculated values for each character in the string.
