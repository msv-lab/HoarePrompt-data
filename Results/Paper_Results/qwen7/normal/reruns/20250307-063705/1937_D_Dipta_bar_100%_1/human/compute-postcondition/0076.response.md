Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is the length of the string `s`, the character at index `i` of `s` is '>', `l` is less than `r`, `a` is `A[l]`, `x` is `r - (l + 2)`**.

Explanation: The variable `x` is assigned the value of `r - (l + 2)`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, the character at index `i` of `s`, `l`, `r`, and `a`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
