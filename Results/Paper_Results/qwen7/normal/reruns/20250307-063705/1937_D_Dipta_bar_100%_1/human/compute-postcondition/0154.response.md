Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is the length of the string `s`, `a` is `A[l]`, `x` is `r - (l + 2)`, `b` is `B[r - 1] - B[x]`**.

The code `b = b - B[x]` subtracts the value of `B[x]` from `b`. Here, `x` is defined as `r - (l + 2)`, so `b` is updated to `B[r - 1] - B[x]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
