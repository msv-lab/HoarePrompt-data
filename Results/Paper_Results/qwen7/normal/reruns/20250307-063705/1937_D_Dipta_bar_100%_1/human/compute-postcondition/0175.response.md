Output State: **`i` is `n - 3`, `n` is the length of the string `s`, `a` is the character at index `l - 1` of the string `s` plus `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, `r` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `a` is updated to its original value plus the product of `(i - idx_A[l - 1])` and `l`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
