Output State: **`n` is the length of the string `s`, `j` is 3, `i` is `n - 4`, `idx_B` does not contain `[n - 2]`, and `x` remains undefined.**

Explanation: The code `i = n - 1 - j` updates the value of `i` to `n - 1 - 3`, which simplifies to `n - 4`. The values of `n`, `j`, `idx_B`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states.
