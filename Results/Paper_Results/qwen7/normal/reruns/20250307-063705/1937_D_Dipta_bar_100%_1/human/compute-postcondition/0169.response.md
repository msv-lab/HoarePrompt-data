Postcondition: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is the length of the string `s`, `l` and `r` are unchanged. If `r == 0`, `i` remains `n - 1` and `l` and `r` remain unchanged. Otherwise, `i` is updated to `n - 1 - (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, `a` is set to `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, `b` is adjusted to `b - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`, and `l` and `r` remain unchanged.**
