Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` is the length of the string `s`, `r` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `r -= 1` decreases the value of `r` by 1. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `i` is now `n - 2`, `n` is still the length of the string `s`, and `r` has been decreased by 1.
