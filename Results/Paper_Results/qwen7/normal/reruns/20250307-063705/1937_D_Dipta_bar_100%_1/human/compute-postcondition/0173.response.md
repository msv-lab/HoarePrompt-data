Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state tells us that `i` is `n - 2`.
2. `n` is the length of the string `s`. This means `n` is the total number of characters in the string `s`.
3. `r` is decreased by 1, but `r` is not used in the print statement, so it does not affect the output.

Given the print statement `print(i + 1, end=' ')`, we need to determine the value of `i + 1`.

- Since `i` is `n - 2`, then `i + 1` would be `(n - 2) + 1 = n - 1`.

Therefore, the print statement will output `n - 1`.

Output: **n - 1**
