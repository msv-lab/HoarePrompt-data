Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n - 1`
   - `n` is the length of the string `s`
   - `x` is `r - (l + 2)`
   - `b` is `b + (idx_B[r - 1] - (n - 1)) * (l + 1)`

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1, end=' ')
   ```

From the initial state, we know:
- `i = n - 1`
- `b` is defined but its explicit value is not given, so we'll keep it as `b`.
- `a` is not mentioned in the initial state, so it must be a variable with an unknown value. We will keep it as `a`.

Given these details, let's substitute the known values into the print statement:
- `i = n - 1`
- Therefore, `i + 1 = (n - 1) + 1 = n`

So the expression inside the print statement becomes:
\[ a \times 2 + b \times 2 + n \]

Since `a` and `b` are not explicitly defined, we will leave them as they are.

Thus, the output will be:
Output: **2a + 2b + n**
