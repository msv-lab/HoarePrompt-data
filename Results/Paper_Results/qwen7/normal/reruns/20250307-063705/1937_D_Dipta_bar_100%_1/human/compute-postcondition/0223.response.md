Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `i` is `n - 2`
   - `n` is the length of the string `s`
   - `r` is decreased by 1 (though `r` is not used in the print statement, so we don't need its value)

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The statement to be executed is `print(i + 1, end=' ')`

3. **Calculating the Value**:
   - Since `i` is `n - 2`, substituting this into the print statement gives us `print((n - 2) + 1, end=' ')`
   - Simplifying this, we get `print(n - 1, end=' ')`

4. **Output**:
   - The value printed will be `n - 1` followed by a space (`end=' '` ensures a space is printed after the value).

Output: **n - 1**
