Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is the length of the string `s`, and the character at index `i` of `s` is '>', `r` is not equal to 0, `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`, `b` is `A[l - 1] - A[l - r - 1] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b` by subtracting `(idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)` from the previous value of `b`. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `i`, `n`, the character at index `i` of `s`, `r`, `a`, and the initial expression for `b` are preserved.
