Postcondition: `i` is `n - 2`, `n` is the length of the string `s`, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is the character at index `l - 1` of the string `s` plus `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, `b` is the character at index `r` of the string `B` minus `B[r - l]` minus `(idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)`. If the condition `r - l >= 0` is true, then `b` is updated accordingly. If the condition `r - l >= 0` is false, no changes are made to the variables.
