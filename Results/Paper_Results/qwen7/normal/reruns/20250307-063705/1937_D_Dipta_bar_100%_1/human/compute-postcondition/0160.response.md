Given the initial state:
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `n` is the length of the string `s`

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(n - i, end=' ')`.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. `n` is the length of the string `s`. This means `n` is an integer representing how many characters are in the string `s`.
2. `i` is explicitly stated to be `n - 1`. This means `i` is the last index of the string `s`.

Now, let's evaluate the expression `n - i`:
- Since `i` is `n - 1`, substituting `i` in the expression gives us `n - (n - 1)`.
- Simplifying this, we get `n - n + 1 = 1`.

Therefore, the expression `n - i` evaluates to `1`.

The `print` statement will output this value with a space as the end character (`end=' '`).

Output: **1**
