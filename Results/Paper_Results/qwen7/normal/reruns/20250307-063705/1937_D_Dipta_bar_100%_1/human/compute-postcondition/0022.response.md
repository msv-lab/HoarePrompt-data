Output State: **`i` is 1 + (length of `idx_A` - 1), `n` is still greater than 1, `A` now contains 0 and an additional element `x`, and `x` is calculated as `A[len(A) - 1] + (1 - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`**.

Explanation: 
- Initially, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, and `A` is a list containing 0.
- The line `idx_A.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` (which is 1) to the list `idx_A`. This changes `i` to 1 + (length of `idx_A` - 1), since the length of `idx_A` is now 1.
- The value of `n` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
- The value of `A` now contains 0 and the new element `x`, which is calculated as `A[len(A) - 1] + (1 - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`. Since `A` now has two elements (0 and the new element), `len(A) - 1` is 1, and `idx_A` also has one element, so `len(idx_A) - 1` is 0. Thus, `x` is `0 + (1 - 1) * 1`, which simplifies to 0.
