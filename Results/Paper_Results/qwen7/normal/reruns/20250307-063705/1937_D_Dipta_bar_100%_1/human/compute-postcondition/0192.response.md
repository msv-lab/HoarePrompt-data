Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` is the length of the string `s`, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is the character at index `r-1` of the string `s`, `b` is the character at index `l - 1` of the string `s`, and `b` is updated to `b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b` by adding `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)` to its current value. Since `i` is `n - 2` and `r` is decreased by 1, the updated value of `b` is `b + (n - 2 - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
