Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n`; `n` is the length of string `s`; `A` is an empty list; `idx_A` is an empty list.**

The code initializes `idx_A` as an empty list. This does not affect the values of `s`, `n`, or `A`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions for these variables while adding that `idx_A` is now an empty list.
