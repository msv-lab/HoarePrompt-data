Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` is the length of the string `s`, the character at index `i` in `s` is not '>', `l` is greater than `r`, and `r` is not equal to 0; `a` is the character at index `r` in `s`; `b` is the character at index `l - 1` in `s` minus the ASCII value of the character at index `l - r - 2` in `s` minus `(idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)` if `l - r - 1 > 0`, otherwise `b` remains unchanged; `b` is updated by adding `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)` to its current value.**

This means that the value of `b` has been updated by adding `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)` to its previous value. All other conditions and values remain the same as the initial state.
