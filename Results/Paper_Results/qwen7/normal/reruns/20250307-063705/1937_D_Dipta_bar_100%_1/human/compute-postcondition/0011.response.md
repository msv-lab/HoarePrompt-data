Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, the character at index `i` of `s` is '>', the length of `idx_A` is not 0, `x` is `A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)`, `A` has one more element which is `x`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `x` to the list `A`. The value of `x` remains as it was defined before the append operation. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `s`, `idx_A`) remain unchanged.
