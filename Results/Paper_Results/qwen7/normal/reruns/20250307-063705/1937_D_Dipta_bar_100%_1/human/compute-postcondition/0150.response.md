Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i`, `n`, `l`, and `r`.

2. **Determine the Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is either `n - 2` or `n - 1`.
   - `n` is the length of the string `s`.
   - `l` and `r` are updated based on the conditions provided.

3. **Analyze the Conditions for the Next Iteration**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.
   - For `i` to be incremented from `n - 2` or `n - 1` to `n - 1` or `n`, respectively, it needs to be within the bounds of the string `s`.

Given the conditions:
- If `i` is `n - 2`, incrementing `i` will set it to `n - 1`.
- If `i` is `n - 1`, incrementing `i` will set it to `n`, but since `i` should be within the range `[0, n-1]`, this case is not possible in the next iteration.

Thus, `i` will be set to `n - 1` in the next iteration.

4. **Update the States**:
   - `i` will be `n - 1`.
   - `n` remains the same, as it is the length of the string `s`.
   - `l` and `r` need to be checked based on the conditions provided.

Since `i` is now `n - 1`, let's check the conditions for updating `l` and `r`:
- If the character at index `i` in `s` is '>', then `l` is incremented by 1.
- If the character at index `i` in `s` is not '>', then the conditions for `l` and `r` are complex, but they depend on the values of `l` and `r` from the previous iteration.

However, without specific values for `l` and `r` from the previous iteration, we cannot definitively update them here. But we know that the loop will proceed to the next iteration with `i = n - 1`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is the length of the string `s`, `l` and `r` are updated according to the conditions provided in the problem statement.**
