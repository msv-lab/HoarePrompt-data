You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a one-dimensional grid of length n . The i -th cell of the grid
contains a character s_i , which is either '<' or '>'.

When a pinball is placed on one of the cells, it moves according to the
following rules:

  * If the pinball is on the i -th cell and s_i is '<', the pinball moves one cell to the left in the next second. If s_i is '>', it moves one cell to the right. 
  * After the pinball has moved, the character s_i is inverted (i. e. if s_i used to be '<', it becomes '>', and vice versa). 
  * The pinball stops moving when it leaves the grid: either from the left border or from the right one. 

You need to answer n independent queries. In the i -th query, a pinball will
be placed on the i -th cell. Note that we always place a pinball on the
initial grid.

For each query, calculate how many seconds it takes the pinball to leave the
grid. It can be shown that the pinball will always leave the grid within a
finite number of steps.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^5 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 5 \cdot
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a string s_1s_2 \ldots s_{n} of
length n consisting of characters '<' and '>'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, for each i (1 \le i \le n ) output the answer if a pinball
is initially placed on the i -th cell.

Example

Input

    3
    
    ><<
    
    4
    
    <<<<
    
    6
    
    <><<<>

Output

    3 6 5 
    1 2 3 4 
    1 4 7 10 8 1 
    
Note

In the first test case, the movement of the pinball for i=1 is shown in the
following pictures. It takes the pinball 3 seconds to leave the grid.

The movement of the pinball for i=2 is shown in the following pictures. It
takes the pinball 6 seconds to leave the grid.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` consisting of characters '<' and '>', and calculates and prints a series of values based on the balance of '<' and '>' characters in the string. Specifically, it computes and prints values derived from the cumulative distances of '<' and '>' characters from their last occurrences, adjusting these distances by the count of such characters encountered so far. The function processes the string from both ends, considering the distances in both directions, and outputs the calculated values for each character in the string.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for all possible cases. Specifically, the logic for calculating the time is flawed. Hereâ€™s an example to illustrate the issue:

Consider the input:
```
3
>><
```

Expected output:
```
3 4 3 
```

However, the program outputs:
```
3 6 3 
```

The issue lies in the way the program calculates the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid. The current implementation does not properly account for the inversion of the direction and the movement of the pinball. For instance, in the case of `>><`, the pinball starting at the second cell should take 4 seconds to leave the grid, but the program incorrectly calculates it as 6 seconds.

To fix this, the program needs to correctly simulate the movement of the pinball, taking into account the inversion of directions and the exact positions where the pinball changes direction. The current logic does not handle these transitions accurately, leading to incorrect results in certain scenarios.
