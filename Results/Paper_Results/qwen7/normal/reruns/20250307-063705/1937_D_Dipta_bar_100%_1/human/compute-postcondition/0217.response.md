To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the calculation step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is defined as `n - 1 - (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`.
   - `a` is defined as `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`.
   - `b` is defined as `A[l - r - 2] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r) + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r`.
   - `n` is the length of the string `s`.
   - `l` and `r` are updated according to the conditions specified for `i = n - 1`. If `l - r > 0`, then `b` is updated to `A[l - r - 2] - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)`. Otherwise, no change is made to `b`.

2. **Expression to Evaluate:**
   - The expression to evaluate is `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)`, and it is printed with `end=' '` to ensure it is printed on the same line without a newline.

Given the complexity of the expressions, let's simplify the understanding:

- `i` is a specific value derived from `n`, `idx_B[r - 1]`, and `i` itself.
- `a` is a value derived from `B[r - 1]`, `idx_B[r - 1]`, and `i`.
- `b` is a value derived from `A[l - r - 2]`, `idx_A[l - 1]`, `idx_A[l - r - 1]`, `l`, `r`, and `i`.

Without specific values for `n`, `idx_B`, `B`, `A`, `idx_A`, `l`, and `r`, we cannot compute exact numerical values. However, we can describe the form of the output:

- `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)` is the expression to be evaluated and printed.

Thus, the output will be the result of this expression, which is a combination of the values of `a`, `b`, and `n - i`.

Output: **a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)**
