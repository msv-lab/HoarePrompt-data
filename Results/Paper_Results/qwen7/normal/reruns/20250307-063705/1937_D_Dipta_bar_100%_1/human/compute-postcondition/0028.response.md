Output State: **`x` is `A[9] + (i - idx_A[8]) * 9`, `i` is `2 + (len(idx_A) - 1)`, `A` is now `[x]` appended, `n` is still greater than 1.**

Explanation: The code `A.append(x)` appends the value of `x` to the list `A`. Since `x` is already defined as `A[9] + (i - idx_A[8]) * 9` and `i` is defined as `2 + (len(idx_A) - 1)`, these values remain unchanged. After appending `x` to `A`, the list `A` now contains the value of `x`. The conditions for `n` and the values of `x` and `i` remain as they were before the append operation.
