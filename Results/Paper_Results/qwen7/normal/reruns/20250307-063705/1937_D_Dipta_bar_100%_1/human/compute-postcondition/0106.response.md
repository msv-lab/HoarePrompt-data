Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` is the length of the string `s`, and the character at index `i` in `s` is not '>'**.

Explanation: The value of `r` is decremented by 1, changing its value from `i` (which was `n - 1`) to `n - 2`. The other variables and their conditions remain unchanged. The character at index `i` in `s` is still not '>', as the code only affects the numerical value of `i`.
