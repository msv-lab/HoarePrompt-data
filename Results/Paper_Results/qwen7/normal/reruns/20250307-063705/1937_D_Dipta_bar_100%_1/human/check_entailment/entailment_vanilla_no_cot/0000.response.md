Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that prevent it from correctly calculating the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for each query:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Movement**:
   - The logic for calculating the time taken for the pinball to move is flawed. The current implementation does not accurately account for the changes in direction and the inversion of characters.
   - For example, the calculation of `A` and `B` arrays does not correctly represent the cumulative time taken for the pinball to reach the boundaries.

2. **Logic Errors**:
   - The logic for updating the `A` and `B` arrays and their indices is incorrect. The current implementation does not properly handle the inversion of characters and the resulting movement directions.
   - The conditions for updating the indices and calculating the time are not correctly implemented, leading to incorrect results.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The solution does not handle edge cases where the pinball starts at the boundary cells or where there are sequences of consecutive `<` or `>` characters correctly.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you should simulate the movement of the pinball for each query independently. Hereâ€™s a more accurate approach:

1. **Simulate Movement**: For each query, simulate the movement of the pinball starting from the given cell until it leaves the grid.
2. **Track Time**: Keep track of the time taken for each movement.
3. **Invert Characters**: Invert the character at the current position after each movement.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    for i in range(n):
        time = 0
        pos = i
        while 0 <= pos < n:
            time += 1
            if s[pos] == '<':
                pos -= 1
            else:
                pos += 1
            s = s[:pos] + ('>' if s[pos] == '<' else '<') + s[pos+1:]
        print(time, end=' ')
    print()
```

This approach correctly simulates the movement of the pinball and calculates the time taken for each query.
