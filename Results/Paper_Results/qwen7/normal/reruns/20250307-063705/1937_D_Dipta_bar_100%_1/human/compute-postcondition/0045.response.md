Output State: **`n` is the length of the string `s`, `j` is 0, `i` is `n - 1 - j`, the character at index `i` of string `s` is `<`, `x` is `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`, `B` is `[x]`**.

Explanation: The code appends the value of `x` to the list `B`. Since `B` was initially empty, after appending `x`, `B` now contains only one element, which is `x`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
