### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires calculating the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell. The pinball's movement is determined by the direction (`<` or `>`) at each cell, and the direction changes after each move.

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the grid and the string representing the directions.
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to compute the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid from each cell.

3. **Key Components of `func_1`**:
   - **Forward Calculation (`A`)**:
     - This part calculates the time taken for the pinball to reach the right boundary starting from the leftmost cell where the direction is `>` until the current cell.
     - It uses the indices of cells with `>` to compute the cumulative time.
   - **Backward Calculation (`B`)**:
     - This part calculates the time taken for the pinball to reach the left boundary starting from the rightmost cell where the direction is `<` until the current cell.
     - It uses the indices of cells with `<` to compute the cumulative time.
   - **Final Computation**:
     - The main loop iterates through each cell, using the forward and backward calculations to determine the total time taken for the pinball to leave the grid.
     - The logic involves adjusting the times based on the direction and position of the pinball.

4. **Verification**:
   - The code correctly handles the forward and backward calculations.
   - The logic for determining the time taken for each cell is sound and matches the problem statement.
   - The code accounts for the changing direction of the pinball and the cumulative effect on the time taken.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles edge cases such as when the pinball starts from the boundary cells or when there are no cells with the opposite direction.
   - The logic ensures that the pinball leaves the grid within a finite number of steps, as required.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the solution for the given problem.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**

The code is correct and accurately computes the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid from each cell.
