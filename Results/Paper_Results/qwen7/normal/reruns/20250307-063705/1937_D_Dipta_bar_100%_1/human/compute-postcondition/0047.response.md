Output State: **`n` is the length of the string `s`, `j` is 0, `i` is `n - 1 - j`, the character at index `i` of string `s` is `<`, `idx_B` contains `[i]`, and `x` is undefined.**

Explanation: The code `idx_B.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` to the list `idx_B`. Initially, `idx_B` is empty, so after appending `i`, `idx_B` now contains `[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `idx_B` is no longer empty, `x` would be calculated using the formula given, but since `i` is the only element in `idx_B`, `x` remains undefined until more elements are added to `idx_B`.
