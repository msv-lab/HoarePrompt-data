You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

    #State: Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning `i` is equal to `n`. The variable `n` is the length of the string `s`. The list `A` contains `n` elements, where each element is calculated based on the conditions within the loop. Specifically, each element in `A` represents the cumulative sum of the distances from the last occurrence of '>' up to the current index `i`, adjusted by the length of `idx_A`. The list `idx_A` contains all indices in `s` where the character is '>', and its length is equal to the number of '>' characters in `s`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, `A` will have `n` elements reflecting the described calculation, and `idx_A` will contain all positions in `s` where the character is '>'.

#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `s`, which is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', with a length between 1 and 500,000. The function returns a value based on the balance of '<' and '>' characters in the string `s`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
