Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is the length of the string `s`, and the character at index `i` of `s` is '>', and `(l >= r)`. `r` is not equal to 0; `a` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`**.

Explanation: The variable `a` is assigned the value of `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r`. Since `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is the length of the string `s`, and the character at index `i` of `s` is '>', and `(l >= r)`. `r` is not equal to 0, these conditions remain unchanged. The new value of `a` is calculated using the given formula.
