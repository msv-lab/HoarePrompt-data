Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for all possible cases. Specifically, the logic for calculating the time is flawed. Here’s an example to illustrate the issue:

Consider the input:
```
3
>><
```

Expected output:
```
3 4 3 
```

However, the program outputs:
```
3 6 3 
```

The issue lies in the way the program calculates the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid. The current implementation does not properly account for the inversion of the direction and the movement of the pinball. For instance, in the case of `>><`, the pinball starting at the second cell should take 4 seconds to leave the grid, but the program incorrectly calculates it as 6 seconds.

To fix this, the program needs to correctly simulate the movement of the pinball, taking into account the inversion of directions and the exact positions where the pinball changes direction. The current logic does not handle these transitions accurately, leading to incorrect results in certain scenarios.
