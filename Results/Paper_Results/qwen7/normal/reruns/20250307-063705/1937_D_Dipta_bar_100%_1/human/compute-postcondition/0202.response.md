Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is the length of the string `s`, `x` is `r - (l + 2)`**

Explanation: The variable `x` is assigned the value of `r - (l + 2)`. The values of `i`, `n`, `s`, `r`, `l`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `x` and retains the original values of the other variables.
