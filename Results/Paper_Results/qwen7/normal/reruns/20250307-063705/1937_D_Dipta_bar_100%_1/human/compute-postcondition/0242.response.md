Let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n - 2`
   - `n` is the length of the string `s`
   - `r` is decreased by 1 (though the value of `r` is not explicitly mentioned, it doesn't affect the final calculation directly since it's not used in the print statement)
   - `a` is the character at index `r-1` of the string `s`
   - `b` is the character at index `l - 1` of the string `s`
   - `b` is incremented by `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)`

2. **Code to Analyze:**
   ```python
   print(a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i), end=' ')
   ```

3. **Determine Values:**
   - Since `i` is `n - 2`, we know `n - i = n - (n - 2) = 2`.
   - `a` is the character at index `r-1` of the string `s`. The value of `r` is not explicitly given, but it doesn't affect the final calculation because `r` is not used in the expression.
   - `b` is the character at index `l - 1` of the string `s`. The value of `l` is also not explicitly given, but it doesn't affect the final calculation because `l` is not used in the expression.
   - The term `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)` involves `idx_A[l - 1]`, but since `idx_A` and `l` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of this term. However, it does not affect the final expression because it is added to `b * 2`.

Given these points, the expression simplifies to:
\[ a * 2 + b * 2 + 2 \]

Since the exact characters `a` and `b` are not specified, we will represent them as such.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The expression `a * 2 + b * 2 + 2` will be printed.

Output: **a*2 + b*2 + 2 (where a and b are characters from the string s)**
