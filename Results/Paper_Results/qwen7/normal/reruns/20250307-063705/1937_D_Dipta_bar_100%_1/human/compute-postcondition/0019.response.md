Output State: **`i` is 1 + (len(idx_A) - 1); `n` is greater than 1; `x` is A[len(A) - 1] + (1 - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A); `A` has an additional element `x`.**

Explanation: The code `A.append(x)` adds the value of `x` to the list `A`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states. The only change is that `A` now has an additional element which is `x`.
