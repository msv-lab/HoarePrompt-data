Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` is the length of the string `s`, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is the character at index `l - 1` of the string `s` plus `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, `b` is the character at index `r` of the string `B` minus `B[r - l]` minus `(idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b` by subtracting `(idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)` from its current value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
