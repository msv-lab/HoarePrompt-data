Output State: **`n` is the length of the string `s`, `j` is 3, `i` is `n - 4`, `idx_B` does not contain `[n - 2]`, and `x` is `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)`**.

Explanation: The code assigns a value to `x` based on the last element of lists `B` and `idx_B`. Since the exact values of `B` and `idx_B` are not specified, `x` is expressed in terms of these lists. The other variables (`n`, `j`, `i`, and `idx_B`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
