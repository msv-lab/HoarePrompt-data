Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is the length of the string `s`, `x` is `r - (l + 2)`, and `b` is `b + (idx_B[r - 1] - (n - 1)) * (l + 1)`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b` by adding `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)` to the current value of `b`. Given that `i` is `n - 1`, the new value of `b` becomes `b + (idx_B[r - 1] - (n - 1)) * (l + 1)`. The values of `n`, `x`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
