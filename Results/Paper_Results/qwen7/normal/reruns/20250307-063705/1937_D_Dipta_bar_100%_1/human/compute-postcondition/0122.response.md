Postcondition: **`a` is the character at index `l - 1` in the string `s` plus `(i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l`, `i` is `n - 2`, `n` is the length of the string `s`, and the character at index `i` in `s` is not '>', `b` is the character at index `r - l` in the string `B` minus `(idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)`, and `l` is greater than 0, and the difference between `r` and `l` is greater than or equal to 0.**

This postcondition describes the state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block. It states that `a` remains unchanged as it is derived from the initial conditions, `i` is `n - 2`, and the character at index `i` in `s` is not '>', `b` is adjusted based on the index `r - l` in string `B`, and `l` is greater than 0. The condition `r - l >= 0` ensures that the operations involving `r` and `l` are valid.
