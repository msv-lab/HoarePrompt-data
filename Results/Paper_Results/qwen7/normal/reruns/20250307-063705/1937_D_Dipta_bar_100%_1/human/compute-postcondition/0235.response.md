Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` is the length of the string `s`, `r` is decreased by 1, `a` is the character at index `r-1` of the string `s`.**

Explanation: The code `a = B[r]` assigns the character at index `r` of the string `B` to the variable `a`. However, since `B` is not defined in the given context, we assume it was a typo and should be `s` (as `n` is the length of the string `s`). Thus, `a` is assigned the character at index `r-1` of the string `s`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `r` remain unchanged except for `r` being decreased by 1.
