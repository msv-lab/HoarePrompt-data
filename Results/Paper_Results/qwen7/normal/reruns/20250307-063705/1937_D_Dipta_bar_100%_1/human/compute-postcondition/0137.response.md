Postcondition: `i` is `n - 2`, `n` is the length of the string `s`, the character at index `i` in `s` is not '>', `l` is greater than `r`, and `r` is not equal to 0; `a` is the character at index `r` in `s`; `b` is the character at index `l - 1` in `s`. The difference between `l` and `r` is greater than 1.
