Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following conditions hold:
   - `n` is the length of the string `s`.
   - `j` is 2.
   - `i` is `n - 2`.
   - If the character at index `n - 2` of string `s` is `<`, then `idx_B` contains `[n - 2]` and `x` remains undefined. Otherwise, `idx_B` does not contain `[n - 2]` and `x` remains undefined.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `j` in the range from 0 to `n` (exclusive).

4. **Calculate the new value of `j`**: Since `j` starts at 2 and the loop increments `j` by 1 each iteration, the next value of `j` will be `j + 1`.

5. **Check if the loop should continue**: The loop will continue as long as `j < n`.

6. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `j` will be incremented by 1, so the new value of `j` will be `2 + 1 = 3`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - The values of `i`, `idx_B`, and `x` remain undefined as they are not part of the loop head and their values are not modified within the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`n` is the length of the string `s`, `j` is 3, `i` is `n - 2`, if the character at index `n - 2` of string `s` is `<`, then `idx_B` contains `[n - 2]` and `x` remains undefined. Otherwise, `idx_B` does not contain `[n - 2]` and `x` remains undefined.**
