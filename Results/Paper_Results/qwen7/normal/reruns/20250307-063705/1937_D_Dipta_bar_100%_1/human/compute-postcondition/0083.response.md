Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is the length of the string `s`, the character at index `i` of `s` is '>', `l` is less than `r`, `a` is `A[l]`, `x` is `r - (l + 2)`, `b` is `(B[r - 1] - B[x] - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)) + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)` if `x` is greater than or equal to 0, or `b` is `B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)` if `x` is less than 0.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b` by adding `(idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)` to the existing value of `b`. The value of `i`, `n`, `s`, `l`, `r`, `a`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states. The expression for `b` is updated based on whether `x` is greater than or equal to 0 or less than 0.
