Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200,000, v is a list of n integers such that 1 <= v_i <= 10^9, and p is a permutation of n integers from 1 to n.**

Explanation: The provided code snippet is a docstring for a decorator function and does not perform any operations that would change the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `v`, or `p`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states as described in the initial state.
