#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200,000, v is a list of n integers such that 1 <= v_i <= 10^9, and p is a permutation of n integers from 1 to n.

    #The program returns a function named 'decorating_function'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `fillvalue` and returns another function named `decorating_function`. This returned function will replace any recursive calls within itself with the value specified by `fillvalue`.
