Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- The loop condition is `ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]`.
- The current state at the end of the previous iteration is:
  - `i` is 2,
  - `n` must be at least 3,
  - `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`,
  - `ans[1]` is `arr[0] + 1 + ans[0]`,
  - `ans[2]` is `ans[1] + ans[1]`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop condition involves `ans[i + 1]` and `arr[i + 1]`.

2. **Determine the Current Values:**
   - Since `i` is 2, the relevant part of the loop condition is `ans[2 + 1] <= arr[2 + 1]`, which simplifies to `ans[3] <= arr[3]`.
   - We know the values of `ans[0]`, `ans[1]`, and `ans[2]`:
     - `ans[0] = arr[0] + 1`
     - `ans[1] = arr[0] + 1 + ans[0] = arr[0] + 1 + (arr[0] + 1) = 2 * arr[0] + 2`
     - `ans[2] = ans[1] + ans[1] = (2 * arr[0] + 2) + (2 * arr[0] + 2) = 4 * arr[0] + 4`

3. **Calculate `ans[3]`:**
   - `ans[3]` would be `ans[2] + ans[2] = (4 * arr[0] + 4) + (4 * arr[0] + 4) = 8 * arr[0] + 8`.

4. **Check the Loop Condition:**
   - For the loop to continue, `ans[3]` must be less than or equal to `arr[3]`.
   - Therefore, `8 * arr[0] + 8 <= arr[3]`.

5. **Adjust the States:**
   - The only variables involved in the loop condition are `ans[3]` and `arr[3]`.
   - To ensure the loop continues, `arr[3]` must be at least `8 * arr[0] + 8`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 3, `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, `ans[1]` is `arr[0] + 1 + ans[0]`, `ans[2]` is `ans[1] + ans[1]`, `arr[3]` must be at least `8 * arr[0] + 8`**
