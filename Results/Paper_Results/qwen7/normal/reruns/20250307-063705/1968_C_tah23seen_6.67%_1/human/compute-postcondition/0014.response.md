Postcondition: `i` is the index of the last element in `ans` that satisfies the condition `ans[i + 1] < arr[i + 1]`, `n` must be at least 3, `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, `ans[1]` is `arr[0] + 1 + ans[0]`, and each subsequent `ans[i]` doubles the previous one (`ans[i] = 2 * ans[i-1]`) until the next value would exceed `arr[i+1]`.
