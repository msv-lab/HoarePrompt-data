The loop condition is `ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]`. For the loop to execute one more time, the condition must be true at the beginning of the next iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `ans[i + 1]` is now equal to `ans[i + 1] + ans[i]`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, the updated value of `ans[i + 1]` must still satisfy the condition `ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]`.

Since `ans[i + 1]` has just been updated to `ans[i + 1] + ans[i]`, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `arr[i + 1]`. Specifically, `arr[i + 1]` must be greater than or equal to `ans[i + 1] + ans[i]`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

State: **`ans[i + 1]' is now equal to `ans[i + 1] + ans[i]' and `arr[i + 1]' must be greater than or equal to `ans[i + 1] + ans[i]'**
