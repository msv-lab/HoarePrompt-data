Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter arr, which is a list of n-1 integers where each integer is between 1 and 500, and n is an integer between 2 and 500. The function returns the list [2, 6, 120, 30, 50].**

This means the function `func_1` takes a list `arr` of n-1 integers, where each integer is between 1 and 500, and the length of the list is between 1 and 499 (since n ranges from 2 to 500). Regardless of the input list, the function always returns the fixed list `[2, 6, 120, 30, 50]`.
