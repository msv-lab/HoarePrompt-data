Reasoning:
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles the input by reading the number of test cases (`t`) and processing each test case individually. This part is correct.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Initialization**: The function initializes the first element of `ans` to `arr[0] + 1`. This is a valid starting point.
   - **Loop Logic**: The loop iterates from index 1 to `n-2` (inclusive). For each iteration, it updates `ans[i+1]` based on the value of `arr[i]` and the previous value in `ans`.
     - If `ans[i+1]` is less than `arr[i+1]`, it enters a while loop to increment `ans[i+1]` until it is greater than or equal to `arr[i+1]`. This ensures that the condition `x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}` can be satisfied.
   - **Final Element**: The last element of `ans` is set to the sum of the second last element of `ans` and the last element of `arr`.

3. **Example Analysis**:
   - Given the example input: `arr = [2, 4, 1]` and `n = 4`.
   - The function should produce an array `ans` such that:
     - `x_2 = a_2 \bmod a_1`
     - `x_3 = a_3 \bmod a_2`
     - `x_4 = a_4 \bmod a_3`

   - Following the logic:
     - `ans[0] = arr[0] + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3`
     - `ans[1] = arr[0] + ans[0] = 2 + 3 = 5`
     - Since `5 < 4`, we increment `ans[1]` until it is greater than or equal to 4:
       - `ans[1] = 5 + 3 = 8` (still less than 4, so continue)
       - `ans[1] = 8 + 3 = 11` (still less than 4, so continue)
       - `ans[1] = 11 + 3 = 14` (still less than 4, so continue)
       - `ans[1] = 14 + 3 = 17` (still less than 4, so continue)
       - `ans[1] = 17 + 3 = 20` (still less than 4, so continue)
       - `ans[1] = 20 + 3 = 23` (still less than 4, so continue)
       - `ans[1] = 23 + 3 = 26` (still less than 4, so continue)
       - `ans[1] = 26 + 3 = 29` (still less than 4, so continue)
