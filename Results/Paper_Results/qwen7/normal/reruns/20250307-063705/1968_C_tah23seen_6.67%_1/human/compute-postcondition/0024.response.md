Output State: The final state of `ans` will be a list where each element is calculated based on the given rules and continues to double until it exceeds `arr[i+1]`. Specifically, `ans[0]` starts as `arr[0] + 1`, `ans[1]` as `arr[0] + 1 + ans[0]`, and each subsequent `ans[i]` doubles the previous `ans[i-1]` until adding `ans[i]` to `ans[i+1]` would make `ans[i+1]` exceed `arr[i+1]`.

In simpler terms, the output state after the loop finishes all its iterations will be a list `ans` where each element follows the doubling rule until it can no longer fit within the constraints set by the corresponding `arr` values.
