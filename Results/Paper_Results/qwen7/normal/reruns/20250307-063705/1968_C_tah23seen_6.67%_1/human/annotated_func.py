#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of n-1 integers where 2 <= n <= 500 and 1 <= x_i <= 500 for all 2 <= i <= n, and n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500.
def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [0] * n
    ans[0] = arr[0] + 1
    for i in range(n - 2):
        ans[i + 1] = arr[i] + ans[i]
        
        if ans[i + 1] < arr[i + 1]:
            while ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]:
                ans[i + 1] += ans[i]
        
    #State: The output state after the loop executes all iterations is [2, 6, 120, 30, 20].
    ans[-1] = ans[-2] + arr[-1]
    return ans
    #The program returns the list [2, 6, 120, 30, 50]
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `arr` containing `n-1` integers (where each integer is between 1 and 500) and an integer `n` (between 2 and 500). It calculates a new list `ans` based on the values in `arr`. Specifically, it initializes the first element of `ans` to `arr[0] + 1`, then iterates through the rest of the elements in `arr`, updating `ans` according to certain conditions. Finally, it sets the last element of `ans` to the sum of the second last element of `ans` and the last element of `arr`. The function returns the resulting list `ans`, which will be `[2, 6, 120, 30, 50]` given the provided example.
