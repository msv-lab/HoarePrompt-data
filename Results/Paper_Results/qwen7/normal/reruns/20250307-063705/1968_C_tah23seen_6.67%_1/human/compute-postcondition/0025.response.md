Output State: The final state of `ans` will be `[2, 6, 14, 30]`.

Explanation: Given the initial conditions and the loop behavior, we can deduce the following:

- `ans[0]` starts as `arr[0] + 1`.
- `ans[1]` starts as `arr[0] + 1 + ans[0] = 2 * (arr[0] + 1)`.
- Each subsequent `ans[i]` is calculated as `2 * ans[i-1]` until the next value would exceed `arr[i+1]`.

Let's assume the initial values of `arr` are such that they allow the loop to run three full iterations. Based on the provided output states after the first three iterations:

- After 1 iteration: `ans` becomes `[2, 6]`.
- After 2 iterations: `ans` becomes `[2, 6, 14]`.
- After 3 iterations: `ans` becomes `[2, 6, 14, 30]`.

Each `ans[i]` is doubled from the previous value until it exceeds the corresponding `arr[i+1]`. Since no specific `arr` values were given, we infer the pattern based on the doubling and the condition that the loop continues until the next value would exceed `arr[i+1]`. Thus, the final state of `ans` after all iterations is `[2, 6, 14, 30]`.
