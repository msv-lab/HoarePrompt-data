The function accepts a list `arr` containing `n-1` integers (where each integer is between 1 and 500) and an integer `n` (between 2 and 500). It calculates a new list `ans` based on the values in `arr`. Specifically, it initializes the first element of `ans` to `arr[0] + 1`, then iterates through the rest of the elements in `arr`, updating `ans` according to certain conditions. Finally, it sets the last element of `ans` to the sum of the second last element of `ans` and the last element of `arr`. The function returns the resulting list `ans`, which will be `[2, 6, 120, 30, 50]` given the provided example.
