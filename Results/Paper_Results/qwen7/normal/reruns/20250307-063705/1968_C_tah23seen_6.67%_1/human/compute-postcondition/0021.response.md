Output State: **`ans[i + 1]' is now equal to `ans[i + 1] + ans[i]'**

This means that the value of `ans[i + 1]` has been updated to its original value plus the value of `ans[i]`. The condition that `ans[i + 1]` must be less than or equal to `arr[i + 1]` remains valid, but the exact value of `ans[i + 1]` now reflects the addition of `ans[i]`.
