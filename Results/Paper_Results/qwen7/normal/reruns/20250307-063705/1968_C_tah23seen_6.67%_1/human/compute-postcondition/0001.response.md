Output State: **`arr` is a list of n-1 integers where 2 <= n <= 500 and 1 <= x_i <= 500 for all 2 <= i <= n, `ans` is a list of n elements each initialized to 0, `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, and 2 <= n <= 500.**

Explanation: The code `ans[0] = arr[0] + 1` updates the first element of the list `ans` to be the first element of the list `arr` plus one. All other variables and their states remain unchanged.
