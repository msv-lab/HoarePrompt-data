Output State: **`i` is 1; `ans` is [2, 6, 30, 30, 20]; `arr[2]` must be greater than or equal to 14**

Explanation: The code `ans[i + 1] += ans[i]` updates the value of `ans[i + 1]` by adding `ans[i]` to it. Given the initial state where `i` is 1 and `ans` is `[2, 6, 14, 30, 20]`, the code calculates `ans[2]` (which is the third element in the list) as `ans[1] + ans[0]`. So, `ans[2]` becomes `6 + 2 = 8`. However, since the initial value of `ans[2]` was 14, and the condition `arr[2] must be greater than or equal to 14` is still valid, the updated `ans` list is `[2, 6, 30, 30, 20]` (note that `ans[2]` was updated from 14 to 30). The value of `i` remains unchanged.
