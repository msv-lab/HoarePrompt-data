Output State: `i` is 1; `ans` is [2, 6, 120, 30, 20].

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `ans[i + 1]` is less than or equal to `arr[i + 1]`. After the third iteration, `ans[2]` is 90 and `arr[2]` is 30, so the condition `ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]` is no longer satisfied (since 90 > 30). Therefore, the loop stops here. Each iteration updates `ans[i + 1]` by adding the previous value of `ans[i]` to it. Given the final value of `ans[2]` is 90 after three iterations and `arr[2]` is 30, the next update would make `ans[3]` equal to `ans[2] + ans[2] = 90 + 90 = 180`, but since the loop stops, `ans[3]` remains 30. Thus, after all iterations, `ans` will be [2, 6, 120, 30, 20].
