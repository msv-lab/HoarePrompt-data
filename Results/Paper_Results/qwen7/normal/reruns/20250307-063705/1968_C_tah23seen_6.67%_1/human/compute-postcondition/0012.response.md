Output State: `i` is equal to `n - 1`; `n` must be at least 3; `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`; `ans[1]` is `arr[0] + 1 + ans[0]`; for every index `j` from 2 to `n-1`, `ans[j]` is `2 * ans[j-1]`; `arr[n-1]` must be at least `8 * arr[0] + 8 * 2^(n-3)`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n - 1` because the loop increments `i` until `ans[i + 1]` is no longer less than or equal to `arr[i + 1]`. Given the pattern observed, `ans[0]` remains as `arr[0] + 1`, and `ans[1]` remains as `arr[0] + 1 + ans[0]`. For each subsequent `ans[j]` where `j` ranges from 2 to `n-1`, it doubles the previous value `ans[j-1]`. Additionally, for the loop to complete all iterations, the condition `arr[n-1]` must be at least `8 * arr[0] + 8 * 2^(n-3)`.
