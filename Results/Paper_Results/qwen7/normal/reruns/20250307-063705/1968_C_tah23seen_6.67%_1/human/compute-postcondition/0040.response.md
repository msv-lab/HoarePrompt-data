Output State: **`ans` is [2, 6, 120, 30, 50]**.

Explanation: The code updates the last element of the list `ans` by adding the last element of the list `arr` to the second last element of `ans`. Given the initial state where `ans` is `[2, 6, 120, 30, 20]` and assuming `arr` has its last element as `20` (since no `arr` is provided, we infer from the context), the last element of `ans` (which is `20`) is updated to `30 + 20 = 50`. Therefore, the updated list `ans` becomes `[2, 6, 120, 30, 50]`.
