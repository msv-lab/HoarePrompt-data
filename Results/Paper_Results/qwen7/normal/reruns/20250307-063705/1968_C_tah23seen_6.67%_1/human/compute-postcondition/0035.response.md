Output State: `i` is 1; `ans` is [2, 6, 120, 30, 20].

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` remains 1 because the condition `ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]` was met and incremented `i` only up to 1 based on the given output states. The `ans` list is updated as follows: starting from `[2, 6, 14, 30, 20]`, it becomes `[2, 6, 30, 30, 20]` after the first iteration (where `ans[2]` is set to 30), then `[2, 6, 60, 30, 20]` after the second iteration (where `ans[2]` is set to 60), and finally `[2, 6, 90, 30, 20]` after the third iteration (where `ans[2]` is set to 90). Since `arr[2]` must be exactly 30 for the loop to execute the third time, and no further changes are made to `ans` or `i` after the third iteration, the final state of `ans` is `[2, 6, 120, 30, 20]`.
