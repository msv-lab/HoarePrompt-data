Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information
- The loop condition is `ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]`.
- The current state at the end of the previous iteration is:
  - `i` is 2
  - `n` must be at least 3
  - `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`
  - `ans[1]` is `arr[0] + 1 + ans[0]`
  - `ans[2]` is `ans[1] + ans[1]`
  - `ans[3]` is `2 * ans[2]`

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]`.
2. **Current Values**:
   - `i = 2`
   - `ans[0] = arr[0] + 1`
   - `ans[1] = arr[0] + 1 + ans[0] = arr[0] + 1 + (arr[0] + 1) = 2 * arr[0] + 2`
   - `ans[2] = ans[1] + ans[1] = (2 * arr[0] + 2) + (2 * arr[0] + 2) = 4 * arr[0] + 4`
   - `ans[3] = 2 * ans[2] = 2 * (4 * arr[0] + 4) = 8 * arr[0] + 8`

3. **Evaluate the Loop Condition**:
   - For the loop to continue, `ans[i + 1]` must be less than or equal to `arr[i + 1]`.
   - Since `i = 2`, we need to check `ans[3]` against `arr[3]`.
   - The condition becomes `ans[3] <= arr[3]`.

4. **Determine the Next Iteration**:
   - If `ans[3] <= arr[3]`, the loop will continue.
   - To ensure the loop continues, `arr[3]` must be greater than or equal to `ans[3]`.
   - Therefore, `arr[3]` must be at least `8 * arr[0] + 8`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - The only variable involved in the loop condition is `arr[3]`.
   - We need to ensure `arr[3]` is at least `8 * arr[0] + 8`.

### Final Answer
State: **`i` is 2; `n` must be at least 3; `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`; `ans[1]` is `arr[0] + 1 + ans[0]`; `ans[2]` is `ans[1] + ans[1]`; `ans[3]` is `2 * ans[2]` and `arr[3]` must be at least `8 * arr[0] + 8`**
