Output State: **`i` is 2; `n` must be at least 3; `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`; `ans[1]` is `arr[0] + 1 + ans[0]`; `ans[2]` is `ans[1] + ans[1]`; `ans[3]` is `2 * ans[2]` and `arr[3]` must be at least `8 * arr[0] + 8`; `ans[3]` is increased by `ans[2]`.**

Explanation: The code updates `ans[i + 1]` (which is `ans[3]` since `i` is 2) by adding `ans[i]` (which is `ans[2]`). Given that `ans[2]` is `ans[1] + ans[1]` and `ans[1]` is `arr[0] + 1 + ans[0]` and `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, we can calculate `ans[2]` as follows:

- `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`
- `ans[1]` is `arr[0] + 1 + (arr[0] + 1)` which simplifies to `2 * arr[0] + 2`
- `ans[2]` is `(2 * arr[0] + 2) + (2 * arr[0] + 2)` which simplifies to `4 * arr[0] + 4`

Therefore, `ans[3]` is initially `2 * ans[2]`, which is `2 * (4 * arr[0] + 4)` or `8 * arr[0] + 8`. After the code execution, `ans[3]` is increased by `ans[2]`, which is `4 * arr[0] + 4`. Thus, the new value of `ans[3]` is `(8 * arr[0] + 8) + (4 * arr[0] + 4)` or `12 * arr[0] + 12`.

The output state remains with all the initial conditions and the updated value of `ans[3]`.
