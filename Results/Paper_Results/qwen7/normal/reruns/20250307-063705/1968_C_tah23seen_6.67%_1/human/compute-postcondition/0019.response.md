Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1; `ans[i + 1]` is updated to be `ans[i] + ans[i]`, which is `2 * ans[i];` the conditions for `ans[0]`, `ans[1]`, and the subsequent `ans[i]` remain valid.**

Explanation: The code updates `ans[i + 1]` to be twice its current value by adding `ans[i]` to itself. The initial conditions for `ans` and the value of `i` are maintained, except that `i` is incremented by 1 and `ans[i + 1]` is now twice the value of `ans[i]`.
