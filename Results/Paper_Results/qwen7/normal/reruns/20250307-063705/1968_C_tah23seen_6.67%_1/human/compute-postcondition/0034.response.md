Output State: **`i` is 1; `ans` is [2, 6, 90, 30, 20]**.

Explanation: The code updates `ans[i + 1]` by adding `ans[i]` to it. Given that `i` is 1, `ans[i + 1]` refers to `ans[2]`. The original value of `ans[2]` is 6, and `ans[1]` is 6. Adding these together, `ans[2]` becomes 12 + 6 = 90. All other values remain unchanged.
