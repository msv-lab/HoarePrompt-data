Output State: **The output state after the loop executes all iterations is [2, 6, 120, 30, 20].**

Explanation: Based on the given information, the loop continues to update the `ans` list according to the rules provided. After executing the loop for 3 iterations, we observe that the value at `ans[2]` becomes 120, which is the result of the condition being met multiple times. The value at `ans[3]` is 30, and `ans[4]` is 20, indicating that the loop has stopped updating once `ans[i + 1]` is no longer less than `arr[i + 1]`. Given the constraints and the pattern observed, it's clear that the loop will not change these values further, resulting in the final `ans` list as [2, 6, 120, 30, 20].
