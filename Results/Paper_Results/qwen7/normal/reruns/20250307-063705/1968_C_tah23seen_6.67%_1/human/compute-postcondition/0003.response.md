Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 3, `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, `ans[1]` is `arr[0] + 1 + ans[0]`**

Explanation: The code updates `ans[i + 1]` to be `arr[i] + ans[i]`. Given that `i` is initially 0, `ans[i + 1]` becomes `ans[1]`, and it is set to `arr[0] + ans[0]`. Since `ans[0]` is given as `arr[0] + 1`, substituting this into the equation gives `ans[1]` as `arr[0] + (arr[0] + 1)`, which simplifies to `2 * arr[0] + 1`. However, since the exact value of `arr[0]` is not provided, we keep it in terms of `arr[0]` and `ans[0]`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
