Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `ans` is [2, 6, 60, 30, 20]
   - `arr[2]` must be exactly 30

3. **Check the loop condition with the current state**:
   - The current value of `i` is 1.
   - Therefore, `ans[i + 1]` corresponds to `ans[2]`, which is 60.
   - `arr[i + 1]` corresponds to `arr[2]`, which must be exactly 30.

4. **Determine if the loop can execute one more time**:
   - For the loop to continue, `ans[i + 1]` must be less than or equal to `arr[i + 1]`.
   - Currently, `ans[2]` is 60 and `arr[2]` is 30.
   - Since 60 is not less than or equal to 30, the loop cannot continue based on the current values.

5. **Adjust the states to allow the loop to execute one more time**:
   - To allow the loop to continue, we need to change the value of `ans[2]` to a value that is less than or equal to 30.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `ans[2]` is less than or equal to 30.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1; `ans` is [2, 6, 60, 30, 20]; `arr[2]` must be exactly 30 and `ans[2]` must be less than or equal to 30**
