Output State: **`ans[i + 1]' is now equal to `ans[i + 1] + ans[i]'** and **`arr[i + 1]' must be greater than or equal to `ans[i + 1] + ans[i]'**.

The value of `ans[i + 1]` has been updated to `ans[i + 1] + ans[i]`. The condition for `arr[i + 1]` remains the same, it must be greater than or equal to the new value of `ans[i + 1]`, which is `ans[i + 1] + ans[i]`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
