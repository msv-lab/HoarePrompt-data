Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition:**
   The loop condition is `ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `ans` is [2, 6, 30, 30, 20].
   - `arr[2]` must be greater than or equal to 14.

3. **Evaluate the Loop Condition:**
   - For the loop to continue, `ans[i + 1]` must be less than or equal to `arr[i + 1]`.
   - Given `i` is 1, the relevant elements are `ans[2]` and `arr[2]`.
   - From the given `ans` array, `ans[2]` is 30.
   - We know `arr[2]` must be greater than or equal to 14.

4. **Determine the Necessary Adjustments:**
   - Since `ans[2]` is 30, for the loop to continue, `arr[2]` must be less than or equal to 30.
   - However, the problem states that `arr[2]` must be greater than or equal to 14.
   - Therefore, `arr[2]` must be exactly 30 to satisfy both conditions (greater than or equal to 14 and less than or equal to 30).

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The only state that needs to be adjusted is `arr[2]` to be exactly 30.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is 1; `ans` is [2, 6, 30, 30, 20]; `arr[2]` must be exactly 30**
