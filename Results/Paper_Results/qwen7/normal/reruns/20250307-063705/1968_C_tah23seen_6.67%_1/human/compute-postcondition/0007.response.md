Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 3, `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, `ans[1]` is `arr[0] + 1 + ans[0]`, `ans[2]` is `ans[1] + ans[1]`**

Explanation: The code `ans[i + 1] += ans[i]` updates `ans[2]` by adding `ans[1]` to itself. Given that `ans[1]` is `arr[0] + 1 + ans[0]`, and `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, we can substitute these values to find that `ans[2]` becomes `ans[1] + ans[1]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
