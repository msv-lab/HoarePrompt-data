Output State: **`i` is 2; `n` must be at least 3; `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`; `ans[1]` is `arr[0] + 1 + ans[0]`; `ans[2]` is `ans[1] + ans[1]`; `ans[3]` is `2 * ans[2]`**

Explanation: The code `ans[i + 1] += ans[i]` updates `ans[3]` (since `i` is 2) by adding `ans[2]` to itself. Given the initial values, `ans[2]` is `ans[1] + ans[1]`, which simplifies to `2 * (arr[0] + 1 + ans[0])`. Since `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, we substitute to get `2 * ((arr[0] + 1) + (arr[0] + 1))`, which simplifies to `2 * (2 * arr[0] + 2)`, or `4 * arr[0] + 4`. Therefore, `ans[3]` is `4 * arr[0] + 4`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
