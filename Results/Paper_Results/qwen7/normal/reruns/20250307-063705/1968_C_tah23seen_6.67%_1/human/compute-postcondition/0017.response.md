Output State: **`i` is now the index of the last element in `ans` that satisfies the condition `ans[i + 1] < arr[i + 1]`, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` must be at least 3, `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, `ans[1]` is `arr[0] + 1 + ans[0]`, and each subsequent `ans[i]` is calculated as `2 * ans[i-1]` until the next value would exceed `arr[i+1]`, `ans[i + 1]` is updated to `arr[i] + ans[i]`.**

Explanation: The code updates `ans[i + 1]` to `arr[i] + ans[i]`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged from the initial state.
