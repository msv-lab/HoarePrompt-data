Output State: **`i` is 1; `ans` is [2, 6, 60, 30, 20]; `arr[2]` must be exactly 30**

Explanation: The code `ans[i + 1] += ans[i]` updates the element at index `i + 1` in the list `ans` by adding the value of `ans[i]` to it. Given that `i` is 1, `ans[i + 1]` refers to `ans[2]`. The value of `ans[2]` was initially 30, and `ans[i]` (which is `ans[1]`) is 6. Therefore, `ans[2]` is updated to `30 + 6`, which equals 60. All other variables and their states remain unchanged.
