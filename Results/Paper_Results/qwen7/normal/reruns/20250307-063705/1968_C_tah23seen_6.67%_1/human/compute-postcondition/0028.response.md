Output State: **`i` is 1; `ans` is [2, 6, 14, 30, 20]**.

Explanation: The code updates the list `ans` by calculating `ans[i + 1]` as `arr[i] + ans[i]`. Given that `i` is 1 and `ans` is `[2, 6, 14, 30]`, the new element `ans[2]` (since `i + 1` equals 2) is calculated as `arr[1] + ans[1]`. Since `arr` is not defined in the initial state, we assume `arr[1]` is the second element of `ans`, which is 6. Thus, `ans[2]` becomes `6 + 6 = 12`. However, since `ans` initially had 4 elements, the updated `ans` now has 5 elements, making it `[2, 6, 14, 30, 20]`. The value of `i` remains unchanged.
