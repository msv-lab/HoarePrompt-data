Output State: `i` is equal to the length of `arr` minus 1, `n` must be at least 3, `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, `ans[1]` is `arr[0] + 1 + ans[0]`, `ans[2]` is `ans[1] + ans[1]`, `ans[3]` is `2 * ans[2]`, and so on until `ans[i]` which is calculated based on the previous elements in the `ans` list, with each `ans[i]` being doubled from the previous `ans[i-1]` until the condition `ans[i + 1] > arr[i + 1]` is met or all elements of `arr` are processed.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be the index of the last element in `ans` that satisfies the loop's condition, `ans[0]` will start as `arr[0] + 1`, and each subsequent `ans[i]` will double the previous one (`ans[i] = 2 * ans[i-1]`) until the next value would exceed `arr[i+1]`.
