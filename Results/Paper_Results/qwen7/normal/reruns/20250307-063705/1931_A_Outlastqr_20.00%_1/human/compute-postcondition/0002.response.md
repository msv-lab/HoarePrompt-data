Output State: **`i` is 0 (or 1), `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `n`. The value of `i` remains unchanged as the input is taken and the assignment happens to a new variable `n`. The initial state of `i` being 0 (or 1) is preserved, and `n` now holds the integer value entered by the user.
