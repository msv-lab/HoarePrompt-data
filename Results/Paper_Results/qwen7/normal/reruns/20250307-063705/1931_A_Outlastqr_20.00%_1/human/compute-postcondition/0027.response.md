Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly stated to be 1.
- `n` is an input integer.
- The value of `word` depends on the value of `n`:
  - If `n` is greater than 52, then `word` is 'zz'.
  - If `n` is greater than 26 but less than or equal to 52, then `word` is 'az'.
  - If `n` is less than or equal to 26, then `word` is 'aaa'.

Since the value of `n` is not specified in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact value of `word`. However, we can describe the possible values of `word` based on the conditions given.

Output: **'zz' if n > 52, 'az' if 26 < n <= 52, 'aaa' if n <= 26**
