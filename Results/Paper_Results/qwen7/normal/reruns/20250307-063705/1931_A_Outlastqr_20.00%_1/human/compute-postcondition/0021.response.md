Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `word` is 'az'**.

Explanation: The code appends the string `'az'` to the variable `word`. Since `n` is an input integer, the specific character from the `alphabet` corresponding to `n - 28` is concatenated with `'az'`. However, without knowing the exact value of `n`, we cannot determine the exact character from `alphabet[n - 28]`. But since the problem does not specify the content of `alphabet`, we assume the simplest case where `alphabet[n - 28]` contributes to the string `'az'`. Therefore, `word` becomes `'az'`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
