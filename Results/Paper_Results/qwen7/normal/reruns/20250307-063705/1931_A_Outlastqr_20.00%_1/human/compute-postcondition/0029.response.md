Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `word` is determined based on the value of `n` as follows: if `n` is greater than 52, then `word` is 'zz'; otherwise, if `n` is greater than 26, `word` is 'az', and if `n` is less than or equal to 26, `word` is 'aaa'**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer. This changes the value of `n`. However, since the initial value of `n` was an input integer, the new value of `n` is now the integer input by the user. The variables `i` and `word` remain unchanged from their initial states.
