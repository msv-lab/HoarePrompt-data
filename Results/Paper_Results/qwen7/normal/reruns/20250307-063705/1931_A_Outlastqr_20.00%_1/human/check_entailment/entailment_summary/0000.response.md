Reasoning:
- The problem requires finding the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word that could have been encoded given a specific sum.
- The provided code does not correctly handle the logic for constructing the word based on the sum `n`.
- Specifically, the code does not ensure that the constructed word is the lexicographically smallest possible for each given `n`.

Let's analyze the logic:
1. If `n > 52`, the code suggests setting `word` to the character from the alphabet at index `n - 53` followed by 'zz'. However, this does not guarantee the smallest word. For example, for `n = 54`, the code would produce 'bzz', but the correct answer should be 'azz'.
2. If `n > 26`, the code suggests setting `word` to 'a' followed by the character from the alphabet at index `n - 28` followed by 'z'. Again, this does not always produce the smallest word. For example, for `n = 30`, the code would produce 'azz', but the correct answer should be 'azz'.
3. If `n <= 26`, the code suggests setting `word` to 'aa' followed by the character from the alphabet at index `n - 3`. This part is correct for generating the smallest possible word in this range.

Given these issues, the provided code does not correctly generate the lexicographically smallest word for all cases.

Correctness: **False**
