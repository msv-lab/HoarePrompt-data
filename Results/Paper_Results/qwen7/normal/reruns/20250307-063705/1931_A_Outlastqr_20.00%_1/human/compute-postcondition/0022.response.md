Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `word` is 'aaa'.**

Explanation: The code appends `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]` to the string `word`. Given that `word` was initially an empty string (`''`), and assuming `alphabet` is a sequence (like a list or string) of alphabets, the operation `alphabet[n - 3]` would get the character from the `alphabet` list or string at index `n - 3`. However, since the exact content of `alphabet` is not specified, we can only say that `word` is now `'aaa'` because it starts with an empty string and then appends `'aa'` followed by one more character from `alphabet` at index `n - 3`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
