Output State: **`i` is 0 or 1, `n` is an input integer with a value greater than 26, and `word` is a string equal to 'az'.**

Explanation: The code appends 'a', the character from the `alphabet` list at index `n - 28`, and 'z' to the `word` string. Given that `n` is an integer greater than 26, `n - 28` will be an integer between -2 and a value less than `n - 27`. However, since the exact value of `alphabet` is not specified, we can only say that `word` will be 'az' because 'a' and 'z' are explicitly added. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
