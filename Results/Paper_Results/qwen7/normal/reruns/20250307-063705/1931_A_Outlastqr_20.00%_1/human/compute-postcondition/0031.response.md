Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `word` is "zz"**.

Explanation: The code `word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'` appends `alphabet[n - 53]` followed by `'zz'` to the string `word`. Since the value of `n` is an input integer, the exact character from `alphabet` cannot be determined without knowing `n`. However, the initial value of `word` is an empty string, so after appending `alphabet[n - 53]` and `'zz'`, `word` becomes `"zz"`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
