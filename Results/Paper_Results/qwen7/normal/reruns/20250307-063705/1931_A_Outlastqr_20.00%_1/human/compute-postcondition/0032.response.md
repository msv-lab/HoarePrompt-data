Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `word` is 'az'**

Explanation: The code appends `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'` to the existing value of `word`. Given that `word` was initially an empty string, and assuming `alphabet` is a sequence of characters (like the English alphabet), `alphabet[n - 28]` would be the character at index `n - 28` in the alphabet. Since `n` is an input integer, the exact character cannot be determined without knowing `n`. However, we know that `word` is updated to include `'a'`, followed by the character at index `n - 28`, and then `'z'`. Thus, `word` becomes `'az'` if `n - 28` corresponds to the index of `'a'` in the alphabet. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
