Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z'.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    word = ''
    if n > 52:
        word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'
    elif n > 26:
        word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'
    else:
        word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]
    print(word)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is either 0 or 1, `n` is an input integer, and `word` is a string. If `n` is greater than 52, then `word` is a string containing the character from the `alphabet` list at index `n - 53` followed by 'zz'. Otherwise, if `n` is greater than 26, `word` is set to 'az'. Otherwise, `word` is set to 'aaa'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer. If `n` is greater than 52, then `word` is 'zz'. Otherwise, if `n` is greater than 26, `word` is 'az', and if `n` is less than or equal to 26, `word` is 'aaa'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, and `word` is either 'zz' if `n` is less than or equal to 52, or 'az' if `n` is greater than 52, or a string containing 'aaa' where 'a' is repeated according to the character at index `n-3` in the alphabet if `n` is 26 or less.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
