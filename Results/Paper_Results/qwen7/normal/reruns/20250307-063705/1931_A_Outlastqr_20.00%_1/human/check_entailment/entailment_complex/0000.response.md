Reasoning:

1. The program correctly handles the different ranges of `n` values:
   - When `n > 52`, the word should be constructed using the character from the alphabet at index `n - 53` followed by 'zz'.
   - When `27 <= n <= 52`, the word should be constructed using 'a' followed by the character from the alphabet at index `n - 28` followed by 'z'.
   - When `n <= 26`, the word should be constructed using 'aa' followed by the character from the alphabet at index `n - 3`.

2. The logic for constructing the word based on the value of `n` is implemented correctly:
   - For `n > 52`, the character from the alphabet is correctly accessed with `alphabet[n - 53]` and appended to 'zz'.
   - For `27 <= n <= 52`, the character from the alphabet is correctly accessed with `alphabet[n - 28]` and appended to 'az'.
   - For `n <= 26`, the character from the alphabet is correctly accessed with `alphabet[n - 3]` and appended to 'aa'.

3. The program iterates over the number of test cases `t` and processes each `n` correctly, printing the lexicographically smallest word for each `n`.

4. The examples provided in the problem statement are correctly handled by the program, producing the expected outputs.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find the lexicographically smallest word for each encoded value `n`.

Correctness: **True**
