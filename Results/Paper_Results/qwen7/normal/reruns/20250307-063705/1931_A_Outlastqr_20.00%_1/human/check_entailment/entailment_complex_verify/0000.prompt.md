You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nikita had a word consisting of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters. The letters
in the Latin alphabet are numbered from 1 to 26 , where the letter "a" has the
index 1 , and the letter "z" has the index 26 .

He encoded this word as the sum of the positions of all the characters in the
alphabet. For example, the word "cat" he would encode as the integer 3 + 1 +
20 = 24 , because the letter "c" has the index 3 in the alphabet, the letter
"a" has the index 1 , and the letter "t" has the index 20 .

However, this encoding turned out to be ambiguous! For example, when encoding
the word "ava", the integer 1 + 22 + 1 = 24 is also obtained.

Determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have
been encoded.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of
the following holds:

  * a is a prefix of b , but a \ne b ;
  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \le n \le
78 ) — the encoded word.

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word
that could have been encoded on a separate line.

Example

Input

    24
    
    70
    
    3
    
    55
    
    48

Output

    aav
    rzz
    aaa
    czz
    auz

- Program: 
import string

def func():
    alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        word = ''
        if n > 52:
            word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'
        elif n > 26:
            word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'
        else:
            word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]
        print(word)



- Annotated Code: 
import string

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78.
def func():
    alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        word = ''
        
        if n > 52:
            word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'
        elif n > 26:
            word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'
        else:
            word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]
        
        print(word)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to the total number of iterations, which is the input value provided to the loop. The variable `n` will be the last integer input provided to the loop. The variable `word` will be determined based on the value of `n` as follows: if `n` is greater than 52, `word` will be the character from the `alphabet` list at index `n - 53` followed by 'zz'. If `n` is between 27 and 52 (inclusive), `word` will be 'a' followed by the character from the `alphabet` list at index `n - 28` followed by 'z'. If `n` is less than or equal to 26, `word` will be 'aa' followed by the character from the `alphabet` list at index `n - 3`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` and then `t` pairs of integers `n`. For each `n`, it constructs a string `word` based on the value of `n`. If `n` is greater than 52, `word` is set to the character from the alphabet at index `n - 53` followed by 'zz'. If `n` is between 27 and 52, inclusive, `word` is set to 'a' followed by the character from the alphabet at index `n - 28` followed by 'z'. If `n` is less than or equal to 26, `word` is set to 'aa' followed by the character from the alphabet at index `n - 3`. The function prints `word` for each `n`. After processing all inputs, the function has no output but modifies the printed strings.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate the lexicographically smallest word for all possible encoded values. Specifically, for the input `n = 3`, the program outputs `"aaa"`, which is correct. However, for other inputs, the program fails to produce the correct result.

For example, consider the input `n = 24`. The lexicographically smallest word that encodes to 24 is `"aav"`, but the program incorrectly outputs `"aaz"`.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the issue:
- For `n = 24`, the correct word is `"aav"` (since 1 + 1 + 22 = 24).
- The program outputs `"aaz"` (since it calculates `alphabet[24 - 28]` which is `'z'` and appends `'a'` twice).

This shows that the program does not handle the encoding logic correctly for all cases, particularly when the sum of the indices results in a specific pattern that needs to be handled differently. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
