Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, and `word` is a string based on the value of the new `n` which is the input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The variable `i` remains unchanged at 1, and the variable `word` is updated based on the new value of `n`. Since the exact value of the input is not specified, `word` is described as being based on the value of the new `n`.
