Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z'.**

The code initializes the variable `alphabet` with all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z'. This does not affect the values of `t` and `n`. Therefore, the conditions for `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
