Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes two integers, `t` and `n`, where `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, but these integers are not passed as arguments to the function. Instead, the function returns based on the conditions provided for `t` and `n`.**

However, since the function definition does not include parameters `t` and `n`, the actual functionality described should reflect that the function does not directly accept any parameters but rather implies that `t` and `n` are expected to be defined or provided elsewhere in the code context.
