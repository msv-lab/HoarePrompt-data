Postcondition: `i` is either 0 or 1, `n` is an input integer, and `word` is a string. If `n` is greater than 52, then `word` is a string containing the character from the `alphabet` list at index `n - 53` followed by 'zz'. Otherwise, if `n` is greater than 26, `word` is set to 'az'. Otherwise, `word` is set to 'aaa'.
