Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - The value of `word` depends on the value of `n`:
     - If `n` is greater than 52, then `word` is 'zz'.
     - If `n` is greater than 26, `word` is 'az'.
     - If `n` is less than or equal to 26, `word` is 'aaa'.

2. **Loop Head:**
   - The loop is defined as `for i in range(int(input())):`.

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - The only variable in the loop head is `i`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 2.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head and is not modified within the loop body (as per the given postcondition).

4. **New State:**
   - `i` is now 2.
   - `n` remains the same as the initial value at the end of the previous iteration.
   - The value of `word` remains the same as the initial value at the end of the previous iteration based on the value of `n`.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `word` is determined based on the value of `n` as follows: if `n` is greater than 52, then `word` is 'zz'; otherwise, if `n` is greater than 26, `word` is 'az', and if `n` is less than or equal to 26, `word` is 'aaa'**.
