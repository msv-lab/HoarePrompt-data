The function reads an integer `t` and then `t` pairs of integers `n`. For each `n`, it constructs a string `word` based on the value of `n`. If `n` is greater than 52, `word` is set to the character from the alphabet at index `n - 53` followed by 'zz'. If `n` is between 27 and 52, inclusive, `word` is set to 'a' followed by the character from the alphabet at index `n - 28` followed by 'z'. If `n` is less than or equal to 26, `word` is set to 'aa' followed by the character from the alphabet at index `n - 3`. The function prints `word` for each `n`. After processing all inputs, the function has no output but modifies the printed strings.
