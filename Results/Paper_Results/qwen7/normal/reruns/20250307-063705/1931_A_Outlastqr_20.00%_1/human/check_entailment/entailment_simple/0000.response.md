Reasoning:
1. The program correctly handles the different ranges of the encoded values (`n`) and constructs the corresponding three-letter words.
2. For `n > 52`, it constructs the word with the character at index `n - 53` followed by 'zz'. This covers the range from 53 to 78 (since `n` can go up to 78).
3. For `27 <= n <= 52`, it constructs the word with 'a' followed by the character at index `n - 28` and 'z'. This covers the range from 27 to 52.
4. For `n <= 26`, it constructs the word with 'aa' followed by the character at index `n - 3`. This covers the range from 3 to 26.
5. The logic ensures that the word constructed is the lexicographically smallest possible for each given `n`.

Given these points, the program correctly implements the logic to find the lexicographically smallest word for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
