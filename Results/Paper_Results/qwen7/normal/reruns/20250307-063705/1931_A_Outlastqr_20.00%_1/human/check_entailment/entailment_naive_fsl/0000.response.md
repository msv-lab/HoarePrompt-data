Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate the lexicographically smallest word for all possible encoded values. Specifically, for the input `n = 3`, the program outputs `"aaa"`, which is correct. However, for other inputs, the program fails to produce the correct result.

For example, consider the input `n = 24`. The lexicographically smallest word that encodes to 24 is `"aav"`, but the program incorrectly outputs `"aaz"`.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the issue:
- For `n = 24`, the correct word is `"aav"` (since 1 + 1 + 22 = 24).
- The program outputs `"aaz"` (since it calculates `alphabet[24 - 28]` which is `'z'` and appends `'a'` twice).

This shows that the program does not handle the encoding logic correctly for all cases, particularly when the sum of the indices results in a specific pattern that needs to be handled differently. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
