Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the State Adjustments**:
   - The variable `i` is used as the loop counter.
   - The expression `int(input())` determines the number of iterations the loop will run.

3. **Analyze the Conditions**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `int(input())` is a positive integer.
   - The value of `int(input())` must be within the range of valid inputs for `i`.

4. **Initial States**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
   - `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 78\).
   - `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z'.

5. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since `i` is the loop counter, it must start at 0 (or 1 if the loop starts from 1) and increment until it reaches the value of `int(input())`.
   - The value of `int(input())` must be a positive integer and within the bounds of the loop's expected behavior.

Given these points, the state adjustments needed are:

- `i` should start at 0 (or 1 if the loop starts from 1).
- `int(input())` must be a positive integer and within the expected range for the loop to execute.

Since `t`, `n`, and `alphabet` do not directly affect the loop's execution, they do not need to be adjusted.

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is 0 (or 1), `int(input())` must be a positive integer and within the expected range for the loop to execute**
