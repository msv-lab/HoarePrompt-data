Output State: **`s` is a string of length `m + 1` that must have at least one character, `i` is the next character in the string `s`, and the character `i` is removed from the alphabet.**

This means that the string `s` and its length `m + 1` remain unchanged, and the character `i` which was part of the alphabet has now been removed from it.
