### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m` followed by the string `s`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function constructs `s1` by appending characters from `s` that are in the set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - It removes these characters from the set of `k` alphabets.
   - It constructs `s2` by appending the last `n` characters from `s1` after processing the entire string `s`.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic checks if the length of `s1` is at least `n * k`. If it is, it means all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets are subsequences of `s`.
   - If not, it prints "NO" and generates a counterexample string of length `n` that cannot be a subsequence of `s`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the alphabet set becomes empty before the end of the string `s`.
   - However, there is a critical issue in the logic used to generate the counterexample string. The variable `i` in the while loop is initialized to `97`, which corresponds to 'a'. The condition `if chr(i) not in s1:` checks if the character corresponding to `i` is not in `s1`. This is incorrect because `i` should be incremented to check the next character in the sequence of the first `k` lowercase alphabets, not just incrementing `i` directly.

5. **Correctness of Counterexample Generation**:
   - The logic to find a character that is not in `s1` is flawed. Instead of checking `chr(i)` directly, it should check the next character in the sequence of the first `k` lowercase alphabets.
   - Specifically, the while loop should check if the next character in the sequence of the first `k` lowercase alphabets is not in `s1`. The current implementation will not correctly identify the next character in the sequence.

6. **Output**:
   - The program outputs "YES" or "NO" for each test case.
   - If "NO", it should output a counterexample string of length `n` that cannot be a subsequence of `s`.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment incorrectly states that the program correctly handles the generation of a counterexample string. The current implementation of the while loop in the main logic is flawed and does not correctly identify the next character in the sequence of the first `k` lowercase alphabets.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final:
Final: **False**
