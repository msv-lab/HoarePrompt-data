The function `func_1` takes a string `s` of length `m`, an integer `k`, and an integer `n` as inputs. It constructs two new strings, `s1` and `s2`, by iterating through each character in `s`. If the character is among the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, it is added to `s1`; under certain conditions, it is also added to `s2`. After processing, it checks if the length of `s1` (which is `m * n`) is at least `n * k`. Finally, it returns a boolean indicating this condition, an empty string, and the current state of `s2`.
