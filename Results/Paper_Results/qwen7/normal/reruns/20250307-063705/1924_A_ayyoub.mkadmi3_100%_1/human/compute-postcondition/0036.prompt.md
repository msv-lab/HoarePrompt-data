You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string of length m, where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000 and consists only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, k and n are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ n ≤ 26.
def func_1(s, k, n):
    s1 = ''
    s2 = ''
    alphabet = {chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}
    for i in s:
        if i in alphabet:
            if len(alphabet) != 1:
                alphabet.remove(i)
            else:
                s2 += i
                alphabet = {chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}
            s1 += i
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `s` is the original string `s` fully concatenated with itself character by character, resulting in a final string of length `m * n`. `s1` contains the full concatenation of `s` as well, so `s1` is identical to `s`. `s2` is either empty or contains characters from `s` based on the conditions within the loop. `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase letters starting from 'a', unless it was reduced to a single character during the loop's execution.
    r = len(s1) // k
    return len(s1) >= n * k, s1[r * k:], s2
    #The program returns a boolean indicating whether the length of `s1` (which is `m * n`) is greater than or equal to `n * k`, an empty string, and the current state of `s2`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: a string `s` of length `m` (where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000), an integer `k` (where 1 ≤ k ≤ 26), and an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 26). It returns a boolean indicating whether the length of `s1` (which is `m * n`) is greater than or equal to `n * k`, an empty string, and the current state of `s2`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a boolean indicating whether the length of `s1` (which is `m * n`) is greater than or equal to `n * k`, an empty string, and the current state of `s2`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
