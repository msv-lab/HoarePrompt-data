#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string of length m, where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000 and consists only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, k and n are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ n ≤ 26.
def func_1(s, k, n):
    s1 = ''
    s2 = ''
    alphabet = {chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}
    for i in s:
        if i in alphabet:
            if len(alphabet) != 1:
                alphabet.remove(i)
            else:
                s2 += i
                alphabet = {chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}
            s1 += i
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `s` is the original string `s` fully concatenated with itself character by character, resulting in a final string of length `m * n`. `s1` contains the full concatenation of `s` as well, so `s1` is identical to `s`. `s2` is either empty or contains characters from `s` based on the conditions within the loop. `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase letters starting from 'a', unless it was reduced to a single character during the loop's execution.
    r = len(s1) // k
    return len(s1) >= n * k, s1[r * k:], s2
    #The program returns a boolean indicating whether the length of `s1` (which is `m * n`) is greater than or equal to `n * k`, an empty string, and the current state of `s2`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a string `s` of length `m`, an integer `k`, and an integer `n` as inputs. It constructs two new strings, `s1` and `s2`, by iterating through each character in `s`. If the character is among the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, it is added to `s1`; under certain conditions, it is also added to `s2`. After processing, it checks if the length of `s1` (which is `m * n`) is at least `n * k`. Finally, it returns a boolean indicating this condition, an empty string, and the current state of `s2`.
