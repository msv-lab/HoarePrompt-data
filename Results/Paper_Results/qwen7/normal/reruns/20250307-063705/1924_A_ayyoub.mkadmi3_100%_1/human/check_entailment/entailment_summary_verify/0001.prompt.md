You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

- Program:
t = int(input())
OUT = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k, m) = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    (b, s1, s2) = func_1(s, k, n)
    if not b:
        OUT.append('No')
        i = 97
        while i <= k + 97:
            if chr(i) not in s1:
                break
            i += 1
        be9i = chr(i) * (n - len(s2))
        OUT.append(s2 + be9i)
    else:
        OUT.append('Yes')
for i in OUT:
    print(i)

def func_1(s, k, n):
    s1 = ''
    s2 = ''
    alphabet = {chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}
    for i in s:
        if i in alphabet:
            if len(alphabet) != 1:
                alphabet.remove(i)
            else:
                s2 += i
                alphabet = {chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}
            s1 += i
    r = len(s1) // k
    return (len(s1) >= n * k, s1[r * k:], s2)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` takes a string `s` of length `m`, an integer `k`, and an integer `n` as inputs. It constructs two new strings, `s1` and `s2`, by iterating through each character in `s`. If the character is among the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, it is added to `s1`; under certain conditions, it is also added to `s2`. After processing, it checks if the length of `s1` (which is `m * n`) is at least `n * k`. Finally, it returns a boolean indicating this condition, an empty string, and the current state of `s2`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m` followed by the string `s`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function aims to check if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets can be found as subsequences in `s`.
   - It constructs `s1` by appending characters from `s` that are in the set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - It removes these characters from the set of `k` alphabets.
   - It constructs `s2` by appending the last `n` characters from `s1` after processing the entire string `s`.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic checks if the length of `s1` is at least `n * k`. If it is, it means all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets are subsequences of `s`.
   - If not, it prints "NO" and generates a counterexample string of length `n` that cannot be a subsequence of `s`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the alphabet set becomes empty before the end of the string `s`.
   - It correctly identifies the first character that is not part of the current set of `k` alphabets and uses it to generate a counterexample string.

5. **Output**:
   - The program outputs "YES" or "NO" for each test case.
   - If "NO", it also outputs a counterexample string of length `n`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to check if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets can be found as subsequences in `s`. It also correctly handles the generation of a counterexample string when necessary.

### Correctness:
**True**
