Output State: **`s` is a string of length `m + 1` that must have at least one character, `i` is the next character in the string `s`, `s2` is the concatenation of `s2` and `i`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `s2 += i` appends the character `i` to the string `s2`. The initial state of `s` and `i` remains unchanged, but `s2` is updated to include the character `i`.
