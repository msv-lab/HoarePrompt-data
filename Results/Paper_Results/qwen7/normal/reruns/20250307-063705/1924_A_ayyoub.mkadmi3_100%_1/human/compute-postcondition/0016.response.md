Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the string `s`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each character in the string `s`. The loop continues as long as there are characters left in `s`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `s` is a string of length `m` that must have at least one character.
   - `i` is a character from the alphabet.

4. **Loop Body Effect**: After each iteration, the character `i` is added to `s`, increasing its length by 1.

5. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` is a character from the alphabet and is added to `s`, the length of `s` increases by 1.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `s` will have a length of `m + 1`.
   - The variable `i` will be the next character in the string `s`.

6. **Adjust the States**:
   - The length of `s` increases by 1, so the new length of `s` is `m + 1`.
   - `i` becomes the next character in `s`.

Given this reasoning, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`s` is a string of length `m + 1` that must have at least one character, `i` is the next character in the string `s`**.
