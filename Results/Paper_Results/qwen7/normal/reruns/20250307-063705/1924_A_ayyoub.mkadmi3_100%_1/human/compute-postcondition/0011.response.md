Postcondition: `s` is a string of length `m` that must have at least one character, `i` is a character that belongs to the alphabet. If `alphabet` has more than one character, `i` is removed from `alphabet`. Otherwise, `s2` is a string that starts with the character `i`, and `s` remains a string of length `m` that must have at least one character, with `alphabet` being a set containing characters from 'a' to 'a' + `k` - 1.
