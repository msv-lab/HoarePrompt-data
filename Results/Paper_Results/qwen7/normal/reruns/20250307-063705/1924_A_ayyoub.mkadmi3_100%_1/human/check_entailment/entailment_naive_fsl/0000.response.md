Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to check if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not properly handle the generation and checking of subsequences.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Function `func_1` Logic**: The function `func_1` is supposed to check if all possible strings of length `n` can be found as subsequences in `s`. However, the current implementation does not ensure this. It only checks if the first `r*k` characters of `s1` (which is built by appending characters from `s` that are in the first `k` alphabets) cover enough characters to form `n*k` unique strings, but it does not verify if all such strings are indeed subsequences of `s`.

2. **Subsequence Verification**: The function does not explicitly check if all possible strings of length `n` formed using the first `k` alphabets are subsequences of `s`. Instead, it relies on the length of `s1` being sufficient, which is not a reliable method.

3. **Example Case**: Consider the following input:
   ```
   1
   3 3 10
   aabbccabab
   ```
   The expected output should be "YES" since all possible strings of length 3 using 'a', 'b', and 'c' (i.e., "aaa", "aab", "aac", etc.) should be subsequences of "aabbccabab". However, the current implementation might incorrectly output "NO" because it does not properly verify all subsequences.

To fix this, the program needs to generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets and check if each of these strings is a subsequence of `s`. This would involve a more complex algorithm, possibly using dynamic programming or backtracking to ensure all combinations are checked.
