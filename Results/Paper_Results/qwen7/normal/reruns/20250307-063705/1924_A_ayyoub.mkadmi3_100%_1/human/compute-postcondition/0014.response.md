Postcondition: `s` is a string of length `m` that must have at least one character. If `i` is a character belonging to the alphabet (a set containing characters from 'a' to 'a' + `k` - 1), then `s` remains unchanged or becomes a string of length `m+1` with the additional character `i` appended to it. If `i` does not belong to the alphabet, `s` remains unchanged.
