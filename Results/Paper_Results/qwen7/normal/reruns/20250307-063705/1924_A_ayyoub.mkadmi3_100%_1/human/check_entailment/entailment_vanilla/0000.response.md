### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m` followed by the string `s`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function aims to check if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets can be found as subsequences in `s`.
   - It constructs `s1` by appending characters from `s` that are in the set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - It removes these characters from the set of `k` alphabets.
   - It constructs `s2` by appending the last `n` characters from `s1` after processing the entire string `s`.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic checks if the length of `s1` is at least `n * k`. If it is, it means all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets are subsequences of `s`.
   - If not, it prints "NO" and generates a counterexample string of length `n` that cannot be a subsequence of `s`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the alphabet set becomes empty before the end of the string `s`.
   - It correctly identifies the first character that is not part of the current set of `k` alphabets and uses it to generate a counterexample string.

5. **Output**:
   - The program outputs "YES" or "NO" for each test case.
   - If "NO", it also outputs a counterexample string of length `n`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to check if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets can be found as subsequences in `s`. It also correctly handles the generation of a counterexample string when necessary.

### Correctness:
**True**
