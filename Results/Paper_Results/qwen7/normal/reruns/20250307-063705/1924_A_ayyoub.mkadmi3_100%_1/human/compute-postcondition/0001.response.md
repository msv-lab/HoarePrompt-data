Output State: **`s1` is an empty string, `s` is a string of length `m`, `s2` is an empty string, `k` is an integer between 1 and 26, inclusive, and `n` is an integer between 1 and 26, inclusive.**

Explanation: The code `s2 = ''` initializes `s2` to an empty string. The values of `s1`, `s`, `k`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
