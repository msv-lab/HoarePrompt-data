Output State: **`s` is a string of length `m`, `i` is the next character in the string `s`, `s2` is `s2` plus the character `i`, and `alphabet` remains unchanged unless its length is 1, in which case the character `i` is removed from `alphabet`.**

This means that the string `s2` has had the character `i` appended to it, while the other variables (`s`, `i`, and `alphabet`) retain their previous states, with the exception that if `alphabet` originally had only one character and that character was `i`, then `i` would no longer be in `alphabet`.
