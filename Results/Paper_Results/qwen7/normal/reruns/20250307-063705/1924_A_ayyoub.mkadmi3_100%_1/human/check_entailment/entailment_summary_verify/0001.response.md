### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m` followed by the string `s`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` constructs two new strings, `s1` and `s2`, by iterating through each character in `s`.
   - `s1` is built by appending characters from `s` that are in the set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - `s2` is constructed by appending the last `n` characters from `s1` after processing the entire string `s`.
   - The function checks if the length of `s1` is at least `n * k`. However, the logic for constructing `s1` and `s2` is flawed. Specifically, `s1` is built by removing characters from the set of `k` alphabets, but it does not ensure that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets are covered.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic checks if the length of `s1` is at least `n * k`. If it is, it means all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets are subsequences of `s`.
   - If not, it prints "NO" and generates a counterexample string of length `n` that cannot be a subsequence of `s`.
   - However, the logic for generating the counterexample string is flawed. The program does not ensure that the generated string is a valid string of length `n` that cannot be a subsequence of `s`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the alphabet set becomes empty before the end of the string `s`.
   - It correctly identifies the first character that is not part of the current set of `k` alphabets and uses it to generate a counterexample string. However, this approach does not guarantee that the generated string is a valid counterexample.

5. **Output**:
   - The program outputs "YES" or "NO" for each test case.
   - If "NO", it also outputs a counterexample string of length `n`.

### Analysis of the Original Assessment:
- The original assessment incorrectly concluded that the program correctly implements the logic to check if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets can be found as subsequences in `s`. The main issue lies in the construction of `s1` and the generation of the counterexample string.
- The function `func_1` does not ensure that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets are covered, and the counterexample string generation is flawed.

### Conclusion:
The program has logical flaws in the construction of `s1` and the generation of the counterexample string. Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
