Output State: **`s1` is the concatenation of `s` and `i`, `i` is the next character in the string `s`, `s2` remains unchanged, and `alphabet` remains unchanged unless its length is 1, in which case the character `i` is removed from `alphabet`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `s1 += i` appends the character `i` to the string `s1`. The length of `s` is `m + 1`, and `i` is the next character in the string `s`. If the length of `alphabet` is not 1, `s2` remains unchanged, and `alphabet` also remains unchanged. However, if the length of `alphabet` is 1, the character `i` is removed from `alphabet`.
