Postcondition: **`s` is a string of length `m`, `i` is either no longer in `alphabet` or the next character in `s`, `s2` is either unchanged or `s2` plus the character `i`, and `alphabet` is either unchanged (if its length is 1, `i` is removed) or a set containing characters from 'a' to 'a' + `k-1`.**
