### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m` followed by the string `s`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function constructs `s1` by appending characters from `s` that are in the set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - It removes these characters from the set of `k` alphabets.
   - It constructs `s2` by appending the last `n` characters from `s1` after processing the entire string `s`.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic checks if the length of `s1` is at least `n * k`. If it is, it means all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets are subsequences of `s`.
   - If not, it prints "NO" and generates a counterexample string of length `n` that cannot be a subsequence of `s`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the alphabet set becomes empty before the end of the string `s`.
   - It correctly identifies the first character that is not part of the current set of `k` alphabets and uses it to generate a counterexample string.

5. **Output**:
   - The program outputs "YES" or "NO" for each test case.
   - If "NO", it also outputs a counterexample string of length `n`.

However, there is a critical flaw in the logic of the `func_1` function. Specifically, the function does not correctly handle the case where the string `s` does not contain enough characters to form all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Function `func_1`**:
  - The function iterates through the string `s` and appends characters to `s1` if they are in the set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
  - It then constructs `s2` by taking the last `n` characters from `s1`.
  - The function returns a boolean indicating whether the length of `s1` is at least `n * k`, an empty string, and the current state of `s2`.

- **Issue**:
  - The function `func_1` does not ensure that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets can be found as subsequences in `s`. Instead, it only checks if the last `n` characters of `s1` can form such strings.
  - The function does not account for the fact that `s1` might not contain all necessary characters to form all possible strings of length `n`.

### Example Counterexample:

Consider the following test case:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  3 3 6
  abcabc
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  YES
  ```

- Actual Output:
  ```
  NO
  aa
  ```

In this case, `s1` would be constructed as `"abcabc"`, and `s2` would be `"abc"`. However, the function incorrectly returns `NO` because `s1` does not contain all necessary characters to form all possible strings of length 3 using the first 3 alphabets (`a`, `b`, `c`). The function should check if all possible combinations of length 3 can be formed, not just the last 3 characters.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is inaccurate because the function `func_1` does not correctly implement the logic to check if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets can be found as subsequences in `s`. The function only checks the last `n` characters of `s1`, which is insufficient.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
