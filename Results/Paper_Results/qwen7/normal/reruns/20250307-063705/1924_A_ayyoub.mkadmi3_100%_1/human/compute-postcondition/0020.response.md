Postcondition: `s` is a string of length `m + 1` that must have at least one character, `i` is the next character in the string `s`. If the length of `alphabet` is not 1, then `s2` is the concatenation of `s2` and `i`, and `alphabet` is a set containing characters from 'a' to 'a' + `k` - 1. If the length of `alphabet` is 1, then the character `i` is removed from the `alphabet`.
