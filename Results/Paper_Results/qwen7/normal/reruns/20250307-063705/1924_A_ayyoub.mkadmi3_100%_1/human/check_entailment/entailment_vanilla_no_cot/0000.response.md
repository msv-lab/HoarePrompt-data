Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Logic in `func_1` Function:**
   - The function `func_1` aims to split the string `s` into two parts: `s1` and `s2`. However, its logic is flawed.
   - It removes characters from the `alphabet` set as they appear in `s`, but this approach doesn't ensure that all possible strings of length `n` can be found as subsequences.
   - The condition `if len(alphabet) != 1:` is unnecessary and incorrect because it doesn't help in determining if all possible strings can be found as subsequences.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Test Cases:**
   - The main loop iterates through the test cases and calls `func_1` for each one.
   - If `func_1` returns `False`, it appends 'No' to the `OUT` list and tries to construct a string `be9i` that should not be a subsequence of `s`. However, the logic for constructing `be9i` is flawed and doesn't guarantee that the constructed string is not a subsequence of `s`.

3. **Output Formatting:**
   - The output formatting is not consistent with the problem statement. The program prints 'YES' or 'NO' in all uppercase, which might not be acceptable depending on the problem constraints.

### Corrected Version:

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from itertools import product

t = int(input())
OUT = []

for _ in range(t):
    n, k, m = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    
    # Generate all possible strings of length n using the first k lowercase English alphabets
    possible_strings = [''.join(p) for p in product('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k], repeat=n)]
    
    found_all = True
    for string in possible_strings:
        if not is_subsequence(string, s):
            found_all = False
            break
    
    if found_all:
        OUT.append('YES')
    else:
        OUT.append('NO')
        # Find any string of length n that is not a subsequence of s
        for string in possible_strings:
            if not is_subsequence(string, s):
                OUT.append(string)
                break

def is_subsequence(sub, s):
    it = iter(s)
    return all(char in it for char in sub)

for i in OUT:
    print(i)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Version:

1. **Generate All Possible Strings:**
   - Use `itertools.product` to generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.

2. **Check Subsequences:**
   - For each generated string, check if it is a subsequence of `s` using the `is_subsequence` function.

3. **Output Result:**
   - If all possible strings are found as subsequences, print 'YES'.
   - Otherwise, print 'NO' and any string that is not a subsequence of `s`.

This corrected version ensures that the program correctly checks for all possible strings and handles the output as specified in the problem statement.
