Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a string `s`, an integer `k`, and an integer `n` as inputs.
   - It initializes `s1` and `s2` as empty strings and creates a set `alphabet` containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - It iterates through each character in `s` and checks if the character is in `alphabet`.
     - If the character is in `alphabet`, it is added to both `s1` and `s2`.
     - If the `alphabet` set has more than one character, it removes the character from `alphabet`.
     - If the `alphabet` set has exactly one character, it adds the character to `s2` and resets `alphabet` to its initial state.
   - After the loop, it calculates the length of `s1` and checks if it is at least `n * k`.
   - It returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating whether the length of `s1` is at least `n * k`, an empty string, and the current state of `s2`.

2. **Main Program Analysis**:
   - The main program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m`, and the string `s`.
   - It calls `func_1` with `s`, `k`, and `n`.
   - Based on the result of `func_1`, it appends "Yes" or "No" to the list `OUT`.
   - If the result is "No", it generates a string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence of `s` and appends it to `OUT`.
   - Finally, it prints each element of `OUT`.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly checks if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`.
   - The main program correctly processes each test case and handles the output format as specified.

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the required functionality.

Correctness: **True**
