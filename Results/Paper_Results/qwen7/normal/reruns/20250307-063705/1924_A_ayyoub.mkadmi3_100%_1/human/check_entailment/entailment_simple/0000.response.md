Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `s` (a string), `k` (an integer representing the number of alphabets to consider), and `n` (an integer representing the length of the subsequences to check).
   - It initializes `s1` and `s2` as empty strings and creates a set `alphabet` containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - It iterates through each character in `s` and checks if it belongs to `alphabet`.
     - If it does, it removes the character from `alphabet` if `alphabet` has more than one character. Otherwise, it appends the character to `s2` and resets `alphabet` to its initial state.
     - Regardless of the condition, the character is appended to `s1`.
   - After the loop, it calculates `r` as the integer division of the length of `s1` by `k`.
   - Finally, it returns a tuple containing:
     - A boolean indicating whether the length of `s1` is at least `n * k`.
     - A substring of `s1` starting from index `r * k` to the end.
     - The current state of `s2`.

2. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m`, and the string `s`.
   - It calls `func_1` with these parameters.
   - If `func_1` returns `False`, it appends "No" to the output list `OUT` and constructs a string `be9i` using the first `k` lowercase alphabets, ensuring it does not use characters present in `s1`.
   - If `func_1` returns `True`, it appends "Yes" to `OUT`.
   - Finally, it prints each element in `OUT`.

3. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly checks if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets can be found as subsequences in `s`.
   - The main program logic correctly handles both cases (YES and NO) and prints the required output format.

Based on the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
