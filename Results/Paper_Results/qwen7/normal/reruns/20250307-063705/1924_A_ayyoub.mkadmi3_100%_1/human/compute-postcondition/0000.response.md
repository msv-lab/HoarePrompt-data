Output State: **`s1` is an empty string, `s` is a string of length `m`, where 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 1000 and consists only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `k` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 26.**

The code initializes `s1` as an empty string, but does not modify the values of `s`, `k`, or `n`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
