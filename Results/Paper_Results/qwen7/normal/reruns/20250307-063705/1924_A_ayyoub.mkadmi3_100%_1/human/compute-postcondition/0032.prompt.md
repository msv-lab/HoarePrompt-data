Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `s1` is an empty string, `s` is a string of length `m`, `s2` is an empty string, `k` is an integer between 1 and 26, `n` is an integer between 1 and 26, and `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase letters starting from 'a'.
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    if i in alphabet:
        if len(alphabet) != 1:
            alphabet.remove(i)
        else:
            s2 += i
            alphabet = {chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}
        s1 += i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `s` is a string of length `m` that must have at least one character. If `i` is a character belonging to the alphabet, `s` is extended by one character `i` to become a string of length `m+1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `s` is a string of length `m + 1` that must have at least one character, `i` is the next character in the string `s`, `s2` remains unchanged, and `alphabet` remains unchanged unless its length is 1, in which case the character `i` is removed from `alphabet`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `s` is a string of length `m+1`, `s1` is `s` concatenated with `i`, `s2` is either unchanged or `s2` plus the character `i`, and `alphabet` is either unchanged (if its length is 1, `i` is removed) or a set containing characters from 'a' to 'a' + `k-1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
