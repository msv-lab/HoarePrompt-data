Output State: **`L` is 51, `R` is 76, `x` is 76, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is `dfs(1, 1)`**

Explanation: The code snippet `R = x` updates the value of `R` to be equal to the current value of `x`, which is 76. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `L` is still 51, `R` is now 76, `x` is 76, `numCuts` is still 0, and `leftover` retains its initial value of `dfs(1, 1)`.
