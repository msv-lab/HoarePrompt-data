Output State: The loop will have executed `n-1` times. For each iteration, two integers `a` and `b` are read from input, and both `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` will contain each other as elements (i.e., `a` will be in `adj[b]` and `b` will be in `adj[a]`). The variable `i` will be equal to `n-1`, and `n` remains unchanged from its initial value. The variable `k` also remains unchanged from its initial value.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the adjacency list `adj` will represent an undirected graph where each pair of vertices `(a, b)` will be connected, and `i` will be `n-1`.
