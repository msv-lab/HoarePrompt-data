Output State: **`i` is 0; `n` must be greater than 1; `a` is the first integer input; `b` is the second integer input; `adj[b]` now contains `[a]`.**

Explanation: The code `adj[b].append(a)` appends the value of `a` to the list `adj[b]`. Initially, `adj[b]` contains only `a`, so after executing the code, `adj[b]` will contain `[a]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
