Output State: **`L` is 100, `R` is 101, `x` is 100, `numCuts` is 0, `z` is 4, `t` must be greater than 4, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**

The code reads two integers from standard input using `sys.stdin.readline().split()` and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. Since the initial values of `L`, `R`, `x`, `numCuts`, `z`, and `t` are not modified by this operation, they remain unchanged. The values of `n` and `k` are set to the integers read from the input, but their specific values are not known.
