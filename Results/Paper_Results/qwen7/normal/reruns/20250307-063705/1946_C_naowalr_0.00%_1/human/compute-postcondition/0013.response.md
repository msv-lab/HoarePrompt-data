Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` is an integer equal to the first number input.
   - `b` is an integer equal to the second number input.
   - `adj[b]` now contains the integer `a` appended as a list element.
   - `i` is `k + 1`.
   - `n` is the same as before.

3. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute again**:
   - The loop condition is `i in range(n - 1)`, which means `i` must be less than `n - 1`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` was `k + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `k + 2`.
   - `n` remains the same as before.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `a` remains unchanged.
   - `b` remains unchanged.
   - `adj[b]` remains unchanged.
   - `i` is now `k + 2`.
   - `n` remains the same as before.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`a` is an integer equal to the first number input, `b` is an integer equal to the second number input, `adj[b]` now contains the integer `a` appended as a list element, `i` is `k + 2`, `n` is the same as before**
