Output State: **`a` is an integer equal to the first number input, `b` is an integer equal to the second number input, `adj[b]` now contains the first number input, `i` is `k + 1`, `n` is the same as before**.

Explanation: The code `a, b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))` reads two integers from the standard input, splits them, and converts them to integers. These integers are then assigned to `a` and `b`. The value of `adj[b]` is updated to contain the value of `a`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.
