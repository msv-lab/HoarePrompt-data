Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is the integer input converted to int, `b` is the second integer input converted to int, `adj[a]` contains `[a, b]`**

Explanation: The code `adj[a].append(b)` appends the value of `b` to the list `adj[a]`. Initially, `adj[b]` contains `[a]`, so after executing the code, `adj[a]` will now contain both `a` and `b`. All other variables remain unchanged.
