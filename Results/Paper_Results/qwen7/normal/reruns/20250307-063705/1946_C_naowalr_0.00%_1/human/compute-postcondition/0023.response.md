Output State: **`i` is equal to `k + (n - 1)`, `n` is the same as before, `L` is 1, `adj` is a list of lists where `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` each contain both `a` and `b` as elements, indicating an undirected edge between nodes `a` and `b`, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is 50001**.

Explanation: The code calculates the value of `x` as the integer division of the sum of `L` and `R` by 2. Given that `L` is 1 and `R` is 100001, `(L + R)` equals `100002`. Dividing `100002` by `2` results in `50001`. No other variables are affected, so their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
