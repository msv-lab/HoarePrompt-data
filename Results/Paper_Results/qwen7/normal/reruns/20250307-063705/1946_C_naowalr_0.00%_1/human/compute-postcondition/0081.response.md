Postcondition: `L` is 51, `i` is equal to `k + (n - 1)`, `R` is 101, `x` is 51, `numCuts` is greater than `k` or (`numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`). If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or (`numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`), `L` remains 51. Otherwise, `L` is 1, `i` is `k + (n - 1)`, `R` is 51, `x` is 51, `numCuts` is 0, and `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`.
