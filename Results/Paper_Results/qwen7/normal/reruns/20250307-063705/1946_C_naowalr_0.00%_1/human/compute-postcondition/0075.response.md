Output State: **`L` is 1, `i` is equal to `k + (n - 1)`, `R` is 101, `x` is 51, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of dfs(1, 1)**

Explanation: The function `dfs(1, 1)` is called, and its result is stored in the variable `leftover`. The values of `L`, `i`, `R`, `x`, and `numCuts` remain unchanged from their initial states.
