Postcondition: **`i` is equal to `k + (n - 1)`, `n` is the same as before, `L` is either 50001 or 1, `adj` is a list of lists, `R` is either 100001 or 50001, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is 50001, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs` function call `dfs(1, 1)`**.

This postcondition describes the state of the program variables after the execution of the if-else block. Depending on whether the condition `numCuts > k` or `(numCuts == k and leftover >= x)` is true, `L` will be set to either 50001 or 1, and `R` will be set to either 100001 or 50001. All other variables retain their initial values from the precondition.
