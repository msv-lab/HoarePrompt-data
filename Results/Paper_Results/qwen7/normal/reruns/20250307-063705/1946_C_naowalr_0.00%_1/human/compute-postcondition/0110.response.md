Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is the integer input converted to int, `b` is the second integer input converted to int, `adj[b]` contains `[b, a]`**

Explanation: The code `adj[b].append(a)` appends the value of `a` to the list `adj[b]`. Initially, `adj[a]` contains `[a, b]`, which means `a` and `b` are connected nodes. After executing the code, the adjacency list for node `b` will now include both `a` and `b` itself, making `adj[b]` contain `[b, a]`. The values of `i`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
