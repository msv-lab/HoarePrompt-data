Output State: **`L` is a variable, `R` is updated to the value of `x`, `x` is the integer division of (`L` + `R`) by 2, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`**.

This means that the value of `R` has been updated to the value of `x`, which is the integer division of (`L` + `R`) by 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
