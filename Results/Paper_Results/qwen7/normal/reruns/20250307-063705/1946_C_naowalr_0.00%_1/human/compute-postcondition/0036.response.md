Output State: **`i` is equal to `k + (n - 1)`, `n` is the same as before, `L` is either 50001 or 1, `adj` is a list of lists where `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` each contain both `a` and `b` as elements, indicating an undirected edge between nodes `a` and `b`, `R` must be 100001 when `L` is 50001, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is 50051, `leftover` is the result of the dfs function call `dfs(1, 1)`**

Explanation: The code assigns the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call to the variable `leftover`. Since the initial state does not specify the exact value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`, `leftover` is simply set to the result of that function call. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
