Output State: **`L` is 1, `i` is equal to `k + (n - 1)`, `R` is 101, `x` is 51.**

Explanation: The variable `x` is assigned the value of `(L + R) // 2`. Given that `L` is 1 and `R` is 101, the calculation for `x` is `(1 + 101) // 2`, which equals 51. The values of `L`, `i`, and `R` remain unchanged.
