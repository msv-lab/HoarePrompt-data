Output State: **`i` is equal to `k + (n - 1)`, `n` is the same as before, `L` is 50001, `adj` is a list of lists, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is 50001, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs` function call `dfs(1, 1)`**

Explanation: The code `L = x` updates the value of `L` to be the same as the value of `x`, which is 50001. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
