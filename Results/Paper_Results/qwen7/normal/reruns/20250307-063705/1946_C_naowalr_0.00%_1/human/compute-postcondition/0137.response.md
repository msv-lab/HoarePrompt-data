Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `R` is increased or `L` is decreased to ensure `R - L > 1`; `x` is equal to (`L` + `R`) // 2.**

Explanation: The variable `numCuts` is assigned the value 0. The conditions for `R` and `L` remain unchanged, meaning `R` is still increased or `L` is decreased to ensure `R - L > 1`. The value of `x` is still calculated as the integer division of the sum of `L` and `R` by 2.
