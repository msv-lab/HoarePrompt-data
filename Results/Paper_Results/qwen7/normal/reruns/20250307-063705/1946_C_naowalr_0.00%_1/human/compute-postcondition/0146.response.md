Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing through an adjacency list `adj` containing information about a tree structure with `n` vertices, where `t` test cases are considered. For each test case, it checks if a path exists between two vertices `n` and `k` within the tree. It returns either "Path Exists" or "Path Does Not Exist" based on the connectivity of the vertices in the given tree structure.**

Note: The actual implementation details such as how the function processes the adjacency list and determines the path are not described here; only the input parameters' constraints and the expected output are detailed.
