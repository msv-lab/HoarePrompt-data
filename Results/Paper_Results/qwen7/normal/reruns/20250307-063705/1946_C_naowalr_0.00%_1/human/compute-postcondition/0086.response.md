Output State: **`L` is 51, `R` is 101, `x` is 76, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is `dfs(1, 1)`**

Explanation: The code assigns the result of the function call `dfs(1, 1)` to the variable `leftover`. Since the function `dfs` is not defined in the given context, we cannot determine the exact value of `leftover`. However, we know that `leftover` now holds the result of this function call. The other variables (`L`, `R`, `x`, and `numCuts`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
