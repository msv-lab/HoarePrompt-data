Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(n - 1):`.
   - The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of These Variables:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0 (this is not directly relevant to the loop head).
   - `n` is an integer obtained from the first space-separated value in input.
   - `k` is an integer obtained from the second space-separated value in input (this is not directly relevant to the loop head).
   - `adj` is a list of lists with length `n + 1` (this is not directly relevant to the loop head).

3. **Check the Condition for the Loop to Execute:**
   - The loop `for i in range(n - 1)` will execute as long as `n - 1` is a non-negative integer.
   - For the loop to start, `n - 1` must be at least 0, which means `n` must be at least 1.

4. **Adjust the State:**
   - We need to ensure that `n` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.
   - The variable `i` will start at 0 and increment by 1 in each iteration, but its initial value is not relevant for the loop condition.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.

**State:**
**`n` must be greater than or equal to 1**
