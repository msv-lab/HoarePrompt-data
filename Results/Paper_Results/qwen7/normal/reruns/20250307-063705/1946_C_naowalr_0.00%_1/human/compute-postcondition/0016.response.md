Output State: **`a` is an integer equal to the first number input, `b` is an integer equal to the second number input, `adj[a]` now contains the list `[a, b]`, `adj[b]` now contains the list `[b, a]`, `i` is `k + 2`, `n` is the same as before**

Explanation: The code appends `a` to the list `adj[b]`. Initially, `adj[b]` contains `[b]`. After executing the code, `adj[b]` will contain both `b` and `a`, making it `[b, a]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
