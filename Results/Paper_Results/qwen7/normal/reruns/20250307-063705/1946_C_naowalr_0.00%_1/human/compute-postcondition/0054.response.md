Output State: **`a` is an integer from the first split input, `b` is an integer from the second split input**.

This means that the code reads two integers from the standard input, splits them, and assigns them to variables `a` and `b`. The exact values of `a` and `b` depend on the input provided, but they are guaranteed to be integers. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
