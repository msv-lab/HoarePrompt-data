Output State: **`i` is equal to `k + (n - 1)`, `n` is 50051, `L` is 50051, `adj` is a list of lists where `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` each contain both `a` and `b` as elements, indicating an undirected edge between nodes `a` and `b`, `R` must be 100001 when `L` is 50001, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is 50051, `leftover` is the result of the dfs function call `dfs(1, 1)`**

Explanation: The code `L = x` updates the value of `L` to be the same as `x`. Given that `x` was previously 50051, `L` is now also 50051. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
