Output State: **`a` is an integer from the first split input, `b` is an integer from the second split input, `adj[a]` now includes `b`.**

Explanation: The code `adj[a].append(b)` appends the value of `b` to the list `adj[a]`. Since `a` and `b` are integers from the first and second split inputs respectively, after executing this line, `adj[a]` will contain `b` in addition to any other elements it may have had before.
