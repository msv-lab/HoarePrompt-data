Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `n` is an integer obtained from the first space-separated value in input; `k` is an integer obtained from the second space-separated value in input.**

The code reads two integers from standard input (using `sys.stdin.readline().split()`) and splits them into a list, which is then unpacked into the variables `n` and `k`. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged.
