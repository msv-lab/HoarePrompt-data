Output State: **`R` is 100001, `i` is `n-2`, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` and `b` are integers read from standard input, `adj[b]` contains a list of all integers `a` that `b` is connected to, with each `a` appearing as many times as it was paired with `b` in the inputs, `L` is 1, `numCuts` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `numCuts` to 0. No other variables are affected, so their states remain as described in the initial state.
