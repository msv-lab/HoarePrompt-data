Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is the first integer input converted to int, `b` is the second integer input converted to int, `adj[b]` contains `[b, a, a]`**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `a` to the list `adj[b]`. Initially, `adj[b]` contains `[b, a]`. After appending `a` again, `adj[b]` now contains `[b, a, a]`. The values of `i`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
