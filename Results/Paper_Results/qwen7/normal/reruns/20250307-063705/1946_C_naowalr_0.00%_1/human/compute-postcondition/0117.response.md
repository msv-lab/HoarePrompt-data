Output State: **`R` is 100001, `i` will be equal to `n-2`, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` and `b` will be integers read from standard input, `adj[b]` will contain a list of all integers `a` that `b` is connected to, with each `a` appearing as many times as it was paired with `b` in the inputs, `L` is 1.**

Explanation: The line `R = int(100000.0 + 1)` assigns the value `100001` to the variable `R`. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `adj`, and `L`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
