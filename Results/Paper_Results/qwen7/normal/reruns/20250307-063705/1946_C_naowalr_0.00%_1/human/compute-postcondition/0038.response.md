Output State: **`i` is equal to `k + (n - 1)`, `n` is the same as before, `L` is either 50001 or 1, `adj` is a list of lists where `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` each contain both `a` and `b` as elements, indicating an undirected edge between nodes `a` and `b`, `R` is 50051, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is 50051, `leftover` is the result of the dfs function call `dfs(1, 1)`**.

Explanation: The code `R = x` assigns the value of `x` (which is 50051) to `R`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
