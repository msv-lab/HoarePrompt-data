Output State: **`a` is an integer equal to the first number input, `b` is an integer equal to the second number input, `adj[b]` now contains the integer `a`, `i` is `k + 1`, `n` is the same as before**.

Explanation: The code `adj[a].append(b)` appends the value of `b` to the list `adj[b]`. Initially, `adj[b]` contains the value of `a`. After executing the code, `adj[b]` will contain both the original value of `a` and the new value of `b`. All other variables remain unchanged.
