Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the constant `n-1`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n-1`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `a` is an integer from the first split input.
   - `b` is an integer from the second split input.
   - `adj[a]` now includes `b`.
   - `adj[b]` now includes `a`.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, let's assume `i` was some value `k` such that `k < n-1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `k+1`.
   - Since `i` was `k` and `k < n-1`, it follows that `k+1 < n-1 + 1 = n`, so `k+1 < n-1` is still true.

5. **Update the State**:
   - `a` remains unchanged.
   - `b` remains unchanged.
   - `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` remain unchanged because the loop body is omitted and no additional changes are made to these lists.

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`a` is an integer from the first split input, `b` is an integer from the second split input, `adj[a]` now includes `b`, and `adj[b]` now includes `a`, `i` is `k+1` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, and `i` must be less than `n-1`**.
