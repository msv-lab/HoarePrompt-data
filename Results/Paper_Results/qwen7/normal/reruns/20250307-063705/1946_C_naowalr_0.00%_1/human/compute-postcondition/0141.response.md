Postcondition: **`numCuts` is 0, `R` is increased or `L` is decreased to ensure `R - L > 1`, `x` is equal to (`L` + `R`) // 2, `L` is equal to `x` if `numCuts > k` or (`numCuts == k` and `leftover >= x`), otherwise `R` is equal to `x` and `L` is decreased to ensure `R - L > 1`, `leftover` is the return value of `dfs(1, 1)`**.
