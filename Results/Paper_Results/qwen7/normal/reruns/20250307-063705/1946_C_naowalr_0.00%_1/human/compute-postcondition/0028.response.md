Postcondition: `i` is equal to `k + (n - 1)`, `n` is the same as before, `L` is 1, `adj` is a list of lists where `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` each contain both `a` and `b` as elements, indicating an undirected edge between nodes `a` and `b`, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is 50001, `leftover` is the result of the dfs function call `dfs(1, 1)`, `numCuts` is less than or equal to `k` or (`numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is less than `x`).
