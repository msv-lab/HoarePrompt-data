Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `R - L > 1`.
2. **Current States at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `L` is 76
   - `R` is 101
   - `x` is 76
   - `numCuts` is 0
   - `leftover` is `dfs(1, 1)`

3. **Check Loop Condition**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `R - L = 101 - 76 = 25`, which is greater than 1. Therefore, the loop can execute again.

4. **Variables in the Loop Head**:
   - The only variables in the loop head are `L` and `R`.

5. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since the loop can definitely execute one more time, we don't need to change the values of `L` and `R` explicitly. However, we need to ensure that the loop condition remains true for the next iteration.
   - After the loop body, `L` and `R` will be updated such that `R - L > 1` still holds true.

### Conclusion:

Since the loop can certainly execute one more time, no adjustments are necessary for the states of `L` and `R`. We just need to ensure that the loop condition remains valid.

**State:**
State: **`L` is 76, `R` is 101, `x` is 76, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is `dfs(1, 1)`**
