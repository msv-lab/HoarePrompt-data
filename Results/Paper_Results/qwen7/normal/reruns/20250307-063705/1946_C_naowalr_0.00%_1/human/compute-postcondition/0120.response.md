Output State: **`R` is 100001, `i` is `n-2`, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` and `b` are integers read from standard input, `adj[b]` contains a list of all integers `a` that `b` is connected to, with each `a` appearing as many times as it was paired with `b` in the inputs, `L` is 1, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is 50001**.

Explanation: The variable `x` is assigned the value of `(L + R) // 2`, which calculates the integer division of the sum of `L` and `R` by 2. Given that `L` is 1 and `R` is 100001, the value of `x` is `(1 + 100001) // 2 = 100002 // 2 = 50001`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
