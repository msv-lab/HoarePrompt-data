Output State: `L` is 100, `R` is 101, `x` is 100, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`.

Explanation: Given the loop continues as long as `R - L > 1`, and the final output state after three iterations shows that `L` is incrementally increasing towards 100 while `R` remains at 101. This indicates that the loop has narrowed down the range to just above 100. After the fourth iteration, the condition `R - L <= 1` will be met, ending the loop. At this point, `L` would be set to 100, and `R` would still be 101, with `x` being the integer division of `L + R` by 2, which is 100. The values of `numCuts` and `leftover` remain unchanged from the last iteration since they are not modified within the loop body once the loop ends.
