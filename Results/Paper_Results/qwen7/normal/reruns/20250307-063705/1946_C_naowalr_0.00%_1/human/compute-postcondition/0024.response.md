Output State: **`i` is equal to `k + (n - 1)`, `n` is the same as before, `L` is 1, `adj` is a list of lists where `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` each contain both `a` and `b` as elements, indicating an undirected edge between nodes `a` and `b`, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is 50001**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the value `0` to the variable `numCuts`. Since `numCuts` was already `0` in the initial state, its value does not change. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
