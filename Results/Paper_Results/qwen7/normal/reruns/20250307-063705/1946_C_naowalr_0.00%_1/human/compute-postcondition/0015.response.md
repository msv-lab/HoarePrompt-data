Output State: **`a` is an integer equal to the first number input, `b` is an integer equal to the second number input, `adj[a]` now contains the list `[a, b]`, `i` is `k + 2`, `n` is the same as before**.

Explanation: The code `adj[a].append(b)` appends the value of `b` to the list `adj[a]`. Initially, `adj[b]` contains the list `[a]`. After executing the code, `adj[a]` will contain both `a` and `b`, making it `[a, b]`. The values of `i`, `n`, and the other variables remain unchanged.
