Output State: All integers from 1 to n are connected through the adjacency list `adj`. Specifically, each node `i` (where `1 ≤ i ≤ n`) will have a list `adj[i]` that contains all other nodes from 1 to n exactly once. This means that there will be a complete graph formed with `n` vertices, where each vertex is connected to every other vertex exactly once. The variable `i` will be equal to `k + (n - 1)` after all iterations of the loop have finished, and it will be less than `n - 1` if `n > 2`. However, since the loop runs `n - 1` times, `i` will eventually reach `n - 1` and the condition `i < n - 1` will no longer hold true, effectively ending the loop. Variables `a` and `b` will contain the last pair of integers read from the input during the final iteration of the loop.
