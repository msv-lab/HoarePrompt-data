Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `R` is increased or `L` is decreased to ensure `R - L > 1`, `x` is equal to (`L` + `R`) // 2, `L` is equal to `x`, `leftover` is the return value of `dfs(1, 1)`**

Explanation: The code `L = x` assigns the value of `x` to `L`. The value of `x` is defined as (`L` + `R`) // 2. After executing this line, `L` is updated to this value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
