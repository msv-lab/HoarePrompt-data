Output State: `i` is equal to `k + (n - 1)`, `n` is the same as before, `L` is 50001, `adj` is a list of lists where `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` each contain both `a` and `b` as elements, indicating an undirected edge between nodes `a` and `b`, `R` is 50001, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is 50001, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs` function call `dfs(1, 1)`.

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, the condition `R - L > 1` will no longer be satisfied, meaning the loop will terminate. The final values of `L` and `R` will converge to the same value, which from the pattern observed is 50001. Since `numCuts` remains 0 throughout the iterations and does not meet the condition to change, it stays at 0. The variable `x` will also be 50001 as it is recalculated in each iteration but does not change the outcome. The `dfs` function call `dfs(1, 1)` will yield the same result for `leftover` as it is not affected by the loop. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `adj`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
