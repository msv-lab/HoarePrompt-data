Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n - 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `k + 1` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration.
   - Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n - 1`.

3. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `i` was `k + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `k + 2`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.

Given these points, we can conclude the following:

- `a` and `b` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.
- `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.
- `i` is incremented by 1, so it becomes `k + 2`.
- `i` must still be less than `n - 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: `a` is the integer from the first split input, `b` is the integer from the second split input, `adj[a]` now includes `b` and already had `b` before this operation (since `adj[b]` also includes `a`), `adj[b]` now includes `a` and already had `a` before this operation (since `adj[a]` also includes `a`), `i` is `k + 2`, and `i` must be less than `n - 1`**.
