Output State: **`a` is an integer equal to the first number input, `b` is an integer equal to the second number input, `adj[a]` now contains `b`.**

Explanation: The code `adj[a].append(b)` appends the value of `b` to the list `adj[a]`. Since `a` and `b` are integers equal to the first and second number inputs respectively, after executing the code, `adj[a]` will contain `b`. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged.
