Output State: **`a` is an integer from the first split input, `b` is an integer from the second split input, `adj[a]` now includes `b`, and `adj[b]` now includes `a`.**

Explanation: The code appends `a` to `adj[b]` and `b` to `adj[a]`. This means that both adjacency lists `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` now include each other. The initial values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged.
