Output State: **`a` is the integer from the first split input, `b` is the integer from the second split input, `adj[a]` now includes `b` and already had `b` before this operation (since `adj[b]` also includes `a`), `adj[b]` now includes `a` and already had `a` before this operation (since `adj[a]` also includes `a`), `i` is `k + 2` and `i` must be less than `n - 1`**.

Explanation: The code `adj[a].append(b)` appends `b` to the list `adj[a]`. Since `adj[b]` already includes `a`, this operation does not change the fact that both adjacency lists include each other. The values of `a`, `b`, `adj[a]`, `adj[b]`, `i`, `k`, and `n` remain unchanged except for the addition of `b` to `adj[a]`.
