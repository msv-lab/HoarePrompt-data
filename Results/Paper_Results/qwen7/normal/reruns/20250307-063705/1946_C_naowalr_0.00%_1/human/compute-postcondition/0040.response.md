Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `R - L > 1`.
2. **Current values of `R` and `L`**:
   - `L` is either 50001 or 1.
   - `R` is 50051 if `numCuts` is greater than `k` or if `numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`, otherwise `R` is 100001.

Given the current state:
- `numCuts` is 0.
- `x` is 50051.
- `leftover` is the result of the `dfs` function call `dfs(1, 1)`.

We need to determine the value of `R` based on the given conditions:
- Since `numCuts` is 0, it is not greater than `k`.
- Therefore, `R` must be 100001 because `numCuts` is not greater than `k`.

So, the current values are:
- `L` is either 50001 or 1.
- `R` is 100001.

For the loop to continue (`R - L > 1`), `L` must be 1 (since if `L` were 50001, `R - L` would be 99999, which is greater than 1, but the loop would still terminate since `R` is 100001).

Therefore, we need to adjust `L` to be 1.

**State:**
- `i` is equal to `k + (n - 1)`.
- `n` is the same as before.
- `L` must be 1.
- `adj` is a list of lists where `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` each contain both `a` and `b` as elements, indicating an undirected edge between nodes `a` and `b`.
- `R` is 100001.
- `numCuts` is 0.
- `x` is 50051.
- `leftover` is the result of the `dfs` function call `dfs(1, 1)`.

State: **`i` is equal to `k + (n - 1)`, `n` is the same as before, `L` must be 1, `adj` is a list of lists where `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` each contain both `a` and `b` as elements, indicating an undirected edge between nodes `a` and `b`, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is 50051, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs` function call `dfs(1, 1)`**
