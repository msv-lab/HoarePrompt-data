Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies `i` and `n`. Therefore, the only variables that can be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than 1
   - `a` is the integer input converted to int
   - `b` is the second integer input converted to int
   - `adj[b]` contains `[b, a]`

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n - 1`.
   - Since `i` is currently 1, it needs to be incremented to 2.
   - `n` must still be greater than 1.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` should be updated to 2.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it must still be greater than 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is the integer input converted to int, `b` is the second integer input converted to int, `adj[b]` contains `[b, a]`**
