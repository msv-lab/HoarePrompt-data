Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n - 1)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `a` is an integer equal to the first number input.
   - `b` is an integer equal to the second number input.
   - `adj[b]` now contains `a`.

3. **Determine the Conditions for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n - 1`.
   - After each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, if `i` was previously `k`, it will be `k + 1` in the next iteration.
   - Therefore, `i` will be `k + 1` in the next iteration.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.

5. **New State**:
   - `a` remains the same as it is not involved in the loop.
   - `b` remains the same as it is not involved in the loop.
   - `adj[b]` remains the same as it is not involved in the loop.
   - `i` will be `k + 1`.
   - `n` remains the same.

Given that `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, the new state for the next iteration will be:

State: **`a` is an integer equal to the first number input, `b` is an integer equal to the second number input, `adj[b]` now contains `a`, `i` is `k + 1`, `n` is the same as before**.

Since the exact value of `n` is not specified in the previous state, we can denote it as `n` (unchanged).

Final State: **`a` is an integer equal to the first number input, `b` is an integer equal to the second number input, `adj[b]` now contains `a`, `i` is `k + 1`, `n` is the same as before**.
