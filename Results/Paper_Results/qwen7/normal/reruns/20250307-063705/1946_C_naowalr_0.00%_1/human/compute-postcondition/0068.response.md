Output State: The graph represented by the adjacency list `adj` will be fully constructed with all `n-1` edges added according to the inputs provided. Specifically, for each edge `(a, b)` read from the input, both `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` will contain each other exactly once. The variable `i` will be equal to `k + (n - 1)`, which means the loop will have executed `n-1` times, adding all required edges. All other variables (`a`, `b`, `leftover`, `numCuts`, `x`, `L`, `R`) will retain their values from the last iteration of the loop, as they are not modified within the loop body.
