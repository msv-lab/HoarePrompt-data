Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is the first integer input converted to int, `b` is the second integer input converted to int, `adj[b]` contains `[b, a]`**.

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the standard input using `sys.stdin.readline().split()` and then converts them to integers using `map(int, ...)`. These integers are then assigned to `a` and `b`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged, and the condition that `n` must be greater than 1 still holds. The list `adj[b]` is updated to include `[b, a]`.
