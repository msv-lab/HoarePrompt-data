Output State: **`R` is 100001, `L` is 50001, `x` is 75001, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of dfs(1, 1)**

Explanation: The function `dfs(1, 1)` is called, and its result is assigned to the variable `leftover`. The values of `R`, `L`, `x`, and `numCuts` remain unchanged from their initial states. The exact value of `leftover` depends on the implementation of the `dfs` function, but it is known that `leftover` now holds the result of the function call.
