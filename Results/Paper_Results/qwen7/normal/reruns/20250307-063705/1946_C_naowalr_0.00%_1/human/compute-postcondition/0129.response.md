Output State: **`R` is 100001, `L` is 50001, `x` is 75001**

Explanation: The code calculates the value of `x` as the integer division of `(L + R)` by 2. Given that `L` is 50001 and `R` is 100001, the value of `x` is `(50001 + 100001) // 2`, which equals `75001`. The values of `R` and `L` remain unchanged.
