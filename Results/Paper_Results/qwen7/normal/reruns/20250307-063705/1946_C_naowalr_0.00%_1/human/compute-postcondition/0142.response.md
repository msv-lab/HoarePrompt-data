Output State: `R` is 50001, `i` is `n-2`, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` and `b` are integers read from standard input, `adj[b]` contains a list of all integers `a` that `b` is connected to, with each `a` appearing as many times as it was paired with `b` in the inputs, `L` is 50001, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is 50001, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the condition `R - L > 1` will no longer hold true, meaning the loop will terminate. The final values of `R` and `L` will converge such that `R - L` is no longer greater than 1. Given the pattern of halving the range in each iteration, the midpoint `x` will eventually settle between `L` and `R`. In this case, since `L` and `R` are initially set to 100001 and 50001 respectively, and considering the nature of the binary search, they will converge to the same value, which is 50001. Therefore, both `R` and `L` will be 50001 at the end of the loop. The variable `x` will also be 50001, and `numCuts` and `leftover` will retain their last computed values from the final iteration of the loop.
