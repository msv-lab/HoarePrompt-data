Output State: **`L` is 1, `i` is equal to `k + (n - 1)`, `R` is 101, `x` is 51, `numCuts` is 0**.

Explanation: The line `numCuts = 0` initializes the variable `numCuts` to 0. No other changes are made to the existing variables `L`, `i`, `R`, and `x`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial values.
