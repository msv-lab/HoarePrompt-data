Output State: **`i` is equal to `k + (n - 1)`, `n` is the same as before, `L` is 1, `adj` is a list of lists, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is 50001, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs` function call `dfs(1, 1)`**

Explanation: The line `leftover = dfs(1, 1)` assigns the result of the `dfs` function call with arguments `1` and `1` to the variable `leftover`. Since the exact value returned by the `dfs` function is not specified, we keep it as the result of the `dfs` function call. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
