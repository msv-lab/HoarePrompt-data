Output State: **`a` is the integer from the first split input, `b` is the integer from the second split input, `adj[a]` now includes `b` and already had `b` before this operation (since `adj[b]` also includes `a`), `adj[b]` now includes `a` and already had `a` before this operation (since `adj[a]` also includes `b`), `i` is `k+1` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, and `i` must be less than `n-1`**.

This means that the list `adj[a]` now contains both `a` and `b`, and similarly, the list `adj[b]` now contains both `b` and `a`. The value of `i` is updated to `k+1`, where `k` was the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, and `i` is still less than `n-1`.
