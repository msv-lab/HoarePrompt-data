Output State: **`R` is increased or `L` is decreased to ensure `R - L > 1`; `x` is equal to (`L` + `R`) // 2.**

Explanation: The variable `x` is assigned the value of `(L + R) // 2`, which is the integer division of the sum of `L` and `R` by 2. The conditions for `R` and `L` to ensure `R - L > 1` remain unchanged.
