Output State: **`i` is equal to `k + (n - 1)`, `n` is the same as before, `L` is 1, `adj` is a list of lists where `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` each contain both `a` and `b` as elements, indicating an undirected edge between nodes `a` and `b`, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is 50001, `leftover` is the result of the dfs function call `dfs(1, 1)`**.

This means that after calling the `dfs` function with arguments `1` and `1`, the variable `leftover` now holds the return value from that function call, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
