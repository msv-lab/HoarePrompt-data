Output State: **`i` is equal to `k + (n - 1)`, `n` is the same as before, `L` is 1, `adj` is a list of lists where `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` each contain both `a` and `b` as elements, indicating an undirected edge between nodes `a` and `b`, `R` is 100001.**

Explanation: The code initializes `R` as an integer value calculated from `100000.0 + 1`. Since `R` is now explicitly set to `100001`, all other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
