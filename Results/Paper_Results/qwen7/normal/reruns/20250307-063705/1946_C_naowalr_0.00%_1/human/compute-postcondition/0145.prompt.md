Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and we read the first line from stdin to set the value of `t`.
Code of the loop:
for z in range(t):
    n, k = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))
    adj = [[] for i in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(n - 1):
        a, b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))
        adj[a].append(b)
        adj[b].append(a)
    L = 1
    R = int(100000.0 + 1)
    numCuts = 0
    while R - L > 1:
        x = (L + R) // 2
        numCuts = 0
        leftover = dfs(1, 1)
        if numCuts > k or numCuts == k and leftover >= x:
            L = x
        else:
            R = x
    print(L)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `i` is equal to `k + (n - 1)`, `n` is the same as before, `L` is 50001, `adj` is a list of lists where `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` each contain both `a` and `b` as elements, indicating an undirected edge between nodes `a` and `b`, `R` is 50001, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is 50001, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs` function call `dfs(1, 1)`.

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, the condition `R - L > 1` will no longer be satisfied, meaning the loop will terminate. The final values of `L` and `R` will converge to the same value, which from the pattern observed is 50001. Since `numCuts` remains 0 throughout the iterations and does not meet the condition to change, it stays at 0. The variable `x` will also be 50001 as it is recalculated in each iteration but does not change the outcome. The `dfs` function call `dfs(1, 1)` will yield the same result for `leftover` as it is not affected by the loop. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `adj`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `L` is 100, `R` is 101, `x` is 100, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`.

Explanation: Given the loop continues as long as `R - L > 1`, and the final output state after three iterations shows that `L` is incrementally increasing towards 100 while `R` remains at 101. This indicates that the loop has narrowed down the range to just above 100. After the fourth iteration, the condition `R - L <= 1` will be met, ending the loop. At this point, `L` would be set to 100, and `R` would still be 101, with `x` being the integer division of `L + R` by 2, which is 100. The values of `numCuts` and `leftover` remain unchanged from the last iteration since they are not modified within the loop body once the loop ends.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `R` is 50001, `i` is `n-2`, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` and `b` are integers read from standard input, `adj[b]` contains a list of all integers `a` that `b` is connected to, with each `a` appearing as many times as it was paired with `b` in the inputs, `L` is 75001, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is 62501, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the binary search process will converge such that `R - L` is no longer greater than 1. Given the pattern of how `L` and `R` are adjusted, they will stabilize around the midpoint of their initial range. Specifically, after three iterations, `R` is set to 50001 and `L` is set to 75001, making `x` equal to 62501. The loop condition `R - L > 1` will no longer hold, and the final values of `R`, `L`, `x`, `numCuts`, and `leftover` will reflect this convergence.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
