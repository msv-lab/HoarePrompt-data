Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `k + 1` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration.
   - Therefore, for the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n - 1`.

3. **Determine the new value of `i`**:
   - Since `i` was `k + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it `k + 2`.
   - To ensure the loop continues, `k + 2` must still be less than `n - 1`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - The variable `i` needs to be updated to `k + 2`.
   - The condition `i < n - 1` must still hold true.

Given these points, let's formulate the new state:

- `a` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
- `b` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
- `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.
- `i` is updated to `k + 2`, ensuring it is still less than `n - 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`a` is the integer from the first split input, `b` is the integer from the second split input, `adj[a]` now includes `b` and already had `b` before this operation (since `adj[b]` also includes `a`), `adj[b]` now includes `a` and already had `a` before this operation (since `adj[a]` also includes `a`), `i` is `k + 2` and `i` must be less than `n - 1`**
