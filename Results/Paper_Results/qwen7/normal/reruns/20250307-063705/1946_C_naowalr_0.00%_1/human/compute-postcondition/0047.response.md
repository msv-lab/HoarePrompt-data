Output State: `i` is equal to `k + (n - 1)`, `n` is the same as before, `L` is 50001, `adj` is a list of lists where `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` each contain both `a` and `b` as elements, indicating an undirected edge between nodes `a` and `b`, `R` is 50001, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is 50001, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs` function call `dfs(1, 1)`.

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, the condition `R - L > 1` will no longer hold true, meaning the loop will terminate. The final values of `L` and `R` will converge to the same value, which is 50001 based on the pattern observed from the first three iterations. Since `numCuts` remains 0 throughout the iterations and does not meet the condition `numCuts > k` or `numCuts == k and leftover < x`, `L` and `R` will stabilize at 50001. The other variables (`i`, `adj`, `x`, and `leftover`) will retain their last computed states.
