Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is the first integer input converted to int, `b` is the second integer input converted to int, `adj[a]` contains `[b, a]`**

Explanation: The code appends `b` to the list `adj[a]`. Initially, `adj[b]` contains `[b, a]`. After executing the line `adj[a].append(b)`, the list `adj[a]` will now contain both `b` and `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
