Output State: **`L` is 1, `i` is equal to `k + (n - 1)`, all other variables (`a`, `b`, `leftover`, `numCuts`, `x`, `L`, `R`) retain their values from the last iteration of the loop.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the value 1 to the variable `L`. The loop that constructs the graph has already completed its execution, and the values of `i`, `a`, `b`, `leftover`, `numCuts`, `x`, and `R` remain unchanged from the last iteration of the loop.
