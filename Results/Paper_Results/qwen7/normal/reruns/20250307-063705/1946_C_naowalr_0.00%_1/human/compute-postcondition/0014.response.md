Output State: **`a` is an integer equal to the first number input, `b` is an integer equal to the second number input, `adj[b]` now contains the list `[a]`, `i` is `k + 2`, `n` is the same as before**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the standard input and assigns them to `a` and `b` respectively using `map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())`. This means `a` and `b` are updated to the values of the first and second numbers input. The list `adj[b]` is updated to contain the integer `a` as its first (and only) element. All other variables remain unchanged.
