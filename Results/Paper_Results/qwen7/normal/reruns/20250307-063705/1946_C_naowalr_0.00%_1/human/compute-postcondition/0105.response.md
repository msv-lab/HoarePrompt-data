Output State: **`i` is 0; `n` must be greater than 1; `a` is the first integer input; `b` is the second integer input; `adj[a]` now contains `b`.**

Explanation: The code `adj[a].append(b)` appends the value of `b` to the list `adj[a]`. Since `a` and `b` are the first and second integer inputs respectively, `adj[a]` will now contain `b`. The other variables (`i`, `n`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
