Output State: **`R` is 100001, `i` is `n-2`, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` and `b` are integers read from standard input, `adj[b]` contains a list of all integers `a` that `b` is connected to, with each `a` appearing as many times as it was paired with `b` in the inputs, `L` is 1, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is 50001**

Explanation: The line `numCuts = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `numCuts`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `R`, `i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `adj[b]`, `L`, and `x` remain unchanged.
