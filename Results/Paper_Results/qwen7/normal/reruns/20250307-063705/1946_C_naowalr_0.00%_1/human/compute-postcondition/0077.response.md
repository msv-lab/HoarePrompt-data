Output State: **`L` is 51, `i` is equal to `k + (n - 1)`, `R` is 101, `x` is 51, `numCuts` is greater than `k` or (`numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`).**

Explanation: The code changes the value of `L` to `x`, which is 51. The other variables (`i`, `R`, `x`, `numCuts`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
