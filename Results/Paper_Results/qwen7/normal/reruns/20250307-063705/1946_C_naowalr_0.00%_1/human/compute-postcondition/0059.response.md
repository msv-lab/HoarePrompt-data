Output State: **`a` is the integer from the first split input, `b` is the integer from the second split input, `adj[a]` now includes `b`, and `adj[b]` now includes `a`, `i` is `k+1` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, and `i` must be less than `n-1`**.

Explanation: The code reads two integers `a` and `b` from the standard input using `sys.stdin.readline().split()`, which splits the input into a list of strings and then converts them to integers using `map(int, ...)`. These values are then assigned to `a` and `b` respectively. The adjacency lists `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` are updated to include each other. The value of `i` remains unchanged as the code does not modify it. Therefore, `i` is still `k+1` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, and `i` must be less than `n-1`.
