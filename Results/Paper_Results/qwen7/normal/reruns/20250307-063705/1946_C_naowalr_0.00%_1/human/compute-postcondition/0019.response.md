Output State: **`i` is equal to `k + (n - 1)`, `n` is the same as before, `L` is 1, `adj` is a list of lists where `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` each contain both `a` and `b` as elements, indicating an undirected edge between nodes `a` and `b`.**

This output state reflects that the variable `L` has been assigned the value `1`, while the other variables retain their initial states. The loop and the adjacency list `adj` remain as described in the initial state.
