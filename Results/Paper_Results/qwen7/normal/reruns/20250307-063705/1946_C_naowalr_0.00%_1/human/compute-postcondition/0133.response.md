Output State: **`R` is 75001, `L` is 50001, `x` is 75001, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of dfs(1, 1)**

Explanation: The code `R = x` simply assigns the value of `x` (which is 75001) to the variable `R`. All other variables (`L`, `numCuts`, and `leftover`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
