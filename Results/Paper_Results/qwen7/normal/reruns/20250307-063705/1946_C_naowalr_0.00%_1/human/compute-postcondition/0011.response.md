Output State: **`a` is an integer equal to the first number input, `b` is an integer equal to the second number input, `adj[b]` now contains the integer `a` appended as a list element, `i` is `k + 1`, `n` is the same as before**.

Explanation: The code `adj[b].append(a)` appends the value of `a` to the list stored in `adj[b]`. Since `a` is an integer equal to the first number input and `b` is an integer equal to the second number input, `adj[b]` now contains the integer `a` as its last element. The other variables (`i`, `k`, `n`) remain unchanged.
