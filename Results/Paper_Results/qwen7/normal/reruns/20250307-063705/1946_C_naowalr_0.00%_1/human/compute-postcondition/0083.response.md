Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `R - L > 1`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `L` is 51
   - `i` is equal to `k + (n - 1)`
   - `R` is 101
   - `x` is 51
   - `numCuts` is greater than `k` or (`numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`)

3. **Determine the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves `R` and `L`. Therefore, we need to adjust these variables.

4. **Check the Current Values**:
   - `L` is 51
   - `R` is 101
   - The difference `R - L` is 50, which is greater than 1. This means the loop can continue as long as the values of `L` and `R` are such that `R - L > 1`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since the loop condition `R - L > 1` is already satisfied, no adjustment is necessary for `L` and `R` to ensure the loop can execute one more time.
   - The other variables (`i`, `x`, `numCuts`, and `leftover`) do not affect the loop condition directly and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are the ones in the loop head, which are `L` and `R`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`L` is 51, `R` is 101**
