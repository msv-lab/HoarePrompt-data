Output State: **`i` is equal to `k + (n - 1)`, `n` and `k` are the values read from the input, `L` is 50001, `adj` is now a list of empty lists with length `n + 1`, `R` is 50001, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is 50001, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs` function call `dfs(1, 1)`**.

Explanation: The code initializes `adj` as a list of empty lists with a length of `n + 1`. This means that for each node from 1 to `n`, there is an empty list associated with it, representing its adjacency list. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
