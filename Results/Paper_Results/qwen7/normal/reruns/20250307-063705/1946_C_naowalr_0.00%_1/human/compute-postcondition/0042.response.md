Output State: **`i` is equal to `k + (n - 1)`, `n` is the same as before, `L` is 1, `adj` is a list of lists, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is 50001, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs` function call `dfs(1, 1)`**.

Explanation: The line `numCuts = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `numCuts`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
