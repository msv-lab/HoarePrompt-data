Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current values**:
   - `i` is currently `k + 1`.
   - `n` is the same as before.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was `k + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `k + 2`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.

5. **Construct the new state**:
   - `a` and `b` remain the same as they are not part of the loop head.
   - `adj[b]` still contains the integer `a` appended as a list element.
   - `i` is now `k + 2`.
   - `n` remains the same as before.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `a` is an integer equal to the first number input, `b` is an integer equal to the second number input, `adj[b]` now contains the integer `a` appended as a list element, `i` is `k + 2`, `n` is the same as before**
