Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies `i` and `n` as the variables involved in the loop condition `i < n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `a` is the first integer input.
   - `b` is the second integer input.
   - `adj[b]` now contains `[a]`.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n - 1`.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration, making `i` equal to 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than 1.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be updated to 1.
   - `n` must still be greater than 1.
   - The values of `a`, `b`, and `adj[b]` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is the first integer input, `b` is the second integer input, `adj[b]` contains `[a]`**.
