Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Understanding the Loop Condition
The loop condition is `R - L > 1`. For the loop to continue, the difference between `R` and `L` must be greater than 1.

### Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `R`, `L`, `x`, `numCuts`, and `leftover` remain unchanged.
- The loop continues based on the condition `R - L > 1`.

### Analyzing the Loop Head Variables
The loop head variables are `R` and `L`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `R - L > 1` for the loop to continue.

### Conditions for Continuing the Loop
To satisfy the condition `R - L > 1`, either `R` must increase or `L` must decrease (or both).

### Adjusting the States
Given the current states:
- `R`, `L`, `x`, `numCuts`, and `leftover` remain unchanged from the previous iteration.

We need to ensure that `R - L > 1` for the loop to continue. This means either `R` should be increased or `L` should be decreased.

### Possible Adjustments
- If `R` is increased, `R` must be set to a value such that `R - L > 1`.
- If `L` is decreased, `L` must be set to a value such that `R - L > 1`.

Since `R` and `L` are the only variables that affect the loop condition, we need to adjust these values.

### Conclusion
For the loop to execute one more time, either `R` must be increased or `L` must be decreased to ensure `R - L > 1`.

### Final Answer
State: **`R` must be increased or `L` must be decreased to ensure `R - L > 1`**
