Output State: **After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n-2`, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` and `b` will be integers read from standard input, `adj[b]` will contain a list of all integers `a` that `b` is connected to (i.e., all nodes `a` such that there is an edge between `b` and `a`), with each `a` appearing as many times as it was paired with `b` in the inputs.**

This means that after the loop completes, the variable `i` will have the value `n-2`, indicating that the loop has executed `n-1` times. The adjacency list `adj` will be fully populated with all the connections specified by the inputs.
