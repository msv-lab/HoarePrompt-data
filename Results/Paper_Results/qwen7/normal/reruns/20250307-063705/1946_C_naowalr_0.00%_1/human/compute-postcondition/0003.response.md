Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `n` is an integer obtained from the first space-separated value in input; `k` is an integer obtained from the second space-separated value in input; `adj` is a list of lists with length `n + 1`.**

Explanation: The code creates a list of lists named `adj` with `n + 1` elements. Each element in the list is initialized as an empty list. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state.
