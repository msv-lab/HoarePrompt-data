Output State: **`a` is the integer from the first split input, `b` is the integer from the second split input, `adj[b]` now includes `a` and has one more occurrence of `a` since `adj[a]` also includes `b`, `i` is `k + 2` and `i` must be less than `n - 1`**.

Explanation: The code `adj[b].append(a)` appends the value of `a` to the list `adj[b]`. Since `adj[b]` already included `a` before this operation (as stated in the initial state), appending `a` again just increases the count of `a` in `adj[b]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
