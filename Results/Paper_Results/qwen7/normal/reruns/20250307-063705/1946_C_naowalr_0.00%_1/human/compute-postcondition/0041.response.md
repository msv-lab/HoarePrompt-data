Output State: **`i` is equal to `k + (n - 1)`, `n` is the same as before, `L` is 1, `adj` is a list of lists, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is 50051, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs` function call `dfs(1, 1)`, `x` is now 50001.**

Explanation: The code `x = (L + R) // 2` calculates the integer division of the sum of `L` and `R` by 2 and assigns the result to `x`. Given that `L` is 1 and `R` is 100001, the calculation becomes `(1 + 100001) // 2`, which equals 50001. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
