Based on the initial state provided:

- `R` is 50001.
- `i` is `n-2`.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `a` and `b` are integers read from standard input.
- `adj[b]` contains a list of all integers `a` that `b` is connected to.
- `L` is 75001.
- `numCuts` is 0.
- `x` is 62501, which is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call.
- The loop condition `R - L > 1` will no longer hold, meaning `R` and `L` have stabilized around the midpoint of their initial range.

Given that `R` is 50001 and `L` is 75001, and the loop condition `R - L > 1` no longer holds, the value of `x` is the midpoint between `R` and `L`, which is 62501. The `dfs(1, 1)` function call results in `x` being 62501.

Therefore, when the `print(L)` statement is executed, it will print the value of `L`, which is 75001.

Output: **75001**
