Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `R` is increased or `L` is decreased to ensure `R - L > 1`, `x` is equal to (`L` + `R`) // 2, `leftover` is the return value of `dfs(1, 1)`**.

Explanation: The function `dfs(1, 1)` is called, which returns a value assigned to `leftover`. The values of `numCuts`, `R`, `L`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states.
