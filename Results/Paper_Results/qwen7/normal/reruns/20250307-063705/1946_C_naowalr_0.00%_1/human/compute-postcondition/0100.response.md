The only variables in the loop head are `z` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `z` and `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `z` is 3, and `t` must be greater than 3 for the loop to continue.

Since the loop continues as long as `R - L > 1`, and given that `L` is 100 and `R` is 101, the loop will terminate when `z` reaches 4 because `R - L` will no longer be greater than 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `z` must be incremented to 4, and `t` must still be greater than 4.

State: **`L` is 100, `R` is 101, `x` is 100, `numCuts` is 0, `z` is 4, `t` must be greater than 4**
