Output State: **`L` is 50001, `R` is 50001, `x` is 50001, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the binary search process converges such that `R` and `L` stabilize at the midpoint of their initial range, which is 50001. Since the loop terminates when `R - L <= 1`, the final values of `R` and `L` will be the same, and `x` will be the integer division of `L + R` by 2, which is 50001. The variable `numCuts` remains 0 because it is not modified within the loop body once the loop ends. The value of `leftover` is determined by the `dfs(1, 1)` function call, which is not affected by the loop. All other variables outside the loop, such as `t`, `n`, `k`, and the adjacency list `adj`, remain unchanged from their initial or previous states.
