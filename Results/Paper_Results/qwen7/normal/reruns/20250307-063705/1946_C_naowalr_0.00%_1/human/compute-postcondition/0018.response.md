Output State: The loop will have executed `n-1` times. Therefore, `i` will be equal to `k + (n - 1)`. The variable `n` remains unchanged. For each pair of integers `(a, b)` read from the input, `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` will contain both `a` and `b` as elements, forming an undirected edge between nodes `a` and `b`. In other words, `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` will each contain a list of integers representing all nodes connected to `a` and `b`, respectively. All other variables in their initial states remain unchanged.

To summarize, the final output state is:
- `i` is equal to `k + (n - 1)`
- `n` is the same as before
- `adj` is a list of lists where `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` each contain both `a` and `b` as elements, indicating an undirected edge between nodes `a` and `b`.
