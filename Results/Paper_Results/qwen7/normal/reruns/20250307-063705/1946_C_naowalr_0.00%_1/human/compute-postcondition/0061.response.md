Output State: **`a` is the integer from the first split input, `b` is the integer from the second split input, `adj[a]` now includes `b` and already had `b` before this operation (since `adj[b]` also includes `a`), `adj[b]` now includes `a` and already had `a` before this operation (since `adj[a]` also includes `a`), `i` is `k+1` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, and `i` must be less than `n-1`**.

Explanation: The code `adj[b].append(a)` appends the value of `a` to the list `adj[b]`. Since `adj[b]` already included `a` before this operation (as stated in the precondition), appending `a` again does not change its content. The same logic applies to `adj[a]` which already included `b` before this operation. The value of `i` remains unchanged as the code does not affect `i`.
