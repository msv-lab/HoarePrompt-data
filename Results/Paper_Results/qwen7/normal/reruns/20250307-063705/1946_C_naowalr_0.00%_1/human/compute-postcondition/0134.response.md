Postcondition: **`R`, `L`, `x`, `numCuts`, and `leftover` remain unchanged. If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or (`numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`), then `R` becomes 100001, `L` remains 75001, `x` becomes 75001, `numCuts` remains 0, and `leftover` remains the result of `dfs(1, 1)`. Otherwise, `R` remains 75001, `L` remains 50001, `x` remains 75001, `numCuts` remains 0, and `leftover` remains the result of `dfs(1, 1)`.**
