Based on the initial state provided:

- `L` is 100
- `R` is 101
- `x` is 100
- `numCuts` is 0
- `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`

The loop continues as long as `R - L > 1`. After three iterations, the loop narrows down the range to just above 100, setting `L` to 100 and keeping `R` at 101. At the end of the loop, `x` is set to the integer division of `L + R` by 2, which is 100. `numCuts` and `leftover` remain unchanged from the last iteration.

The `print(L)` statement will print the value of `L`, which is 100.

Output: **100**
