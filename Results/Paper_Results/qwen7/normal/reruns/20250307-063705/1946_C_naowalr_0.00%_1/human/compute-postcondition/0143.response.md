Output State: `R` is 50001, `i` is `n-2`, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` and `b` are integers read from standard input, `adj[b]` contains a list of all integers `a` that `b` is connected to, with each `a` appearing as many times as it was paired with `b` in the inputs, `L` is 75001, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is 62501, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the binary search process will converge such that `R - L` is no longer greater than 1. Given the pattern of how `L` and `R` are adjusted, they will stabilize around the midpoint of their initial range. Specifically, after three iterations, `R` is set to 50001 and `L` is set to 75001, making `x` equal to 62501. The loop condition `R - L > 1` will no longer hold, and the final values of `R`, `L`, `x`, `numCuts`, and `leftover` will reflect this convergence.
