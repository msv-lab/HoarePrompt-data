Output State: **`a` is an integer equal to the first number input, `b` is an integer equal to the second number input**.

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the standard input (using `sys.stdin.readline().split()`) and assigns them to variables `a` and `b`. Since the input is split into two parts, `a` will hold the first number and `b` will hold the second number. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
