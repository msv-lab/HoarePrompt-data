Output State: **`L` is 1, `i` is equal to `k + (n - 1)`, `R` is 101.**

Explanation: The variable `R` is assigned the value of `int(100000.0 + 1)`, which evaluates to 101. All other variables retain their values from the last iteration of the loop. Therefore, the updated state includes `R` being set to 101, while `L` and `i` remain unchanged.
