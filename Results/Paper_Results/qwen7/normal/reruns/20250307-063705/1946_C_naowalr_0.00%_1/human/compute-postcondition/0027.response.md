Output State: **`i` is equal to `k + (n - 1)`, `n` is the same as before, `L` is 50001, `adj` is a list of lists where `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` each contain both `a` and `b` as elements, indicating an undirected edge between nodes `a` and `b`, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is greater than `k` or equal to `k` with `leftover` being greater than or equal to `x`, `x` is 50001, `leftover` is the result of the dfs function call `dfs(1, 1)`**

Explanation: The code `L = x` updates the value of `L` to be equal to `x`, which is 50001. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
