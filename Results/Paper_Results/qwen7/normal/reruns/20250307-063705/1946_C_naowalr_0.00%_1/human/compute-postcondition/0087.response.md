Output State: **`L` is 76, `R` is 101, `x` is 76, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is `dfs(1, 1)`**

Explanation: The value of `L` is updated to the value of `x`, which is 76. The values of `R`, `x`, `numCuts`, and `leftover` remain unchanged from their initial states. The function call `dfs(1, 1)` is preserved as it was before the assignment.
