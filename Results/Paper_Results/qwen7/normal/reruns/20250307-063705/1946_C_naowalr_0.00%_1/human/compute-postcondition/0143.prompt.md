Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `R` is 100001, `i` is `n-2`, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` and `b` are integers read from standard input, `adj[b]` contains a list of all integers `a` that `b` is connected to, with each `a` appearing as many times as it was paired with `b` in the inputs, `L` is 1, `numCuts` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while R - L > 1:
    x = (L + R) // 2
    numCuts = 0
    leftover = dfs(1, 1)
    if numCuts > k or numCuts == k and leftover >= x:
        L = x
    else:
        R = x


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `R` is 100001, `i` is `n-2`, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` and `b` are integers read from standard input, `adj[b]` contains a list of all integers `a` that `b` is connected to, with each `a` appearing as many times as it was paired with `b` in the inputs, `L` is 50001, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is 50001, `leftover` is the result of the dfs function call with arguments 1 and 1, and `numCuts` is either greater than `k` or (`numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`) in the first case, or `numCuts` is less than or equal to `k` or (`numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is less than `x`) in the second case.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `R`, `L`, `x`, `numCuts`, and `leftover` remain unchanged. If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or (`numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`), then `R` becomes 100001, `L` remains 75001, `x` becomes 75001, `numCuts` remains 0, and `leftover` remains the result of `dfs(1, 1)`. Otherwise, `R` remains 75001, `L` remains 50001, `x` remains 75001, `numCuts` remains 0, and `leftover` remains the result of `dfs(1, 1)`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `numCuts` is 0, `R` is increased or `L` is decreased to ensure `R - L > 1`, `x` is equal to (`L` + `R`) // 2, `L` is equal to `x` if `numCuts > k` or (`numCuts == k` and `leftover >= x`), otherwise `R` is equal to `x` and `L` is decreased to ensure `R - L > 1`, `leftover` is the return value of `dfs(1, 1)`


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
