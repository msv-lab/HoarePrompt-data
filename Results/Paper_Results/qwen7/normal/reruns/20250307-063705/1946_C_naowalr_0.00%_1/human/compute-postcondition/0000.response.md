Output State: **`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and we read the first line from stdin to set the value of `t`.**

The code reads the first line from standard input (`sys.stdin.readline()`) and converts it to an integer, which is then assigned to the variable `t`. No other variables are affected by this code snippet.
