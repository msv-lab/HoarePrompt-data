Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies `i` and `n` as the variables involved in the loop condition `i in range(n - 1)`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < n - 1`.

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `a` is an integer from the first split input.
   - `b` is an integer from the second split input.
   - `adj[a]` now includes `b`.
   - `adj[b]` now includes `a`.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would be equal to `n - 2`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than `n - 1`. Therefore, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it `n - 1`.

5. **Update the States**:
   - `a` remains unchanged.
   - `b` remains unchanged.
   - `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` remain unchanged as they were updated in the previous iterations but not modified within the loop itself.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: `a` is an integer from the first split input, `b` is an integer from the second split input, `adj[a]` now includes `b`, and `adj[b]` now includes `a`, and `i` is `n - 1`.**
