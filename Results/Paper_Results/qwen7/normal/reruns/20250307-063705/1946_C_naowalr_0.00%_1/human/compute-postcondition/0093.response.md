Output State: **`L` is a variable, `R` is a variable, `x` is the integer division of (`L` + `R`) by 2, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`**.

Explanation: The code `leftover = dfs(1, 1)` assigns the result of the function call `dfs(1, 1)` to the variable `leftover`. The values of `L`, `R`, `x`, and `numCuts` remain unchanged from their initial states.
