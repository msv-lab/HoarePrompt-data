Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `R - L > 1`.
2. **Current values before the loop**:
   - `L` is 1
   - `i` is equal to `k + (n - 1)`
   - `R` is 101
   - `numCuts` is 0 (this variable is not part of the loop condition, so no adjustment is needed for this variable)
3. **Determine the necessary adjustment**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `R - L > 1` must be true.
   - Currently, `R` is 101 and `L` is 1, so `R - L = 101 - 1 = 100`, which is indeed greater than 1.
   - Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `L` and `R` to satisfy the loop condition.

Since the current values already satisfy the loop condition, no adjustments are required.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`L` is 1, `i` is equal to `k + (n - 1)`, `R` is 101**
