Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `k + (n - 1)`
- `n` is the same as before
- `L` is 50001
- `adj` is a list of lists where `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` each contain both `a` and `b` as elements, indicating an undirected edge between nodes `a` and `b`
- `R` is 50001
- `numCuts` is 0
- `x` is 50001
- `leftover` is the result of the `dfs` function call `dfs(1, 1)`

The `print(L)` statement will print the value of `L`.

From the explanation, it is stated that `L` converges to 50001 after the loop terminates, and no operations affect `L` afterward.

Output: **50001**
