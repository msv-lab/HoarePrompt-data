Postcondition: **`R` is 100001, `i` is `n-2`, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` and `b` are integers read from standard input, `adj[b]` contains a list of all integers `a` that `b` is connected to, with each `a` appearing as many times as it was paired with `b` in the inputs, `L` is 1, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is 50001, `leftover` is the result of the dfs function call with arguments 1 and 1, `numCuts` is less than or equal to `k` or (`numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is less than `x`)**
