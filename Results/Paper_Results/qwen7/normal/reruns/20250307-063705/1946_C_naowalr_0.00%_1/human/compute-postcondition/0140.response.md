Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `R` is equal to `x`, `L` is decreased to ensure `R - L > 1`, `x` is equal to (`L` + `R`) // 2, `leftover` is the return value of `dfs(1, 1)`**.

Explanation: The variable `R` is updated to be equal to `x`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state. `L` is still decreased to ensure that `R - L > 1`, `x` is still calculated as (`L` + `R`) // 2, and `leftover` retains its value as the return value of `dfs(1, 1)`.
