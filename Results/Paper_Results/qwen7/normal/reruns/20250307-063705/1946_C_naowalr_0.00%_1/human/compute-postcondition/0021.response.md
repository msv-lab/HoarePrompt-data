Output State: **`i` is equal to `k + (n - 1)`, `n` is the same as before, `L` is 1, `adj` is a list of lists where `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` each contain both `a` and `b` as elements, indicating an undirected edge between nodes `a` and `b`, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0.**

The variable `numCuts` is assigned the value 0, which means no cuts have been made yet. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
