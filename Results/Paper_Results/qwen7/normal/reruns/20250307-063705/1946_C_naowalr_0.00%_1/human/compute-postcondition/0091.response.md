Output State: **`L` is a variable, `R` is a variable, `x` is the integer division of `(L + R)` by 2.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of the integer division of `(L + R)` to the variable `x`. Since the initial values of `L` and `R` are not specified, they remain as variables. The value of `x` is calculated as the integer division of the sum of `L` and `R`.
