Output State: **`L` is equal to `x`, `R` is unchanged, `x` is the integer division of (`L` + `R`) by 2, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`**.

Explanation: The code `L = x` updates the value of `L` to be equal to the current value of `x`. The value of `x` is defined as the integer division of (`L` + `R`) by 2. The values of `R`, `numCuts`, and `leftover` remain unchanged from their initial states.
