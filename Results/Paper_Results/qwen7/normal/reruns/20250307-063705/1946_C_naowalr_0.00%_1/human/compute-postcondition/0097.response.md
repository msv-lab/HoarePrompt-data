Output State: `L` is 100, `R` is 101, `x` is 100, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`.

Explanation: Given the nature of the binary search-like loop, it narrows down the range `[L, R)` until `R - L` is no longer greater than 1. After three iterations, the loop has effectively determined that the value of `x` should be 100 to satisfy the condition within the specified range. Since `R` cannot go below `L` and the difference `R - L` is now 1, the loop terminates with `L` set to 100 and `R` remaining at 101. The value of `x` is the midpoint of the final range, which is 100. `numCuts` and `leftover` remain as they were last updated, with `numCuts` being 0 and `leftover` being the result of the most recent call to `dfs(1, 1)`.
