Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts four parameters: an integer `n` (between 3 and 200,000), and three integers `na`, `nb`, and `nc` (each between 1 and `n-2` such that their sum equals `n`). It also takes a list of `n` positive integers named `numbers`. The function first sorts the `numbers` list in descending order. Then, it distributes the numbers into three groups (`group_a`, `group_b`, `group_c`) by calling the `distribute_number(num)` function for each number in the sorted list. After processing all numbers, it checks the sums of the three groups using the `func_1` function. If the condition in `func_1` is met, the function returns 'YES' along with the three groups. Otherwise, it returns 'NO'.**
