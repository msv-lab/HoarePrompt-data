Output State: **The program returns 'YES', along with three groups (group_a, group_b, group_c) which were formed during the processing of the numbers list.**

This means that the function `distribute_number(num)` was called `n` times, and based on the condition `func_1(sum_a, sum_b, sum_c)` being true, the function returns a tuple containing the string 'YES' and the three groups (`group_a`, `group_b`, `group_c`) that were created from distributing the numbers.
