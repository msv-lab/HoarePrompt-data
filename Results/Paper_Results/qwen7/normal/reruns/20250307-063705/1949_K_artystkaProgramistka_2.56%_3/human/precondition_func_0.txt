a, b, and c are positive integers representing the sums of the numbers in the three groups, respectively, such that a + b + c is the sum of a given list of n positive integers, and a, b, and c are non-negative integers satisfying a + b + c = sum_of_x, where sum_of_x is the sum of the integers in the list x_1, x_2, ..., x_n.
