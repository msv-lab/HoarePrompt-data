Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: n (an integer between 3 and 200,000), na, nb, and nc (integers between 1 and n-2 such that na + nb + nc = n), and a list of n positive integers (numbers). It returns either 'YES' along with three groups (group_a, group_b, group_c) formed from the numbers list, or 'NO'.**
