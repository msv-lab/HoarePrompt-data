Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for num in numbers:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `num` and `numbers`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop iterates over each element in the `numbers` list. After each iteration, `num` takes the value of the current element being processed, and then that element is removed from the `numbers` list.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `num` is removed from the `numbers` list.
   - `numbers` is now a list of `n-1` positive integers sorted in descending order.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `num` is removed from the `numbers` list, the next value of `num` will be the next element in the updated `numbers` list.
   - For the loop to execute again, `numbers` must still contain at least one element (i.e., it should have `n-2` elements left).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `num` is the next element in the updated `numbers` list.
- `numbers` is now a list of `n-2` positive integers sorted in descending order.

So, the final answer is:
State: **`num` is the next element in the updated `numbers` list, `numbers` is now a list of `n-2` positive integers sorted in descending order**.
