Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for num in numbers:`. The objects involved here are `num` and `numbers`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `num` is a variable that will take on each value from the list `numbers` during each iteration of the loop.
   - `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order.

3. **Understand the loop behavior**:
   - The loop iterates over each element in the `numbers` list.
   - Initially, `num` will be the first element in the `numbers` list because the list is sorted in descending order.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `num` will take on the values from the `numbers` list one by one, we need to ensure that `num` is set to the first element of the list.
   - The list `numbers` itself remains unchanged as it is used directly in the loop.

5. **Final state**:
   - `num` should be the first element of the `numbers` list.
   - `numbers` should remain as a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order.

Given the above analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`num` is the first element of the `numbers` list, `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order**.
