Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `sum_a` is 0, `sum_b` is 0, `sum_c` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are integers such that 1 ≤ `na`, `nb`, `nc` ≤ `n-2` and `na + nb + nc = n`, `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers such that 1 ≤ `numbers[i]` ≤ 10^9 for all 0 ≤ i < `n`, and `numbers` is sorted in descending order; `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` are empty lists.
Code of the loop:
for num in numbers:
    distribute_number(num)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `num` is removed from the `numbers` list, `numbers` is now a list of `n-1` positive integers sorted in descending order.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `num` is no longer the next element in the updated `numbers` list, `numbers` is now a list of `n-2` positive integers sorted in descending order, and the function `distribute_number(num)` has been called with `num` as its argument.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `num` is the next element in the updated `numbers` list, which is a list of `n-3` positive integers sorted in descending order after the call to `distribute_number(num)`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
