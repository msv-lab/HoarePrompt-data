Output State: **All elements in the `numbers` list have been processed, `numbers` is now an empty list, and the function `distribute_number(num)` has been called `n` times with each `num` as its argument.**

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `numbers` list will be completely empty since each of its elements was processed exactly once. Additionally, the `distribute_number(num)` function was called once for each element in the original `numbers` list, totaling `n` calls.
