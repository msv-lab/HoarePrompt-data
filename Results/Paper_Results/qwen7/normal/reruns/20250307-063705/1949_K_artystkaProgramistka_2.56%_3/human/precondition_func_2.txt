num is an integer such that 1 <= num <= 10^9, na, nb, and nc are positive integers representing the sizes of the three groups, and sum_a, sum_b, and sum_c are integers representing the current sums of the three groups respectively. Additionally, the function has access to three lists: group_a, group_b, and group_c, which will store the numbers in the respective groups, and these lists are initially empty.
