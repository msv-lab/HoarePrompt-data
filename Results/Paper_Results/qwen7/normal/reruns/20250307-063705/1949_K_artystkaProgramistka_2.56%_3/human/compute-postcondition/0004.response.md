Output State: **`num` is removed from the `numbers` list, `numbers` is now a list of `n-1` positive integers sorted in descending order.**

Explanation: The function `distribute_number(num)` is called with `num` as an argument. Since `num` is the first element of the `numbers` list and the list is sorted in descending order, `distribute_number(num)` likely removes `num` from the list. After removing `num`, the list `numbers` will have one less element, making it a list of `n-1` elements, and it will still be sorted in descending order.
