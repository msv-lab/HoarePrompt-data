Output State: **`times` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `_` is 0**

Explanation: The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means it will hold the integer value entered by the user. The variable `times` remains greater than 0, and the variable `_` remains 0 as it was not affected by the code.
