Output State: **`times` is an input integer, `check` is 2147483647**

Explanation: The code sets `check` to the value of \(2^{31} - 1\), which is 2147483647. Since `times` is an input integer and no other variables are defined or modified, `times` remains an input integer, and `check` is now set to 2147483647.
