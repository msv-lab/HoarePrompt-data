Output State: **`times` is an input integer, and all other variables are undefined.**

Explanation: The code reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `times`. Since the input is read from the user, the exact value of `times` is not known until runtime. All other variables remain undefined or unchanged from their initial state.
