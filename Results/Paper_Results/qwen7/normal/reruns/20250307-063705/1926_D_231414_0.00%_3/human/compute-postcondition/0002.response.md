State: **`times` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0** 

Explanation:
- The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is used as a throwaway variable) and `times`.
- Whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `times`. For the loop to execute, `times` must be greater than 0.
- The variable `_` is initialized to 0 at the start of each iteration, but since it is not used outside the loop, its initial value before the loop does not affect the loop's execution. Therefore, it does not need to be explicitly adjusted.

Thus, the only state that needs adjustment is ensuring `times` is greater than 0.
