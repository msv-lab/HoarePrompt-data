Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the iterable `data`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of Variables in the Loop Head**:
   - `i` will take on the values from the list `data` during each iteration of the loop.
   - `data` is already defined as a list of integers.

3. **Check the Conditions for the Loop to Execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `data` must contain at least one element because the loop iterates over each element in `data`.
   - Since `i` will take on the values from `data`, `i` can be initialized to the first element of `data` when the loop starts.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - The initial value of `i` should be set to the first element of `data`.
   - Ensure that `data` has at least one element.

Given these considerations, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `data` must have at least one element.
- `i` should be set to the first element of `data`.

Therefore, the modified state is:

**State: **`times` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `_` is 0, `data` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `dic` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is equal to `n`, `check` is 2147483647, `i` is the first element of `data`**.
