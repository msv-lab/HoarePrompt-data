Output State: **`times` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `_` is 0, `data` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `dic` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is equal to `n`, `check` is 2147483647, `i` is the first element of `data`, `s` is `i ^ 2147483647**.

Explanation: The variable `s` is assigned the value of `i` XORed with `check`. Since `i` is the first element of `data` and `check` is a constant value (2147483647), `s` will be the result of the bitwise XOR operation between `i` and `2147483647`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
