Output State: **`times` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `_` is 0, `data` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `dic` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is equal to `n`, `check` is 2147483647.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value \(2^{31} - 1\) to the variable `check`. This value is a specific constant and does not affect the other variables. Therefore, the values of `times`, `n`, `_`, `data`, `dic`, and `ans` remain unchanged, and `check` is set to 2147483647.
