Postcondition: **`times` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `_` is 0, `data` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `dic` is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is `i ^ 2147483647` and the value is -1, `ans` is equal to `n - 1`, `check` is 2147483647, `i` is the first element of `data`, `s` is `i ^ 2147483647`, and the current value of `s` is in `dic`. The condition `dic[s] == 0` is true.**
