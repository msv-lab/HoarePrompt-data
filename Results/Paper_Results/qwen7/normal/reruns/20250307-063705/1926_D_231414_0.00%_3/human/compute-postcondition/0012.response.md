Output State: **`times` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `_` is 0, `data` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `dic` is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is `i ^ 2147483647` and the value is -1, `ans` is equal to `n`, `check` is 2147483647, `i` is the first element of `data`, `s` is `i ^ 2147483647`, and `s` is in `dic`.**

Explanation: The code `dic[s] -= 1` decrements the value associated with the key `s` in the dictionary `dic` by 1. Since `s` is `i ^ 2147483647` and initially `dic[s]` was set to 0 (as per the initial state where `s` is in `dic`), the new value of `dic[s]` becomes -1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
