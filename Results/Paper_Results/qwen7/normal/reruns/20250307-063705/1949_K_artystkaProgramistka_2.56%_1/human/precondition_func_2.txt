num is an integer such that 1 <= num <= 10^9, na, nb, and nc are positive integers satisfying na + nb + nc = n, and sum_a, sum_b, and sum_c are integers representing the current sums of the three groups (group_a, group_b, group_c), where group_a, group_b, and group_c are lists of integers representing the numbers in each group, and len(group_a) + len(group_b) + len(group_c) < n.
