Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for num in numbers:`. The variables involved here are `num` and `numbers`.

2. **Understand the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop continues as long as there are elements left in the `numbers` list.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `num` is no longer the second element of the `numbers` list.
   - `numbers` must still have at least one element remaining.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop continues as long as there are elements in `numbers`, for the loop to execute one more time, `numbers` must still have at least one element.
   - After the current iteration, `num` is no longer the second element of `numbers`. This means that either the second element was removed or `num` is now the first element (if it was the first element before).

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `numbers` must still have at least one element remaining.
   - `num` will be the next element in the list after the current one.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `numbers` must still have at least one element remaining.
- `num` will be the next element in the list.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `num` is the next element in the list, `numbers` must still have at least one element remaining**.
