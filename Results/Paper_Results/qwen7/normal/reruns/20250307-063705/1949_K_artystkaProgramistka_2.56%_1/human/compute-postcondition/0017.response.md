Functionality: **The function `func_2` takes four parameters: `n`, `na`, `nb`, and `nc`, representing the size of a list and the sizes of three subgroups, respectively. It also accepts a list `numbers` containing `n` positive integers. The function sorts the `numbers` list in descending order and then distributes its elements into three groups (`group_a`, `group_b`, `group_c`) based on a custom distribution logic defined within the `distribute_number` function. After processing all elements, it checks if the sums of the three groups are equal using the `func_1` function. If the sums are equal, it returns 'YES' along with the three groups; otherwise, it returns 'NO'.**
