The function accepts three positive integers a, b, and c. It checks whether these integers can form the sides of a triangle based on the triangle inequality theorem (i.e., the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the remaining side). If the conditions a + b > c, a + c > b, and b + c > a are all satisfied, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
