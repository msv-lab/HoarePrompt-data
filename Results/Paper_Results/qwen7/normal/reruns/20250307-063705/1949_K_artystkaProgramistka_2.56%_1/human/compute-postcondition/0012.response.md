Postcondition: **Output State: All elements from the `numbers` list have been processed, and each element was passed to the `distribute_number` function exactly once. The `numbers` list is now empty. The variables `sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c` retain their accumulated sums from calling `distribute_number` for each element in the list. The `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` lists contain all the numbers that were originally in the `numbers` list, but distributed among these three groups as per the logic inside the `distribute_number` function. Additionally, the function `func_1(sum_a, sum_b, sum_c)` evaluates to True.**
