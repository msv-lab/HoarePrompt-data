Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop is iterating over the `numbers` list, and the variable used in the loop is `num`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `num`**: Since the loop starts with the first element of the `numbers` list, `num` will be set to the first element of the `numbers` list.

3. **Consider the Properties of `numbers`**: The `numbers` list is sorted in descending order, meaning the first element is the largest number in the list.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c` are not directly involved in the loop head, so they don't need to be adjusted here.
   - `n`, `na`, `nb`, `nc`, and `group_a`, `group_b`, `group_c` are not directly involved in the loop head either, so they don't need to be adjusted here.
   - `num` will be set to the first element of the `numbers` list.

Given these points, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `num`, which will be set to the first element of the `numbers` list.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`num` is the first element of the `numbers` list**
