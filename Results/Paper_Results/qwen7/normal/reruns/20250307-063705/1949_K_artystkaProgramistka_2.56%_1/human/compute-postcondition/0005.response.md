Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `num` and `numbers`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in the `numbers` list.

3. **Analyze the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `num` is no longer the first element of the `numbers` list.
   - `num` has been passed to the function `distribute_number`.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `num` is no longer the first element, it means the first element of the `numbers` list has already been processed.
   - For the loop to continue, the next element in the `numbers` list must be assigned to `num`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `num` will now be the second element of the `numbers` list.
   - The `numbers` list will have one less element since the first element has been processed.

Given this analysis, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`num` is the second element of the `numbers` list, and `numbers` must have at least one element remaining.**
