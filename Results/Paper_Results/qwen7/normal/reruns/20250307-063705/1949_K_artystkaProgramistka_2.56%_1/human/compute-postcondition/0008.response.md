Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for num in numbers:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `num` and `numbers`.

2. **Understand the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `num` is no longer the second element of the `numbers` list.
   - `numbers` must still have at least one element remaining.

3. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `numbers` must have at least one element remaining.
   - `num` will be the next element in the `numbers` list after the current one.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `num` is no longer the second element, it means that the second element has already been processed.
   - The next element in the list will become `num` for the next iteration.
   - `numbers` must still have at least one element remaining for the loop to continue.

Given these points, we can conclude that for the loop to execute one more time, `numbers` must have at least two elements remaining (since the second element has already been processed).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`num` is the third element of the `numbers` list, and `numbers` must have at least two elements remaining**.
