Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `n`, `na`, `nb`, and `nc`, where `n` is an integer between 3 and 200,000 inclusive, and `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are integers between 1 and `n-2` inclusive such that their sum equals `n`. It also accepts a list `numbers` of `n` positive integers, each between 1 and 10^9 inclusive. The function returns either 'YES' along with three groups of integers (group_a, group_b, group_c) if it's possible to partition the `numbers` list into three groups of sizes `na`, `nb`, and `nc` with equal sums, or 'NO' if it's not possible.**
