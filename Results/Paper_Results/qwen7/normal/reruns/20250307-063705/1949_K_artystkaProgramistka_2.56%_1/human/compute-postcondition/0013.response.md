Output State: **The program returns 'YES', group_a, group_b, group_c**

This means the program returns a tuple containing the string `'YES'` and the three lists `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c`. These lists contain the numbers that were originally in the `numbers` list but distributed among these three groups according to the logic inside the `distribute_number` function. Additionally, the function `func_1(sum_a, sum_b, sum_c)` evaluates to `True`, indicating that certain conditions related to the sums `sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c` are met.
