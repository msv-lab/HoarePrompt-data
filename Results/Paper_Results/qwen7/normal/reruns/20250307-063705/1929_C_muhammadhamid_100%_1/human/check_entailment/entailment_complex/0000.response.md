Reasoning:
The given program is designed to determine if Sasha can ensure he has at least \( n \) coins after a series of bets, given the constraints on the bet size, the maximum number of consecutive losses, and the initial number of coins.

The program iterates \( x \) times, updating the value of \( s \) using the formula \( s += s // (k - 1) + 1 \). This formula effectively simulates Sasha's betting strategy where, after a loss, he increases his bet size exponentially. The variable \( s \) starts at 1 and grows significantly with each iteration due to the exponential increase.

Here's why the program is correct:
1. **Initial Value**: \( s \) starts at 1, representing the minimum possible bet.
2. **Update Rule**: Each iteration of the loop updates \( s \) by adding \( s // (k - 1) + 1 \). This ensures that after each loss, Sasha can place a larger bet, and the growth is exponential.
3. **Number of Iterations**: The loop runs \( x \) times, simulating the maximum number of consecutive losses allowed.
4. **Final Comparison**: After the loop, the program checks if \( s \geq a \). If true, it prints 'Yes', indicating that Sasha can achieve at least \( a \) coins; otherwise, it prints 'No'.

Given the problem constraints and the logic of the program, the implementation correctly determines whether Sasha can guarantee having at least \( a \) coins.

Correctness: **True**
