Output State: The value of `s` will be the result of applying the operation `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` iteratively `x` times starting from `s = 1`. Therefore, `s` will be the sum of the series generated by repeatedly adding `s // (k - 1) + 1` to itself for `x` iterations.

In simpler terms, `s` will be the final value obtained after performing the operation `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` exactly `x` times, beginning with `s` initialized to 1.
