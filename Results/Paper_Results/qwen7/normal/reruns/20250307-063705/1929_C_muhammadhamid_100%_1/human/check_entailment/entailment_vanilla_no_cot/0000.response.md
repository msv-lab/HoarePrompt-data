Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here’s why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Sasha's Strategy:**
   - The program calculates `s` as `1 + 1 // (k - 1) + 1` repeatedly for `x` iterations. This calculation does not accurately represent Sasha's strategy for achieving an arbitrary number of coins `n`.
   - Specifically, the expression `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` does not correctly simulate the betting strategy where Sasha increases his bet based on his wins and ensures he doesn't exceed his current coins.

2. **Strategy Implementation:**
   - To ensure Sasha can achieve any number of coins `n`, we need to simulate the betting process and check if he can eventually have `n` coins given the constraints.
   - The correct approach would involve simulating the betting rounds and ensuring that Sasha can recover from losses while increasing his bet size appropriately.

3. **Promotion Rule Consideration:**
   - The program does not consider the promotion rule that Sasha cannot lose more than `x` times in a row. This rule needs to be enforced during the simulation.

Here’s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (k, x, a) = map(int, input().split())
        # Check if Sasha can achieve any number of coins n
        # If a is already greater than or equal to the minimum number of coins needed
        # to ensure he can win given the promotion rule, print "YES"
        if a >= (k ** x - 1) // (k - 1):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Calculation of Minimum Coins Needed:** 
  - The formula `(k ** x - 1) // (k - 1)` calculates the minimum number of coins Sasha needs to ensure he can win after `x` consecutive losses. This is derived from the geometric progression sum formula considering the increase in bet size.
- **Comparison with Initial Coins:**
  - If Sasha’s initial coins `a` are greater than or equal to this calculated value, he can achieve any number of coins `n`. Otherwise, he cannot.

This approach correctly handles the constraints and logic required to solve the problem.
