You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, k is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 30, x is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 100, and a is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        k, x, a = map(int, input().split())
        
        s = 1
        
        for i in range(x):
            s += s // (k - 1) + 1
        
        print('Yes' if a >= s else 'No')
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `s` will be the result of applying the operation `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` exactly `x` times, starting from the initial value of `s`, which is 1. The value of `i` will be equal to `x`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The values of `k` and `a` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the loop.
    #
    #In more detail, if the loop runs `x` times, the final value of `s` can be described as follows:
    #- Initially, `s = 1`.
    #- In each iteration, `s` is updated by adding `s // (k - 1) + 1` to its current value.
    #- After `x` iterations, `s` will be the sum of the initial value and the result of the operation applied `x` times.
    #
    #For example, if `x` is 5, the operations would be:
    #1. `s = 1`
    #2. `s = 1 + (1 // (k - 1) + 1)`
    #3. `s = (1 + (1 // (k - 1) + 1)) + ((1 + (1 // (k - 1) + 1)) // (k - 1) + 1)`
    #4. `s = ((1 + (1 // (k - 1) + 1)) + ((1 + (1 // (k - 1) + 1)) // (k - 1) + 1)) + (((1 + (1 // (k - 1) + 1)) + ((1 + (1 // (k - 1) + 1)) // (k - 1) + 1)) // (k - 1) + 1)`
    #5. `s = (((1 + (1 // (k - 1) + 1)) + ((1 + (1 // (k - 1) + 1)) // (k - 1) + 1)) + (((1 + (1 // (k - 1) + 1)) + ((1 + (1 // (k - 1) + 1)) // (k - 1) + 1)) // (k - 1) + 1)) + ((((1 + (1 // (k - 1) + 1)) + ((1 + (1 // (k - 1) + 1)) // (k - 1) + 1)) + (((1 + (1 // (k - 1) + 1)) + ((1 + (1 // (k - 1) + 1)) // (k - 1) + 1)) // (k - 1) + 1)) // (k - 1) + 1)`
    #
    #After the loop completes, `i` will be equal to `x`, and the values of `k` and `a` will remain as they were initially.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies that it should handle four variables: t (a positive integer between 1 and 1000), k (an integer between 2 and 30), x (an integer between 1 and 100), and a (an integer between 1 and 10^9). Depending on these variables, the function may return different values or perform certain operations. However, without specific details on what operations or returns, the exact functionality cannot be fully described.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
