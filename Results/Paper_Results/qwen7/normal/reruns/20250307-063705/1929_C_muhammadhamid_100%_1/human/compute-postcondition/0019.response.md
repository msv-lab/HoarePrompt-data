Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(x)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `x`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `k` is an input integer
   - `x` is an input integer
   - `a` is an input integer
   - `s` is calculated as `2 * s // (k - 1) + 2`
   - `i` is 1

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `x`.
   - Therefore, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it `i = 2`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` should be less than `x`. Hence, `x` remains unchanged.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `k` remains unchanged.
   - `x` remains unchanged.
   - `a` remains unchanged.
   - `s` remains unchanged.
   - `i` is incremented to 2.

So, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `s` is `2 * s // (k - 1) + 2`, `i` is 2**
