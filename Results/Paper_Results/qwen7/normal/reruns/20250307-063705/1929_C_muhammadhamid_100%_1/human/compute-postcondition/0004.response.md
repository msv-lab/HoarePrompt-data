Output State: **`x` must be at least 1; `s` is increased by `s // (k - 1) + 1`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `s` by adding `s // (k - 1) + 1` to its current value. Since `x` must be at least 1 and no changes were made to `x` in the given code, `x` remains unchanged. The value of `s` is updated according to the formula provided.
