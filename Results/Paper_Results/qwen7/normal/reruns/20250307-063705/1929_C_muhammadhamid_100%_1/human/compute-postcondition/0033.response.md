Output State: **`x` must be greater than 0; `s` is updated to `s + s // (k - 1) + 1`**

Explanation: The variable `s` is updated by adding `s // (k - 1) + 1` to its current value. Since `x` must be greater than 0, this condition remains true, but the exact value of `s` depends on the initial value of `s` and `k`. The precondition that `x` must be greater than 0 is still valid, but the value of `s` changes according to the given operation.
