Based on the initial state provided:

- `k` is an input integer.
- `x` is an input integer.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `s` is calculated as `3 * s // (k - 1) + 3`.
- `i` is set to 3.

The print statement checks if `a` is greater than or equal to `s` and prints "Yes" if true, otherwise it prints "No".

Given that `s` is defined recursively in terms of itself, let's break down the calculation of `s`:

1. Initially, `s` is some value (let's call it `s_initial`).
2. `s` is updated to `3 * s_initial // (k - 1) + 3`.

Since the exact initial value of `s` is not specified, we can denote it as `s_initial`. The expression `3 * s_initial // (k - 1) + 3` will give us the new value of `s` after the update.

The value of `i` is explicitly stated to be 3, but this does not affect the comparison in the print statement.

The comparison `a >= s` will depend on the values of `a` and `s`. Since the exact values of `a` and `s` are not specified, we can only describe the condition in general terms.

Output: **Yes** if `a` is greater than or equal to `3 * s_initial // (k - 1) + 3`, otherwise **No**.
