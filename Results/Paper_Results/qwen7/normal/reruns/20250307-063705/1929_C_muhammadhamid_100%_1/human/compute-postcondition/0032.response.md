Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `x` must be greater than 0.
- `s` is increased by `s // (k - 1) + 1` and then `s` is further updated by `s + s // (k - 1) + 1`.

### Loop Head
- The loop iterates over `i` in the range from 0 to `x-1`.

### Analysis
- The loop variable `i` is incremented in each iteration but does not affect the values of `x` or `s` directly.
- The loop condition depends on the value of `x`. For the loop to continue, `x` must be greater than 0.

### Updating States
- Since `x` is the only variable that affects the loop condition and it must remain greater than 0 for the loop to continue, we need to ensure `x` is still greater than 0.
- The value of `s` is updated within the loop body but not directly by the loop itself. Therefore, the update of `s` does not need to be explicitly adjusted here.

### Conclusion
- The only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is `x`, which must remain greater than 0.

### Final State
State: **`x` must be greater than 0**
