Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `x`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < x`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `x` is at least 1.
   - `s` is updated to `s // (k - 1) + 1` and then incremented by the new value of `s`.

4. **Analyze the loop body**:
   - The loop increments `i` from 0 to `x-1`.
   - For each iteration, `x` remains unchanged unless modified within the loop body, but since no such modification is mentioned, `x` stays the same.

5. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - `x` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.

6. **Adjust the state**:
   - `x` remains at least 1.
   - `s` is updated to `s // (k - 1) + 1` and then incremented by the new value of `s`. This means `s` has been updated twice: first to `s // (k - 1) + 1` and then incremented by this new value.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated value of `s` and the incremented value of `s`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`x` is at least 1, `s` is the value after it was updated to `s // (k - 1) + 1` and then incremented by this new value**.
