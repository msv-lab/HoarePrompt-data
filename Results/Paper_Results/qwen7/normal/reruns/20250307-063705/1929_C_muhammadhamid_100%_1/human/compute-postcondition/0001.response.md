Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 30, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 100, `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 10^9, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer**.

The code takes three integers as input and assigns them to the variables `k`, `x`, and `a`. The values of `t` and `a` remain unchanged from their initial conditions. The values of `k` and `x` are now specific input integers, and `a` is also an input integer.
