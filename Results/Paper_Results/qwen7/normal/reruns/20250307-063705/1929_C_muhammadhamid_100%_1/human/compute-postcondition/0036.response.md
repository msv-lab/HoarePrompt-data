Based on the initial state provided:

- `x` must be greater than 0.
- `s` is updated to the value obtained after adding `s // (k - 1) + 1` to itself `x` times.

Let's break down the process:

1. Initially, `s` is some value.
2. The value of `s` is updated `x` times using the formula `s = s // (k - 1) + 1`.

Since the exact initial value of `s` and the specific values of `x` and `k` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `s` after the updates. However, we know that `s` will be updated by the formula `s // (k - 1) + 1` exactly `x` times.

Given this, the print statement will compare `a` with the final value of `s` and print "Yes" if `a` is greater than or equal to `s`, otherwise it will print "No".

Since the exact values of `a`, `s`, `x`, and `k` are not specified, we can only describe the condition being checked.

Output: **'Yes' if a >= s else 'No' (where s is the value obtained after updating s // (k - 1) + 1, x times, starting from some initial value)**
