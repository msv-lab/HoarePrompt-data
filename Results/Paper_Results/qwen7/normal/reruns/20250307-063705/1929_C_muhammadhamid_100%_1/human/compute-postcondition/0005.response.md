Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `x` must be at least 1.
- `s` is increased by `s // (k - 1) + 1`.

### Loop Head
```
for i in range(x):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
- The loop variable `i` ranges from `0` to `x-1`.
- The loop will execute as long as `i < x`.
- After each iteration, `x` remains unchanged, but `s` is updated based on the formula `s = s // (k - 1) + 1`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment
1. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `x`.
   - Since `i` starts from `0` and increments by `1` in each iteration, the loop will continue as long as `i < x`.

2. **Update the State:**
   - The value of `x` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - The value of `s` is updated according to the formula `s = s // (k - 1) + 1`.

### Final State
- `x` must still be at least 1 (unchanged).
- `s` is updated to `s // (k - 1) + 1`.

### Conclusion
State: **`x` must be at least 1; `s` is updated to `s // (k - 1) + 1`**
