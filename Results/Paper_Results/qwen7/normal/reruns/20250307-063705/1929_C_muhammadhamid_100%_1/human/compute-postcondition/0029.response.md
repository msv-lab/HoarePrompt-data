Output State: **`x` must be greater than 0; `s` is increased by `s // (k - 1) + 1`**.

Explanation: The code updates the variable `s` by adding the value of `s // (k - 1) + 1` to its current value. The precondition that `x` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged. The exact value of `s` after the operation depends on the values of `s` and `k`, but the updated value of `s` is `s + (s // (k - 1) + 1)`.
