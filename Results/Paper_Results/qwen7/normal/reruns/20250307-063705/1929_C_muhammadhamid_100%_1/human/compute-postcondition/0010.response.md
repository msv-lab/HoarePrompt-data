Output State: The final value of `s` will be the result of applying the operation `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` repeatedly `x` times, starting from the initial value of `s`, which is 1.

In more detail, after each iteration of the loop, the value of `s` is updated as follows: it is first divided by `(k - 1)` and the quotient is added to 1, then this result is added back to `s`. This process is repeated `x` times. Therefore, the final value of `s` will be the cumulative effect of these operations performed `x` times on the initial value of `s`, which is 1.

For example, if `x` is 4, the operations would be:
1. `s = 1`
2. `s = 1 + (1 // (k - 1) + 1)`
3. `s = (1 + (1 // (k - 1) + 1)) + ((1 + (1 // (k - 1) + 1)) // (k - 1) + 1)`
4. `s = ((1 + (1 // (k - 1) + 1)) + ((1 + (1 // (k - 1) + 1)) // (k - 1) + 1)) + (((1 + (1 // (k - 1) + 1)) + ((1 + (1 // (k - 1) + 1)) // (k - 1) + 1)) // (k - 1) + 1)`

This pattern continues until the loop has executed `x` times.
