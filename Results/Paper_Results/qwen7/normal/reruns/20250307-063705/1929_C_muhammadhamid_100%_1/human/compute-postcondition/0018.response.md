Output State: **`k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `s` is `2 * s // (k - 1) + 2`, `i` is 1**

Explanation: The initial value of `s` was given as `s + s // (k - 1) + 1`. After executing `s += s // (k - 1) + 1`, the new value of `s` becomes `2 * s // (k - 1) + 2`. All other variables (`k`, `x`, `a`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
