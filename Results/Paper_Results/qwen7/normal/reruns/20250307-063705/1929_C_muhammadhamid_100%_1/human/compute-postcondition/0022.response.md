Output State: `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `s` is `3 * s // (k - 1) + 3`, `i` is 3.

Explanation: After each iteration of the loop, the value of `s` is updated according to the formula `s += s // (k - 1) + 1`. After the loop has executed `x` times, the final value of `s` will be the result of applying this update rule `x` times. Given the pattern from the first three iterations, we can generalize that after `x` iterations, `s` will be `x * s // (k - 1) + x`. The variable `i` will be equal to `x - 1` because it starts at 0 and increments by 1 with each iteration.
