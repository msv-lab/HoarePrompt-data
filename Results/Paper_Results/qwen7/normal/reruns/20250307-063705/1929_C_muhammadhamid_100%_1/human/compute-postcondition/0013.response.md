Output State: **`k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `k`, `x`, and `a`. The initial value of `s` is 1, and the loop counter `_` is not defined yet. Since the operation `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` is not performed yet, the values of `k`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged.
