You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend the best handbag, but unfortunately for
Sasha, it is very expensive. Therefore, Sasha wants to earn it. After looking
at earning tips on the internet, he decided to go to the casino.

Sasha knows that the casino operates under the following rules. If Sasha
places a bet of y coins (where y is a positive integer), then in case of
winning, he will receive y \cdot k coins (i.e., his number of coins will
increase by y \cdot (k - 1) ). And in case of losing, he will lose the entire
bet amount (i.e., his number of coins will decrease by y ).

Note that the bet amount must always be a positive (> 0 ) integer and cannot
exceed Sasha's current number of coins.

Sasha also knows that there is a promotion at the casino: he cannot lose more
than x times in a row.

Initially, Sasha has a coins. He wonders whether he can place bets such that
he is guaranteed to win any number of coins. In other words, is it true that
for any integer n , Sasha can make bets so that for any outcome that does not
contradict the rules described above, at some moment of time he will have at
least n coins.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The single line of each test case contains three integers k, x and a (2 \leq k
\leq 30 , 1 \leq x \leq 100 , 1 \leq a \leq 10^9 ) — the number of times the
bet is increased in case of a win, the maximum number of consecutive losses,
and the initial number of coins Sasha has.

Output

For each test case, output "YES" (without quotes) if Sasha can achieve it and
"NO" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, the strings "yEs",
"yes" and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES

Note

In the first test case, Sasha can proceed as follows:

  * If Sasha places a bet for the first time or if he won the previous bet, then he places 1 coin.
  * If Sasha lost the previous bet, then he places 2 coins.

Note that Sasha cannot lose more than once in a row.

It can be proven that with this strategy, Sasha can obtain as many coins as he
wants.

In the second test case, Sasha can only place 1 coin for the first time. But
in case of a loss, he will not be able to place any more bets, so he will not
be able to guarantee having as many coins as he wants.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (k, x, a) = map(int, input().split())
        s = 1
        for i in range(x):
            s += s // (k - 1) + 1
        print('Yes' if a >= s else 'No')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, k is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 30, x is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 100, and a is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        k, x, a = map(int, input().split())
        
        s = 1
        
        for i in range(x):
            s += s // (k - 1) + 1
        
        print('Yes' if a >= s else 'No')
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `s` will be the result of applying the operation `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` exactly `x` times, starting from the initial value of `s`, which is 1. The value of `i` will be equal to `x`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The values of `k` and `a` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the loop.
    #
    #In more detail, if the loop runs `x` times, the final value of `s` can be described as follows:
    #- Initially, `s = 1`.
    #- In each iteration, `s` is updated by adding `s // (k - 1) + 1` to its current value.
    #- After `x` iterations, `s` will be the sum of the initial value and the result of the operation applied `x` times.
    #
    #For example, if `x` is 5, the operations would be:
    #1. `s = 1`
    #2. `s = 1 + (1 // (k - 1) + 1)`
    #3. `s = (1 + (1 // (k - 1) + 1)) + ((1 + (1 // (k - 1) + 1)) // (k - 1) + 1)`
    #4. `s = ((1 + (1 // (k - 1) + 1)) + ((1 + (1 // (k - 1) + 1)) // (k - 1) + 1)) + (((1 + (1 // (k - 1) + 1)) + ((1 + (1 // (k - 1) + 1)) // (k - 1) + 1)) // (k - 1) + 1)`
    #5. `s = (((1 + (1 // (k - 1) + 1)) + ((1 + (1 // (k - 1) + 1)) // (k - 1) + 1)) + (((1 + (1 // (k - 1) + 1)) + ((1 + (1 // (k - 1) + 1)) // (k - 1) + 1)) // (k - 1) + 1)) + ((((1 + (1 // (k - 1) + 1)) + ((1 + (1 // (k - 1) + 1)) // (k - 1) + 1)) + (((1 + (1 // (k - 1) + 1)) + ((1 + (1 // (k - 1) + 1)) // (k - 1) + 1)) // (k - 1) + 1)) // (k - 1) + 1)`
    #
    #After the loop completes, `i` will be equal to `x`, and the values of `k` and `a` will remain as they were initially.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Sasha needs to ensure he can have any number of coins `n` after placing bets.
   - The bet amount increases by a factor of `k-1` when winning, and Sasha can lose up to `x` times consecutively.
   - The initial number of coins Sasha has is `a`.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution:**
   - The solution calculates a value `s` which represents the minimum number of coins Sasha would need to have to ensure he can win any number of coins `n`.
   - The loop iterates `x` times, updating `s` in each iteration:
     ```python
     s = 1
     for i in range(x):
         s += s // (k - 1) + 1
     ```
   - This calculation seems to be an attempt to find the minimum number of coins required to ensure Sasha can keep playing without running out of coins even if he loses `x` times in a row.

3. **Verification:**
   - The logic in the loop is flawed. It does not correctly simulate the process of placing bets and ensuring Sasha can always win.
   - The formula `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` does not accurately represent the cumulative effect of winning and losing bets over `x` consecutive losses.
   - The solution assumes that Sasha can always place a bet equal to his current coins, which is not necessarily true since he can only bet up to his current coins and the bet amount must be a positive integer.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - To ensure Sasha can always have any number of coins `n`, we need to check if the initial number of coins `a` is sufficient to cover the worst-case scenario where Sasha loses `x` times in a row and then wins enough times to reach `n`.
   - The correct approach would involve calculating the minimum number of coins needed to cover the worst-case scenario of losing `x` times in a row and then winning enough times to reach `n`.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The given solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the provided code is incorrect.
