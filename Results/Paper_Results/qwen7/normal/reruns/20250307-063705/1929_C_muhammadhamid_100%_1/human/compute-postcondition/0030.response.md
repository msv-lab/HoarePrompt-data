Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies `i` as the iterator variable, but it does not directly involve `x` or `s` in its condition. However, the loop's continuation depends on the value of `x`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `0` to `x-1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `x`. Since the loop has just completed an iteration, `i` is equal to `x-1`.

3. **Determine the new state of `x`**: For the loop to continue, `x` must remain greater than 0. There is no information suggesting that `x` changes within the loop body, so we assume `x` remains unchanged.

4. **Adjust the state of `s`**: The problem states that `s` is increased by `s // (k - 1) + 1` at the end of each iteration. Therefore, `s` will be updated to its new value after this operation.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the following:
- `x` must still be greater than 0.
- `s` will be updated to its new value after the increment operation.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`x` must be greater than 0; `s` is increased by `s // (k - 1) + 1`**
