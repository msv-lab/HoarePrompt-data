Output State: **`k` is an input integer from `input().split()`, `x` is an input integer from `input().split()`, `a` is an input integer from `input().split()`, `s` is `3 * s // (k - 1) + 3`, `i` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `k, x, a = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the user input and assigns them to the variables `k`, `x`, and `a`. The initial state of `s` and `i` remains unchanged. Therefore, `s` is still calculated as `3 * s // (k - 1) + 3`, and `i` is still 0.
