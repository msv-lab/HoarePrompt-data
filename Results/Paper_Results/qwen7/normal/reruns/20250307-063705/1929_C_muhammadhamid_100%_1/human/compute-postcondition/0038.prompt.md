Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, k is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 30, x is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 100, and a is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 10^9.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    k, x, a = map(int, input().split())
    s = 1
    for i in range(x):
        s += s // (k - 1) + 1
    print('Yes' if a >= s else 'No')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: The final value of `s` will be the result of applying the operation `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` repeatedly `x` times, starting from the initial value of `s`, which is 1.

In more detail, after each iteration of the loop, the value of `s` is updated as follows: it is first divided by `(k - 1)` and the quotient is added to 1, then this result is added back to `s`. This process is repeated `x` times. Therefore, the final value of `s` will be the cumulative effect of these operations performed `x` times on the initial value of `s`, which is 1.

For example, if `x` is 4, the operations would be:
1. `s = 1`
2. `s = 1 + (1 // (k - 1) + 1)`
3. `s = (1 + (1 // (k - 1) + 1)) + ((1 + (1 // (k - 1) + 1)) // (k - 1) + 1)`
4. `s = ((1 + (1 // (k - 1) + 1)) + ((1 + (1 // (k - 1) + 1)) // (k - 1) + 1)) + (((1 + (1 // (k - 1) + 1)) + ((1 + (1 // (k - 1) + 1)) // (k - 1) + 1)) // (k - 1) + 1)`

This pattern continues until the loop has executed `x` times.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `s` is `3 * s // (k - 1) + 3`, `i` is 3.

In natural language: After the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `s` will be three times the result of `s // (k - 1)` plus 3. The variable `i` will be equal to 3, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The values of `k`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `x` must be greater than 0; `s` is updated to the value obtained after adding `s // (k - 1) + 1` to itself `x` times.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `s` will have been updated by the expression `s // (k - 1) + 1` exactly `x` times.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
