Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `s` starts with the value 1.
   - The operation `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` is performed `x` times.
   - After each iteration, `s` is updated according to the formula.

2. **Operation Explanation**:
   - In each iteration, `s` is updated as follows:
     - First, `s` is divided by `(k - 1)` and the quotient is taken.
     - Then, 1 is added to this quotient.
     - Finally, this result is added back to `s`.

3. **Final Value of `s`**:
   - Since `s` starts at 1 and the operation is performed `x` times, the exact value of `s` after `x` iterations depends on the value of `k` and `x`.
   - Without specific values for `k` and `x`, we can only describe the final value of `s` in a general form.

4. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement checks if `a` is greater than or equal to `s` and prints either "Yes" or "No".

Given the initial state and the operation, the print statement will evaluate the condition `a >= s` and print "Yes" if `a` is greater than or equal to the final value of `s`, otherwise it will print "No".

Since the exact values of `a` and `s` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the condition.

Output: **'Yes' if a >= s else 'No' (where s is the final value of s after performing the operation x times starting from 1)**
