Output State: **`x` must be greater than 0; `s` is increased by `s // (k - 1) + 1` and then `s` is further updated by `s + s // (k - 1) + 1`.**

Explanation: The variable `s` is first increased by `s // (k - 1) + 1`, and then the same operation is applied again, updating `s` to `s + s // (k - 1) + 1`. The conditions and values of `x` and `k` remain unchanged.
