Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(x)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `x`.

2. **Determine the current state after the previous iteration**:
   - `k` is an input integer.
   - `x` is an input integer.
   - `a` is an input integer.
   - `s` is updated as `s + s // (k - 1) + 1`.
   - `i` is 0.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < x`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 1.
   - The value of `x` remains unchanged because it is a loop control variable and does not change within the loop body.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `k` remains an input integer.
   - `x` remains an input integer.
   - `a` remains an input integer.
   - `s` remains `s + s // (k - 1) + 1` from the previous iteration.
   - `i` is now 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `s` is `s + s // (k - 1) + 1`, `i` is 1**.
