The function processes multiple inputs, each consisting of three integers \( k \), \( x \), and \( a \). For each input, it calculates the value of \( s \) starting from 1 and repeatedly updates it according to the formula \( s += s // (k - 1) + 1 \) for \( x \) times. After completing the calculations, it compares the final value of \( s \) with \( a \) and prints 'Yes' if \( s \) is greater than or equal to \( a \), otherwise it prints 'No'. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each input.
