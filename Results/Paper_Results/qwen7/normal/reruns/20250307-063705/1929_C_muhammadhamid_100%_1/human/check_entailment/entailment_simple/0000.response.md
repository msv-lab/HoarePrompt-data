Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `k`, `x`, and `a`.
3. It initializes `s` to 1, which represents the minimum number of coins needed to ensure Sasha can always recover from losing up to `x` times consecutively.
4. The loop runs `x` times, updating `s` by adding `s // (k - 1) + 1` to itself. This calculation ensures that Sasha can always recover from losing up to `x` times by placing bets that increase exponentially.
5. After the loop, the program checks if `a` (the initial number of coins Sasha has) is greater than or equal to `s`. If it is, Sasha can guarantee winning any number of coins; otherwise, he cannot.
6. The program prints "Yes" or "No" based on the comparison.

Given the logic and the steps described, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
