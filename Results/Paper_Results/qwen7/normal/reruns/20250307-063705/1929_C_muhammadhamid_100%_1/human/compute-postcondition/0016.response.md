Output State: **`k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `s` is `s + s // (k - 1) + 1`, `i` is 0.**

Explanation: The value of `s` is updated by adding `s // (k - 1) + 1` to its current value. Since `s` was initially 1, the new value of `s` becomes `1 + 1 // (k - 1) + 1`. The other variables (`k`, `x`, `a`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
