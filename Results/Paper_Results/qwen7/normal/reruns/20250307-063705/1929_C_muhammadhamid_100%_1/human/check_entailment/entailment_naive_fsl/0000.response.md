Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the strategy needed to ensure Sasha can achieve any number of coins. Specifically, the program calculates `s` as the sum of Sasha's coins after `x` consecutive losses, but it does not account for the varying bet amounts based on wins and losses as described in the problem. 

For example, consider the test case `(k=2, x=1, a=1)`. According to the problem description, Sasha should be able to achieve any number of coins by placing a bet of 1 coin if he wins, and 2 coins if he loses. However, the program incorrectly prints "Yes" for this case because it only checks if `a >= s`, where `s` is calculated as `1 + 1 // (2 - 1) + 1 = 3`. This calculation does not reflect the dynamic nature of the bets based on wins and losses. 

A correct implementation would need to simulate the betting process and ensure that Sasha can always increase his coins to any desired amount within the constraints of the problem.
