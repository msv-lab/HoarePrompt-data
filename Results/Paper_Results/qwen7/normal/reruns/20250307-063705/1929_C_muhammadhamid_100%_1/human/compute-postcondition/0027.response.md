Output State: **`k` is an input integer from `input().split()`, `x` is an input integer from `input().split()`, `a` is an input integer from `input().split()`, `s` is 1, `i` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `s = 1` directly assigns the value 1 to the variable `s`. The values of `k`, `x`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
