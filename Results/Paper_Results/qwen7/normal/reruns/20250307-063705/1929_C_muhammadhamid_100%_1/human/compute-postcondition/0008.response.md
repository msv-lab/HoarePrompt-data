Output State: **`x` is at least 1; `s` is the value after it was updated to `s // (k - 1) + 1` and then incremented by this new value + the new value again.**

Explanation: The code `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` first calculates `s // (k - 1) + 1` and assigns it to a temporary value, let's call it `temp`. Then it adds `temp` to `s`. So, the new value of `s` is `s + temp + temp`, which simplifies to `s + 2 * temp`. Given that `temp = s // (k - 1) + 1`, the final value of `s` is `s + 2 * (s // (k - 1) + 1)`. The value of `x` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation.
