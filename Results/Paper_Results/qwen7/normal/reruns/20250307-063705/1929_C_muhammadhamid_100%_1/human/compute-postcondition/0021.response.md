Output State: **`k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `s` is `2 * s // (k - 1) + 2 + s // (k - 1) + 1`, `i` is 2**.

Explanation: The variable `s` is updated by adding `s // (k - 1) + 1` to its current value. Initially, `s` was defined as `2 * s // (k - 1) + 2`. After the update, the new value of `s` becomes `2 * s // (k - 1) + 2 + s // (k - 1) + 1`. The other variables (`k`, `x`, `a`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
