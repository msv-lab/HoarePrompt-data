Reasoning:
1. The provided program aims to determine if Sasha can achieve any number of coins \( n \) given the constraints of the casino game.
2. The logic in the program is to calculate a minimum number of coins \( s \) that Sasha can ensure after a series of bets, considering the maximum number of consecutive losses \( x \).
3. The formula used in the program \( s += s // (k - 1) + 1 \) for \( x \) times is intended to simulate Sasha's betting strategy, where \( s \) represents the minimum number of coins Sasha can ensure after \( x \) rounds of betting.
4. The program checks if Sasha's initial number of coins \( a \) is greater than or equal to \( s \) and prints 'Yes' or 'No' accordingly.
5. Given the problem constraints and the provided examples, the program appears to correctly implement the logic to determine if Sasha can achieve any number of coins \( n \).

Based on the reasoning above, the program logic matches the problem description and the provided examples.

Correctness: **True**
