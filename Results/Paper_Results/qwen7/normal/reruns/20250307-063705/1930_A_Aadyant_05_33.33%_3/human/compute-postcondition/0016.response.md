Output State: **`a` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4; `i` is 4; `list2` contains an element which is the integer value of `list1[8]` (since 2 * i equals 8)**

Explanation: The code appends the integer value of `list1[8]` to `list2`. The index `2 * i` evaluates to `8` since `i` is `4`. The initial conditions for `a` and `i` remain unchanged.
