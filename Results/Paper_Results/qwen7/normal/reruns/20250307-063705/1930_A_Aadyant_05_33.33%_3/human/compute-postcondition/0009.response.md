Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `num` must be a positive integer, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `out` is an empty list, `list2` is an empty list, `list1` is sorted in ascending order, `a` is an integer, `b` is the input string from the user.**

Explanation: The code `list1.sort()` sorts the list `list1` in ascending order. The other variables remain unchanged.
