Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `num` must be a positive integer, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `out` is an empty list, `list2` is an empty list, `list1` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `list1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
