Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `num` is an input integer, and n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50.**

Explanation: The code `num = input()` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `num`. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and the value of `n` is not yet determined because no value has been assigned to it within the given code snippet. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `num` and retains the original conditions for `t` and `n`.
