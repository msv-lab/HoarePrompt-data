Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `num` must be a positive integer, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `out` is an empty list, `list2` is an empty list, `list1` is updated to contain the words from the input string `b` split by spaces, `a` is an integer, `b` is the input string from the user.**

The code splits the input string `b` by spaces and assigns the resulting list of strings to `list1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
