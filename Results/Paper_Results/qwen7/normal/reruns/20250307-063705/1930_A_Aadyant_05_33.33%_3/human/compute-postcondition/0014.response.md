Output State: **`a` must be a positive integer; `i` is 3; `list2` has the integer value of `list1[6]` appended; `list2` has the integer value of `list1[6]` appended again.**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The initial state includes `a` being a positive integer, `i` being 3, and `list2` having the integer value of `list1[6]` appended.
2. The code snippet `list2.append(int(list1[2 * i]))` means that `list2` will append the integer value of `list1[2 * i]`.
3. Since `i` is 3, `2 * i` equals 6.
4. Therefore, `list2` will append the integer value of `list1[6]` again, which is already known to be in `list2`.

Thus, the output state includes all the initial conditions plus the additional information that `list2` now contains the integer value of `list1[6]` appended once more.
