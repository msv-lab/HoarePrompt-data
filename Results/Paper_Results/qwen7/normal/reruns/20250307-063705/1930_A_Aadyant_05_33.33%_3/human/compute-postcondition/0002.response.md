Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for numbers in range(int(num))`. The variables involved here are `numbers`, `int(num)`, and implicitly `num` (since `int(num)` is derived from `num`).

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
   - `num` is an input integer.
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 50\).
   - `out` is an empty list.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `int(num)` is greater than 0. Since `num` is an input integer, we need to ensure that `num` is a positive integer.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - We need to ensure that `num` is a positive integer because `range(int(num))` will generate a sequence starting from 0 up to `int(num) - 1`.
   - The other variables (`t`, `n`, and `out`) do not directly affect the loop's execution condition and can remain as they are.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `num` must be a positive integer.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `num` must be a positive integer, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `out` is an empty list**.
