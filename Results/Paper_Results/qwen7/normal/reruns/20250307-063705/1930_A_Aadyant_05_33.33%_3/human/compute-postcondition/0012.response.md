Output State: **`a` must be a positive integer; list2 has appended the integer value of list1[2 * i]`.**

Explanation: The code appends to `list2` the integer value of `list1[2 * i]`. However, since the initial values of `list1` and `i` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact value that was appended to `list2`. We only know that `list2` now contains one additional element which is the integer value of `list1[2 * i]`. The value of `a` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
