Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `num` must be a positive integer, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `out` is an empty list, `list2` is an empty list, `list1` is an empty list, `a` is now the integer value of the input string, and the type of `a` is changed to integer.**

This means that the input string `a` has been converted to an integer, and the type of `a` is now an integer, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
