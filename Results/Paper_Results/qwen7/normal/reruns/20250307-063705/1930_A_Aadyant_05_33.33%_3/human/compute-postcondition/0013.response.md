Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i` and `a`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < a`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` must be a positive integer.
   - `list2` has appended the integer value of `list1[2 * i]`.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 at each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was one less than `a`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `a`.
   - Therefore, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its previous value.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `a` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop.
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
   - `list2` will append the integer value of `list1[2 * (i + 1)]` in the next iteration.

Given these points, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`a` must be a positive integer; `i` is 1 more than its previous value; `list2` has appended the integer value of `list1[2 * (i + 1)]`**.

To provide a concrete example, if `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` would be 3.
- `list2` would have appended the integer value of `list1[2 * 3] = list1[6]`.

So, the final state is:

State: **`a` must be a positive integer; `i` is 3; `list2` has appended the integer value of `list1[6]`**.
