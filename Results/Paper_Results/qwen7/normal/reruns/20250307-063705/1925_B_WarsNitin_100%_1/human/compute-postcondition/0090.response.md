Postcondition: `i` is 4, `x` is divisible by 4, `x` is at least `n * 4`, and the difference `(x - n * 4)` is divisible by 4. `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `i` if the condition `x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0` is met. If the condition is not met, `ans` remains unchanged.
