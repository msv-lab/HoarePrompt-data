Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `q` is 0, `x` is a positive integer, `ans` is the maximum of `ans` and `i` where `i` is incremented by 1, and if the condition `x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0` is true, `ans` is further updated to be the maximum of `ans` and `i`.
