Postcondition: `i` is 3, `ans` is the maximum of its previous value and 2. If the condition `x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and ((x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0)` is true, then `ans` is now equal to `x // 3`. If the condition is false, `i` remains 3 and `ans` keeps the value of its previous maximum with 2.
