Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `i`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` must be greater than or equal to 1.
   - `x` is divisible by `i`.
   - After executing the if-else block, `x` is at least `n * i` and the difference `(x - n * i)` is divisible by `i`.
   - `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `x // i` if the condition `x % i == 0` is met. If the condition is not met, `ans` remains unchanged.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time, the new value of `i` will be the previous value of `i` plus 1.
   - The conditions for `x` and `ans` remain the same as they are not directly modified by the loop itself but depend on the loop's execution.

5. **Calculate the new state**:
   - The new value of `i` will be `previous_i + 1`.
   - The conditions for `x` and `ans` remain the same as they are not directly modified by the loop itself but depend on the loop's execution.

Given the previous state:
- `i` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `x` is divisible by `i`.
- After executing the if-else block, `x` is at least `n * i` and the difference `(x - n * i)` is divisible by `i`.
- `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `x // i` if the condition `x % i == 0` is met. If the condition is not met, `ans` remains unchanged.

For the next iteration, the state should be adjusted as follows:
- The new value of `i` will be `previous_i + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`i` is previous_i + 1, `x` is divisible by `i`, `x` is at least `n * i` and the difference `(x - n * i)` is divisible by `i`, `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `x // i` if the condition `x % i == 0` is met. If the condition is not met, `ans` remains unchanged.**

To provide a concrete example, if the previous state was `i` is 3, `x` is divisible by 3, `x` is at least `n * 3` and the difference `(x - n * 3)` is divisible by 3, `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `x // 3` if the condition `x % 3 == 0` is met. If the condition is not met, `ans` remains unchanged.

Then the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`i` is 4, `x` is divisible by 4, `x` is at least `n * 4` and the difference `(x - n * 4)` is divisible by 4, `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `x // 4` if the condition `x % 4 == 0` is met. If the condition is not met, `ans` remains unchanged.**
