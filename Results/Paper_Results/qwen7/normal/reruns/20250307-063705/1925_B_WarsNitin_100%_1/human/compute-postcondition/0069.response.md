Output State: **The final value of `i` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `x`, and `ans` is the maximum value of `i` that satisfies the conditions within the loop.**

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, the loop variable `i` will take on the value of the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `x`. The variable `ans` will retain the maximum value it was updated to during any iteration where the conditions `x % i == 0` and either `x - n * i >= 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0` or `x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and (x // i) > 0 and (x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0` were met.
