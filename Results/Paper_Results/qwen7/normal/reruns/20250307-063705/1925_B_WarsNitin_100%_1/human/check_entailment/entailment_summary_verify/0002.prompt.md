You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

- Program:
from math import sqrt

def func():
    for q in range(int(input())):
        (x, n) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        ans = 1
        for i in range(1, int(sqrt(x)) + 1):
            if x % i == 0:
                if x - n * i >= 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0:
                    ans = max(ans, i)
                if x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and ((x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0):
                    ans = max(ans, x // i)
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by two integers \(x\) and \(n\). For each test case, it finds the maximum integer \(i\) such that \(x - n \cdot i \geq 0\) and both \(x - n \cdot i\) and \(i\) are divisible by \(i\). The function outputs the maximum \(i\) found for each test case. After processing all test cases, it prints the results for each one.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the maximum GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of `n` sub-problems whose difficulties sum up to `x`.

2. **Key Insight**: To maximize the GCD, we need to find the largest divisor of `x` that can be evenly distributed among `n` sub-problems. This means we need to check all divisors of `x` and see if they can form valid sub-problems.

3. **Algorithm Breakdown**:
   - For each test case, we read `x` and `n`.
   - We initialize `ans` to 1, which is the minimum possible GCD.
   - We iterate over potential divisors `i` from 1 to the square root of `x`. For each divisor:
     - Check if `x` can be divided into `n` sub-problems each with difficulty `i`.
     - Check if `x` can be divided into `n` sub-problems each with difficulty `x // i`.
   - If both conditions are satisfied, update `ans` to the maximum value found.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `x` is a prime number, the only possible GCDs are 1 and `x` itself.
   - If `x` is not divisible by `n`, the GCD must be 1.

5. **Implementation Verification**:
   - The code correctly iterates through potential divisors and checks if they can form valid sub-problems.
   - It updates `ans` appropriately based on the conditions.
   - The logic handles edge cases where `x` might be a prime number or not divisible by `n`.

6. **Output**:
   - The code prints the maximum GCD found for each test case.

Given the above analysis, the provided solution appears to be correct and follows the problem's requirements accurately.
