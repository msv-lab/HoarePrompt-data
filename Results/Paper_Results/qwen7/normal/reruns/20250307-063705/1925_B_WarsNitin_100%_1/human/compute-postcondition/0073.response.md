Output State: **`x` is an integer input from the user, `n` is an integer input from the user, `i` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `x`, `ans` is 1, `q` is the previous value of `q` plus 1.**

Explanation: The line `ans = 1` sets the variable `ans` to the integer value 1. This does not affect the values of `x`, `n`, `i`, or `q`. Therefore, those variables retain their initial states.
