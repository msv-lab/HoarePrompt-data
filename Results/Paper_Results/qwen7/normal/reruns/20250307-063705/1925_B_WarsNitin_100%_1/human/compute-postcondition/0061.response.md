Output State: **`i` is 3, `ans` is the maximum of 3 and 2**.

Explanation: The code updates `ans` to be the maximum of its current value (`i`, which is 3) and 2. Since 3 is greater than 2, `ans` is updated to 3. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 3. Therefore, the output state is that `i` is 3 and `ans` is the maximum of 3 and 2.
