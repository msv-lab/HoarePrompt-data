The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by two integers \(x\) and \(n\). For each test case, it finds the maximum integer \(i\) such that \(x - n \cdot i \geq 0\) and both \(x - n \cdot i\) and \(i\) are divisible by \(i\). The function outputs the maximum \(i\) found for each test case. After processing all test cases, it prints the results for each one.
