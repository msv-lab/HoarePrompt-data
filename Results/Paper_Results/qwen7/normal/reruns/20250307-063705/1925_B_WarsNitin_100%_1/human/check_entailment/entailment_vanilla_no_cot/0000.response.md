Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided solution correctly implements the logic to find the maximum balance of the problemset. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case.
2. **Factor Calculation**: For each test case, it calculates the factors of `x` using the square root method to optimize the search.
3. **Balance Calculation**: It checks both `i` and `x // i` as potential balances by ensuring that the remaining difficulty (`x - n * i` or `x - n * (x // i)`) can be evenly divided among the `n` sub-problems.
4. **Max Balance Update**: It updates the maximum balance found during the iteration.

The logic ensures that the program finds the highest possible GCD (balance) for the given constraints. Therefore, the provided solution is correct.
