Postcondition: `i` is greater than or equal to 1, and `x` is divisible by `i`. After executing the if-else block, `x` is at least `n * i`, and the difference `(x - n * i)` is divisible by `i`; `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `i`. The current value of `x` is `n * (x // i)`, and `x // i` is greater than 0.
