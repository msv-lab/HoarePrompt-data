Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `q` will be equal to `t - 1`, `x` will retain its original value, `ans` will be the maximum value found during all iterations of the loop that satisfy the given conditions, and `i` will be the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `x`.

This means that for each test case (`q`), the loop processes the values of `x` and `n` to find the maximum `i` that meets the specified conditions. After processing all `t` test cases, `q` will have been incremented `t - 1` times, making it `t - 1`. The value of `x` remains unchanged as it is only read at the start of each iteration. The variable `ans` holds the highest valid `i` found across all iterations, and `i` itself will be the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `x` since it is the upper limit of the loop range.
