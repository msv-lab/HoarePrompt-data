You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each test case, x and n are positive integers such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ n ≤ x.
def func():
    for q in range(int(input())):
        x, n = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        
        ans = 1
        
        for i in range(1, int(sqrt(x)) + 1):
            if x % i == 0:
                if x - n * i >= 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0:
                    ans = max(ans, i)
                if x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and (x - n * (x // i)) % (x //
                    i) == 0:
                    ans = max(ans, x // i)
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `q` will be equal to `t - 1`, `x` will retain its original value, `ans` will be the maximum value found during all iterations of the loop that satisfy the given conditions, and `i` will be the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `x`.
    #
    #This means that for each test case (`q`), the loop processes the values of `x` and `n` to find the maximum `i` that meets the specified conditions. After processing all `t` test cases, `q` will have been incremented `t - 1` times, making it `t - 1`. The value of `x` remains unchanged as it is only read at the start of each iteration. The variable `ans` holds the highest valid `i` found across all iterations, and `i` itself will be the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `x` since it is the upper limit of the loop range.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes three values: t, x, and n, where t is a positive integer between 1 and 10^3, and for each test case, x and n are positive integers between 1 and 10^8 and 1 and x respectively. It returns a result based on the relationship between x, n, and t.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
