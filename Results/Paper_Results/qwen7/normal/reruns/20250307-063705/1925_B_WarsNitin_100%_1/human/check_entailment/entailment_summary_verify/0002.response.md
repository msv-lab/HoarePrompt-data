### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the maximum GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of `n` sub-problems whose difficulties sum up to `x`.

2. **Key Insight**: To maximize the GCD, we need to find the largest divisor of `x` that can be evenly distributed among `n` sub-problems. This means we need to check all divisors of `x` and see if they can form valid sub-problems.

3. **Algorithm Breakdown**:
   - For each test case, we read `x` and `n`.
   - We initialize `ans` to 1, which is the minimum possible GCD.
   - We iterate over potential divisors `i` from 1 to the square root of `x`. For each divisor:
     - Check if `x` can be divided into `n` sub-problems each with difficulty `i`.
     - Check if `x` can be divided into `n` sub-problems each with difficulty `x // i`.
   - If both conditions are satisfied, update `ans` to the maximum value found.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `x` is a prime number, the only possible GCDs are 1 and `x` itself.
   - If `x` is not divisible by `n`, the GCD must be 1.

5. **Implementation Verification**:
   - The code correctly iterates through potential divisors and checks if they can form valid sub-problems.
   - It updates `ans` appropriately based on the conditions.
   - The logic handles edge cases where `x` might be a prime number or not divisible by `n`.

6. **Output**:
   - The code prints the maximum GCD found for each test case.

Upon closer inspection, the original assessment is accurate. The provided solution correctly implements the logic to find the maximum GCD of the sub-problems. The code iterates through potential divisors of `x` and checks if they can form valid sub-problems. It updates the maximum GCD found during the iteration.

However, there is a minor optimization that can be made. The current implementation checks both `i` and `x // i` as potential GCDs, but it can be simplified by only checking up to `sqrt(x)` and ensuring that the remaining part of `x` after distributing `i` sub-problems is also divisible by `i`.

Here is a simplified version of the code:

```python
from math import sqrt

def func():
    for q in range(int(input())):
        (x, n) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        ans = 1
        for i in range(1, int(sqrt(x)) + 1):
            if x % i == 0:
                if x - n * i >= 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0:
                    ans = max(ans, i)
                if x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and ((x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0):
                    ans = max(ans, x // i)
        print(ans)
```

This code is essentially the same as the original, but the original assessment already covers the correctness of the logic and the handling of edge cases.
