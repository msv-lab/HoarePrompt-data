Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i`, `x`, and `sqrt(x)`.
2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute if `int(sqrt(x)) + 1` is greater than 0. Since `x` is a positive integer, `sqrt(x)` will also be a non-negative number, and `int(sqrt(x))` will be an integer. Therefore, `int(sqrt(x)) + 1` will always be greater than 0.
3. **Adjust the states accordingly**: We need to ensure that the loop can start with a valid value for `i`. The loop starts with `i = 1` and increments `i` until `i` is less than or equal to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.

Given the initial states:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\)
- `q` is 0
- `x` is the first integer input
- `n` is the second integer input
- `ans` is 1

We need to focus on adjusting the states related to the loop head, which are `i`, `x`, and `sqrt(x)`.

Since the loop starts with `i = 1` and `i` will increment until it is less than or equal to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`, we need to ensure that `x` is a positive integer and that `sqrt(x)` is a valid integer.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `q` is 0, `x` is a positive integer, `ans` is 1, `i` is 1, `sqrt(x)` is a valid integer**
