Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `x`, `x` will still be the original input value, `ans` will be the maximum value between its initial value (1) and any `i` that satisfies the conditions within the loop, and `q` will be incremented by 1 for each iteration of the loop.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of the original input `x`. The variable `ans` will hold the highest value of `i` that meets the specified conditions during the loop's execution. The variable `q` will have been incremented by 1 for each pass through the loop. The value of `x` and `n` will remain unchanged from their initial inputs.
