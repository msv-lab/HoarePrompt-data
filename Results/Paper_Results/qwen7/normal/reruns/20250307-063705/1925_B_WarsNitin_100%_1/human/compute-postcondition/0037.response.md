Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `q` is 1, `x` is the first integer from the input, `n` is the second integer from the input, `ans` is 1, and `i` is the final value of the loop variable `i` after all iterations.**

Explanation: The line `ans = 1` initializes the variable `ans` to 1. All other variables (`t`, `q`, `x`, `n`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states as no operations are performed on them in this line of code.
