Output State: **`x` is now an integer input from the user, `n` is now an integer input from the user, `i` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `x`, `ans` is the maximum value of `i` that satisfies the conditions within the loop, `q` is the previous value of `q` plus 1.**

This means that the variables `x` and `n` have been updated to the integer values input by the user, while `i`, `ans`, and `q` retain their previous states relative to their initial conditions.
