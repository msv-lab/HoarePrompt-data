Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variables `i` and the expression `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\)
   - `q` is 0
   - `x` is a positive integer
   - `ans` is `x` if `x` is divisible by `i` (which starts at 1), else `ans` remains 1
   - `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration

4. **Determine the new state**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was the value it had before incrementing.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than or equal to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.
   - Therefore, `i` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `t` remains unchanged.
   - `q` remains unchanged.
   - `x` remains unchanged.
   - `ans` remains unchanged because the loop body is omitted and no operations affecting `ans` are mentioned.
   - `i` will be incremented by 1.

Given this analysis, the new state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `q` is 0, `x` is a positive integer, `ans` is `x` if `x` is divisible by `i` (which starts at 1), else `ans` remains 1, `i` is incremented by 1**. 

Since `i` is incremented by 1, let's denote the new value of `i` as `i_new = i + 1`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `q` is 0, `x` is a positive integer, `ans` is `x` if `x` is divisible by `i_new`, else `ans` remains 1, `i_new` is 1 more than the previous value of `i`**.

To provide a concrete example, if `i` was 5 at the end of the previous iteration, then `i_new` would be 6.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `q` is 0, `x` is a positive integer, `ans` is `x` if `x` is divisible by 6, else `ans` remains 1, `i` is 6**.

So, the final state is:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `q` is 0, `x` is a positive integer, `ans` is `x` if `x` is divisible by `i`, else `ans` remains 1, `i` is incremented by 1**.
