Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `q` is 0, `x` is a positive integer, `ans` is 1, `i` is 1, and if `x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0` holds true, then `i` remains unchanged and the conditions continue to hold. Otherwise, the conditions remain as they were before the if statement.**
