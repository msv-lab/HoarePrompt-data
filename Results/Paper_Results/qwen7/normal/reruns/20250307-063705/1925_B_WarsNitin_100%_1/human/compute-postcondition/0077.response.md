Output State: **`i` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `x` is divisible by `i`. Currently, `x` is at least `n * i` and the difference `(x - n * i)` is also divisible by `i`; `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `i`.**

Explanation: The line `ans = max(ans, i)` updates the value of `ans` to be the maximum between its current value and `i`. The conditions and relationships between `i`, `x`, and `n` remain unchanged.
