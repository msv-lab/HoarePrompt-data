Based on the initial state provided:

- The final value of `i` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `x`.
- `ans` is the maximum value of `i` that satisfies the conditions within the loop.

Given this information, let's break down the steps:

1. `i` is set to the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `x`.
2. `ans` is the maximum value of `i` that satisfies the conditions within the loop. Since no specific loop conditions are mentioned other than finding the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `x`, `ans` would be the same as `i`.

Therefore, `ans` will hold the value of the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `x`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of x)**
