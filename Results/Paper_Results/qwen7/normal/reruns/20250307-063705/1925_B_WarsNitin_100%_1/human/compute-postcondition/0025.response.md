Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `q` is 0, `x` is a positive integer, `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `i`, `i` is the previous value of `i` plus 1.**

Explanation: The code updates `ans` to be the maximum of its current value and `i`. Since `i` is the previous value of `i` plus 1, `ans` is now updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `i+1`. The other variables (`t`, `q`, and `x`) remain unchanged.
