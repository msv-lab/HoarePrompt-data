### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the maximum GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of `n` sub-problems whose difficulties sum up to `x`.

2. **Key Insight**: To maximize the GCD, we need to find the largest divisor of `x` that can be evenly distributed among `n` sub-problems. This means we need to check all divisors of `x` and see if they can form valid sub-problems.

3. **Algorithm Breakdown**:
   - For each test case, we read `x` and `n`.
   - We initialize `ans` to 1, which is the minimum possible GCD.
   - We iterate over potential divisors `i` from 1 to the square root of `x`. For each divisor:
     - Check if `x` can be divided into `n` sub-problems each with difficulty `i`.
     - Check if `x` can be divided into `n` sub-problems each with difficulty `x // i`.
   - If both conditions are satisfied, update `ans` to the maximum value found.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `x` is a prime number, the only possible GCDs are 1 and `x` itself.
   - If `x` is not divisible by `n`, the GCD must be 1.

5. **Implementation Verification**:
   - The code correctly iterates through potential divisors and checks if they can form valid sub-problems.
   - It updates `ans` appropriately based on the conditions.
   - The logic handles edge cases where `x` might be a prime number or not divisible by `n`.

6. **Output**:
   - The code prints the maximum GCD found for each test case.

Given the above analysis, the provided solution appears to be correct and follows the problem's requirements accurately.
