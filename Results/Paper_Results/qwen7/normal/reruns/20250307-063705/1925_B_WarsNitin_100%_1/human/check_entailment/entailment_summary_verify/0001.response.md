### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step using the provided function summary and the problem description.

1. **Function Summary Analysis:**
   - The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by two integers \(x\) and \(n\).
   - For each test case, it finds the maximum integer \(i\) such that \(x - n \cdot i \geq 0\) and both \(x - n \cdot i\) and \(i\) are divisible by \(i\).
   - This means the function is checking for the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the difficulties of the sub-problems.

2. **Program Logic Analysis:**
   - The program iterates through possible divisors of `x` up to the square root of `x`.
   - For each divisor `i`, it checks if `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`. If so, it updates the maximum balance.
   - It also checks the complementary divisor `x // i` in a similar manner.

3. **Edge Cases and Constraints:**
   - The program handles the constraints \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), \(1 \leq x \leq 10^8\), and \(1 \leq n \leq x\).
   - The logic seems to cover all possible ways to split `x` into `n` sub-problems while ensuring the GCD condition is met.

4. **Examples Verification:**
   - For the example input:
     - Test Case 1: \(x = 10\), \(n = 3\)
       - Possible splits: (4, 2, 4) -> GCD = 2
       - Correct output: 2
     - Test Case 2: \(x = 5\), \(n = 5\)
       - Only possible split: (1, 1, 1, 1, 1) -> GCD = 1
       - Correct output: 1
     - Test Case 3: \(x = 420\), \(n = 69\)
       - Possible split: (6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6,
