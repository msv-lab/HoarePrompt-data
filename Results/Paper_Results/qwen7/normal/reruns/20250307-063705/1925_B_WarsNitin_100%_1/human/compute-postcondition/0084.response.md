Postcondition: `i` must be greater than or equal to 1, `x` is divisible by `i`, and after executing the if-else block, `x` is at least `n * i` and the difference `(x - n * i)` is divisible by `i`. Additionally, `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `x // i` if the condition in the if statement is met. If the condition is not met, `ans` remains unchanged.
