Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `q` is 0, `x` is the first integer input, `n` is the second integer input.**

Explanation: The code splits the input into two integers using `map(int, input().split(' '))` and assigns them to `x` and `n`. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and `q` is still 0.
