Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `q` is 1, `x` is updated to the first integer from the input, `n` is updated to the second integer from the input, `ans` is the maximum value found during the loop iterations based on the conditions provided, and `i` is the final value of the loop variable `i` after all iterations.**

Explanation: The code `x, n = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` takes a line of input, splits it into two parts, and converts each part into integers. These integers are then assigned to `x` and `n`. The values of `t`, `q`, and the loop-related variables (`ans` and `i`) remain unchanged unless further operations modify them.
