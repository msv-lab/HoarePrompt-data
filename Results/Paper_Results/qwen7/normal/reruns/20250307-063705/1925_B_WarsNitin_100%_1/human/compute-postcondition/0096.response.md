Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 4
   - `x` is divisible by 4
   - `x` is at least `n * 4`
   - The difference `(x - n * 4)` is divisible by 4
   - `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `x // 4` if the condition `x % 4 == 0` is met. If the condition is not met, `ans` remains unchanged.

2. **Loop Head:**
   - The loop is defined as `for i in range(1, int(sqrt(x)) + 1):`

3. **Adjusting the States:**
   - The loop variable `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 until it reaches `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 4. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will be 5 in the next iteration.
   - The other variables (`x`, `n`, and `ans`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

4. **Updated State:**
   - `i` will be 5.
   - `x` remains the same.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `ans` remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 5, `x` is divisible by 4, `x` is at least `n * 4`, and the difference `(x - n * 4)` is divisible by 4; `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `x // 4` if the condition `x % 4 == 0` is met. If the condition is not met, `ans` remains unchanged.**
