Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `q` is 0, `x` is a positive integer, `ans` is 1, `i` is 1, `sqrt(x)` is a valid integer, and the current value of `i` is a divisor of `x`. If the condition `x - n * i >= 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0` is true, the postcondition remains unchanged. If the condition is false, the postcondition also remains unchanged since there is no modification in the else part.
