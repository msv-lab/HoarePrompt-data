Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from `1` to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.

3. **Determine the New Value of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1. The loop will increment `i` by 1 for the next iteration.

4. **Check the Loop Condition for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `i` must be within the range `1` to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.

5. **Update the State**: Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, the new value of `i` will be `2` for the next iteration. We need to ensure that `i` is still within the specified range. Given that `sqrt(x)` is typically an integer or a float, `int(sqrt(x)) + 1` will be the upper limit for `i`.

6. **Maintain the Value of `ans`**: The value of `ans` remains unchanged unless the condition `x % i == 0` is met and the postcondition is satisfied. Since the previous value of `i` was 1, the condition `x % 1 == 0` is always true, but the postcondition needs to be checked again for `i = 2`.

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the new value of `i` and the unchanged value of `ans`.

**State: **`i` is 2, `ans` retains its previous value**.
