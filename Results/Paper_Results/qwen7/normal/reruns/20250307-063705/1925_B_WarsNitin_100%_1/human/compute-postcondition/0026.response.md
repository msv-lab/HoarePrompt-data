Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `q` is 0, `x` is a positive integer, `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `i` if `x - n * i \geq 0` and `(x - n * i) \% i == 0`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged, `i` is the previous value of `i` plus 1.
