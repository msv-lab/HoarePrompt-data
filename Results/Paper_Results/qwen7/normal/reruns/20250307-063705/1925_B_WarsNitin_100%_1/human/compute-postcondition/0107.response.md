Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `q` will be equal to `t - 1`, as the loop runs `t` times. The variable `i` will be the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `x`. The variable `ans` will hold the maximum value found during the loop iterations that satisfy the given conditions. For each test case (`q`), `x` remains the same as the input value, and `n` also remains unchanged throughout the loop executions.
