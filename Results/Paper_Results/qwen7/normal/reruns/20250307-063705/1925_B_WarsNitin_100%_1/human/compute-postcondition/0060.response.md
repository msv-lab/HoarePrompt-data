Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
   - `i` is 2.
   - `ans` is the maximum of its previous value and 2, based on the condition `x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and ((x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0)`.

2. **Loop Head**: The loop is defined as:
   ```python
   for i in range(1, int(sqrt(x)) + 1):
   ```

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is within the range from 1 to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.

4. **Current Value of `i`**: From the postcondition, we know `i` is currently 2.

5. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 3.

6. **Condition for Next Iteration**: The loop will check if `i` is still within the range `1` to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`. Since `i` is now 3, it will depend on the value of `int(sqrt(x))`.

7. **Adjusting States**: We need to adjust the state of `i` to reflect the next value it will take in the loop. The other variables (`ans`, `x`, and `n`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 3, `ans` is the maximum of its previous value and 2, if the condition `x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and ((x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0)` is true. If the condition is false, `i` remains 3 and `ans` keeps the value of its previous maximum with 2.**
