Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `q` is 0, `x` is a positive integer, `ans` is the maximum of `ans` and `x // i` if `x % i == 0` and the condition `x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and ((x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0)` is true, and `i` is incremented by 1.
