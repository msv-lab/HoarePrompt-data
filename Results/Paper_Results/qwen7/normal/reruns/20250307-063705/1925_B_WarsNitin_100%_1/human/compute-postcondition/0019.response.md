Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `q` is 0, `x` is a positive integer, `ans` is the maximum of `ans` and `x // i`, `i` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans` to be the maximum of its current value and `x // i`. The value of `t`, `q`, `x`, and `i` are updated according to their respective descriptions in the initial state. The value of `i` is incremented by 1 after the operation.
