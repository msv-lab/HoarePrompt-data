Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes three values: t, x, and n, where t is a positive integer between 1 and 10^3, and for each test case, x and n are positive integers between 1 and 10^8 and 1 and x respectively. It returns a result based on the relationship between x, n, and t.**

Given the constraints and the lack of direct parameter definition in the function signature, it implies that the function might take these values as inputs indirectly through other means (e.g., from a list, dictionary, or through a series of calls). The function then processes these values and returns a result based on their relationships.
