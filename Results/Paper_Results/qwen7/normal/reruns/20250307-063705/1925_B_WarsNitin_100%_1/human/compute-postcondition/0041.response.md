Output State: **`ans` is updated to the maximum value between its previous value and `i`, `i` is 1.**

Explanation: The line `ans = max(ans, i)` updates the value of `ans` to be the maximum between its current value (`ans`) and the value of `i` (which is 1). Since `ans` was not previously defined, it is initialized to 1. Therefore, `ans` is now 1. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 1.
