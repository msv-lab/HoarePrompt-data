Output State: **`good_subarrays` is 0, `a` is a list of integers with length n, `b` is a list of integers with length m, `b_freq` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each element in `b`, `window_freq` is a Counter object containing the frequency of the first m elements in `a`.**

Explanation: The code creates a new Counter object named `window_freq` which contains the frequency of the first `m` elements in the list `a`. The other variables (`good_subarrays`, `a`, `b`, and `b_freq`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
