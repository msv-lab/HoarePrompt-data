Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to `m`, and the number of matches is greater than or equal to `k`; `good_subarrays` is incremented by 1.**

The code `good_subarrays += 1` increments the value of `good_subarrays` by 1. Since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `good_subarrays`, we only know that it has been incremented. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
