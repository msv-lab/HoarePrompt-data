Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be at least \(1048576\), `nums` is a list containing the values `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, k - 4194304]`, `idx` is 23**.

Explanation: The code `nums.append(k + 1)` appends the value of `k + 1` to the list `nums`. Since `k` must be at least \(1048576\), the new element added to the list is `k + 1`. The position of this new element in the list is the length of the list before appending, which was 23 (since the original list had 23 elements plus one additional element `k - 4194304`). Therefore, the index of the new element is 23. All other variables remain unchanged.
