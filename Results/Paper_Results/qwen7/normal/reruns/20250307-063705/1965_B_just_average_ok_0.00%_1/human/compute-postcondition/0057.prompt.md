Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n and k are positive integers satisfying 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n. Additionally, the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 10^7.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    nums = [(1 << i) for i in range(24)]
    idx = 0
    while k >= 1 << idx:
        idx += 1
    idx -= 1
    nums.append(k - nums[idx])
    nums.append(k + 1)
    nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)
    nums.remove(1 << idx)
    print(len(nums))
    print(*nums)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be non-negative and less than 1, `nums` is a list containing the values `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, -0.9999999999999999, k + 1, k + 21]` with the element `1 << idx` removed, `idx` is 20

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be at least \(2^{20} = 1048576\), `nums` is a list containing the values `[2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, -0.9999999999999999, k + 1, k + 21, k - 1048576, k + 1 + nums[20] + 1]`, `idx` is 20

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be at least \(1048576\), `nums` is a list containing the values `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, k - 4194304]` with the element `k + nums[idx] + 1` appended, `idx` is 23, and the number `1 << idx` (which is 16777216) has been removed from the list `nums`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
