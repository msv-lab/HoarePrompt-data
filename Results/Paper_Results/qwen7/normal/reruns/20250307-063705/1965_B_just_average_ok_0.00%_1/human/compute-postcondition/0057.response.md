Output State: **t is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `_` is 999, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be at least \(2^{23} = 8388608\), `nums` is a list containing the values `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, 16777216]` with the element `16777216` removed, `idx` is 23, and the numbers `k - 8388608`, `k + 1 + nums[23] + 1`, and `k + 1` are appended to the list.**

Explanation: The loop runs for `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. After `t` iterations, the value of `idx` will be 23 because the loop increments `idx` until `k < 1 << idx`. Since `k` is at least \(2^{23}\), `idx` will eventually reach 23. The list `nums` initially contains powers of 2 up to \(2^{23}\) and then gets modified by appending and removing elements based on the value of `k`. Specifically, it removes `1 << idx` (which is \(2^{23}\)) and appends `k - 8388608` and `k + 1 + nums[23] + 1` (which is `k + 16777216 + 1`). The length of `nums` is printed after each iteration, and since the loop runs `t` times, the final length of `nums` is `24 - 1 = 23` (since one element is removed).
