Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be at least \(1048576\), `nums` is a list containing the values `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, k - 4194304]` with the element `k + nums[idx] + 1` appended, `idx` is 23, and the number `1 << idx` (which is 16777216) has been removed from the list `nums`.**

Explanation: The code removes the element `1 << idx` from the list `nums`, where `idx` is 23. Since `1 << idx` equals `16777216`, this specific value is removed from the list. All other variables remain unchanged.
