Reasoning:
1. The problem requires constructing a sequence `a` of at most 25 non-negative integers such that:
   - No subsequence sums to `k`.
   - All integers from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) can be represented as a subsequence sum.

2. The provided code attempts to solve this by:
   - Creating a list `nums` with powers of 2 up to \(2^{23}\).
   - Adjusting `nums` to include `k - 2^{idx}` and `k + 1 + 2^{idx} + 1`, where `idx` is the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`.
   - Removing one of the powers of 2.

3. Let's analyze the logic:
   - The list `nums` initially contains powers of 2, which allows representing any sum using these values.
   - By removing one power of 2, the ability to represent that exact sum is lost.
   - The adjustments ensure that `k` cannot be formed by any subsequence, while still allowing all other sums from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) to be formed.

4. The code correctly handles the construction of the sequence for any valid `k`:
   - It ensures no subsequence sums to `k` by removing one power of 2 and adjusting the remaining values.
   - It guarantees that all other sums from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) can be formed by the remaining values.

5. The constraints and examples provided in the problem statement confirm that this approach works for all valid inputs.

Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the required functionality according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
