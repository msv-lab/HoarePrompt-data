Let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\). This value is not needed for the current print statement.
   - `_` is 0. This value is also not needed for the current print statement.
   - `n` is an input integer. This value is not needed for the current print statement.
   - `k` must be non-negative and less than 1. Since `k` is a float and must be less than 1, it could be any value like 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, etc., but the exact value is not specified.
   - `nums` is a list containing the values `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, -0.9999999999999999]` with the element `1 << idx` removed, where `idx` is 20.

2. **Determine the Removed Element:**
   - The expression `1 << idx` means shifting the binary number 1 left by `idx` positions. For `idx = 20`, this results in `1 << 20 = 1048576`.
   - Therefore, the element `1048576` is removed from the list.

3. **Construct the List `nums`:**
   - The list `nums` after removing `1048576` is:
     ```python
     [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, -0.9999999999999999]
     ```
     becomes:
     ```python
     [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, -0.9999999999999999]
     ```

4. **Print Statement Execution:**
   - The `print(*nums)` statement will print the elements of the list `nums` separated by spaces.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024 2048 4096 8192 16384 32768 65536 131072 262144 524288 2097152 4194304 8388608 -0.9999999999999999**
