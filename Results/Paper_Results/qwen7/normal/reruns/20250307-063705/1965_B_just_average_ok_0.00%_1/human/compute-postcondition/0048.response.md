Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be at least \(1048576\), `nums` is a list containing the values `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608]`, `idx` is 22.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `idx` as long as `k` is greater than or equal to \(1 << idx\). Given that `k` starts at least at \(1048576\) (which is \(2^{20}\)), and the `nums` list contains powers of 2 up to \(8388608\) (which is \(2^{23}\)), the loop will increment `idx` from 0 to 22 (since \(2^{22} = 4194304\) and \(2^{23} = 8388608\)). After 23 iterations, `idx` will be 22, and since \(2^{22} = 4194304 < 8388608\) but \(2^{23} = 8388608 \geq 8388608\) does not hold, the loop terminates. Thus, the final value of `idx` is 22.
