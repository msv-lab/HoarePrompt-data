Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be at least \(1048576\), `nums` is a list containing the values `[2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, -0.9999999999999999, k + 1, k + 21, k - 1048576, k + 1 + nums[20] + 1]`, `idx` is 20, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an integer**.

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. Since the initial values of `n` and `k` were placeholders (`an input integer` and `must be at least 1048576`), they are now specific integers obtained from user input. All other variables remain unchanged.
