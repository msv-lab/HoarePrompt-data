Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers: t, n, and k. For each test case, it constructs a list of specific integers based on k and prints the length of this list followed by the list itself. The list contains predefined values, the value of k adjusted in certain ways, and some removed values.**
