Let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\). This value does not affect the list `nums`, so we can ignore it.
   - `_` is 2. This value does not affect the list `nums`, so we can ignore it.
   - `n` is an input integer. This value does not affect the list `nums`, so we can ignore it.
   - `k` must be at least \(1048576\). This value does not affect the list `nums`, so we can ignore it.
   - `nums` is a list containing the values \([1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, k - 4194304]\).
   - `idx` is 23. This means the last element added to `nums` is `k + nums[idx] + 1`, where `nums[idx]` is `nums[23] = 8388608`.
   - The number `1 << idx` (which is 16777216) has been removed from the list `nums`.

2. **Constructing the List `nums`:**
   - The list starts with \([1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608]\).
   - The last element added is `k + 8388608 + 1`. Since `k` is at least \(1048576\), let's denote `k` as \(K\). So, the last element is \(K + 8388608 + 1\).
   - The number `16777216` is removed from the list. Since \(16777216 = 2^{24}\), and `idx` is 23, the number `16777216` is the 24th element in the original list (before adding the new element).

3. **Final List `nums`:**
   - The list `nums` after removing `16777216` and adding `K + 8388608 + 1` is:
     \([1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, K + 8388608 + 1]\).

4. **Length of `nums`:**
   - The length of the list `nums` is 24 (since we added one element and removed one element from the original 24-element list).

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be the length of the list `nums`, which is 24.

Output: **24**
