Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be at least 8, `nums` is a list containing the values `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, -0.9999999999999999, k + 1, k + 21]`, `idx` is 7.

Explanation: The loop continues as long as `k >= 1 << idx`. After the loop has executed 3 times, `idx` is 3, meaning `k` must be at least \(1 << 3 = 8\). Each iteration of the loop increments `idx` by 1. Therefore, after all iterations, `idx` will be incremented to 7. At this point, `k` must be at least \(1 << 7 = 128\), but since the condition is checked with `>=`, `k` must simply be at least 8 (as it was already checked to be at least 8 after 3 iterations and can only increase). All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `nums`) remain unchanged.
