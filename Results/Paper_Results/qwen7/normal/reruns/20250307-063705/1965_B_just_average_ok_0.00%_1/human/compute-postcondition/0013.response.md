Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be non-negative and less than 1, `nums` is a list containing the values `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, -0.9999999999999999]`, `idx` is 20**.

Explanation: The code appends `k - nums[idx]` to the list `nums`. Given that `idx` is 20, the value appended is `k - 1048576`. Since `k` is a non-negative number less than 1, `k - 1048576` will be a negative number very close to -1 (specifically, `-1048575.9999999999999999`). Therefore, the updated `nums` list includes this new value, making it `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, -0.9999999999999999]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
