Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be at least \(2^{20} = 1048576\), `nums` is a list containing the values `[2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, -0.9999999999999999, k + 1, k + 21, k - 1048576, k + 1 + nums[20] + 1]`, `idx` is 20**.

Explanation: The code removes the element at index `idx` from the list `nums`. Since `idx` is 20, the element `1 << idx` (which is `1048576`) is removed from the list. The resulting list contains all elements except `1048576`.
