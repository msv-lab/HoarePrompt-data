Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head is `while k >= 1 << idx:`. Therefore, the variables that can be adjusted are `k` and `idx`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop continues as long as `k` is greater than or equal to `1 << idx`.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `_` is 1.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `k` must be at least 1.
   - `nums` is a list containing the values `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, -0.9999999999999999, k + 1, k + 21]`.
   - `idx` is 1.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - For the loop to continue, `k` must still satisfy the condition `k >= 1 << idx`. Since `idx` is currently 1, the condition becomes `k >= 1 << 1`, which simplifies to `k >= 2`.
   - Therefore, `k` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute one more time.

Given these considerations, the states that need to be adjusted are `k` and `idx`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be at least 2, `nums` is a list containing the values `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, -0.9999999999999999, k + 1, k + 21]`, `idx` must be 1**
