Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n` and `k`.

2. **Sequence Construction**:
   - The program initializes a list `nums` with powers of 2 up to \(2^{23}\).
   - It calculates the index `idx` such that \(2^{\text{idx}}\) is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`.
   - It then constructs a new list `nums` by removing this power of 2 and appending `k - 2^{\text{idx}}`, `k + 1`, and `k + 2^{\text{idx}} + 1` to it.
   - This construction ensures that:
     - No subsequence sums to `k`.
     - All integers from 1 to `n` (except `k`) can be represented as a sum of some subset of the constructed sequence.

3. **Output**:
   - The length of the constructed sequence is printed.
   - The sequence itself is printed.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `k` is a power of 2. In such cases, the sequence is constructed to ensure no subsequence sums to `k` and all other integers can be formed.

Given the problem constraints and the logic of the program, the sequence construction ensures that the conditions are met for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
