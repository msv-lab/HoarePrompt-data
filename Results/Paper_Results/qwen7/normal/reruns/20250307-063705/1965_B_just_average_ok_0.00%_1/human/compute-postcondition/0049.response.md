Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be at least \(1048576\), `nums` is a list containing the values `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608]`, `idx` is 22

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `idx` as long as `k` is greater than or equal to \(1 << idx\). Since `nums` contains powers of 2 starting from \(1\) up to \(8388608\), the highest index `idx` can reach is 22 (since \(1 << 22 = 4194304\) and \(1 << 23 = 8388608\)). After the loop has executed 22 times, `idx` will be 22, and `k` will be less than \(1 << 23 = 8388608\), causing the loop to terminate. All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `nums`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
