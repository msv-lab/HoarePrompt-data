Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be non-negative and less than 1, `nums` is a list containing the values `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, -0.9999999999999999, k + 1, k + 21]`, `idx` is 20`**

Explanation: The code appends to the `nums` list the value of `k + nums[idx] + 1`. Given that `idx` is 20, `nums[idx]` is `k + 1`. So, the new value appended is `k + (k + 1) + 1`, which simplifies to `2k + 2`. Since `k` is a non-negative number less than 1, `2k + 2` will be a value slightly more than 2 (specifically between 2 and 3). The other variables remain unchanged.
