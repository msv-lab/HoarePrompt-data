Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be non-negative and less than 1 (since the loop increments `idx` as long as `k >= 1 << idx`, and the highest value of `idx` can reach is 20, making \(1 << 20 = 1048576\)), `nums` is a list containing the values `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608]`, `idx` is 21.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, `idx` will be 21 because the loop continues to increment `idx` until `k` is no longer greater than or equal to \(1 << idx\). Since the highest power of 2 in the `nums` list is \(2^{20} = 1048576\), `idx` will eventually reach 21 when `k` is less than \(1 << 21 = 2097152\).
