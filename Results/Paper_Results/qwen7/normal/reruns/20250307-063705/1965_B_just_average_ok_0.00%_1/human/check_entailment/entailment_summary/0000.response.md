Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires constructing a sequence `a` of at most 25 non-negative integers such that:
   - No subsequence sums to `k`.
   - All integers from 1 to `n` except `k` must have at least one subsequence that sums to them.

2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The program iterates over each test case.
   - It initializes a list `nums` with powers of 2 up to \(2^{23}\).
   - It calculates an index `idx` such that \(2^{\text{idx}}\) is just below `k`.
   - It modifies the list `nums` by removing \(2^{\text{idx}}\) and appending `k - 2^{\text{idx}}`, `k + 1`, and `k + 2^{\text{idx}} + 1`.

3. **Verification**:
   - **No Subsequence Summing to `k`**: The modifications ensure that `k` cannot be formed as a sum of any subset of the resulting list. This is because the critical value `2^{\text{idx}}` is removed, and the additions `k - 2^{\text{idx}}` and `k + 2^{\text{idx}} + 1` do not include `k` directly or indirectly through simple sums.
   - **Subsequences Summing to 1 to `n` Except `k`**: The list includes all necessary values to form sums from 1 to `n` except `k`. Each value in the range can be formed using the remaining elements after the removal and adjustments.

4. **List Length and Constraints**: The constructed list has at most 25 elements, which fits within the constraint.

Given the analysis, the program correctly constructs a sequence that meets the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
