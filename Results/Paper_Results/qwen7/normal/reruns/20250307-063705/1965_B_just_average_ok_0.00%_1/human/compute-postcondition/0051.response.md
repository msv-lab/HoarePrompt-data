Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be at least \(1048576\), `nums` is a list containing the values `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608]` with an additional element `k - 4194304`, `idx` is 22**.

Explanation: The code appends the value of `k - nums[idx]` to the list `nums`. Given that `idx` is 21, `nums[idx]` is `8388608`. Since `k` must be at least \(1048576\), the new element appended to `nums` is `k - 8388608`. The other variables remain unchanged.
