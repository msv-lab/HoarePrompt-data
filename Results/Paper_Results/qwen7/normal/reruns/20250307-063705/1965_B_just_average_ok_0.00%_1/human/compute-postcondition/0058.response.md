Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes a series of test cases. Each test case includes three integers: t, n, and k, where t is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, n is a positive integer between 2 and 10^6, and k is a positive integer between 1 and n. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 10^7. For each test case, the function performs some unspecified operation using t, n, and k and returns the result of these operations.**

Note: The actual operations to be performed on t, n, and k are not specified in the given information, so the functionality description focuses on the parameters and their constraints.
