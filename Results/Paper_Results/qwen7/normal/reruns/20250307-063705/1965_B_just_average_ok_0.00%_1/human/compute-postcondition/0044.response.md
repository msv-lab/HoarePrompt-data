Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `k >= 1 << idx`.
2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\)
   - `_` is 2
   - `n` is an input integer
   - `k` must be at least \(1048576\)
   - `nums` is a list containing the values `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608]`
   - `idx` is 1

3. **Determine which variables affect the loop condition**:
   - The loop condition depends on `k` and `idx`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - For the loop to continue, `k` must be at least \(1 << idx\).
   - Given `idx` is currently 1, the condition becomes `k >= 2` (since \(1 << 1 = 2\)).
   - Since `k` must be at least \(1048576\) (which is much larger than 2), the current value of `k` satisfies the condition.

Therefore, no adjustments are necessary for the given states since `k` already meets the condition for the loop to continue.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be at least \(1048576\), `nums` is a list containing the values `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608]`, `idx` is 1**
