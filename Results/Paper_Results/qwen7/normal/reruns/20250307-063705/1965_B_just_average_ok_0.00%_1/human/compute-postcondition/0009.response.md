Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be at least 4, `nums` is a list containing the values `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608]`, `idx` is 3**.

Explanation: The variable `idx` was originally set to 2, and the code `idx += 1` increments `idx` by 1, making it 3. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
