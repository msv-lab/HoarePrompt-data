Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The only variable in the loop head is `_`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as the value of `_` is within the range specified by `range(int(input()))`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `_` is 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `k` must be non-negative and less than 1.
   - `nums` is a list containing the values `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, -0.9999999999999999, k + 1, k + 21]` with the element `1 << idx` removed, where `idx` is 20.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `_` is the only variable in the loop head, it needs to be adjusted.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 0.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be within the range specified by `range(int(input()))`.
   - Therefore, `_` should be set to 1 (the next value in the range).

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be non-negative and less than 1, `nums` is a list containing the values `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, -0.9999999999999999, k + 1, k + 21]` with the element `1 << idx` removed, `idx` is 20**
