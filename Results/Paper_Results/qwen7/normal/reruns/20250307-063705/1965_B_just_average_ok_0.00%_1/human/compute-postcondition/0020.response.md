Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `nums` is a list containing the values `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, -0.9999999999999999, k + 1, k + 21]` with the element `1 << 20` removed, `idx` is 20**.

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `k`. The values of `t`, `_`, `nums`, and `idx` remain unchanged. The list `nums` has the element `1 << idx` (which is `1048576`) removed.
