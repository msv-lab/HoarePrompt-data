Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not guarantee that there is no subsequence with a sum of `k`. In the provided solution, the last three numbers added to the list (`k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`) might form a subsequence that sums to `k`. For example, if `k = 7` and `idx = 2` (since `1 << 2 = 4`), the generated list would be `[1, 2, 4, 3, 8, 9]`. Here, the subsequence `[3, 4, 8]` sums to `15`, which is not `k`, but the subsequence `[3, 4]` sums to `7`, which is `k`.

To ensure no subsequence sums to `k`, a more careful construction of the sequence is needed. One possible approach could involve generating a sequence where the presence of `k` itself and its combinations with other elements do not allow any subsequence to sum to `k`.
