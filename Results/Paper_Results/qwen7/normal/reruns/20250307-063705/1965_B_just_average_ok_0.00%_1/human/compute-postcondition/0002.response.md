Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `nums` is a list containing the values [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608]**.

Explanation: The code creates a list `nums` using a list comprehension where each element is calculated as \(1\) left-shifted by \(i\) bits for \(i\) ranging from \(0\) to \(23\). This results in a list of powers of \(2\) from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\), which are the values \([1, 2, 4, 8, ..., 8388608]\). The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
