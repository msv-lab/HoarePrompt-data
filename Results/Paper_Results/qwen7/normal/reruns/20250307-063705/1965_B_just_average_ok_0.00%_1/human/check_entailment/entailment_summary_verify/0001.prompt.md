You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        nums = [1 << i for i in range(24)]
        idx = 0
        while k >= 1 << idx:
            idx += 1
        idx -= 1
        nums.append(k - nums[idx])
        nums.append(k + 1)
        nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)
        nums.remove(1 << idx)
        print(len(nums))
        print(*nums)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers: t, n, and k. For each test case, it constructs a list of specific integers based on k and prints the length of this list followed by the list itself. The list contains predefined values, the value of k adjusted in certain ways, and some removed values.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.

2. **Generating Sequence:**
   - The program initializes a list `nums` with powers of 2 up to \(2^{24}\).
     ```python
     nums = [1 << i for i in range(24)]
     ```
   - It then finds the index `idx` such that \(2^{\text{idx}}\) is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`.
     ```python
     idx = 0
     while k >= 1 << idx:
         idx += 1
     idx -= 1
     ```
   - It removes this power of 2 from the list.
     ```python
     nums.remove(1 << idx)
     ```
   - It then adds three new elements to the list:
     - `k - nums[idx]`: This ensures that the sum `k` cannot be formed using any subsequence.
     - `k + 1`: This ensures that there is a subsequence summing to `k + 1`.
     - `k + nums[idx] + 1`: This ensures that there is a subsequence summing to `k + nums[idx] + 1`.

3. **Output:**
   - The length of the modified list `nums` is printed.
   - The elements of `nums` are printed.

### Verification:

1. **No Subsequence Summing to `k`:**
   - By removing \(2^{\text{idx}}\) and adding \(k - 2^{\text{idx}}\), any subsequence summing to `k` would require including both \(k - 2^{\text{idx}}\) and \(2^{\text{idx}}\), which is impossible since \(2^{\text{idx}}\) is removed.

2. **Subsequences Summing to All Numbers from 1 to `n` Except `k`:**
   - The remaining elements in `nums` are powers of 2, and their sums cover all possible sums from 1 to \(2^{24} - 1\).
   - Adding \(k + 1\) and \(k + 2^{\text{idx}} + 1\) ensures that all numbers from `k + 1` to `k + 2^{\text{idx}} + 1` can be formed as subsequences.
   - Since \(2^{\text{idx}} < k\), the remaining elements can form all sums from 1 to `k - 1`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly generates a sequence that meets the problem requirements. It ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` and that all other sums from 1 to `n` except `k` can be formed.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
