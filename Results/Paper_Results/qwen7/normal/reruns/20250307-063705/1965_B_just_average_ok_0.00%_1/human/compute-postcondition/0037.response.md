Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `_` is 1 (though this variable is not used in the print statement).
   - `n` is an input integer (though it is not used in the print statement).
   - `k` must be at least \(2^{20} = 1048576\).
   - `nums` is a list containing the values `[2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, -0.9999999999999999, k + 1, k + 21, k - 1048576, k + 1 + nums[20] + 1]`.
   - `idx` is 20.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(*nums)
   ```

3. **Explanation of `nums`**:
   - The list `nums` contains 26 elements.
   - The first 20 elements are powers of 2 starting from 2 up to 8388608.
   - The next three elements are:
     - `k + 1`
     - `k + 21`
     - `k - 1048576`
   - The last element is:
     - `k + 1 + nums[20] + 1`
     - Since `nums[20]` is 8388608, this becomes `k + 1 + 8388608 + 1 = k + 8388609`.

4. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print(*nums)` statement will print all elements of the list `nums` separated by spaces.

Given the above, the output will be the list `nums` printed with each element separated by a space. The exact values of `k` and `n` are not needed since they do not affect the printed output directly.

Output: **2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024 2048 4096 8192 16384 32768 65536 131072 262144 524288 1048576 2097152 4194304 8388608 k + 1 k + 21 k - 1048576 k + 8388609**
