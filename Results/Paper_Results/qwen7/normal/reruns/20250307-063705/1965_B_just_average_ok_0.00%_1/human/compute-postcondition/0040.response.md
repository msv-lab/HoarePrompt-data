Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be at least \(1048576\), `nums` is a list containing the values `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608]`, `idx` is 20, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an integer**.

Explanation: The line `nums = [(1 << i) for i in range(24)]` creates a new list `nums` where each element is calculated as \(2^i\) for \(i\) ranging from 0 to 23. This means `nums` is updated to contain the powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\). All other variables remain unchanged.
