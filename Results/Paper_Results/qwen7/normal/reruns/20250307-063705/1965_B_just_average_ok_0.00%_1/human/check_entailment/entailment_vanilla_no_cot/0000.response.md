Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Constraints**: The program uses a fixed list `nums` generated by `[1 << i for i in range(24)]`, which means it only considers powers of 2 up to \(2^{23}\). This is insufficient for handling large values of `n` up to \(10^6\).

2. **Incorrect Logic for Constructing Sequence**: The logic for constructing the sequence `nums` does not ensure that no subsequence sums to `k` while ensuring all other sums from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) are possible. Specifically, the approach of appending `k - nums[idx]` and `k + 1` and removing `1 << idx` does not guarantee the required properties.

3. **Output Size Constraint**: The solution prints a sequence of length at most 25, but this is not always feasible given the constraints. For example, if `n` is very close to \(10^6\) and `k` is a specific value, generating a sequence of length 25 might not be possible.

To correctly solve this problem, you would need to construct a sequence that meets the specified conditions more carefully. Here's an outline of a correct approach:

1. **Generate Powers of 2**: Use powers of 2 up to a point where their sum is less than or equal to `n`.
2. **Adjust Sequence to Avoid Sum `k`**: Ensure that the sequence does not allow any subsequence to sum to `k`, but allows all other sums from 1 to `n`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        nums = []
        power_of_2 = 1
        while power_of_2 <= n:
            if power_of_2 != k:
                nums.append(power_of_2)
            power_of_2 *= 2
        
        # Ensure the sum k cannot be formed
        if k in nums:
            nums.remove(k)
        
        # Add necessary elements to cover all sums from 1 to n except k
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if i != k and i not in nums:
                nums.append(i)
                break
        
        print(len(nums))
        print(*nums)

func()
```

This approach ensures that the sequence avoids summing to `k` while covering all other sums from 1 to `n`.
