Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `nums` is a list containing the values [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608], `idx` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `idx` to 0. Since `t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, and `nums` were not affected by this line of code, their states remain unchanged.
