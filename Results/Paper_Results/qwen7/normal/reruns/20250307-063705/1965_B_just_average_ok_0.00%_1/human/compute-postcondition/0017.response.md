Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\). This value is not needed for the specific print statement we need to evaluate.
   - `_` is 0. This value is also not needed for the specific print statement.
   - `n` is an input integer. This value is not needed for the specific print statement.
   - `k` must be non-negative and less than 1. This means `k` is a float between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive).
   - `nums` is a list containing the values `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, -0.9999999999999999, k + 1, k + 21]` with the element `1 << idx` removed, where `idx` is 20.

2. **List `nums`:**
   - The list contains powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\) (which is 1048576).
   - The element `1 << idx` where `idx` is 20 is `1 << 20`, which is \(2^{20} = 1048576\).
   - Therefore, the list `nums` after removing `1048576` is `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, -0.9999999999999999, k + 1, k + 21]` without `1048576`.

3. **Length of `nums`:**
   - The length of the list `nums` is 24 because it originally had 25 elements and one was removed.

Therefore, the print statement `print(len(nums))` will print the length of the list `nums`, which is 24.

Output: **24**
