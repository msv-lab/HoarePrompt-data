Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 1000, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.**

The code reads two integers, `n` and `k`, from the input using `map(int, input().split())`. This means that `n` and `k` are assigned the values of the first and second numbers entered by the user, respectively. The values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged.
