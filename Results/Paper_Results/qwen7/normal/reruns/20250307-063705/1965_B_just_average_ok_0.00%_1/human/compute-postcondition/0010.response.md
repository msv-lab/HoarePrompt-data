Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be non-negative (i.e., \(k \geq 0\)), `nums` is a list containing the values `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608]`, `idx` is the highest index such that \(1 \ll idx \leq k\).

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `idx` as long as `k` is greater than or equal to \(1 << idx\). Since the maximum value in the `nums` list is \(8388608\) (which is \(2^{23}\)), the loop will terminate when \(1 << idx > 8388608\). This means `idx` will be set to 23, which is the highest index where \(1 << idx \leq 8388608\). Therefore, after all iterations, `idx` will be 23, and `k` will be less than \(1 << 23 = 8388608\).
