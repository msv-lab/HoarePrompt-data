Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be at least \(1048576\), `nums` is a list containing the values `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, k - 4194304]` with an additional element `k + nums[idx] + 1` appended, `idx` is 23**.

Explanation: The code appends a new value to the list `nums`. The new value is calculated as `k + nums[idx] + 1`, where `idx` is 23. Since `nums[idx]` (where `idx` is 23) is `8388608`, the new value appended to `nums` is `k + 8388608 + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
