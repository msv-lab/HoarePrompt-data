Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State Descriptions:**
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\). This value is not needed for the print statement.
   - `_` is 2. This value is not needed for the print statement.
   - `n` is an input integer. This value is not needed for the print statement.
   - `k` must be at least \(1048576\). This value is not needed for the print statement.
   - `nums` is a list containing the values `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, k - 4194304]`. This list contains powers of 2 starting from 1 up to 8388608, followed by `k - 4194304`.
   - `idx` is 23. This index is used to append an element to the list `nums`.
   - The number `1 << idx` (which is 16777216) has been removed from the list `nums`.

2. **Appending the Element:**
   - The element `k + nums[idx] + 1` is appended to the list `nums`. Since `idx` is 23, `nums[idx]` is 8388608.
   - Therefore, the element appended is `k + 8388608 + 1 = k + 8388609`.

3. **Removing the Element:**
   - The number `16777216` (which is `1 << 24`) is removed from the list `nums`.

4. **Final List `nums`:**
   - The final list `nums` after appending and removing elements is:
     ```python
     [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, k + 8388609]
     ```
   - Note that `16777216` is missing from this list.

5. **Printing the List:**
   - The `print(*nums)` statement will print the elements of the list `nums` separated by spaces.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024 2048 4096 8192 16384 32768 65536 131072 262144 524288 1048576 2097152 4194304 8388608 [k + 8388609]**
