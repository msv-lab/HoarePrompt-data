Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.

2. **Generating Sequence:**
   - The program initializes a list `nums` with powers of 2 up to \(2^{24}\).
     ```python
     nums = [1 << i for i in range(24)]
     ```
   - It then finds the index `idx` such that \(2^{\text{idx}}\) is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`.
     ```python
     idx = 0
     while k >= 1 << idx:
         idx += 1
     idx -= 1
     ```
   - It removes this power of 2 from the list.
     ```python
     nums.remove(1 << idx)
     ```
   - It then adds three new elements to the list:
     - `k - nums[idx]`: This ensures that the sum `k` cannot be formed using any subsequence.
     - `k + 1`: This ensures that there is a subsequence summing to `k + 1`.
     - `k + nums[idx] + 1`: This ensures that there is a subsequence summing to `k + nums[idx] + 1`.

3. **Output:**
   - The length of the modified list `nums` is printed.
   - The elements of `nums` are printed.

### Verification:

1. **No Subsequence Summing to `k`:**
   - By removing \(2^{\text{idx}}\) and adding \(k - 2^{\text{idx}}\), any subsequence summing to `k` would require including both \(k - 2^{\text{idx}}\) and \(2^{\text{idx}}\), which is impossible since \(2^{\text{idx}}\) is removed.

2. **Subsequences Summing to All Numbers from 1 to `n` Except `k`:**
   - The remaining elements in `nums` are powers of 2, and their sums cover all possible sums from 1 to \(2^{24} - 1\).
   - Adding \(k + 1\) and \(k + 2^{\text{idx}} + 1\) ensures that all numbers from `k + 1` to `k + 2^{\text{idx}} + 1` can be formed as subsequences.
   - Since \(2^{\text{idx}} < k\), the remaining elements can form all sums from 1 to `k - 1`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly generates a sequence that meets the problem requirements. It ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` and that all other sums from 1 to `n` except `k` can be formed.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
