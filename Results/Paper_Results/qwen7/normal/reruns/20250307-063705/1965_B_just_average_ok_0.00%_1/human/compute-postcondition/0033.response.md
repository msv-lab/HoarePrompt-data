Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be at least \(2^{20} = 1048576\), `nums` is a list containing the values `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, -0.9999999999999999, k + 1, k + 21, k - 1048576]`, `idx` is 20, `nums` is appended with `k + 1`.**

Explanation: The code appends `k + 1` to the list `nums`. Since `k` is at least \(2^{20} = 1048576\), the new value added to `nums` is at least \(1048577\). All other variables remain unchanged.
