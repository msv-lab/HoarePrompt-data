Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `k >= 1 << idx`.
2. **Determine the current state of the variables involved in the loop condition**:
   - `k` must be at least 2 (as given in the problem statement).
   - `idx` is currently 2.
   - `1 << idx` means shifting 1 left by `idx` bits, which results in `1 << 2 = 4`.

3. **Check the current state**:
   - `k` must be at least 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `k` must be greater than or equal to `4` because `1 << 2 = 4`.

Given that `k` must be at least 2 and the loop continues as long as `k` is greater than or equal to `4`, we need to ensure that `k` is at least 4 for the loop to execute one more time.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `k` is at least 4.

**State:**
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\)
- `_` is 1
- `n` is an input integer
- `k` must be at least 4
- `nums` is a list containing the values `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, -0.9999999999999999, k + 1, k + 21]`
- `idx` is 2

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be at least 4, `nums` is a list containing the values `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, -0.9999999999999999, k + 1, k + 21]`, `idx` is 2**
