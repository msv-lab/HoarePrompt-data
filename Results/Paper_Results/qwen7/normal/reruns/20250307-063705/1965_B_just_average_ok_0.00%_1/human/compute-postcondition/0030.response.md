Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be at least \(2^{20} = 1048576\), `nums` is a list containing the values `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, -0.9999999999999999, k + 1, k + 21]`, `idx` is 21.

Explanation: The loop continues as long as `k` is greater than or equal to \(2^{\text{idx}}\). Starting from `idx` being 0, it increments `idx` by 1 each iteration. After 20 iterations, `idx` becomes 20, and the condition `k >= 1 << idx` (which is equivalent to `k >= 2^20`) will no longer hold because `k` is less than \(2^{21}\) but at least \(2^{20}\). Therefore, the loop will execute exactly 21 times. After 21 iterations, `idx` will be 21.
