State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, each test case has n and k as positive integers satisfying 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 10^7, `_` is 0**

### Explanation:
- The loop variable `_` is used in the loop header to iterate over the range of `int(input())`, which represents the number of test cases (`t`). 
- Before the loop starts, we need to ensure that the input for `t` is correctly set to a value within the specified range (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000).
- The loop itself does not modify or depend on the initial values of `t`, `n`, or `k` directly; instead, it reads these values from input for each iteration.
- Since the loop variable `_` starts at 0 and increments by 1 for each iteration, at the start of the loop, `_` should be 0.

Thus, the state to adjust for the loop to execute is that `t` is a positive integer within the specified range, and `_` is 0.
