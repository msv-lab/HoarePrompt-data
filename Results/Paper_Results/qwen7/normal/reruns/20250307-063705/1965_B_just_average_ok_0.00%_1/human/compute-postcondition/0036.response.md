Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State Description:**
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `_` is explicitly defined as 1.
   - `n` is an input integer (though its specific value is not needed for this particular print statement).
   - `k` must be at least \(2^{20} = 1048576\).
   - `nums` is a list containing the values \([2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, -0.9999999999999999, k + 1, k + 21, k - 1048576, k + 1 + nums[20] + 1]\).
     - Here, `nums[20]` is 1048576, so `k + 1 + nums[20] + 1` simplifies to \(k + 1 + 1048576 + 1 = k + 1048578\).
   - `idx` is 20.

2. **Code Snippet Analysis:**
   - The code snippet is `print(len(nums))`.

3. **Calculation of `len(nums)`:**
   - The list `nums` contains 26 elements (from the explicit values provided plus the calculation for `k + 1 + nums[20] + 1`).

Therefore, the length of the list `nums` is 26.

Output: **26**
