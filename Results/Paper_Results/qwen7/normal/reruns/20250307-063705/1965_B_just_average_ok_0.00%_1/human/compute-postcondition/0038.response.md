Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `_` and the range function. The range function takes an integer input from the user, which determines how many times the loop will run.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\)
   - `_` is 1 (this is the loop counter initialized to 1)
   - `n` is an input integer
   - `k` must be at least \(2^{20} = 1048576\)
   - `nums` is a list containing the specified values
   - `idx` is 20

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for each integer in the range specified by the user input. Since `_` starts at 1, it will increment by 1 with each iteration.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, the loop counter `_` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `_` will be 2 at the start of the next iteration.

5. **Other states remain unchanged**: The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `nums`, and `idx`) do not change based on the loop head alone; they are not affected by the loop counter `_`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be at least \(2^{20} = 1048576\), `nums` is a list containing the values `[2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, -0.9999999999999999, k + 1, k + 21, k - 1048576, k + 1 + nums[20] + 1]`, `idx` is 20**
