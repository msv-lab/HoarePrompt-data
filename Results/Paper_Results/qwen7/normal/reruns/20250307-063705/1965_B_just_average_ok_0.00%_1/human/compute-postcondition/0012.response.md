Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be non-negative and less than 1, `nums` is a list containing the values `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608]`, `idx` is 20.**

Explanation: The code `idx -= 1` decrements the value of `idx` by 1. Initially, `idx` was 21. After executing this line, `idx` becomes 20. All other variables remain unchanged.
