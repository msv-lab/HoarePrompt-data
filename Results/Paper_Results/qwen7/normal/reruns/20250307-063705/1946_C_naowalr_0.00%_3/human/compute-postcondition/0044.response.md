Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `x` is (L + R) // 2, either `L` is equal to `x` or `R` is equal to `x`, and `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`**.

The code `leftover = dfs(1, 1)` assigns the return value of the function `dfs(1, 1)` to the variable `leftover`. The values of `numCuts`, `x`, `L`, and `R` remain unchanged from their initial state.
