Output State: **`a` is an integer equal to the first number entered, `b` is an integer equal to the second number entered, `adj[b]` now contains the value `[a]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `a` to the list `adj[b]`. Initially, `adj[b]` contains the value `b`. After executing the code, `adj[b]` will contain `[b, a]`, but since `b` is already present and we are appending `a`, the updated state is that `adj[b]` now contains `[a]`.
