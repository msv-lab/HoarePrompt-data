Output State: **The loop has executed `n-1` times. The variable `i` is `n-2`. The variable `n` must be greater than 1. `a` and `b` are integers read from standard input, where `a` is the first integer and `b` is the second integer for each iteration. For each `i`, `adj[a]` contains `[a, b, a, ..., a]` (with `i+1` occurrences of `a`) and `adj[b]` contains `[b, a, a, ..., a]` (with `i+1` occurrences of `a`).**

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, the adjacency list `adj` will be fully populated based on the inputs provided. Each node `a` will have an edge to `b` and back, and this pattern will repeat for each iteration of the loop, ensuring that the graph represented by `adj` is fully connected as per the inputs given.
