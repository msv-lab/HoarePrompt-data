Output State: **The loop has executed `n-1` times, the variable `i` is `n-2`, the variable `n` must be greater than 1, `a` and `b` are integers read from standard input, where `a` is the first integer and `b` is the second integer for each iteration, `adj[a]` contains `[a, a, a, ..., a]` (with `n-1` occurrences of `a`), `adj[b]` contains `[b, a, a, ..., a]` (with `n-1` occurrences of `a`), and `L` is 1.**

Explanation: The line `L = 1` initializes the variable `L` to 1. No other variables are affected by this line of code. The conditions and values of the other variables remain the same as the initial state.
