The only objects in the loop head are variables `z` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `z` and `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `z` is 50001, and `t` is an unspecified value but must be greater than `z` for the loop to continue.

Given that `z` starts at 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `z` must be less than `t`.

At the end of the last iteration, `z` is 50001, so for the loop to execute one more time, `z` must be 50002 and `t` must be greater than or equal to 50002.

State: **`L` is 50001, `R` is 50001, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, `z` is 50002, `t` must be greater than or equal to 50002**
