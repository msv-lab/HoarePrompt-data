Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `R - L > 1`.

2. **Determine the current state**:
   - `numCuts` is 0.
   - `leftover` equals `dfs(1, 1)`.
   - `L` is the average of `R` and `L`.
   - `R` is such that `R - L > 1`.

3. **Check the loop condition**:
   - For the loop to continue, `R - L` must be greater than 1.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - The only state that directly affects the loop condition is `R` and `L`. Specifically, `R - L` must remain greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

Given the current state:
- `L` is the average of `R` and `L`, which means `L = (R + L) / 2`.
- `R` is such that `R - L > 1`.

For the loop to continue, `R` and `L` must be adjusted such that `R - L > 1` still holds true.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `L` and `R`.

State: **`numCuts` is 0, `leftover` equals `dfs(1, 1)`, `L` is the average of `R` and `L`, and `R` is such that `R - L > 1`**.
