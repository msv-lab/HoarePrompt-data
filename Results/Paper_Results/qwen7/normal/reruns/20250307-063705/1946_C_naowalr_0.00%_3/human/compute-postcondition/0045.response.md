Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `x` is equal to `L`, `L` is equal to `x`, and `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`**.

Explanation: The code `L = x` assigns the current value of `x` to `L`. Since `x` is defined as `(L + R) // 2`, and it is given that either `L` is equal to `x` or `R` is equal to `x`, after executing the line `L = x`, `L` will now be equal to `x`. All other variables (`numCuts` and `leftover`) remain unchanged.
