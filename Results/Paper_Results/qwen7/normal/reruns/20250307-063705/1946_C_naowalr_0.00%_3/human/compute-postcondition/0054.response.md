Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `range(n - 1)`. This means the loop will iterate from `i = 0` to `i = n - 2`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: Since the loop starts with `i = 0`, we need to ensure that `i` is initially set to 0.

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i < n - 1`. Therefore, `i` must be less than `n - 1` at the start of the loop.

4. **Check Other Variables**: The other variables (`L`, `R`, `leftover`, `z`, `n`, `k`, and `adj`) are not directly involved in the loop condition or the loop body (since the loop body is omitted). Thus, their values do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Based on this analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i` being set to 0 and ensuring that `i` is less than `n - 1` at the start of the loop.

**Final State:**
State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1**
