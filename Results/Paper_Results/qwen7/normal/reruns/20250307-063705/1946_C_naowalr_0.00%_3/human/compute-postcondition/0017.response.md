Output State: The loop will execute `n-1` times, where `n` is the number of nodes in the graph. After all iterations, `i` will be `n-1`. The variable `a` will be the first integer inputted, and `b` will be the second integer inputted. The adjacency list `adj` will be fully constructed such that for every edge `(u, v)` provided in the inputs, both `adj[u]` and `adj[v]` will contain each other. In other words, `adj[u]` will contain all vertices `v` connected to `u` by an edge, and vice versa.

To summarize, `i` will be `n-1`, `a` will be the first integer inputted, `b` will be the second integer inputted, and `adj` will represent a complete undirected graph with `n` nodes, where each node is connected to every other node via the edges specified in the inputs.
