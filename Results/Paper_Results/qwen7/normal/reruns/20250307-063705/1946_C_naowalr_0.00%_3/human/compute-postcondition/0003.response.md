Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `z` is 0, `n` is an integer obtained from the first space-separated integer input, `k` is an integer obtained from the second space-separated integer input, `adj` is a list of lists with length `n + 1` where each element is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an adjacency list `adj` for a graph with `n + 1` vertices (since the list index starts from 0). The values of `t`, `z`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged as no operations were performed on them.
