Output State: **`a` is an integer equal to the first number entered, `b` is an integer equal to the second number entered**.

This means that the code reads two integers from standard input (using `sys.stdin.readline().split()`) and splits them into a list. Then, it unpacks this list into two variables `a` and `b`, which now hold the respective integers. The exact values of `a` and `b` depend on the input provided by the user.
