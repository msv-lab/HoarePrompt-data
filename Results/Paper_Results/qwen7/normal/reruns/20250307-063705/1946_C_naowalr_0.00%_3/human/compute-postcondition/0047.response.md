Postcondition: `numCuts` is 0, `x` is (L + R) // 2, either `L` is equal to `x` or `R` is equal to `x`, and `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`. If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or (`numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`), then `leftover` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `leftover` is set to the value of `x`.
