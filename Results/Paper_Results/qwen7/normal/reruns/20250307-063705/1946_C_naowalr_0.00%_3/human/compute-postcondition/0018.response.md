Output State: **`L` is 1, `i` is `n-1`, `a` is the first integer inputted, `b` is the second integer inputted, and `adj` represents a complete undirected graph with `n` nodes, where each node is connected to every other node via the edges specified in the inputs.**

Explanation: The code simply initializes `L` to 1. This does not affect the values of `i`, `a`, `b`, or `adj`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain as described in the initial state, and `L` is updated to 1.
