The function processes an adjacency list representing a tree with \( n \) vertices. It reads \( t \) test cases, where each case includes \( n \) and \( k \). The function then determines the smallest integer \( L \) such that cutting the tree at depth \( L \) results in at most \( k \) connected components, with each component having at least \( x \) vertices, where \( x \) is calculated by a depth-first search (DFS) starting from vertex 1. The function returns the value of \( L \).
