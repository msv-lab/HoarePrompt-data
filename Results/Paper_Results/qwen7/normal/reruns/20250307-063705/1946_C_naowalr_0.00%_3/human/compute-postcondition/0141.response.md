Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `leftover` equals `dfs(1, 1)` returned value, `L` is the average of `R` and `L`, `R` is such that `R - L > 1`, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`**

Explanation: The code `leftover = dfs(1, 1)` assigns the return value of the function `dfs(1, 1)` to the variable `leftover`. Since the initial state does not specify the exact value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`, we keep it as `dfs(1, 1)` returned value. All other variables remain unchanged as no operations were performed on them.
