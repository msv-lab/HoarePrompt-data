Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is the integer entered as the first number, `b` is the integer entered as the second number, `adj[a]` now contains `[a, b, b]`, `adj[b]` now contains `[b, a]`**.

Explanation: The code `adj[b].append(a)` appends the value of `a` to the list `adj[b]`. Initially, `adj[b]` contains `[b]` (since `adj[b]` is initialized with `[a, b]` and `a` is the first element). After executing the code, `adj[b]` will contain both `b` and `a`, making it `[b, a]`. The value of `a`, `b`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged.
