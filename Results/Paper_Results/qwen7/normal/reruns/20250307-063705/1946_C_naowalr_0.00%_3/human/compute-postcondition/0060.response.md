Output State: **`a` is an integer equal to the first number entered, `b` is an integer equal to the second number entered, `adj[b]` contains the value `[integer equal to the first number entered, `a`], `i` is `n - 1`**.

Explanation: The code appends the value of `b` to the list `adj[a]`. Initially, `adj[b]` contains `[integer equal to the first number entered]`, which means `adj[b]` contains `[a]`. After running the code, `adj[a]` will now contain `[b]`, and since `adj[b]` was updated to include `a`, it now contains `[a, b]`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
