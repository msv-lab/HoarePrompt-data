Output State: The loop will execute `n-1` times, meaning `i` will take on all integer values from 0 to `n-2`. After all iterations, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` will be the first integer entered, `b` will be the second integer entered, and for every edge added to the adjacency list, both `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` will contain each other, indicating that the graph is represented as an undirected graph with each pair of integers forming an edge. Specifically, `adj[a]` will contain all integers `b` such that there is an edge between `a` and `b`, and vice versa for `adj[b]`.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, `i` will be `n-2`, `n` will still be greater than 1, `a` will be the first number entered, `b` will be the second number entered, and the adjacency list `adj` will represent an undirected graph where each pair of numbers entered forms an edge between them.
