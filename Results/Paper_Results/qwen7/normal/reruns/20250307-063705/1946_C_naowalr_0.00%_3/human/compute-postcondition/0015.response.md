Output State: **`a` is an integer equal to the first number inputted; `b` is an integer equal to the second number inputted; `adj[a]` now contains the value `[b, a]`; `adj[b]` now contains the value `[a]`.**

Explanation: The code appends `a` to the list `adj[b]` and also appends `b` to the list `adj[a]`. Initially, `adj[a]` contained only `b`, so after appending `a`, `adj[a]` becomes `[b, a]`. Similarly, `adj[b]` was initially empty (or could have been anything), but after appending `a`, it becomes `[a]`.
