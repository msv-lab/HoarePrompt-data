Output State: **`a` is an integer equal to the first number entered, `b` is an integer equal to the second number entered, `adj[b]` contains the value `[first number entered, `a`], `i` is `n - 2`, and `adj[a]` contains the value `[first number entered, `b`]**.

Explanation: The code `adj[b].append(a)` appends the value of `a` to the list `adj[b]`. Initially, `adj[b]` contains `[first number entered, `a`]`. After appending `a` to `adj[b]`, `adj[b]` becomes `[first number entered, `a`, `a`]. However, since `a` is already present in the list, it remains unchanged. Similarly, `adj[a].append(b)` appends `b` to the list `adj[a]`, making `adj[a]` contain `[first number entered, `b`]. The values of `a`, `b`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged.
