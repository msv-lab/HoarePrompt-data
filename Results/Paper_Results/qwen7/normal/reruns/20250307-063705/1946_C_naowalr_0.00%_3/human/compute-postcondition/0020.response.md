Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `L` is 1, `i` is `n-1`, `a` is the first integer inputted, `b` is the second integer inputted, `adj` represents a complete undirected graph with `n` nodes, `R` is 100001.**

Explanation: The line `numCuts = 0` initializes the variable `numCuts` to 0. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `L`, `i`, `a`, `b`, `adj`, and `R` remain unchanged from their initial states.
