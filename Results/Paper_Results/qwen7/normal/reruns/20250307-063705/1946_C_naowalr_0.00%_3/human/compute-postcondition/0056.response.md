Output State: **`a` is an integer equal to the first number entered, `b` is an integer equal to the second number entered, `adj[a]` now contains the value `b`.**

Explanation: The line of code `adj[a].append(b)` appends the value of `b` to the list `adj[a]`. Since `a` is an integer equal to the first number entered and `b` is an integer equal to the second number entered, after executing the code, `adj[a]` will contain the value `b`. The initial values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged.
