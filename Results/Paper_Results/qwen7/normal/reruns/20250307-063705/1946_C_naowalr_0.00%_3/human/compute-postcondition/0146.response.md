Output State: `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` equals `dfs(1, 1)` returned value, `L` is 1, and `R` is 100001.

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, the condition `R - L > 1` will no longer be satisfied because `R` and `L` will have converged to the same value or be as close as possible while still maintaining `R - L > 1` is false. Given that the loop's termination condition is `R - L > 1`, once this condition fails, the loop stops. Since the output state after the third iteration indicates that `numCuts` is 0 and `leftover` equals `dfs(1, 1)` returned value, and considering that `L` and `R` do not change further when the loop exits, we can conclude that these values remain the same. Therefore, the final output state will have `numCuts` as 0, `leftover` as the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, `L` as 1, and `R` as 100001.
