Output State: **`numCuts` is 0**

Explanation: The line `numCuts = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `numCuts`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `numCuts` is set to 0, while `i` is `n-2`, `n` is greater than 1, `a` and `b` are integers read from standard input, `adj[a]` contains `[a, a, a, ..., a]` (with `n-1` occurrences of `a`), `adj[b]` contains `[b, a, a, ..., a]` (with `n-1` occurrences of `a`), and `L` is 1; `R` is 100001; `x` is `(1 + 100001) // 2`.
