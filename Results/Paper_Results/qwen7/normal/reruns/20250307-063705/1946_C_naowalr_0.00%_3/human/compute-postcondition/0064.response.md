Output State: **`a` is an integer equal to the first number entered, `b` is an integer equal to the second number entered, `adj[b]` contains the value `[first number entered, `a`], `i` is `n - 2`, and `adj[a].append(b)` appends `b` to the list `adj[a]`.**

Explanation: The code `adj[a].append(b)` appends the value of `b` to the list stored in `adj[a]`. Initially, `adj[b]` contains `[first number entered, `a`],` which means that `adj` is a dictionary where `b` is a key, and its corresponding value is a list containing `a` and the first number entered. After executing the code, `adj[a]` will now contain `b` in addition to the existing elements `[first number entered, `a`]`. The values of `a`, `b`, `i`, and the structure of `adj` are updated accordingly.
