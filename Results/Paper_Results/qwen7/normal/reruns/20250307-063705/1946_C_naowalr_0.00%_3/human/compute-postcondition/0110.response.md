Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is the integer input converted to int, `b` is the second integer input converted to int, `adj[a]` now contains the value `[a, b, a]`, `adj[b]` now contains the value `[b, a]`**.

Explanation: The line `adj[b].append(a)` appends the value of `a` to the list `adj[b]`. Initially, `adj[a]` contains `[a, b]`, which means `a` and `b` are connected. After appending `a` to `adj[b]`, `adj[b]` will contain `[b, a]`, and `adj[a]` will now contain `[a, b, a]` because `a` was already present in the list. All other variables remain unchanged.
