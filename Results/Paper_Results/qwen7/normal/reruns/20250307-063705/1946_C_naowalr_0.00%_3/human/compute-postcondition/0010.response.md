Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is the integer entered as the first number, `b` is the integer entered as the second number, `adj[a]` now contains `[a, b]`**.

Explanation: The code `adj[a].append(b)` appends the value of `b` to the list `adj[a]`. Initially, `adj[b]` contains `[a]`, which means that when `a` is the key, the value is a list containing `[a]`. After executing the code, `b` is appended to this list, making `adj[a]` now contain `[a, b]`. The values of `i`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
