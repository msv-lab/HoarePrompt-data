Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `leftover` equals `dfs(1, 1)`, `L` is the average of `R` and `L`, `R` is such that `R - L > 1`, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`**.

Explanation: The code calculates `x` as the integer division of the sum of `L` and `R` by 2. Since `L` is the average of `R` and `L`, we can express `L` as `(R + L) / 2`. However, the exact numerical values of `L` and `R` are not provided, so we keep them in their general form. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
