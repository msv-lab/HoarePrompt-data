Output State: **The loop has executed `n-1` times, the variable `i` is `n-2`, the variable `n` must be greater than 1, `a` and `b` are integers read from standard input, where `a` is the first integer and `b` is the second integer for each iteration, `adj[a]` contains `[a, a, a, ..., a]` (with `n-1` occurrences of `a`), `adj[b]` contains `[b, a, a, ..., a]` (with `n-1` occurrences of `a`), and `L` is 1; `R` is 100001.**

Explanation: The code `R = int(100000.0 + 1)` assigns the value `100001` to the variable `R`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
