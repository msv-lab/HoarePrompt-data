Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is the first integer entered, `b` is the second integer entered.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the standard input using `sys.stdin.readline().split()`, which splits the input into a list of strings, and then converts these strings into integers using `map(int, ...)`. These integers are then assigned to the variables `a` and `b`. The variable `i` remains unchanged at 0, and the condition that `n` must be greater than 1 is still valid.
