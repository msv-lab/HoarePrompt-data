Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies `i` and `n - 1`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` is an integer equal to the first number entered.
   - `b` is an integer equal to the second number entered.
   - `adj[b]` now contains the value `[a]`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n - 2` (since `range(n - 1)` generates values from `0` to `n - 2`).

4. **Determine the state adjustments needed**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have been one less than the upper bound of the loop, which is `n - 2`.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it `n - 1`.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - The variable `i` needs to be adjusted to `n - 1`.
   - The variable `n` remains unchanged.

6. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `a` remains an integer equal to the first number entered.
   - `b` remains an integer equal to the second number entered.
   - `adj[b]` still contains the value `[a]`.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`a` is an integer equal to the first number entered, `b` is an integer equal to the second number entered, `adj[b]` contains the value `[a]`, `i` is `n - 1`**.
