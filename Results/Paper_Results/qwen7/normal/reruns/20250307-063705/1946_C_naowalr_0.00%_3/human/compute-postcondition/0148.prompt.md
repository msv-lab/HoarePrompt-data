Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, and `t` is assigned the value of the first line from standard input.
Code of the loop:
for z in range(t):
    n, k = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))
    adj = [[] for i in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(n - 1):
        a, b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))
        adj[a].append(b)
        adj[b].append(a)
    L = 1
    R = int(100000.0 + 1)
    numCuts = 0
    while R - L > 1:
        x = (L + R) // 2
        numCuts = 0
        leftover = dfs(1, 1)
        if numCuts > k or numCuts == k and leftover >= x:
            L = x
        else:
            R = x
    print(L)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: numCuts is 0, L is R, and leftover is the value returned by dfs(1, 1).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `L` is 50001, `R` is 50001, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`.

Explanation: After the loop executes, the condition `R - L > 1` will no longer be true because `L` and `R` converge to the same value, which is the midpoint of the initial range [1, 100001]. Given that the loop continues to update `L` and `R` based on the condition inside the while loop, and considering the initial values and the nature of the binary search-like approach, `L` and `R` will both become 50001 after the loop completes. The variable `numCuts` remains 0 as it is not incremented within the loop, and `leftover` retains its value from the last call to `dfs(1, 1)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` equals `dfs(1, 1)` returned value, `L` is 1, and `R` is 100001.

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, the condition `R - L > 1` will no longer be satisfied because `R` and `L` will have converged to the same value or be as close as possible while still maintaining `R - L > 1` is false. Given that the loop's termination condition is `R - L > 1`, once this condition fails, the loop stops. Since the output state after the third iteration indicates that `numCuts` is 0 and `leftover` equals `dfs(1, 1)` returned value, and considering that `L` and `R` do not change further when the loop exits, we can conclude that these values remain the same. Therefore, the final output state will have `numCuts` as 0, `leftover` as the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, `L` as 1, and `R` as 100001.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
