Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 0
   - `n` must be greater than 1
   - `a` is the first integer input
   - `b` is the second integer input
   - `adj[b]` now contains the value `[a]`

2. **Loop Head Analysis:**
   - The loop is defined as `for i in range(n - 1):`
   - This means the loop will iterate from `i = 0` to `i = n - 2`.

3. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.

4. **Condition for Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n - 1`.
   - Since `i` is currently 0, it needs to be incremented to 1 for the next iteration.

5. **Adjusting the State:**
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 1.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is a condition for the loop but not modified within the loop itself.
   - `a` and `b` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.
   - `adj[b]` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop itself.

6. **Final State for the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `i` is now 1
   - `n` must still be greater than 1
   - `a` is the first integer input (unchanged)
   - `b` is the second integer input (unchanged)
   - `adj[b]` now contains the value `[a]` (unchanged)

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is the first integer input, `b` is the second integer input, `adj[b]` now contains the value `[a]`**
