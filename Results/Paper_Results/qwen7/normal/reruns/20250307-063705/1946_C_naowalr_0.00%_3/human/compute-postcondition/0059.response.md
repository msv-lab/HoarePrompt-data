Output State: **`a` is an integer equal to the first number entered, `b` is an integer equal to the second number entered, `adj[b]` contains the value `[integer equal to the first number entered], `i` is `n - 1`**.

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the standard input using `sys.stdin.readline().split()`, which splits the input into two parts, and then converts them into integers using `map(int)`. These integers are then assigned to `a` and `b` respectively. The value of `adj[b]` is updated to contain the value of `a` in a list. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
