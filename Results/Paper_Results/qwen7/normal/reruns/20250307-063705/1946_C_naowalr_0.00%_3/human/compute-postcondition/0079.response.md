Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, and `R` is `x`.**

Explanation: The variable `R` is assigned the value of `x`. The values of `numCuts` and `leftover` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the output state includes these unchanged values along with the new value assigned to `R`.
