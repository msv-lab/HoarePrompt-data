Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables: `i`, `n - 1`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: The variable `i` is initialized to 0 in the `range(n - 1)` function call.

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i < n - 1`. Therefore, `i` must be less than `n - 1` for the loop to execute.

4. **Initial Values of Other Variables**: 
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `z` is 0.
   - `n` is an integer obtained from the first space-separated integer input.
   - `k` is an integer obtained from the second space-separated integer input.
   - `adj` is a list of lists with length `n + 1` where each element is an empty list.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `i` is initialized to 0, we need to ensure that `i` is less than `n - 1` for the loop to execute.
   - The values of `t`, `z`, `k`, and `adj` do not directly affect the loop condition and can remain as given.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1**.

This ensures that `i < n - 1` holds true for the first iteration of the loop.
