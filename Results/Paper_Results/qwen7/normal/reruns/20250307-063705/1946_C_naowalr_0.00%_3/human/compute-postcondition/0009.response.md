Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is the integer entered as the first number, `b` is the integer entered as the second number, `adj[b]` now contains `[a]`**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the standard input using `sys.stdin.readline().split()` and assigns them to variables `a` and `b` after converting them to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `adj[b]` are updated accordingly. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 1 remains unchanged, and the initial value of `a` is replaced by the first integer entered, while the initial value of `b` is replaced by the second integer entered. The list `adj[b]` is updated to contain the value of `a`.
