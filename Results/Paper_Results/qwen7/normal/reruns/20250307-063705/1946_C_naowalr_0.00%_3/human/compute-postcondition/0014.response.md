Output State: **`a` is an integer equal to the first number inputted; `b` is an integer equal to the second number inputted; `adj[a]` now contains the value `b` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code `adj[a].append(b)` appends the value of `b` to the list `adj[a]`. Since `a` and `b` are integers representing the first and second numbers inputted respectively, the list `adj[a]` will now contain `b` as its first (and only) element.
