Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `leftover` equals `dfs(1, 1)`, `L` is the average of `R` and `L`, and `R` is such that `R - L > 1`.**

Explanation: The variable `L` is updated to be the average of `L` and `R`. Since `L` was previously the average of `L` and `R`, updating `L` to be the average again does not change its value. The other variables (`numCuts`, `leftover`, and `R`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
