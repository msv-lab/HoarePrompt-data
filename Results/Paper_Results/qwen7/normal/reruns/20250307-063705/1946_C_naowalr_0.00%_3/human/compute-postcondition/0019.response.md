Output State: **`L` is 1, `i` is `n-1`, `a` is the first integer inputted, `b` is the second integer inputted, `adj` represents a complete undirected graph with `n` nodes, `R` is 100001.**

The code `R = int(100000.0 + 1)` assigns the value 100001 to the variable `R`. All other variables (`L`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `adj`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
