Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `x` is the average of `L` and `R`, `dfs(1, 1)` is returned, `L` is now equal to `x`, `R` and `L` must be adjusted such that `R - L > 1`.**

Explanation: The code sets `L` to the value of `x`, which was previously the average of `L` and `R`. The other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
