Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `x` is the average of `L` and `R`, `R` and `L` must be adjusted such that `R - L > 1`, `numCuts` is 0.**

Explanation: The variable `numCuts` is assigned the value `0`. The other conditions and relationships between variables (`x` being the average of `L` and `R`, and the requirement that `R - L > 1`) remain unchanged from the initial state.
