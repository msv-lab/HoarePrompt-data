Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `R - L > 1`.
2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `numCuts` is 0.
   - `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`.
   - The postcondition for the loop is based on the values of `numCuts`, `leftover`, `k`, and `x`.

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - For the loop to continue, the condition `R - L > 1` must be true.
   - Given that `numCuts` is 0 and `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, these values do not directly affect the loop condition `R - L > 1`.

4. **Check the loop condition**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `R - L > 1`.
   - Since `R` and `L` are the only variables involved in the loop condition, they are the ones that need to be adjusted.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to maintain the condition `R - L > 1`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `R` and `L` such that `R - L > 1`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, and `R - L` must be greater than 1**
