Output State: `L` is 50001, `i` is -1, `R` is 50001, `numCuts` is 0.

Explanation: The loop continues to narrow down the range `[L, R]` until `R - L` is no longer greater than 1. After each iteration, the midpoint `x` is calculated as `(L + R) // 2`, and based on the conditions provided, `L` or `R` is updated accordingly. Given the initial values and the conditions specified, after the loop completes, `L` and `R` will converge to the same value, which is the midpoint of the initial range `[1, 100001]`, i.e., `50001`. The variable `i` remains `-1` as it was not involved in any updates within the loop, and `numCuts` remains `0` as no changes were made to it within the loop either.
