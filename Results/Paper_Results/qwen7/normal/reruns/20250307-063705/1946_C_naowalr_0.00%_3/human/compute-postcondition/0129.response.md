Postcondition: `numCuts` is either greater than `k` or equal to `k` with `leftover` being greater than or equal to `x`; in both cases, `L` is `x`. If `numCuts` is not greater than `k` and does not meet the condition of being equal to `k` with `leftover` being greater than or equal to `x`, then `numCuts` remains 0, `leftover` remains the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, and `R` is `x`.
