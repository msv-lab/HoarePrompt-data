Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`**

Explanation: The line `numCuts = 0` simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `numCuts`. This does not affect the values of `leftover` or `x`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial values of `leftover` as the result of `dfs(1, 1)` and `x` as `(L + R) // 2`.
