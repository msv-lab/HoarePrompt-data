Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`, `L` is `x`, `R` is such that `R - L > 1`, and `x` is the average of `L` and `R`.**

Explanation: The variable `numCuts` is directly assigned the value `0`. The values of `leftover`, `L`, `R`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial conditions. Therefore, `leftover` is still greater than or equal to `x`, `L` is still `x`, `R` is such that `R - L > 1`, and `x` is still the average of `L` and `R`.
