Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `L` is 1, `i` is `n-1`, `a` is the first integer inputted, `b` is the second integer inputted, `adj` represents a complete undirected graph with `n` nodes, `R` is 100001, `x` is `(1 + 100001) // 2`**.

This means that `x` is calculated as the integer division of `(1 + 100001)` which results in `50001`. All other variables retain their initial or previously mentioned values.
