Output State: `L` is 50001, `R` is 50001, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`.

Explanation: After the loop executes, the condition `R - L > 1` will no longer be true because `L` and `R` converge to the same value, which is the midpoint of the initial range [1, 100001]. Given that the loop continues to update `L` and `R` based on the condition inside the while loop, and considering the initial values and the nature of the binary search-like approach, `L` and `R` will both become 50001 after the loop completes. The variable `numCuts` remains 0 as it is not incremented within the loop, and `leftover` retains its value from the last call to `dfs(1, 1)`.
