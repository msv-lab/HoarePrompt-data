Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ `t` â‰¤ 10^4, `z` is 0, `n` is an integer obtained from the first space-separated integer input, `k` is an integer obtained from the second space-separated integer input.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from standard input using `sys.stdin.readline().split()`, which splits the input into a list of strings. The `map(int, ...)` function converts these strings into integers. These integers are then assigned to the variables `n` and `k`. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and `z` remains 0.
