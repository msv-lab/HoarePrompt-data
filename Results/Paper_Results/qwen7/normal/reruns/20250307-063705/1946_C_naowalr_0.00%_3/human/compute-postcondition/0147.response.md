Based on the initial state provided:

- `numCuts` is 0.
- `leftover` equals the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`.
- `L` is 1.
- `R` is 100001.

The code snippet to be executed is:

```python
print(L)
```

From the initial state, we know that `L` is set to 1. Therefore, when the `print(L)` statement is executed, it will print the value of `L`.

Output: **1**
