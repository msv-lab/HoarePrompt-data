Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head**: The loop head includes `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` is an integer equal to the first number entered.
   - `b` is an integer equal to the second number entered.
   - `adj[b]` contains the value `[integer equal to the first number entered, `a`], followed by `a`.
   - `i` is `n - 1`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n - 2` (inclusive). Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n - 1`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` starts at `n - 1` and the loop runs until `i < n - 1`, `i` needs to be decreased by 1 to enter the next iteration.
   - `i` should now be `n - 2`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `a` remains unchanged.
   - `b` remains unchanged.
   - `adj[b]` remains unchanged.
   - `i` is now `n - 2`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`a` is an integer equal to the first number entered, `b` is an integer equal to the second number entered, `adj[b]` contains the value `[integer equal to the first number entered, `a`], followed by `a`, `i` is `n - 2`**
