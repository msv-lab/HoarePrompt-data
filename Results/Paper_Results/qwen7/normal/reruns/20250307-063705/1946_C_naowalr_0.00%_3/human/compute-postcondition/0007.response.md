Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is the first integer entered, `b` is the second integer entered, `adj[b]` now contains `[a]`**.

Explanation: The code `adj[b].append(a)` appends the value of `a` to the list `adj[b]`. Given the initial state, `adj[b]` was initially an empty list (since no elements were specified), and after appending `a`, `adj[b]` now contains the list `[a]`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged.
