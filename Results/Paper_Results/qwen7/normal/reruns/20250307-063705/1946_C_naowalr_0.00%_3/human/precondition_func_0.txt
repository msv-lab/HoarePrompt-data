t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each set of input data, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5. The adjacency list adj represents a tree with n vertices, where adj[v] is a list of integers representing the neighbors of vertex v. The value of each element in adj is an integer such that 1 ≤ v, u ≤ n.
