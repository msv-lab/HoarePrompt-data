Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is the integer input converted to int, `b` is the second integer input converted to int, `adj[b]` now contains the value `[a]`**.

The code reads two integers from the standard input and assigns them to variables `a` and `b` respectively. These values are converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The original values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged, and the list `adj[b]` is updated to contain the value `[a]`.
