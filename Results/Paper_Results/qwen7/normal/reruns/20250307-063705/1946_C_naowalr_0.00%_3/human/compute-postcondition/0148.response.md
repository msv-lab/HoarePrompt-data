Output State: `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` equals `dfs(1, 1)` returned value, `L` is 1, and `R` is 100001.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have been executed, the loop's condition `R - L > 1` will no longer be true, causing the loop to terminate. At this point, `L` and `R` will have converged to the closest values that satisfy the loop's condition before it fails. Given the initial range of `[1, 100001]` and the nature of the binary search-like approach used in the loop, `L` and `R` will converge to the same value or be as close as possible while still maintaining `R - L > 1` is false. Since the loop does not increment `numCuts` and `leftover` retains its value from the last call to `dfs(1, 1)`, these variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the final output state will have `numCuts` as 0, `leftover` as the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, `L` as 1, and `R` as 100001.
