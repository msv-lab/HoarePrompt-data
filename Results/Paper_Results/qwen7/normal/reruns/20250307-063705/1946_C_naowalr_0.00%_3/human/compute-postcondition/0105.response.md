Output State: **`i` is 0; `n` must be greater than 1; `a` is the first integer input; `b` is the second integer input; `adj[a]` now contains the value `b`**.

Explanation: The code `adj[a].append(b)` appends the value of `b` to the list `adj[a]`. Since `a` is the first integer input and `b` is the second integer input, `adj[a]` will now contain the value `b`. The other variables (`i`, `n`) remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
