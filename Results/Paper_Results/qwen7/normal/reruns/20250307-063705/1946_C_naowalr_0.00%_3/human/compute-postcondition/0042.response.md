Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `x` is (L + R) // 2, `dfs(1, 1)` is returned, and either `L` is now equal to `x` or `R` is equal to `x`, ensuring that `R - L > 1`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `x` to be the integer division of `(L + R) // 2`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition that either `L` is now equal to `x` or `R` is equal to `x` is preserved, and the difference between `R` and `L` remains greater than 1.
