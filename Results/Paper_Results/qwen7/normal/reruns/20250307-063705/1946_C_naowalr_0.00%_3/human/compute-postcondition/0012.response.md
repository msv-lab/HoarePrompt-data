Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies `i` and `n`. Therefore, only these two variables can be adjusted.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop condition is `i < n - 1`. This means the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `a` is the integer entered as the first number.
   - `b` is the integer entered as the second number.
   - `adj[a]` now contains `[a, b, b]`.
   - `adj[b]` now contains `[b, a]`.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Thus, `i` becomes 2.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged from the previous iteration, but it must still be greater than 1.

Therefore, the updated states for the next iteration are:
- `i` is 2.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `a` is the integer entered as the first number (unchanged).
- `b` is the integer entered as the second number (unchanged).
- `adj[a]` now contains `[a, b, b]` (unchanged).
- `adj[b]` now contains `[b, a]` (unchanged).

**Final State:**
State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is the integer entered as the first number, `b` is the integer entered as the second number, `adj[a]` now contains `[a, b, b]`, `adj[b]` now contains `[b, a]`**
