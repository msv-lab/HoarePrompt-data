Output State: `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` equals the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, `L` is 1, and `R` is 100001.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the condition `R - L > 1` will no longer be true, causing the loop to terminate. Given the behavior of the loop, where `L` and `R` are updated based on the value of `x` (which is the midpoint of the current range), and considering the initial range of `[1, 100001]`, `L` and `R` will eventually converge to the same value or be as close as possible while still maintaining `R - L > 1` is false. The provided output states indicate that after the third iteration, `L` and `R` are 1 and 100001 respectively, and `numCuts` remains 0. Since the loop does not modify `numCuts` or `leftover` after the loop exits, these values remain unchanged. Therefore, after all iterations of the loop have completed, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, `L` is 1, and `R` is 100001.
