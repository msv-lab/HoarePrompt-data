To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition and the given postcondition.

### Loop Condition Analysis
The loop condition is `R - L > 1`. This means the loop continues as long as the difference between `R` and `L` is greater than 1.

### Postcondition Analysis
The postcondition states that:
- If `numCuts` is either greater than `k`, or equal to `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `L` is `x`.
- If `numCuts` is 0 and `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, then `R` is `x`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head involves the variables `R` and `L`.
2. **Loop Continuation**: For the loop to continue, `R - L > 1` must hold true.
3. **Adjusting States**: We need to ensure that `R - L > 1` holds true for the next iteration.

Given the postcondition, the values of `R` and `L` are influenced by the conditions involving `numCuts`, `leftover`, and the result of `dfs(1, 1)`.

### Determining Adjustments
- **Initial Values**: We need to ensure that `R` and `L` are set such that `R - L > 1` holds true.
- **Possible Adjustments**:
  - If `R` is too close to `L`, we need to increase `R` or decrease `L` to satisfy `R - L > 1`.

Since the exact values of `R` and `L` depend on the postcondition, we need to ensure that the loop can continue based on the given conditions.

### Conclusion
To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `R` and `L` such that `R - L > 1` holds true. Given the postcondition, we need to ensure that `R` and `L` are set appropriately.

State: **`numCuts` is either greater than `k`, or equal to `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`; in both cases, `L` is `x`. If `numCuts` is 0 and `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, then `R` is `x`, and `R` and `L` must be adjusted such that `R - L > 1`.**

This ensures that the loop condition `R - L > 1` is satisfied for the next iteration.
