Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `leftover` equals `dfs(1, 1)` returned value, `L` is the average of `R` and `L`, `R` is equal to `x`, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`**.

Explanation: The code `R = x` updates the value of `R` to be equal to `x`. The other variables (`numCuts`, `leftover`, `L`) remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states.
