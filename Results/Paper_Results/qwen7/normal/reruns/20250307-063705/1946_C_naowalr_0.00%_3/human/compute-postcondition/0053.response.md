Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `L` is `R`, `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`, `z` is `t-1`, `n` is an integer input, `k` is an integer input, `adj` is a list of empty lists with length `n + 1`.**

Explanation: The code initializes an adjacency list `adj` for a graph with `n + 1` nodes, where each node is represented by an empty list. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
