Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `leftover` equals `dfs(1, 1)`, `L` is `x`, `R` is `x`, and `x` is the average of `L` and `R`.**

Explanation: The code `R = x` updates the value of `R` to be the same as `x`. Since `x` is defined as the average of `L` and `R`, and now `R` is also `x`, it means `R` is updated to be the same as `x`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
