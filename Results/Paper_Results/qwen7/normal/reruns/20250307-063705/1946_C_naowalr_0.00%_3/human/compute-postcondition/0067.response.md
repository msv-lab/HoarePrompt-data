Output State: All integers from 1 to n are connected through the adjacency list `adj`. Specifically, `adj[1]` contains a list of all integers from 2 to n, and for each integer `i` from 2 to n, `adj[i]` contains the list starting with 1 followed by all integers from 1 to i-1 and then i+1 to n (if applicable).

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, every node from 1 to n will have edges connecting it to every other node exactly once. The variable `i` will be `-1` since the loop runs from `0` to `n-2`, and when `i` reaches `n-2`, the loop condition `i < n-1` fails, stopping the loop.
