Output State: **`a` is an integer equal to the first number entered, `b` is an integer equal to the second number entered, `adj[b]` contains the value `[integer equal to the first number entered, `a`], followed by `a`, `i` is `n - 1`**.

Explanation: The code appends the value of `a` to the list `adj[b]`. Initially, `adj[b]` contains `[integer equal to the first number entered, `a`]`. After appending `a` again, `adj[b]` now contains `[integer equal to the first number entered, `a`], followed by `a`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged.
