Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is the first integer entered, `b` is the second integer entered, `adj[a]` now contains `b`.**

Explanation: The line `adj[a].append(b)` appends the value of `b` to the list `adj[a]`. Since `a` and `b` are defined as the first and second integers entered, respectively, `adj[a]` is updated to include `b`. The other variables (`i`, `n`) remain unchanged.
