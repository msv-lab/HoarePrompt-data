Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `leftover` equals `dfs(1, 1)`, `L` is the average of `R` and `L`, `R` is such that `R - L > 1`, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`**

Explanation: The code `numCuts = 0` simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `numCuts`. Since no other operations or changes are performed on the other variables (`leftover`, `L`, `R`, `x`), their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
