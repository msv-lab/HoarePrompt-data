Output State: **`i` is 0; `n` must be greater than 1; `a` is the first integer input; `b` is the second integer input; `adj[b]` now contains the value `[a]`**

Explanation: The code `adj[b].append(a)` appends the value of `a` to the list `adj[b]`. Initially, `adj[b]` contains the value `b`. After executing the code, `adj[b]` will contain `[b, a]`. However, since the initial state only mentions that `adj[b]` contains `b`, we update it to show that `b` is now followed by `a` in the list. All other variables remain unchanged.
