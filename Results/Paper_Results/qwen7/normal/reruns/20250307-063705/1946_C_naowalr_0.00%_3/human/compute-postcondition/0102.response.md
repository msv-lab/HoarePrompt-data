Output State: **`L` is 50001, `R` is 50001, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, `z` is 50002, `t` must be greater than or equal to 50002, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `adj` is a list of empty lists with length `n + 1`.**

The code creates an adjacency list `adj` with `n + 1` empty lists. This means that for each node from 1 to `n`, there will be an empty list to represent the edges connecting to other nodes. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
