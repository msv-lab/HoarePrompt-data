Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The loop has executed `n-1` times, the variable `i` is `n-2`, the variable `n` must be greater than 1, `a` and `b` are integers read from standard input, where `a` is the first integer and `b` is the second integer for each iteration, `adj[a]` contains `[a, a, a, ..., a]` (with `n-1` occurrences of `a`), `adj[b]` contains `[b, a, a, ..., a]` (with `n-1` occurrences of `a`), and `L` is 1; `R` is 100001; `numCuts` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while R - L > 1:
    x = (L + R) // 2
    numCuts = 0
    leftover = dfs(1, 1)
    if numCuts > k or numCuts == k and leftover >= x:
        L = x
    else:
        R = x


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `numCuts` is either greater than `k` or equal to `k` with `leftover` being greater than or equal to `x`; in both cases, `L` is `x`. If `numCuts` is not greater than `k` and does not meet the condition of being equal to `k` with `leftover` being greater than or equal to `x`, then `numCuts` remains 0, `leftover` remains the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, and `R` is `x`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` equals `dfs(1, 1)`, `L` is the average of `R` and `L`, and `R` is such that `R - L > 1`. If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or (`numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`), `L` becomes the average of `R` and `L`. Otherwise, `L` remains `x` and `R` remains `x`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` equals `dfs(1, 1)` returned value. If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or (`numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`), then `L` is equal to `x`. Otherwise, `R` is equal to `x`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
