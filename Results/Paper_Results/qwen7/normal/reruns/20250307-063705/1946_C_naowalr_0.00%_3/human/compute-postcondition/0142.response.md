Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `leftover` equals `dfs(1, 1)` returned value, `L` is equal to `x`, `R` is such that `R - L > 1`, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`**

Explanation: The code `L = x` assigns the current value of `x` to `L`. The values of `numCuts`, `leftover`, `R`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `L` now holds the value of `x`, which is `(L + R) // 2`.
