Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is the first integer from the input, `b` is the second integer from the input, `adj[b]` now contains the value `[b, a, a, b]`**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `a` to the list `adj[b]`. Initially, `adj[b]` contains the value `[b, a, a]`. After appending `a` to `adj[b]`, the list becomes `[b, a, a, b]`. The values of `i`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
