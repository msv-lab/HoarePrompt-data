Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `x` is the average of `L` and `R`, `dfs(1, 1)` is returned, `R` is equal to `x`, `L` and `R` must be adjusted such that `R - L > 1`**.

Explanation: The variable `R` is assigned the value of `x`. The value of `x` is the average of `L` and `R`, which remains unchanged. The return value of `dfs(1, 1)` also remains unchanged. Additionally, the condition that `R - L > 1` must still be satisfied.
