Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `R - L > 1`.
2. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `numCuts` is 0
   - `L` is 1
   - `i` is `n-1`
   - `a` is the first integer inputted
   - `b` is the second integer inputted
   - `adj` represents a complete undirected graph with `n` nodes
   - `R` is 100001

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - The loop will execute if `R - L > 1`.
   - Currently, `R` is 100001 and `L` is 1.
   - To satisfy the condition `R - L > 1`, we need to check if `R - L` is already greater than 1.

4. **Evaluate the current values**:
   - `R - L = 100001 - 1 = 100000`, which is indeed greater than 1.

Since the condition `R - L > 1` is already satisfied with the given values, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute the first time.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`numCuts` is 0, `L` is 1, `i` is `n-1`, `a` is the first integer inputted, `b` is the second integer inputted, `adj` represents a complete undirected graph with `n` nodes, `R` is 100001**
