Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 0
   - `n` must be greater than 1
   - `a` is the first integer entered
   - `b` is the second integer entered
   - `adj[b]` now contains `[a]`

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n - 1):
   ```

3. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < n - 1`.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will become 1.
   - Since `n` must be greater than 1, it remains unchanged.
   - The values of `a`, `b`, and `adj[b]` do not change within the loop head.

5. **New States at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than 1 (unchanged)
   - `a` is the first integer entered (unchanged)
   - `b` is the second integer entered (unchanged)
   - `adj[b]` now contains `[a]` (unchanged)

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is the first integer entered, `b` is the second integer entered, `adj[b]` now contains `[a]`**
