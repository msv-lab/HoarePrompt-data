Based on the initial state provided:

- `L` is 50001
- `R` is 50001
- `numCuts` is 0
- `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`

The print statement is `print(L)`. According to the explanation, after the loop completes, `L` converges to 50001. Therefore, the value of `L` that will be printed is 50001.

Output: **50001**
