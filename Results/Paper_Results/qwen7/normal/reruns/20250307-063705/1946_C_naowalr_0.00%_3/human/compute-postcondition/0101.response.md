Output State: **`L` is 50001, `R` is 50001, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, `z` is 50002, `t` must be greater than or equal to 50002, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**

The code reads two integers, `n` and `k`, from standard input using `sys.stdin.readline().split()`. These values are then unpacked into the variables `n` and `k`. The values of `L`, `R`, `numCuts`, `leftover`, `z`, and `t` remain unchanged from their initial states.
