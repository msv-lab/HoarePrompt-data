Based on the initial state provided:

- `numCuts` is 0.
- `L` is equal to `R`.
- `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`.

The `print(L)` statement will simply print the value of `L`.

Since `L` is equal to `R`, and no other information about `R` is provided, we can only say that `L` holds the value of `R`.

Output: **R**
