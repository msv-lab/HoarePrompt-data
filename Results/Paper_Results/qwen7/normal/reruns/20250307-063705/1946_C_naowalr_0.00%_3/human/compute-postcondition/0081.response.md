The loop condition is `while R - L > 1:`. This means the loop will continue as long as the difference between `R` and `L` is greater than 1. To determine which states need to be adjusted, we need to consider the variables involved in the loop condition.

The variables in the loop head are `R` and `L`. Therefore, we can only adjust these two variables.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
- `numCuts` is 0
- `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`
- If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or (`numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`), then `L` is `x`. Otherwise, `R` is `x`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `R - L > 1` must still hold true. This means either `R` needs to decrease or `L` needs to increase (or both).

Given the current state:
- If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or (`numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`), then `L` is `x`. Otherwise, `R` is `x`.

To ensure the loop continues, we need to adjust `R` or `L` such that `R - L > 1` remains true. Since `L` is set to `x` under certain conditions, decreasing `L` would help maintain the condition. Similarly, increasing `R` would also help maintain the condition.

Therefore, we need to adjust either `L` or `R` to ensure the loop continues. The most straightforward way to ensure the loop continues is to adjust `L` to a value that is less than `R - 1`.

State: **`numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, and `L` must be less than `R - 1`**
