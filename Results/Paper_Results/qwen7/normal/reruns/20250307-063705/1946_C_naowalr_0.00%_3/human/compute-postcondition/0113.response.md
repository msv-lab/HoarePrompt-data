Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is the first integer from the input, `b` is the second integer from the input, `adj[a]` now contains the value `[a, b, a, b]`, `adj[b]` now contains the value `[b, a, a]`**

Explanation: The code `adj[a].append(b)` appends the value of `b` to the list `adj[a]`. Initially, `adj[a]` contains `[a, b, a]`. After appending `b`, `adj[a]` becomes `[a, b, a, b]`. The value of `b` is also added to `adj[b]`, making it `[b, a, a]`. The values of `i`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
