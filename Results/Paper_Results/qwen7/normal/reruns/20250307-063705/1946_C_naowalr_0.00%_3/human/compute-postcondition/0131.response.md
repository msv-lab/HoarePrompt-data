Output State: **`numCuts` is either greater than `k` or equal to `k` with `leftover` being greater than or equal to `x`; in both cases, `L` is `x`, `R` is such that `R - L > 1`, and `x` is the average of `L` and `R`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `x` as the floor division of the sum of `L` and `R` by 2. Since `L` is `x` and `R - L > 1`, `x` is now the average of `L` and `R`. All other conditions and relationships between variables remain unchanged.
