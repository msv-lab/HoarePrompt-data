Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `L` is `R`, `leftover` is the value returned by `dfs(1, 1)`, `z` is `t-1`, `n` is an integer input, `k` is an integer input.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from standard input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. However, since the initial values of `numCuts`, `L`, `R`, `leftover`, `z`, and the specific values of `n` and `k` are not provided, we only know that `n` and `k` are now integers obtained from user input. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
