Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `x` is (L + R) // 2, and either `L` is equal to `x` or `R` is equal to `x`, ensuring that `R - L > 1`.**

Explanation: The line `numCuts = 0` simply reassigns the value of `numCuts` to 0. This does not change the values of `x`, `L`, or `R`. The condition that either `L` is equal to `x` or `R` is equal to `x` and that `R - L > 1` remains unchanged.
