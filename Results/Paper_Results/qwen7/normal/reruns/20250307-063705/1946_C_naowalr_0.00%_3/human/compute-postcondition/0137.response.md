Postcondition: **`numCuts` is 0, `leftover` equals `dfs(1, 1)`, `L` is the average of `R` and `L`, and `R` is such that `R - L > 1`. If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or (`numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`), `L` becomes the average of `R` and `L`. Otherwise, `L` remains `x` and `R` remains `x`.**
