Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)` again, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`**.

Explanation: The line `leftover = dfs(1, 1)` assigns the result of the function call `dfs(1, 1)` to the variable `leftover`. Since `leftover` was already the result of `dfs(1, 1)` before this line, calling `dfs(1, 1)` again just updates `leftover` to its own current value. The values of `numCuts` and `x` remain unchanged.
