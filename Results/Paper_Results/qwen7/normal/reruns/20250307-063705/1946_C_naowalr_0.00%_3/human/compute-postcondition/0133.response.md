Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `leftover` equals `dfs(1, 1)`, `L` is `x`, `R` is such that `R - L > 1`, and `x` is the average of `L` and `R`.**

Explanation: The function `dfs(1, 1)` is called, and its return value is assigned to `leftover`. The other variables (`numCuts`, `L`, `R`, and `x`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `leftover` now depends on the return value of `dfs(1, 1)`.
