Output State: **`numCuts` is either greater than `k`, or equal to `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`; in both cases, `L` is `x`; `x` is the average of `L` and `R`; `R` and `L` must be adjusted such that `R - L > 1`.**

Explanation: The variable `x` is assigned the value of `(L + R) // 2`, which is the integer division of the sum of `L` and `R` by 2. This means `x` is now the average of `L` and `R`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged from the initial state.
