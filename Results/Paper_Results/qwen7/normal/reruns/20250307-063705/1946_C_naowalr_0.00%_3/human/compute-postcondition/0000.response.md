Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, and `t` is assigned the value of the first line from standard input.**

This means that the variable `t` has been updated to hold the integer value read from the standard input, which is within the range of 1 to 10^4. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
