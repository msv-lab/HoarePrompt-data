Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`.**

Explanation: The variable `x` is assigned the value of `(L + R) // 2`, which is the integer division of the sum of `L` and `R` by 2. The values of `numCuts` and `leftover` remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition `R - L` must be greater than 1 is still valid.
