Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is the first integer input, `b` is the second integer input.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from standard input using `sys.stdin.readline().split()`, which splits the input into a list of strings. `map(int, ...)` converts these strings into integers. These integers are then assigned to the variables `a` and `b`. The variables `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 1 is still valid, but since no direct operation involving `n` is performed, its value remains unspecified beyond this condition.
