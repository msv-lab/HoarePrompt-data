Output State: **`a` is an integer equal to the first number entered, `b` is an integer equal to the second number entered, `adj[b]` contains the value `[first number entered, `a`], `i` is `n - 2`**.

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the standard input and assigns them to `a` and `b`. However, since the initial state already specifies that `a` is the first number entered and `b` is the second number entered, the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged. The list `adj[b]` is updated to contain `[a, a]`, and `i` remains `n - 2`.
