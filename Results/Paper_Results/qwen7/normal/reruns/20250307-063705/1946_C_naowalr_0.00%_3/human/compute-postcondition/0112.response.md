Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is the first integer from the input, `b` is the second integer from the input, `adj[a]` now contains the value `[a, b, a]`, `adj[b]` now contains the value `[b, a]`**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the standard input using `sys.stdin.readline().split()` and assigns them to `a` and `b`. These values replace the existing lists in `adj[a]` and `adj[b]`. The other variables (`i` and `n`) remain unchanged.
