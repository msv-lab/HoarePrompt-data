You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each set of input data, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5. The adjacency list adj represents a tree with n vertices, where adj[v] is a list of integers representing the neighbors of vertex v. The value of each element in adj is an integer such that 1 ≤ v, u ≤ n.
def func_1():
    t = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    for z in range(t):
        n, k = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))
        
        adj = [[] for i in range(n + 1)]
        
        for i in range(n - 1):
            a, b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))
            adj[a].append(b)
            adj[b].append(a)
        
        L = 1
        
        R = int(100000.0 + 1)
        
        numCuts = 0
        
        while R - L > 1:
            x = (L + R) // 2
            numCuts = 0
            leftover = dfs(1, 1)
            if numCuts > k or numCuts == k and leftover >= x:
                L = x
            else:
                R = x
        
        print(L)
        
    #State: Output State: `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` equals the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, `L` is 1, and `R` is 100001.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the condition `R - L > 1` will no longer be true, causing the loop to terminate. Given the behavior of the loop, where `L` and `R` are updated based on the value of `x` (which is the midpoint of the current range), and considering the initial range of `[1, 100001]`, `L` and `R` will eventually converge to the same value or be as close as possible while still maintaining `R - L > 1` is false. The provided output states indicate that after the third iteration, `L` and `R` are 1 and 100001 respectively, and `numCuts` remains 0. Since the loop does not modify `numCuts` or `leftover` after the loop exits, these values remain unchanged. Therefore, after all iterations of the loop have completed, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, `L` is 1, and `R` is 100001.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes an adjacency list `adj` which represents a tree with `n` vertices. It also uses two integers `n` and `k` as inputs, where `1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5`, and `1 ≤ v, u ≤ n`. The function returns a value based on the structure of the tree represented by `adj`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
