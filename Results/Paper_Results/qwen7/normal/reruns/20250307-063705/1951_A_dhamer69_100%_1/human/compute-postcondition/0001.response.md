Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `while t > 0:`. The only variable involved here is `t`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `t > 0`.

3. **Check the current state of `t`**: The current state given is that `t` is an input integer.

4. **Adjust the state of `t`**: For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0. Since `t` is an input integer, we need to ensure that `t` is initially greater than 0.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `t` to ensure it is greater than 0.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` must be greater than 0**
