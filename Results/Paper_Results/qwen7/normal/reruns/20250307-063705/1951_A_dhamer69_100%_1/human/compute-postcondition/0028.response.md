Postcondition: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer not equal to 2, `s` is an input string, `count_1` is the number of '1's in the string `s`, and `count_1` is even. Additionally, either the string `s` has exactly two '1's and the substring '11' appears exactly once, or the string `s` does not meet these conditions.
