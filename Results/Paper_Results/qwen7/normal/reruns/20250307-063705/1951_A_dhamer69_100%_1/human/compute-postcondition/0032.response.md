Postcondition: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, and if `n` equals 2, then `s` is either equal to '00' or not equal to '00'. If `n` is not equal to 2, then `count_1` is the number of '1's in the string `s`. If the number of '1's (`count_1`) is odd, the postcondition remains as initially described. If `count_1` is even, the string `s` either has exactly two '1's with the substring '11' appearing exactly once, or it does not meet these specific conditions.
