Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is equal to `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer from the user, `s` is a string input from the user, and `count_1` is the number of times '1' appears in the string `s`. If `n` equals 2, no changes are made. If `n` does not equal 2, then if `count_1` is odd or if `count_1` is even and the string `s` does not contain exactly one instance of '11', no changes are made.**

The value of `t` is decremented by 1, but the conditions for `n` and `count_1` remain unchanged. The other variables retain their initial states.
