Based on the initial state provided:

- `start` is an integer.
- `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`.
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `n` is an input integer not equal to 2.
- `s` is an input string with exactly two '1's, and the substring '11' appears exactly once in the string `s`.
- `count_1` is even.

The print statement is:

```python
print('NO')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'NO'` without any reference to the variables `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, or `count_1`.

Output: **NO**
