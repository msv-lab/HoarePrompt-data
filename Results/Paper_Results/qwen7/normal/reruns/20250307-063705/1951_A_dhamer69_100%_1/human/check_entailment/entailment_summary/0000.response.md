Reasoning:
The given program `func()` does not match the problem description and the provided code snippet at all. The problem description mentions generating files for HTML documents within a specified range, whereas the provided code snippet defines a function that processes multiple inputs consisting of an integer `n` and a string `s`, checking specific conditions and printing 'YES' or 'NO' based on those conditions. 

The execution summary also describes the behavior of this function, which clearly indicates that it is performing operations based on the input strings and integers, rather than generating files for HTML documents.

Given the mismatch between the problem description and the provided code, the program is not correct for the given problem.

Correctness: **False**
