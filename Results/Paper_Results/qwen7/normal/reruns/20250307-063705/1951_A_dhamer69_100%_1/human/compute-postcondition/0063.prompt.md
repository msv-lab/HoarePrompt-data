Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
while t > 0:
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    if n == 2:
        if s == '00':
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    else:
        count_1 = s.count('1')
        if count_1 % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        elif s.count('11') == 1 and count_1 == 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
    t -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is equal to `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, and if `n` equals 2, then `s` is either equal to '00' or not equal to '00'. If `n` is not equal to 2, then `count_1` is the number of '1's in the string `s`. If the number of '1's (`count_1`) is odd, the postcondition remains as initially described. If `count_1` is even, the string `s` either has exactly two '1's with the substring '11' appearing exactly once, or it does not meet these specific conditions.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0 and now equal to `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer from the user, `s` is a string input from the user, and the values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, and `count_1` (the number of times '1' appears in the string `s`) remain unchanged regardless of the value of `n`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is equal to `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer from the user, `s` is a string input from the user, and `count_1` is the number of times '1' appears in the string `s`. If `n` equals 2, no changes are made. If `n` does not equal 2, then if `count_1` is odd or if `count_1` is even and the string `s` does not contain exactly one instance of '11', no changes are made.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
