Postcondition: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer from the user, `s` is a string input from the user, and `count_1` is the number of times '1' appears in the string `s`; `s` is now the input string from the user.** 

This postcondition remains the same as the precondition because the if and else parts do not change the values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, or `count_1`. The if and else parts only specify different actions based on the condition `s == '00'`, but these actions do not alter the variables listed in the postcondition.
