Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0 and now equal to `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer from the user, `s` is a string input from the user, and the values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, and `count_1` (the number of times '1' appears in the string `s`) remain unchanged regardless of the value of `n`.**

The value of `t` is decremented by 1, making it `t - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
