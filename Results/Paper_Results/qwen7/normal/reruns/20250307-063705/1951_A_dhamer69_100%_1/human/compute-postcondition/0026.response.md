Based on the initial state provided:

- `start` is an integer.
- `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`.
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `s` is an input string.
- `count_1` is the number of '1's in the string `s`.
- `n` is not equal to 2.
- `count_1` is even.
- Either `s.count('11') != 1` or `count_1 != 2`.

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
