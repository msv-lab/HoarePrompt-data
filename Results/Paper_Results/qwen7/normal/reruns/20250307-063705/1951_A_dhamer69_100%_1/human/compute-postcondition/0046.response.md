Postcondition: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer from the user, `s` is a string input from the user, and `count_1` is the number of times '1' appears in the string `s`. If `n` is not equal to 2, the values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, and `count_1` remain unchanged. If `n` is equal to 2, the values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, and `count_1` also remain unchanged.
