Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, and if `n` equals 2, then `s` is either equal to '00' or not equal to '00'. If `n` is not equal to 2, then `count_1` is the number of '1's in the string `s`. After executing `n = int(input())`, `n` is now an input integer.**

The input integer `n` is assigned the value from user input, while all other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
