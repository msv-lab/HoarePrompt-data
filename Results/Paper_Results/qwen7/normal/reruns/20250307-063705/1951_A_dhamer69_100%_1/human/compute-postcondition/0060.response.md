Postcondition: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer from the user, `s` is a string input from the user, `count_1` is the number of times '1' appears in the string `s`. If `count_1` is odd, no changes are made. If `count_1` is even and the string `s` does not contain exactly one instance of '11', no changes are made.**
