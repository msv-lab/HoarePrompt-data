Postcondition: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer from the user, `s` is a string input from the user. Regardless of whether `s` equals '00' or not, the values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged.**
