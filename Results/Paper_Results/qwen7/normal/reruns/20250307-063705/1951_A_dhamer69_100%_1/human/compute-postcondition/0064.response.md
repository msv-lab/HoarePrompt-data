Output State: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is equal to 0, `n` is an input integer from the user, `s` is a string input from the user, and `count_1` is the number of times '1' appears in the string `s`.

After all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `t` will be decremented until it reaches 0. At this point, the loop terminates, and the values of `n` and `s` will remain as they were during the last iteration of the loop. The variable `count_1` will also retain its value from the last iteration, which is the number of '1's in the string `s`. The values of `start` and `end` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
