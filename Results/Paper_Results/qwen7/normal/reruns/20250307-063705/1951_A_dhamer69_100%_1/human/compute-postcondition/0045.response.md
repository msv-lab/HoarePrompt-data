Postcondition: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer from the user, `s` is a string input from the user, `count_1` is the number of times '1' appears in the string `s`. If `count_1 % 2 != 0`, the conditions remain unchanged. Otherwise, if `s.count('11') == 1` and `count_1 == 2`, the conditions also remain unchanged.**
