Postcondition: **`n` is equal to -1, `u2vs` represents an undirected graph where each node (index) points to all other nodes it is connected to through the edges defined by the inputs, `d` and `previous` are the results of the `bfs(a)` function call, `b` is the result of calling `func_1(d)`, and `path_ba` is a list containing the value of `b`.**
