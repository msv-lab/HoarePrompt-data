Output State: **`i` is 1, `len(path_ba)` must be at least 1, `c1` is `path_ba[0]`, `c2` is `path_ba[1]`, `ops` contains the tuples `(c1, 1)` and `(c2, 1)`**.

Explanation: The code appends a new tuple `(c2, i)` to the list `ops`. Given the initial conditions, `i` is 1, `c1` is `path_ba[0]`, `c2` is `path_ba[1]`, and `ops` initially contains the tuple `(c1, i)`. After executing the code, `ops` now contains both `(c1, 1)` and `(c2, 1)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
