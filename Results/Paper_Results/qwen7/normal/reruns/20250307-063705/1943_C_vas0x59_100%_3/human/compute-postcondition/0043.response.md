Output State: **`n` is equal to `previous[-1]`; `u2vs` represents an undirected graph where each node (index) points to all other nodes it is connected to through the edges defined by the inputs; `d` and `previous` are the results of the `bfs(a)` function call; `b` is the result of calling `func_1(d)`; `path_ba` is a list containing the values `-1` and `n`, and `path_ba.append(n)` appends the current value of `n` to the list `path_ba`.**

In this case, the code appends the current value of `n` to the list `path_ba`. Since `n` is equal to `previous[-1]`, the updated `path_ba` will be a list containing `-1`, `n`, and the current value of `n`.
