Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is set to -1.
   - `u2vs` represents an undirected graph.
   - `d` and `previous` are the results of the `bfs(a)` function call.
   - `b` is the result of calling `func_1(d)`.
   - `path_ba` is a list containing the values `-1` and `-1` repeated either 1 time or at least 6 times.
   - `ops` is a list containing tuples where `c1` and `c2` are paired with every odd index from 1 up to `len(path_ba) - 1`.

2. **Determine the length of `path_ba`:**
   - Since `path_ba` contains `-1` and `-1` repeated, let's assume it repeats at least 6 times (the minimum case).
   - Therefore, `path_ba` would look like: `[-1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1]`.
   - The length of `path_ba` is 6.

3. **Determine the content of `ops`:**
   - `ops` contains tuples where `c1` and `c2` are paired with every odd index from 1 up to `len(path_ba) - 1`.
   - For `path_ba` of length 6, the odd indices are 1, 3, and 5.
   - Thus, `ops` will contain tuples for these indices: `(c1, c2)` for index 1, `(c1, c2)` for index 3, and `(c1, c2)` for index 5.
   - Since `c1` and `c2` are not specified, we can denote them as generic values.

4. **Calculate the length of `ops`:**
   - The length of `ops` is the number of tuples it contains, which is 3 (one for each odd index).

Therefore, when the `print(len(ops))` statement is executed, it will print the length of the `ops` list, which is 3.

Output: **3**
