Output State: `path_ba` is a list containing the values `-1` and `-1` repeated 1 time (since `ci` is at least 1), `i` is `ci` + 1 (which means `i` is 2), `ci` is at least 1, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(c, i)` for `i` from 0 to `ci` (which means `ops` contains 1 tuple: `(-1, 0)` and `(-1, 1)`).

In this final state, the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `n` remains `-1`, `u2vs` remains an undirected graph with the same structure, `d` and `previous` are still the results of the `bfs(a)` function call, `b` is still the result of calling `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` contains `-1` and `-1` once, `ops` contains the tuples `(-1, 0)` and `(-1, 1)`, `ci` is at least 1, and `c` is still `-1`.
