Output State: **`n` must be at least 1, `u` is `u2vs[v][0] - 1`, `v` is `u2vs[v][1] - 1`**

Explanation: The code `v -= 1` decrements the value of `v` by 1. The initial values of `u` and `v` are defined in terms of `u2vs[v]`, so these definitions remain unchanged except that `v` itself is now one less than its original value. The precondition that `n` must be at least 1 is not affected by this operation.
