Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `u` is `u2vs[v][0] - 3`, `v` is `u2vs[v][1] - 2`, `u2vs[u]` contains an additional element `v`, `u2vs[v]` now contains two elements where the second element is `u`.**

Explanation: The variable `v` is decremented by 1. The initial conditions and relationships between the variables remain intact except for the updated value of `v`. Therefore, `u` is now `u2vs[v][0] - 3` (since `v` was originally `u2vs[v][0] - 2`), and `v` is now `u2vs[v][1] - 2` (since `v` was originally `u2vs[v][1] - 1`). The structures of `u2vs[u]` and `u2vs[v]` remain unchanged, with `u2vs[u]` containing an additional element `v` and `u2vs[v]` containing two elements where the second element is `u`.
