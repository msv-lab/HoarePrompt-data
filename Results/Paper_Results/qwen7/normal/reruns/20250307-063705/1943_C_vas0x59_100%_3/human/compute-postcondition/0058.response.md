Postcondition: **`n` is -1, `u2vs` represents an undirected graph where each node (index) points to all other nodes it is connected to through the edges defined by the inputs, `d` and `previous` are the results of the `bfs(a)` function call, `b` is the result of calling `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the values `-1` and `-1` repeated as many times as the loop iterates until `n` becomes `-1`, and `ops` is an empty list. The length of `path_ba` is even.**
