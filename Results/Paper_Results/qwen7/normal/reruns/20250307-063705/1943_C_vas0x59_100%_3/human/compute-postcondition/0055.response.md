Output State: **`path_ba` is a list containing the values `-1` and `-1` repeated as many times as the loop iterates until `ci` becomes at least 1, `i` is `ci` + 1, `ci` is at least 1, `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(c, i)` for the new value of `i`, and a tuple `(c, i)` has been appended to `ops`.**

Explanation: The code `ops.append((c, i))` appends a tuple `(c, i)` to the list `ops`. The values of `path_ba`, `i`, `ci`, and the structure of `ops` remain unchanged except for the addition of the new tuple `(c, i)`.
