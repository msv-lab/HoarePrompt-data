Output State: **`ci1` is 0, `ci2` is 1**

Explanation: The value of `ci1` is updated to `ci2 - 1`, which means `ci1` becomes `1 - 1`, resulting in `ci1` being `0`. The value of `ci2` remains unchanged at `1`. All other variables (`n`, `u2vs`, `d`, `previous`, `b`, `path_ba`, and `ops`) are not affected by this line of code.
