Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `u2vs` is a list of length `n` where each element is a list of integers representing the neighbors of the corresponding vertex in the tree.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state of `u2vs` (a list of lists representing the tree structure) remains unchanged. Therefore, `n` now holds the integer input, and `u2vs` retains its original state as a list of length `n` where each element is a list of integers representing the neighbors of the corresponding vertex in the tree.
