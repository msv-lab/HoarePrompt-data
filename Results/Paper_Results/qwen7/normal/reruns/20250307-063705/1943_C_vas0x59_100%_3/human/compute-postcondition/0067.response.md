Output State: **`i` is 3, `len(path_ba)` must be at least 4, `c1` is `path_ba[0]`, `c2` is `path_ba[1]`, `ops` contains the tuples (`c1`, 1), (`c2`, 1), and (`c1`, 3)**.

Explanation: The code appends a new tuple (`c1`, `i`) to the list `ops`. Given that `i` is 3 and `c1` is `path_ba[0]`, the updated `ops` now contains the tuples (`c1`, 1), (`c2`, 1), and (`c1`, 3). The other variables remain unchanged.
