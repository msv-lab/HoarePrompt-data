Postcondition: **`n` is -1, `u2vs` represents an undirected graph, `d` and `previous` are the results of the `bfs(a)` function call, `b` is the result of calling `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the values `-1` and `-1` repeated either 1 time or at least 6 times, `ops` is a list containing tuples where `c1` and `c2` are paired with every odd index from 1 up to `len(path_ba) - 1`. If `len(path_ba)` is odd, `ci` is 1, `i` is 2, and `ops` contains 3 tuples. Otherwise, `i` is the highest odd number less than `len(path_ba)`, and `ops` contains tuples with `c1` and `c2` paired with every odd index up to `len(path_ba) - 1`.**
