Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10³, and a list `u2vs` of length `n` where each element is a list of integers representing the neighbors of the corresponding vertex in the tree. The input describes a valid tree structure. The function does not return any value.**
