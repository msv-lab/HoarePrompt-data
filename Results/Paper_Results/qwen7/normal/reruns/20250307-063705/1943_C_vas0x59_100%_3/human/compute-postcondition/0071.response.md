Output State: **`i` is 5, `len(path_ba)` must be at least 6, `c1` is `path_ba[0]`, `c2` is `path_ba[1]`, `ops` contains the tuples (`c1`, 1), (`c2`, 1), (`c1`, 3), (`c2`, 3), (`c1`, 5), (`c2`, 5)**

Explanation: The code appends a new tuple `(c2, i)` to the list `ops`. Given that `i` is 5, the new tuple added is `(c2, 5)`. The values of `i`, `len(path_ba)`, `c1`, `c2`, and the existing tuples in `ops` remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated list `ops` now includes the new tuple.
