Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `u` and `v` are integers obtained from splitting the input string by space and converting each part to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `u, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))` takes a single line of input, splits it into parts using a space as the delimiter, converts each part to an integer, and assigns them to `u` and `v`. The condition that `n` must be at least 2 remains unchanged.
