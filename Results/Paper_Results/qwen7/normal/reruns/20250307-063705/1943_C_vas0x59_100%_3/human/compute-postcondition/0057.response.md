Output State: **`path_ba` is a list containing the values `-1` and `-1` repeated 1 time, `ci` is 1, `i` is 2, `ops` is a list containing 3 tuples `(c, i)` with `i` ranging from 0 to 2.**

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = ci`. Given that `ci` is initially set to at least 1, and it remains 1 throughout the loop's execution (since no operation inside the loop changes `ci`), the loop will run exactly 2 times (from `i = 0` to `i = 1`). Each iteration appends a tuple `(c, i)` to the `ops` list. After the loop completes, `i` will be `ci + 1`, which is 2. Therefore, `ops` will contain the tuples `(c, 0)`, `(c, 1)`, and `(c, 2)`. The `path_ba` list remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
