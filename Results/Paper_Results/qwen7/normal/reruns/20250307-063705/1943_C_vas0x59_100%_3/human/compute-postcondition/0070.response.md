Output State: **`i` is 5, `len(path_ba)` must be at least 6, `c1` is `path_ba[0]`, `c2` is `path_ba[1]`, `ops` contains the tuples (`c1`, 1), (`c2`, 1), (`c1`, 3), (`c2`, 3), (`c1`, 5)**

Explanation: The code appends a new tuple `(c1, i)` to the list `ops`. Given that `i` is 5 and `c1` is `path_ba[0]`, the new tuple added to `ops` is (`c1`, 5). All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
