Output State: **`path_ba` is a list containing the values `-1` and `-1` repeated as many times as the loop iterates until `ci` becomes at least 1, `ci` is at least 1, `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(c, i)` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ops.append((c, i))` appends a tuple `(c, i)` to the list `ops`. The values of `path_ba` and `ci` remain unchanged from their initial state. The list `ops` now includes the new tuple `(c, i)` in addition to any tuples that were already present.
