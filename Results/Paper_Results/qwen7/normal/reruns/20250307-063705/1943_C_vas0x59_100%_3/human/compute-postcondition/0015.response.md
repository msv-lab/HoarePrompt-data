Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `u` is `u2vs[v][0] - 1`, `v` is `u2vs[v][1] - 1`, `u2vs[u]` contains an additional element `v`, `u2vs[v]` now contains two elements where the second element is `u`, `u` and `v` are integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code takes two integers as input and assigns them to `u` and `v`. The conditions and relationships involving `n`, `u2vs`, `u`, and `v` remain unchanged except for the new values of `u` and `v` which are determined by the user's input.
