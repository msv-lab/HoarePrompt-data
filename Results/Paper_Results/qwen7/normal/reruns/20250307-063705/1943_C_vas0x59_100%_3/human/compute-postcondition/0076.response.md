Let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `n = -1`: This is a simple integer value.
   - `u2vs` is an undirected graph, but it's not used in the print statement.
   - `d` and `previous` are the results of the `bfs(a)` function call, but their specific values are not needed for the print statement.
   - `b` is the result of calling `func_1(d)`, but again, its value is not needed for the print statement.
   - `path_ba` is a list containing the values `-1` and `-1` repeated either 1 time or at least 6 times. Given the context, let's assume it is repeated at least 6 times for the most precise answer: `path_ba = [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1]`.
   - `ops` is a list containing tuples where `c1` and `c2` are paired with every odd index from 1 up to `len(path_ba) - 1`. Since `len(path_ba)` is 6, the odd indices are 1, 3, and 5. Therefore, `ops` contains tuples with `c1` and `c2` paired with these indices.

2. **Calculating `ops`:**
   - For `i = 1`, `c1` is the value at index 1 of `path_ba`, which is `-1`, and `c2` is the value at index 3 of `path_ba`, which is also `-1`. So, one tuple is `(-1, -1)`.
   - For `i = 3`, `c1` is the value at index 3 of `path_ba`, which is `-1`, and `c2` is the value at index 5 of `path_ba`, which is also `-1`. So, another tuple is `(-1, -1)`.
   - For `i = 5`, `c1` is the value at index 5 of `path_ba`, which is `-1`, and `c2` is not applicable since there is no next index (it's the last index).

   Therefore, `ops` is `[(1, 1), (3, 3), (5, 5)]`.

3. **Printing the Result:**
   - The `print` statement uses `map` to apply a lambda function to each tuple in `ops`. The lambda function formats each tuple as a string in the form `'c1 + 1 c2'`.
   - For each tuple `(1, 1)`, the formatted string is `"1 1"`.
   - For each tuple `(3, 3)`, the formatted string is `"3 3"`.
   - For each tuple `(5, 5)`, the formatted string is `"5 5"`.

   So, the output will be:
   ```
   1 1
   3 3
   5 5
   ```

Output: **1 1
3 3
5 5**
