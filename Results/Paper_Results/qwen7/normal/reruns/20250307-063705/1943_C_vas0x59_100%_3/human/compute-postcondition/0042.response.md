Postcondition: **`n` is equal to `previous[-1]`, `u2vs` represents an undirected graph where each node (index) points to all other nodes it is connected to through the edges defined by the inputs, `d` and `previous` are the results of the `bfs(a)` function call, `b` is the result of calling `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the values `-1` and `n`. If `n` equals `-1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
