Output State: **`n` is equal to `previous[-1]`, `u2vs` represents an undirected graph where each node (index) points to all other nodes it is connected to through the edges defined by the inputs, `d` and `previous` are the results of the `bfs(a)` function call, `b` is the result of calling `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the values `-1` and `n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block immediately preceding the `break` statement, it simply breaks out of the context where it was last inside a loop or conditional structure. All other variables retain their previous values and states.
