Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is -1, `u2vs` represents an undirected graph where each node (index) points to all other nodes it is connected to through the edges defined by the inputs, `d` and `previous` are the results of the `bfs(a)` function call, `b` is the result of calling `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the values `-1` and `-1` repeated as many times as the loop iterates until `n` becomes `-1`, `ops` is an empty list, `ci` is half the length of `path_ba`, `c` is -1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(ci + 1):
    ops.append((c, i))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `path_ba` is a list containing the values `-1` and `-1` repeated as many times as the loop iterates until `ci` becomes at least 1, `ci` is at least 1, `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(c, i)` appended to it.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `path_ba` is a list containing the values `-1` and `-1` repeated as many times as the loop iterates until `ci` becomes at least 1, `ci` is at least 1, `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(c, i)` appended to it.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `path_ba` is a list containing the values `-1` and `-1` repeated as many times as the loop iterates until `ci` becomes at least 1, `i` is `ci` + 1, `ci` is at least 1, `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(c, i)` for the new value of `i`, and a tuple `(c, i)` has been appended to `ops`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
