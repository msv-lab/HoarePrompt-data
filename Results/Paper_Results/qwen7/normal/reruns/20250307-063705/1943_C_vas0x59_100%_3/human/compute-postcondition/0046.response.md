Output State: **`n` is -1, `u2vs` represents an undirected graph where each node (index) points to all other nodes it is connected to through the edges defined by the inputs, `d` and `previous` are the results of the `bfs(a)` function call, `b` is the result of calling `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the values `-1` and `-1` repeated as many times as the loop iterates until `n` becomes `-1`, and `ops` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list `ops`. Since there are no operations performed within the list, the only change is that the loop condition is met, making `n` equal to `-1`. The other variables (`u2vs`, `d`, `previous`, `b`, and `path_ba`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
