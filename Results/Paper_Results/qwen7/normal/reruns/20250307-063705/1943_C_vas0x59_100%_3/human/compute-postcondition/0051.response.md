Output State: **`path_ba` is a list containing the values `-1` and `-1` repeated as many times as the loop iterates until `ci` becomes at least 1, `ci` is at least 1, `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(c, i)` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code snippet appends a tuple `(c, i)` to the list `ops`. Since the initial state does not specify the values of `c` and `i`, they remain as generic variables. The list `path_ba` and the variable `ci` retain their initial states as described.
