Output State: **`n` must be at least 1, `u` is the first integer input, `v` is the second integer input, `u2vs[v]` now contains `[u, v]`**.

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `u` and `v`. The initial conditions for `n`, `u`, and `v` are updated accordingly. The list `u2vs[v]` is updated to contain the new values of `u` and `v`. The precondition that `n` must be at least 1 remains unchanged.
