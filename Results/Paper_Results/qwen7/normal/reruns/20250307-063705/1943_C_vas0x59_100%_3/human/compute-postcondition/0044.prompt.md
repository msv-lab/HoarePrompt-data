Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The loop will have executed `n-1` times, `u2vs` will represent an undirected graph where each node (index) points to all other nodes it is connected to through the edges defined by the inputs, `d` and `previous` are the results of the `bfs(a)` function call, `b` is the result of calling `func_1(d)`, and `path_ba` is a list containing the value of `b`.
Code of the loop:
while True:
    n = previous[path_ba[-1]]
    if n == -1:
        break
    path_ba.append(n)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is -1, `u2vs` represents an undirected graph where each node (index) points to all other nodes it is connected to through the edges defined by the inputs, `d` and `previous` are the results of the `bfs(a)` function call, `b` is the result of calling `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the value `-1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` is the value of `previous[-1]`, `u2vs` represents an undirected graph where each node (index) points to all other nodes it is connected to through the edges defined by the inputs, `d` and `previous` are the results of the `bfs(a)` function call, `b` is the result of calling `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the values `-1` and `n`, and the most internal loop or if statement has been broken out.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` is equal to `previous[-1]`; `u2vs` represents an undirected graph where each node (index) points to all other nodes it is connected to through the edges defined by the inputs; `d` and `previous` are the results of the `bfs(a)` function call; `b` is the result of calling `func_1(d)`; `path_ba` is a list containing the values `-1` and `n`, and `path_ba.append(n)` appends the current value of `n` to the list `path_ba`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
