Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case involves the variable `i` and `ci`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from `0` to `ci + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `path_ba` is a list containing the values `-1` and `-1` repeated as many times as the loop iterates until `ci` becomes at least 1.
   - `ci` is at least 1.
   - `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(c, i)` appended to it.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `ci` is at least 1, the loop will run for `i` from `0` to `ci`.
   - After the previous iteration, `i` would have been incremented by 1 (assuming the loop body does not change `i`).
   - Therefore, `i` will now be equal to `ci` (since the loop starts from `0` and goes up to `ci`).

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be set to `ci` because the loop will continue if `i < ci + 1`.
   - `ci` remains unchanged unless the loop body modifies it, but based on the given information, `ci` is at least 1 and no modification is mentioned.

6. **Final state**:
   - `path_ba` will still contain the values `-1` and `-1` repeated as many times as the loop iterates until `ci` becomes at least 1.
   - `ci` remains unchanged.
   - `ops` will contain the tuple `(c, i)` where `i` is now `ci`.

So, the final state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`path_ba` is a list containing the values `-1` and `-1` repeated as many times as the loop iterates until `ci` becomes at least 1, `ci` is at least 1, `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(c, ci)` appended to it**.
