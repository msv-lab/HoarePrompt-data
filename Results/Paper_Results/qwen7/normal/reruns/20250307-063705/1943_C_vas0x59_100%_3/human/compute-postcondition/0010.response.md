Output State: **`n` must be at least 1, `u` is `u2vs[v][0] - 1`, `v` is `u2vs[v][1]`**

Explanation: The code `u -= 1` decrements the value of `u` by 1. Since `u2vs[v]` contains `[u, v]`, the updated value of `u` is the original value of `u` minus 1. The value of `v` remains unchanged. The precondition that `n` must be at least 1 is still valid.
