Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case involves the variable `i` and `ci`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from `0` to `ci + 1`. This means the loop will continue as long as `i < ci + 1`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `path_ba` is a list containing the values `-1` and `-1` repeated as many times as the loop iterates until `ci` becomes at least 1.
   - `ci` is at least 1.
   - `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(c, i)` appended to it.

4. **Analyze the loop body**: Although the loop body is omitted, we know that `i` is incremented in each iteration. Therefore, `i` will be increased by 1 at the end of each iteration.

5. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, `i` will be `ci` at the end of the previous iteration plus 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must still be less than `ci + 1`. Therefore, `i` should be `ci` (the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration) plus 1.
   - `ci` remains unchanged unless modified within the loop body, but since no such modification is mentioned, `ci` stays the same.
   - `path_ba` will be updated based on the value of `i`, but since the exact update logic is not given, we focus on the loop condition variables.

6. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be `ci` (current value) + 1.
   - `ci` remains unchanged.
   - `ops` will contain an additional tuple `(c, i)` for the new value of `i`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`path_ba` is a list containing the values `-1` and `-1` repeated as many times as the loop iterates until `ci` becomes at least 1, `i` is `ci` + 1, `ci` is at least 1, `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(c, i)` for the new value of `i`**.

However, to simplify the answer:

State: **`path_ba` is a list containing the values `-1` and `-1` repeated as many times as the loop iterates until `ci` becomes at least 1, `i` is `ci` + 1, `ci` is at least 1, `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(c, i)` for the new value of `i`**.

In a more concise form:

State: **`path_ba` is a list containing the values `-1` and `-1` repeated as many times as the loop iterates until `ci` becomes at least 1, `i` is `ci` + 1, `ci` is at least 1, `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(c, i)` for the new value of `i`**.
