Output State: **`n` is -1, `u2vs` represents an undirected graph where each node (index) points to all other nodes it is connected to through the edges defined by the inputs, `d` and `previous` are the results of the `bfs(a)` function call, `b` is the result of calling `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the values `-1` and `-1` repeated as many times as the loop iterates until `n` becomes `-1`, `ops` is an empty list, `ci` is half the length of `path_ba`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the length of the `path_ba` list and stores it in the variable `ci` by taking the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2. Since the length of `path_ba` is odd, `len(path_ba) // 2` gives the integer part of its length divided by 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
