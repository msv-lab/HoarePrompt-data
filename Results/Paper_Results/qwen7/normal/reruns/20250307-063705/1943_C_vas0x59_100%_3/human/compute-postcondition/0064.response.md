Output State: **`i` is 1, `len(path_ba)` must be at least 1, `c1` is `path_ba[0]`, `c2` is `path_ba[1]`, `ops` contains the tuple `(c1, i)`**.

The code appends a tuple `(c1, i)` to the list `ops`. Given the initial conditions, `c1` is the first element of `path_ba`, and `i` is 1. Therefore, `ops` now contains the tuple `(c1, 1)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
