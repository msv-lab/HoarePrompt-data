The `while True` loop does not have any conditions based on external variables; it will continue to execute indefinitely as long as the loop itself is not explicitly broken out of. Since the loop has already been broken out of, the only way to proceed to the next iteration is to reset the loop condition to allow it to start over.

Given the loop is `while True`, no adjustments to the loop condition are necessary because it always evaluates to `True`. However, we need to ensure that the loop can start fresh, meaning we should reset any internal states that were modified during the previous iteration.

In this case, the relevant states are:
- `n` is the value of `previous[-1]`
- `u2vs` represents an undirected graph
- `d` and `previous` are the results of the `bfs(a)` function call
- `b` is the result of calling `func_1(d)`
- `path_ba` is a list containing the values `-1` and `n`

Since the loop is `while True`, we don't need to change anything about these states to allow the loop to start again. We just need to ensure that the loop can proceed as if it were starting from the beginning.

State: **`n` is the value of `previous[-1]`, `u2vs` represents an undirected graph where each node (index) points to all other nodes it is connected to through the edges defined by the inputs, `d` and `previous` are the results of the `bfs(a)` function call, `b` is the result of calling `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the values `-1` and `n`**
