Output State: The loop will have executed `n-1` times. After all iterations, `u2vs` will represent an undirected graph where each edge is added twice (once from `u` to `v` and once from `v` to `u`). Specifically, for every pair `(u, v)` provided as input, `u2vs[u]` will contain `v` and `u2vs[v]` will also contain `u`. The list `u2vs[i]` for any `i` in the range `[0, n-1]` will contain all `n-1` nodes exactly twice, reflecting the edges added during the loop iterations.

This means that `u2vs` will form a complete graph with each node connected to every other node, and each edge will be represented twice in the adjacency list.
