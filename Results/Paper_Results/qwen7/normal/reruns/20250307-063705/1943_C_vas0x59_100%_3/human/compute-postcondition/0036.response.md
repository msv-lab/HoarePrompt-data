Output State: **`n` is the value of `previous[-1]`, `u2vs` represents an undirected graph where each node (index) points to all other nodes it is connected to through the edges defined by the inputs, `d` and `previous` are the results of the `bfs(a)` function call, `b` is the result of calling `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the value `-1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but indicates that the most internal loop or if statement has been exited. All other variables retain their initial states as described in the initial state.
