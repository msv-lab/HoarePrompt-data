Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `ci`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The variable `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
   - The variable `ci` is given as half the length of `path_ba`.

3. **Analyze the Given States**:
   - `n` is -1.
   - `u2vs` is an undirected graph.
   - `d` and `previous` are results of the `bfs(a)` function call.
   - `b` is the result of calling `func_1(d)`.
   - `path_ba` is a list containing the values `-1` and `-1` repeated as many times as the loop iterates until `n` becomes `-1`.
   - `ops` is an empty list.
   - `ci` is half the length of `path_ba`.
   - `c` is -1.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `n` is -1, it does not affect the loop execution directly. We can ignore it.
   - `u2vs`, `d`, `previous`, `b`, `path_ba`, `ops`, and `c` are not directly involved in the loop head, so they don't need adjustment.
   - `ci` is half the length of `path_ba`. To ensure the loop can execute, `path_ba` must have at least 1 element, making `ci` at least 0.5. Since `ci` is an integer, it must be at least 1.
   - The loop starts with `i = 0` and increments by 1. Therefore, `i` must be less than or equal to `ci`.

Given these considerations, the states that need to be adjusted are `path_ba` and `ci`.

State: **`path_ba` is a list containing the values `-1` and `-1` repeated as many times as the loop iterates until `ci` becomes at least 1, `ci` is at least 1**
