Output State: `n` is now `n // 8 // int(input()) // 4`, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`, `s` is increased by `x` three times, and `m` is doubled three times.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `n` will be reduced to `n // 8 // int(input()) // 4`, `x` will be `(n + 1) // 2`, `s` will have been increased by `x` three times, and `m` will have been doubled three times.
