Output State: **`n` is now `n // 2**t`, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`, `s` is the sum of all `x` values added in each iteration, and `m` is doubled `t` times.**

In natural language:
After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `n` has been halved `t` times from its initial value, making it `n // 2**t`. The variable `x` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2` in each iteration. The variable `s` accumulates the sum of all `x` values added during the iterations, and `m` is doubled `t` times, making it `2**t`.
