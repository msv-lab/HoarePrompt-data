Output State: **`n` must be greater than zero; `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `(n + 1) // 2` to the variable `x`. Since `n` must be greater than zero, `x` will be the integer division of `(n + 1)` by `2`. The initial condition that `n` must be greater than zero is preserved.
