Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is now `n // 2`, `k` is an input integer, `s` is `x`, `m` is 2, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`. If `s < k` and `k <= s + x`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains as described in the if part.
