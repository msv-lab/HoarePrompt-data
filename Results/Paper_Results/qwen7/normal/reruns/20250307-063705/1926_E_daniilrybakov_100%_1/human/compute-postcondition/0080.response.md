Output State: **`n` must be non-zero; `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`**

The value of `n` must remain non-zero as per the initial state. The variable `x` is assigned the value of `(n + 1) // 2`, which is the integer division of `n + 1` by 2. The precondition that `n` must be non-zero is still valid after the code execution.
