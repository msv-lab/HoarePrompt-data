Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates through each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`.
3. It initializes variables `s` and `m` to keep track of the cumulative count of cards laid down and the multiplier for the current group of cards, respectively.
4. The while loop calculates the number of cards that will be laid down at each step (i.e., `x = (n + 1) // 2`), updates `n` to `n // 2`, and adds `x` to `s` to keep track of the cumulative count of cards laid down.
5. If `k` falls within the range `[s, s + x]`, the loop breaks, and the correct card is calculated using the formula `(2 * (k - s) - 1) * m`.
6. The final result is printed for each test case.

The logic in the annotated program matches the problem description accurately. The code correctly identifies the position of the k-th card in the sequence defined by Vladislav's laying pattern.

Correctness: **True**
