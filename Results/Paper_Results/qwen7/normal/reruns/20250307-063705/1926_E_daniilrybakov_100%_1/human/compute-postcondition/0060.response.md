Output State: **`n` is equal to `n` // 2; `x` is equal to (`n` + 1) // 2; `s` is equal to `s` + `x`.**

The code `s += x` updates the value of `s` by adding `x` to its current value. The values of `n` and `x` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `n` is still equal to `n` // 2, and `x` is still equal to (`n` + 1) // 2. The only change is that `s` is now `s + x`.
