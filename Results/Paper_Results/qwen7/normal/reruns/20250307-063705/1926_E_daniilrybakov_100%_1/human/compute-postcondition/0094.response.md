Output State: **`n` is now `n // 2`, `x` is equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, `s` is increased by `x`, `m` is doubled.**

Explanation: The code `m *= 2` doubles the value of `m`. The values of `n`, `x`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `n` is still `n // 2`, `x` is still `(n + 1) // 2`, `s` is still increased by `x`, and `m` is now double its original value.
