### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires determining the \(k\)-th card that Vladislav lays down following a specific pattern.
   - The pattern involves laying down cards in groups where each group consists of numbers that are multiples of increasing odd numbers (1, 3, 5, ...).

2. **Pattern Analysis:**
   - For \(n = 7\), the sequence is: 1, 3, 5, 7, 2, 6, 4.
   - The sequence can be broken down into segments:
     - First segment: All odd numbers (1, 3, 5, 7).
     - Second segment: Numbers that are twice an odd number (2, 6).
     - Third segment: Numbers that are three times an odd number (not applicable here since \(n\) is small).
     - Fourth segment: Numbers that are four times an odd number (4).

3. **Given Code Analysis:**
   - The code initializes `t` with the number of test cases.
   - It iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it calculates the position of the \(k\)-th card using a while loop and a series of calculations.

4. **Key Calculations:**
   - `x = (n + 1) // 2`: This calculates the number of elements in the current segment.
   - `n //= 2`: This updates `n` to move to the next segment.
   - `s += x`: This accumulates the total count of elements processed so far.
   - `m *= 2`: This multiplies the multiplier by 2 for the next segment.

5. **Final Calculation:**
   - The final formula `(2 * (k - s) - 1) * m` correctly computes the \(k\)-th card by adjusting the position within the current segment and applying the appropriate multiplier.

6. **Testing the Code:**
   - The provided examples match the expected output, indicating that the logic is correct.

### Conclusion:
The given code accurately implements the logic required to find the \(k\)-th card based on the specified pattern. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
