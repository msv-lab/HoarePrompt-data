Output State: **`n` is now `n // 2`; `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`, and `s` is `s + x`; `m` is `m * 2`.**

Explanation: The code `m *= 2` multiplies the current value of `m` by 2. Since no initial value for `m` was given, we keep it as `m` is `m * 2`. The values of `n`, `x`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial states.
