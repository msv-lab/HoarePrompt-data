Output State: **`n` is now `n // 2`, `x` is equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, `s` is increased by `x`.**

Explanation: The variable `s` is incremented by the value of `x`. The values of `n` and `x` remain unchanged from their initial postconditions. Therefore, `n` is still `n // 2` and `x` is still `(n + 1) // 2`. The only change is that `s` has been updated to `s + x`.
