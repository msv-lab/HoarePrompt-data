You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n cards numbered 1, 2, \dots, n . He wants to lay them down in a
row as follows:

  * First, he lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest. 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 2 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 3 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 3 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 4 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 4 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * And so on, until all cards are laid down. 

What is the k -th card he lays down in this process? Once Vladislav puts a
card down, he cannot use that card again.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n
\leq 10^9 ) — the number of cards Vlad has, and the position of the card you
need to output.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the k -th card Vladislav lays
down.

Note

In the first seven test cases, n=7 . Vladislav lays down the cards as follows:

  * First — all the odd-numbered cards in the order 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . 
  * Next — all cards that are twice an odd number in the order 2 , 6 . 
  * Next, there are no remaining cards that are 3 times an odd number. (Vladislav has only one of each card.) 
  * Next — all cards that are 4 times an odd number, and there is only one such card: 4 . 
  * There are no more cards left, so Vladislav stops. 

Thus the order of cards is 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 2 , 6 , 4 .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        s = 0
        m = 1
        while n:
            x = (n + 1) // 2
            n //= 2
            if s < k and k <= s + x:
                break
            s += x
            m *= 2
        print((2 * (k - s) - 1) * m)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4. Each test case consists of two integers n and k such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        s = 0
        
        m = 1
        
        while n:
            x = (n + 1) // 2
            n //= 2
            if s < k and k <= s + x:
                break
            s += x
            m *= 2
        
        print((2 * (k - s) - 1) * m)
        
    #State: `n` is now `n // 2
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers \( n \) and \( k \). For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific value based on the relationship between \( n \) and \( k \). Specifically, it finds the smallest integer \( m \) such that the sum of certain terms up to \( m \) is just less than or equal to \( k \), and then computes and outputs a formula involving \( k \) and \( m \). The function reads \( t \) test cases from the input, where \( 1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4 \), and \( 1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^9 \) for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the described process of laying down the cards. Specifically, the logic for determining which card is laid down at position `k` is flawed. The program attempts to calculate the position directly without properly simulating the process of laying down the cards according to the rules.

For example, consider the test case `n = 7` and `k = 7`. According to the problem description, the sequence of cards laid down should be: 1, 3, 5, 7, 2, 6, 4. However, the program incorrectly calculates the 7th card as 4 instead of 4, which is the correct order based on the rules provided.

To verify this, let's manually simulate the process for `n = 7` and `k = 7`:

1. Lay down all odd-numbered cards: 1, 3, 5, 7
2. Lay down all cards that are twice an odd number: 2, 6
3. Lay down all cards that are three times an odd number: 4
4. The sequence is: 1, 3, 5, 7, 2, 6, 4

The 7th card is 4, but the program outputs 4 as the 6th card, indicating a logical error in the calculation. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
