Output State: **`n` is now `n // 2`, `x` is equal to `(n + 1) // 2`.**

Explanation: The value of `n` is updated to `n // 2`, which means `n` is now divided by 2 and rounded down to the nearest whole number. The value of `x` is defined as `(n + 1) // 2` based on the initial state, but since `n` has changed, `x` remains consistent with the new value of `n`. The precondition that `n` must be greater than zero still holds true.
