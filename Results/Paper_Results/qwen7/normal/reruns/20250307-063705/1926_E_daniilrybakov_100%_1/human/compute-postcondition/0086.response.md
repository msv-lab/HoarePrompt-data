Output State: **`n` is now `n // 2`, `x` is equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, `s` is increased by `x`, `m` is doubled.**

Explanation: The variable `m` is multiplied by 2, which means its new value is twice its previous value. The other variables (`n`, `x`, and `s`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
