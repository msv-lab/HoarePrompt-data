Output State: **`n` is now `n // 2`; `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`, and `s` is `s + x`.**

Explanation: The code `s += x` increments `s` by the value of `x`. Given the initial postconditions, `n` is now `n // 2` and `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`. The condition `if s < k and k <= s + x: we break out of the most internal loop or if statement` does not affect the values of `n` and `x` since it is not evaluated here. Therefore, `s` is updated to `s + x`.
