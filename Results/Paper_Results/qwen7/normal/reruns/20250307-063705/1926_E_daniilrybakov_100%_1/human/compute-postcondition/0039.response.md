Output State: **`n` is a non-zero integer, `k` is updated to the integer value of the second input, `s` is 0, `m` is 1, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`.**

This means that `x` is assigned the value of `(n + 1) // 2`, where `//` denotes integer division. The values of `n`, `k`, `s`, and `m` remain unchanged from their initial states.
