Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `while n:`. This means the loop will continue as long as `n` is non-zero.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `n` is now `n // 2`
   - `x` is equal to `(n + 1) // 2`
   - `s` is increased by `x`
   - `m` is doubled

3. **Determine Which States Need Adjustment**:
   - The only variable in the loop head is `n`. Therefore, the only state that needs adjustment is `n`.

4. **Ensure the Loop Can Execute Again**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `n` must be non-zero. Since `n` is updated to `n // 2` at the end of each iteration, `n` will be zero if `n` was originally zero or became zero in a previous iteration. To ensure the loop can execute again, `n` must be greater than zero.

5. **Adjust the State**:
   - We need to ensure that `n` is greater than zero for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `n` must be greater than zero.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` must be greater than zero**
