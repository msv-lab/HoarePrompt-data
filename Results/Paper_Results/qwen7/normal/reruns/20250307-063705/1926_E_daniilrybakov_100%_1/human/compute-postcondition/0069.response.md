Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `n`. For the loop to execute the first time, `n` must be non-zero (i.e., `n > 0`).

2. **Current state of `n`**: The current state of `n` is given as `n` is now `n // 8 // int(input())`.

3. **Determine the necessary adjustment**: Since `n` is defined as `n // 8 // int(input())`, we need to ensure that this expression results in a non-zero value for the loop to execute the first time.

4. **Analyze the components**:
   - `n // 8`: This operation divides `n` by 8.
   - `int(input())`: This reads an integer input from the user.

5. **Ensure non-zero result**: For `n // 8 // int(input())` to be non-zero, at least one of the following conditions must hold:
   - `n // 8` is non-zero.
   - `int(input())` is 1 (since any non-zero number divided by 8 and then divided by 1 remains non-zero).

6. **Adjust the state**:
   - We cannot directly control the input from the user, but we can ensure that `n` itself is such that when divided by 8 and then divided by the input, the result is non-zero.
   - Therefore, `n` must be a positive number that, when divided by 8, still leaves a non-zero value after further division by the input.

Given these considerations, the state right before the loop should be adjusted to ensure that `n` is a positive number that meets the above criteria.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` is now `n // 8 // int(input())` and `n` must be a positive number that, when divided by 8 and then divided by the input, results in a non-zero value**.
