Output State: **`n` is equal to `n` // 2; `x` is equal to (`n` + 1) // 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `n` and `x`. It only indicates that the program breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it was inside. Therefore, the values of `n` and `x` remain as they were in the initial state.
