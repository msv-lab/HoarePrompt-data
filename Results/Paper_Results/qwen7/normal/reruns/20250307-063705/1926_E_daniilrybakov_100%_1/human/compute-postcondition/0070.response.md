Output State: **`n` is now `n // 8 // int(input())`, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`.**

Explanation: The value of `n` is updated to `n // 8 // int(input())`, which means `n` is first divided by 8 and then by the integer input from the user. After this operation, `x` is assigned the value of `(n + 1) // 2`, which is the integer division of `n + 1` by 2. The initial condition that `n` must be a positive number resulting in a non-zero value after the operations remains valid.
