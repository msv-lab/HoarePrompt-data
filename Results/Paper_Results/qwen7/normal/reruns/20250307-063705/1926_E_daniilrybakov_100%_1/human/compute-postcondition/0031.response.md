Output State: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` will be `t // 2**i` where `i` is the number of iterations the loop executed, `k` is an input integer, `s` is the sum of `x` after each iteration, with `x` being `(n + 1) // 2` at the start of each iteration, `m` will be `2**i`, where `i` is the number of iterations the loop executed.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` remains greater than 0, `n` is reduced to `t` divided by \(2^i\), where \(i\) is the total number of iterations, `k` remains as the input integer, `s` is the cumulative sum of `x` values from each iteration, with `x` starting as `(n + 1) // 2` at the beginning of each iteration, `m` is \(2^i\), indicating the number of iterations that occurred.
