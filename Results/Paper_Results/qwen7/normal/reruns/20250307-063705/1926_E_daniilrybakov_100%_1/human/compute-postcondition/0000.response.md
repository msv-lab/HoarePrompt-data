Output State: **`t` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial condition that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\) remains valid after the code is executed, but the specific value of `t` is now determined by the user's input. All other variables remain unaffected, so they retain their initial state as described in the precondition.
