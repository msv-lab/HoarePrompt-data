Output State: **`n` is updated to the integer value of the first input, `k` is updated to the integer value of the second input, `s` is 0**.

Explanation: The code initializes a variable `s` to 0. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state, which means `n` is the integer value of the first input and `k` is the integer value of the second input. The variable `s` is set to 0.
