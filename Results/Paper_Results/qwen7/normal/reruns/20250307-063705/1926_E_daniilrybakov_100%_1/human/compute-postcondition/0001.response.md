State: **`t` must be greater than 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variable `t` from the expression `range(t)`.
2. For the loop to execute, the range function needs a positive integer value for `t` as its argument.
3. The initial state of `t` being an input integer does not guarantee that the loop will execute.
4. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `t` must be greater than 0 to ensure the loop can start executing.
