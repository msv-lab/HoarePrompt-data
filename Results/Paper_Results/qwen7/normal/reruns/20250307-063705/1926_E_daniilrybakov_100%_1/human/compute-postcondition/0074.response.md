Output State: **`n` is now `n // 8 // int(input()) // 2`, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`, `s` is an integer less than `k`, and `k` is an integer less than or equal to `s + x`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only exits the loop or the most internal if statement. Therefore, the values of `n`, `x`, `s`, and `k` remain as they were defined in the initial state.
