Output State: **`n` is now `n // 8 // int(input())`, `m` is `m * 8`, `s` is updated to include the sum of the sequence terms based on the new value of `n`, `k` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k`. The initial state of `n` was `n // 8`, so after the code runs, `n` becomes `n // 8 // int(input())`. The value of `m` is multiplied by 8, and `s` is updated to include the sum of the sequence terms based on the new value of `n`. The value of `k` is the integer input.
