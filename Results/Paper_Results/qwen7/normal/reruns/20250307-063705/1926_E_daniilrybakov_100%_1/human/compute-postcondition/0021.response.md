Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is now `n // 2`, `k` is an input integer, `s` is increased by `(n + 1) // 2`, `m` is 4, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2**.

Explanation: The value of `m` is multiplied by 2, making it 4. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is now `n // 2`, `k` is an input integer, `s` is increased by `(n + 1) // 2`, and `x` is `(n + 1) // 2` still holds true.
