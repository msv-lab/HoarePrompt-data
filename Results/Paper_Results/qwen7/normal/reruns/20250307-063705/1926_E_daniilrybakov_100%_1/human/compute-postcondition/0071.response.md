Output State: **`n` is now `n // 8 // int(input()) // 2`, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`.**

Explanation: The code `n //= 2` divides the current value of `n` by 2 using integer division. The initial state of `n` is `n // 8 // int(input())`. After the operation, `n` becomes `n // 8 // int(input()) // 2`. The value of `x` remains unchanged as it was defined as `(n + 1) // 2` before the operation and the operation only affects `n`.
