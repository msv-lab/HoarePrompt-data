Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `s` is `x`, `m` is 2, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`**

Explanation: The code `x = (n + 1) // 2` does not change the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `s`, or `m`. It only updates the value of `x` to be `(n + 1) // 2`. The conditions and values of the other variables remain unchanged.
