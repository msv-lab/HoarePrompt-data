You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n cards numbered 1, 2, \dots, n . He wants to lay them down in a
row as follows:

  * First, he lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest. 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 2 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 3 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 3 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 4 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 4 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * And so on, until all cards are laid down. 

What is the k -th card he lays down in this process? Once Vladislav puts a
card down, he cannot use that card again.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n
\leq 10^9 ) — the number of cards Vlad has, and the position of the card you
need to output.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the k -th card Vladislav lays
down.

Note

In the first seven test cases, n=7 . Vladislav lays down the cards as follows:

  * First — all the odd-numbered cards in the order 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . 
  * Next — all cards that are twice an odd number in the order 2 , 6 . 
  * Next, there are no remaining cards that are 3 times an odd number. (Vladislav has only one of each card.) 
  * Next — all cards that are 4 times an odd number, and there is only one such card: 4 . 
  * There are no more cards left, so Vladislav stops. 

Thus the order of cards is 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 2 , 6 , 4 .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        s = 0
        m = 1
        while n:
            x = (n + 1) // 2
            n //= 2
            if s < k and k <= s + x:
                break
            s += x
            m *= 2
        print((2 * (k - s) - 1) * m)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4. Each test case consists of two integers n and k such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9.

    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        s = 0
        
        m = 1
        
        while n:
            x = (n + 1) // 2
            n //= 2
            if s < k and k <= s + x:
                break
            s += x
            m *= 2
        
        print((2 * (k - s) - 1) * m)
        
    #State: `n` is now `n // 2
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers \( n \) and \( k \). For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific value based on the relationship between \( n \) and \( k \). Specifically, it finds the smallest integer \( m \) such that the sum of certain terms up to \( m \) is just less than or equal to \( k \), and then computes and outputs a formula involving \( k \) and \( m \). The function reads \( t \) test cases from the input, where \( 1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4 \), and \( 1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^9 \) for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires determining the \(k\)-th card that Vladislav lays down following a specific pattern.
   - The pattern involves laying down cards in groups where each group consists of numbers that are multiples of increasing odd numbers (1, 3, 5, ...).

2. **Pattern Analysis:**
   - For \(n = 7\), the sequence is: 1, 3, 5, 7, 2, 6, 4.
   - The sequence can be broken down into segments:
     - First segment: All odd numbers (1, 3, 5, 7).
     - Second segment: Numbers that are twice an odd number (2, 6).
     - Third segment: Numbers that are three times an odd number (not applicable here since \(n\) is small).
     - Fourth segment: Numbers that are four times an odd number (4).

3. **Given Code Analysis:**
   - The code initializes `t` with the number of test cases.
   - It iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it calculates the position of the \(k\)-th card using a while loop and a series of calculations.

4. **Key Calculations:**
   - `x = (n + 1) // 2`: This calculates the number of elements in the current segment.
   - `n //= 2`: This updates `n` to move to the next segment.
   - `s += x`: This accumulates the total count of elements processed so far.
   - `m *= 2`: This multiplies the multiplier by 2 for the next segment.

5. **Final Calculation:**
   - The final formula `(2 * (k - s) - 1) * m` correctly computes the \(k\)-th card by adjusting the position within the current segment and applying the appropriate multiplier.

6. **Testing the Code:**
   - The provided examples match the expected output, indicating that the logic is correct.

### Conclusion:
The given code accurately implements the logic required to find the \(k\)-th card based on the specified pattern. Therefore, the program is correct.
