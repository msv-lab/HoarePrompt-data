Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop condition is `n`. Therefore, the only variable we need to consider is `n`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `n` is truthy (non-zero).

3. **Current state before the loop**: 
   - `t` must be greater than 0
   - `n` is an input integer
   - `k` is an input integer
   - `s` is 0
   - `m` is 1

4. **Adjust the state for the loop to execute**: Since the loop condition is `n`, and `n` is an input integer, we need to ensure that `n` is non-zero for the loop to execute at least once.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `n` must be non-zero.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be non-zero, `k` is an input integer, `s` is 0, `m` is 1**
