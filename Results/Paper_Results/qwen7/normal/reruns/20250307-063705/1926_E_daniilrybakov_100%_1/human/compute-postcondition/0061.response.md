Output State: **`n` is equal to `n` // 2; `x` is equal to (`n` + 1) // 2; `s` is equal to `s` + `x`; `m` is twice its original value.**

Explanation: The code `m *= 2` multiplies the current value of `m` by 2. Since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `m`, we only know that it is now twice its original value. The values of `n`, `x`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial states.
