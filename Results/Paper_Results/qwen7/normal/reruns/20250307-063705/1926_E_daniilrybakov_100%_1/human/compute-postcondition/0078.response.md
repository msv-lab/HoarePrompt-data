Output State: **`n` is now `n // 8 // int(input()) // 2`, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`, `s` is `s + x`, and `m` is doubled.**

Explanation: The variable `m` is multiplied by 2 (`m *= 2`). The values of `n`, `x`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial state. The output state includes the updated value of `m` and the unchanged states of `n`, `x`, and `s`.
