Output State: **`n` is now `n // 2`, `k` is updated to the integer value of the second input, `s` is 0, `m` is 1, `x` is `((n // 2) + 1) // 2`.**

Explanation: The code `n //= 2` divides `n` by 2 and updates `n` to the integer result of this division. The other variables (`k`, `s`, `m`, and `x`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `x` is recalculated based on the new value of `n`.
