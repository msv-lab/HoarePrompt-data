Output State: **`n` is equal to `n` // 2; `x` is equal to (`n` + 1) // 2**

Explanation: The code `n //= 2` divides `n` by 2 and assigns the floor division result back to `n`. Since `x` was previously defined as `(n + 1) // 2`, and given that `n` is now `n // 2`, `x` remains as `(`n` + 1) // 2`. The initial condition that `n` must be greater than 0 is still valid.
