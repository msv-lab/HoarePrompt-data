Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is now `n // 2`, `k` is an input integer, `s` is `(n + 1) // 2`, `m` is 2, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`, and `s` is increased by `(n + 1) // 2**.

Explanation: The variable `s` is incremented by the value of `x`, which is `(n + 1) // 2`. The other variables remain unchanged from their preconditions.
