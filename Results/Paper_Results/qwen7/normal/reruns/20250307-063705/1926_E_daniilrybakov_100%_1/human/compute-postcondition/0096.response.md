Output State: `n` is now `n // 8 // int(input()) // 4`, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`, `s` is the sum of all `x` values added in each iteration, and `m` is doubled three times.

To explain this output state in natural language:
After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `n` has been halved three times from its initial value (`n // 8 // int(input())`). This means `n` is now `n // 8 // int(input()) // 4`. The variable `x` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2` in each iteration. The variable `s` accumulates the sum of all `x` values added during the iterations, and `m` is doubled three times, making it `m * 2^3` or simply `m * 8`.
