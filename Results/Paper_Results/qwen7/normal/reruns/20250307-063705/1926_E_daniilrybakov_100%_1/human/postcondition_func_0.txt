The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers \( n \) and \( k \). For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific value based on the relationship between \( n \) and \( k \). Specifically, it finds the smallest integer \( m \) such that the sum of certain terms up to \( m \) is just less than or equal to \( k \), and then computes and outputs a formula involving \( k \) and \( m \). The function reads \( t \) test cases from the input, where \( 1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4 \), and \( 1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^9 \) for each test case.
