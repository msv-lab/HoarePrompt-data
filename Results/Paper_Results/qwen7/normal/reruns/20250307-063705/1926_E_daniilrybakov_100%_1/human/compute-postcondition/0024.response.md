Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is now `n // 2`, `k` is an input integer, `s` is increased by `(n + 1) // 2`, `m` is 4, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`**.

Explanation: The code `n //= 2` divides `n` by 2 and assigns the result back to `n`. Since `n` was previously at least 1, `n` is now `n // 2`. All other variables (`t`, `k`, `s`, `m`, and `x`) remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states.
