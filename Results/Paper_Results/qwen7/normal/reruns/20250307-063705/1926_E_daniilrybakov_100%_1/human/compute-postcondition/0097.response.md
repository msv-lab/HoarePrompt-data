Let's break down the problem step by step based on the initial state provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is now `n // 8 // int(input()) // 4`
   - `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`
   - `s` is the sum of all `x` values added in each iteration
   - `m` is doubled three times, so `m = m * 8`

2. **Code to Analyze:**
   ```python
   print((2 * (k - s) - 1) * m)
   ```

3. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `n` is derived from an initial value of `n` after being halved three times. Specifically, `n` becomes `n // 8 // int(input()) // 4`.
   - `x` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2` in each iteration.
   - `s` is the cumulative sum of all `x` values added in each iteration.
   - `m` is doubled three times, resulting in `m * 8`.

4. **Explanation of the Print Statement:**
   - The expression inside the print statement is `(2 * (k - s) - 1) * m`.
   - Here, `k` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it is used in the expression. Since `k` is not defined, we cannot determine its exact value. However, we know that `s` is the sum of all `x` values added in each iteration, and `m` is `8`.
   - Therefore, the expression simplifies to `(2 * (k - s) - 1) * 8`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The print statement will output the result of the expression `(2 * (k - s) - 1) * 8`.

Given the above analysis, the output will be:

Output: **(2 * (k - s) - 1) * 8**
