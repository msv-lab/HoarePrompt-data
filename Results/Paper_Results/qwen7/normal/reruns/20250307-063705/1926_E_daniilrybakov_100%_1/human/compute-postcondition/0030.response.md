Output State: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is now `n // 2` after all iterations, `k` is an input integer, `s` is the sum of `x` after each iteration, `m` is \(2^{\text{number of iterations}}\), and `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` remains greater than 0, `n` is reduced to `n // 2` as many times as the loop ran, `k` remains unchanged, `s` is the cumulative sum of `x` from each iteration, `m` is \(2\) raised to the power of the number of iterations, and `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`.
