Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    s = 0
    m = 1
    while n:
        x = (n + 1) // 2
        n //= 2
        if s < k and k <= s + x:
            break
        s += x
        m *= 2
    print((2 * (k - s) - 1) * m)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` will be `t // 2**i` where `i` is the number of iterations the loop executed, `k` is an input integer, `s` is the sum of `x` after each iteration, with `x` being `(n + 1) // 2` at the start of each iteration, `m` will be `2**i`, where `i` is the number of iterations the loop executed.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` remains greater than 0, `n` is reduced to `t` divided by \(2^i\), where \(i\) is the total number of iterations, `k` remains as the input integer, `s` is the cumulative sum of `x` values from each iteration, with `x` starting as `(n + 1) // 2` at the beginning of each iteration, `m` is \(2^i\), indicating the number of iterations that occurred.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `n` is now `n // 8`, `k` is updated to the integer value of the second input, `s` is `s + ((n // 2) + 1) // 2 + ((n // 4) + 1) // 2 + ((n // 8) + 1) // 2`, `m` is `m * 8`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `n` will have been halved three times, resulting in `n` being divided by \(2^3 = 8\). The variable `m` is multiplied by 2 in each iteration, so after 3 iterations, it will be \(2^3 = 8\) times its original value. The variable `s` accumulates the sum of `x` in each iteration, where `x` is calculated as \((n + 1) // 2\) in each step, starting from the initial value of `n` and halving it each time. Therefore, `s` will be the sum of the first three terms of the sequence generated by halving `n` and adding 1, then taking the floor division by 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `n` is now `n // 8 // int(input()) // 4`, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`, `s` is the sum of all `x` values added in each iteration, and `m` is doubled three times.

To explain this output state in natural language:
After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `n` has been halved three times from its initial value (`n // 8 // int(input())`). This means `n` is now `n // 8 // int(input()) // 4`. The variable `x` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2` in each iteration. The variable `s` accumulates the sum of all `x` values added during the iterations, and `m` is doubled three times, making it `m * 2^3` or simply `m * 8`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
