Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 1, `k` is an input integer, `s` is increased by `(n + 1) // 2`, `m` is 4, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`**.

The code `x = (n + 1) // 2` does not change the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `s`, or `m`. It only updates the value of `x` to be `(n + 1) // 2`, which is already stated in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
