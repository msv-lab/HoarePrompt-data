Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is now `n // 2`, `k` is an input integer, `s` is 0, `m` is 1, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`**.

Explanation: The code `n //= 2` divides `n` by 2 and assigns the result back to `n`. Since `n` was originally a non-zero integer, after the operation, `n` becomes `n // 2`. All other variables (`t`, `k`, `s`, `m`, and `x`) remain unchanged. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 0 and `n` must be non-zero still holds true. The value of `x` is recalculated based on the new value of `n`.
