Output State: **`n` is now `n // 2`, `x` is equal to `(n + 1) // 2`.**

Explanation: The value of `n` is updated to `n // 2`, which means `n` is now half of its original value (integer division). The value of `x` is defined as `(n + 1) // 2`, but since `n` has changed, `x` is now `(n // 2 + 1) // 2`. The initial condition that `n` must be non-zero is still valid.
