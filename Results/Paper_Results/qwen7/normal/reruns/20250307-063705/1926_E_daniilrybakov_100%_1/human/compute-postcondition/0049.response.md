Output State: **`n` is now `n // 2`; `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`**

Explanation: The value of `n` is updated to `n // 2`, which means `n` is now divided by 2 and rounded down to the nearest whole number. The value of `x` is defined as `(n + 1) // 2`, which remains unchanged because the calculation of `x` depends on the updated value of `n`. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 0 is still valid.
