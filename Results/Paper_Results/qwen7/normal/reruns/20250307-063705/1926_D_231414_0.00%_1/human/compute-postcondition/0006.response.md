Output State: **`times` must be greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `check` is 2147483647, `n` is an input integer, `data` is a list of integers entered by the user, `dic` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is `n`.**

The code assigns the value of `n` to the variable `ans`. Since `n` is an input integer, `ans` now holds the same value as `n`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
