Output State: **`times` is an input integer, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.**

Explanation: The variable `times` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means it now holds an integer input from the user. The variable `t` was initially described as a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), but since no operation was performed on `t` within the given code snippet, its state remains unchanged.
