Output State: **`times` is an input integer, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `check` is 2147483647**

Explanation: The code sets `check` to the value of \(2^{31} - 1\), which is 2147483647. This value does not affect the values of `times` or `t`. Therefore, their states remain unchanged.
