Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(times):`. The only object here is `times`.

2. **Determine the conditions for loop execution**: The loop will execute as long as `times` is greater than 0.

3. **Adjust the state accordingly**: Since `times` is the only variable involved in the loop head, we need to ensure that `times` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Given the initial state:
- `times` is an input integer.
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `check` is 2147483647.

We need to adjust the state such that `times` is greater than 0.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`times` must be greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `check` is 2147483647**
