Output State: **`times` must be greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `check` is 2147483647, `n` is an input integer, `data` is a list of integers entered by the user, `dic` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is `n`, `check` is updated to 2147483647.**

Explanation: The line `check = 2 ** 31 - 1` updates the value of `check` to 2147483647. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
