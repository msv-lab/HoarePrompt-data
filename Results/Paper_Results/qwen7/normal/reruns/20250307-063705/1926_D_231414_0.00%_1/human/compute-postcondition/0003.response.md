Output State: **`times` must be greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `check` is 2147483647, `n` is an input integer.**

The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input received from the user to the variable `n`. The initial conditions for `times`, `t`, and `check` remain unchanged. Therefore, `times` must still be greater than 0, `t` is still a positive integer within the specified range, and `check` is still 2147483647. The variable `n` now holds the integer value entered by the user.
