Output State: **`data` is a list of integers with at least one element, `s` is the bitwise XOR of the first element of `data` and the variable `check` decreased by 1, `ans` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is decremented by 1. The values of `data` and `s` remain unchanged from their initial state, except that `s` is now the bitwise XOR of the first element of `data` and `check` decreased by 1.
