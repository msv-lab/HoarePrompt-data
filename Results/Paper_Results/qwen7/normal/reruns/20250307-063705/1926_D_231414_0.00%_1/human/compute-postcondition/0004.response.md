Output State: **`times` must be greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `check` is 2147483647, `n` is an input integer, `data` is a list of integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `data = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer. These integers are then stored in the list `data`. The values of `times`, `t`, and `check` remain unchanged, and `n` remains an input integer.
