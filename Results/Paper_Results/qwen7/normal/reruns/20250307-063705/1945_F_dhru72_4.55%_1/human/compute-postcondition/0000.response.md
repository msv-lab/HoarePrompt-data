Output State: **T is a type variable, 'T', is unchanged; n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; v is a list of n positive integers such that 1 ≤ v_i ≤ 10^9; p is a permutation of numbers from 1 to n; T is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.**

Explanation: The given code snippet defines a type variable `T` using `TypeVar('T')`. However, no operations are performed on any of the variables (`t`, `n`, `v`, or `p`). Therefore, the values and conditions of these variables remain the same as the initial state.
