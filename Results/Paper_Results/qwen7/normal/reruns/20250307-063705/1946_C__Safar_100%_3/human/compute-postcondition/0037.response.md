Output State: **`c` is 0, `l` is greater than `r`, `r` is less than `l`, `mid` is the last calculated midpoint value, and `check(mid)` is True.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the binary search process would have narrowed down the range until `l` becomes strictly greater than `r`. This indicates that the search space is exhausted, and the last `mid` value for which `check(mid)` returned `False` is the closest to the condition being met. Since `l` is now greater than `r`, the loop terminates, and `check(mid)` for the last `mid` value evaluated must be `True` because the loop would not continue if `check(mid)` were still `False`.
