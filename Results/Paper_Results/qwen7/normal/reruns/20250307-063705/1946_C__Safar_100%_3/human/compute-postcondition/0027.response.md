Output State: **`visited` is an empty set, stack is [(1, 1)], `x` is 1, `p` is 1, A is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing k edges, `g` is a dictionary where keys are vertex indices and values are lists of adjacent vertices, `d` is a dictionary with key (1) and value 1, `r` is 1.**

The value of `r` is incremented by 1, making it 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
