Functionality: **The function constructs an adjacency list representation of a tree using the given number of vertices \( n \), the number of segments \( k \), and a list of edges. It then performs a binary search to find a specific value \( r \) that satisfies a condition checked by the `check(mid)` function. Finally, it prints the value of \( r \).**
