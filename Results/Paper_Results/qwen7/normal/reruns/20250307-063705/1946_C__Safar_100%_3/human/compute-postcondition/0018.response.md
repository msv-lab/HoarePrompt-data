Output State: **`node` is the next node in the adjacency list `g[x]` (not equal to `p`), `stack` contains the tuple `(node, x)`, and the new tuple `(node, x)` is appended to `stack`.**

This means that the tuple `(node, x)` has been added to the end of the `stack`. The values of `node`, `x`, and `p` remain unchanged from their initial state.
