Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `visited` contains {1}, stack is [(1, 1)], `x` is 1, `p` is 1, A is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing k edges, `g` is a dictionary where keys are vertex indices and values are lists of adjacent vertices, `d` is a dictionary with key (1) and value 1, `r` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for node in g[x]:
    if node != p:
        stack.append((node, x))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `node` is not equal to `p`; `stack` contains the tuple `(node, x)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `node` is not equal to `p` and is the next node in the adjacency list `g[x]`, `stack` contains the tuple `(node, x)` and the new tuple `(node, x)` is appended to `stack`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `node` is the next node in the adjacency list `g[x]` (not equal to `p`), `stack` contains the tuple `(node, x)`, and the new tuple `(node, x)` is appended to `stack`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
