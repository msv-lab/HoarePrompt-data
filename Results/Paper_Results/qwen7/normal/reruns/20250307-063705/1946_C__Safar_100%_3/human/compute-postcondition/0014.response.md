Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for node in g[x]`. The variables involved in the loop head are `node` and `x`.

2. **Understand the postcondition from the previous iteration**: The postcondition given is that `node` is not equal to `p` and `stack` contains the tuple `(node, x)`.

3. **Determine the changes needed for the next iteration**:
   - The variable `x` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.
   - The variable `node` needs to be updated to the next node in the adjacency list `g[x]` such that `node` is not equal to `p`.

4. **Formulate the new state**: After the loop starts the next iteration, `node` will be the next node in the adjacency list `g[x]` (excluding `p`), and `stack` will contain the tuple `(node, x)`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`node` is not equal to `p` and is the next node in the adjacency list `g[x]`, `stack` contains the tuple `(node, x)`**.
