Output State: **stack is [(1, 1)], A is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing k edges, g is a dictionary where keys are vertex indices and values are lists of adjacent vertices.**

Explanation: The code initializes a stack with a tuple `(1, 1)`. The values of `A` and `g` remain unchanged from their initial state.
