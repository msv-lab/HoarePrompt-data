Output State: **`node` is not equal to `p` and is the next node in the adjacency list `g[x]`, `stack` contains the tuple `(node, x)` and the new tuple `(node, x)` is appended to `stack`.**

This means that the tuple `(node, x)` has been added to the end of the `stack` list, while the conditions and values of `node` and `stack` remain unchanged from their initial state.
