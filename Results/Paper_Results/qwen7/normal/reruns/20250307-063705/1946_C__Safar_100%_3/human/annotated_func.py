#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n, and edges is a list of tuples where each tuple (a, b) represents an edge between vertices a and b in the tree, with 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n.
def func_1(n, k, edges):
    g = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for (a, b) in edges:
        g[a].append(b)
        
        g[b].append(a)
        
    #State: Output State: The list `g` is fully constructed as an adjacency list representation of a tree with `n` vertices, where each vertex `i` (from 1 to `n`) has its corresponding list `g[i]` containing all vertices `j` such that there is an edge between vertex `i` and vertex `j`. All edges in the `edges` list have been processed, and each vertex's adjacency list is complete based on the given edges.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the list `g` will represent a tree structure where each vertex points to all other vertices it is connected to via edges provided in the `edges` list.
    c = 0
    l = 1
    r = n // k
    while l <= r:
        mid = l + (r - l) // 2
        
        if check(mid):
            l = mid + 1
        else:
            r = mid - 1
        
    #State: `c` is 0, `l` is greater than `r`, `r` is less than `l`, `mid` is the last calculated midpoint value, and `check(mid)` is True.
    print(r)
    #This is printed: r (where r is a value less than l)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function constructs an adjacency list representation of a tree using the given number of vertices \( n \), the number of segments \( k \), and a list of edges. It then performs a binary search to find a specific value \( r \) that satisfies a condition checked by the `check(mid)` function. Finally, it prints the value of \( r \).
