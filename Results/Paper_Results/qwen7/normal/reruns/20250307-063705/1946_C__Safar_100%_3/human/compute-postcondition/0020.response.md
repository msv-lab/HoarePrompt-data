Output State: The `stack` will contain tuples of all nodes that are reachable from the initial node 1, without any node being repeated more than once. The `node` variable will hold the last node visited during the final iteration of the loop, which is the deepest node in the traversal from the starting node 1. The `x` variable will hold the parent node of the current `node`. All other variables (`visited`, `p`, `A`, `g`, `d`, `r`) will retain their initial values.

In simpler terms, the `stack` will contain a path from the initial node 1 to the deepest node in the graph that can be reached without revisiting any node, and the `node` and `x` variables will point to the end of this path.
