Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for node in g[x]`. The variables involved here are `node` and `x`.

2. **Understand the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `node` is not equal to `p` and is the next node in the adjacency list `g[x]`.
   - `stack` contains the tuple `(node, x)` and the new tuple `(node, x)` is appended to `stack`.

3. **Determine the Conditions for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `node` must be a valid next node in the adjacency list `g[x]` and it must not be equal to `p`.
   - The `stack` will contain the tuple `(node, x)` from the current iteration and the new tuple `(node, x)` will be appended to `stack`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `node` is the next node in the adjacency list `g[x]`, it will change to the next node in the list for the next iteration.
   - The condition `node != p` must still hold true.
   - The `stack` will contain the tuple `(node, x)` from the current iteration and the new tuple `(node, x)` will be appended to `stack`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `node` will be the next node in the adjacency list `g[x]` (not equal to `p`).
- `stack` will contain the tuple `(node, x)` from the current iteration and the new tuple `(node, x)` will be appended to `stack`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`node` is the next node in the adjacency list `g[x]` (not equal to `p`), `stack` contains the tuple `(node, x)` and the new tuple `(node, x)` is appended to `stack`**
