Output State: **`visited` is an empty set, stack is [(1, 1)], `x` is 1, `p` is 1, A is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing k edges, `g` is a dictionary where keys are vertex indices and values are lists of adjacent vertices, `d` is a dictionary with key (1) and value 1, `r` is 0**

Explanation: The code `x, p = stack[-1]` pops the last element from the stack and assigns its values to `x` and `p`. Since the stack contains only one element `(1, 1)`, both `x` and `p` are assigned the value `1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
