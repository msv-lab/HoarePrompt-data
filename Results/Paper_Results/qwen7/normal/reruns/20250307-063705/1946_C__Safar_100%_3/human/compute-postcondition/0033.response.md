Output State: **`c` is 0, `l` is `mid + 1`, `r` must be greater than or equal to `l`, `mid` is now `l + (r - l) // 2`, and `check(mid)` is False.**

Explanation: The code `l = mid + 1` updates the value of `l` to `mid + 1`. All other variables (`c`, `r`, `mid`, and `check(mid)`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
