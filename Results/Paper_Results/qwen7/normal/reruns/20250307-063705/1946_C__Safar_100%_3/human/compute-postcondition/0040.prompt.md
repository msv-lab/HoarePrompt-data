You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n, and edges is a list of tuples where each tuple (a, b) represents an edge between vertices a and b in the tree, with 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n.
def func_1(n, k, edges):
    g = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for (a, b) in edges:
        g[a].append(b)
        
        g[b].append(a)
        
    #State: Output State: The list `g` is fully constructed as an adjacency list representation of a tree with `n` vertices, where each vertex `i` (from 1 to `n`) has its corresponding list `g[i]` containing all vertices `j` such that there is an edge between vertex `i` and vertex `j`. All edges in the `edges` list have been processed, and each vertex's adjacency list is complete based on the given edges.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the list `g` will represent a tree structure where each vertex points to all other vertices it is connected to via edges provided in the `edges` list.
    c = 0
    l = 1
    r = n // k
    while l <= r:
        mid = l + (r - l) // 2
        
        if check(mid):
            l = mid + 1
        else:
            r = mid - 1
        
    #State: `c` is 0, `l` is greater than `r`, `r` is less than `l`, `mid` is the last calculated midpoint value, and `check(mid)` is True.
    print(r)
    #This is printed: r (where r is a value less than l)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), an integer `k` (1 ≤ k < n), and a list of tuples `edges` representing edges in a tree.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
