Based on the initial state provided:

- `c` is 0.
- `l` is greater than `r`.
- `r` is less than `l`.
- `mid` is the last calculated midpoint value.
- `check(mid)` is True.

The `print(r)` statement will print the value of `r`.

Given that `r` is less than `l` but `l` is greater than `r`, `r` must be a valid value within this range. Since no specific value is provided for `r`, we can only describe it in terms of its relationship to `l`.

Output: **r (where r is a value less than l)**
