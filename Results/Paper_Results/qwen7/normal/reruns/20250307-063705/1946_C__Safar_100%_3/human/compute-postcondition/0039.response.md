The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `edges`. 

- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.
- `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n.
- `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple (a, b) represents an edge between vertices a and b in the tree, with 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n.

The function returns a value based on the given parameters. However, since no specific output logic is provided in the problem statement, we can only describe the parameters and their constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), an integer `k` (1 ≤ k < n), and a list of tuples `edges` representing edges in a tree.**
