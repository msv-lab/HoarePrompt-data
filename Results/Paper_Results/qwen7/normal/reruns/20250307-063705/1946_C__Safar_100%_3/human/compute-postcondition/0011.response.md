Output State: **`node` is not equal to `p`; `stack` contains the tuple `(node, x)`**.

The code appends a tuple containing the current `node` and `x` to the `stack`. Since the initial state specifies that `node` is not equal to `p`, and no other changes are made to `node` or `p`, these values remain unchanged. The `stack` now includes the newly added tuple.
