Postcondition: **`visited` is an empty set, stack is [(1, 1)], `x` is 1, `p` is 1, A is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing k edges, `g` is a dictionary where keys are vertex indices and values are lists of adjacent vertices, `d` is a dictionary with key (1) and value either 1 or 2 depending on whether `d[x]` is greater than or equal to A, `r` is 1 if `d[x]` is greater than or equal to A, otherwise `r` remains 0.**
