Output State: **`visited` is an empty set, stack is [(1, 1)], A is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing k edges, g is a dictionary where keys are vertex indices and values are lists of adjacent vertices.**

The code initializes an empty set named `visited`. The other variables (`stack`, `A`, and `g`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
