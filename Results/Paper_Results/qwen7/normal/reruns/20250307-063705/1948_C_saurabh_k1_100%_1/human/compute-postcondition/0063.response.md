Output State: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` (which starts from 1 and increments by 2 each time) is less than `n`. After all iterations, if the loop does not encounter a condition where it prints 'No' and breaks, it will print 'yes'. 

The final output state would be:
- `i` will be equal to `n-1` if `n` is odd, or `n-2` if `n` is even, because the loop increments `i` by 2 starting from 1 up to but not including `n`.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `a` and `b` remain lists of characters as they were initialized.
- If the loop completes without finding any pair `a[i]` and `b[i+1]` or `a[i]` and `b[i-1]` both equal to '<', the final output will be 'yes'.
- If the loop finds such a pair at any point, it will print 'No' and exit the loop prematurely.

In summary, the output state after all iterations of the loop will be determined by whether the loop finds any pair `a[i]` and `b[i+1]` or `a[i]` and `b[i-1]` both equal to '<'. If no such pair is found, the output will be 'yes'; otherwise, it will be 'No'.
