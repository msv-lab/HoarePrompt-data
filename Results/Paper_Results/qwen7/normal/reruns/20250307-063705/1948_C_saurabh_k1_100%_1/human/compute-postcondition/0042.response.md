The only objects in the loop head are variables `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. The loop will continue as long as there are more test cases to process, meaning `t` must be greater than 0.

At the end of the previous iteration, the loop has processed one test case, so `t` is reduced by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
