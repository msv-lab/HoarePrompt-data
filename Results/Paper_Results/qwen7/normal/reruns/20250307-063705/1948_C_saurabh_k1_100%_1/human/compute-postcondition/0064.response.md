Output State: The loop will execute for all valid values of `t`, meaning it will run through all the inputs provided by the user for `t` test cases. For each test case, the loop checks every odd index `i` in the string `a` and compares it with the character at position `i+1` or `i-1` in string `b`. If the condition `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` is ever met for any odd `i`, the loop will print 'No' and terminate early. If the loop completes all iterations for a given test case without finding any such pair, it will print 'yes'.

After all iterations of the loop have finished, the output state will be:

Output State: The final output will be 'yes' for all test cases where none of the conditions `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` are satisfied for any odd index `i`. If any of these conditions are met at any point during the loop's execution, the output for that test case will be 'No'.
