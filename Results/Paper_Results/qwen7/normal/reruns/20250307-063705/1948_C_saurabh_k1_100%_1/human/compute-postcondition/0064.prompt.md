Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive. The conditions for `n`, the strings, and the constraints remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    for i in range(1, n, 2):
        if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
            print('No')
            break
    else:
        print('yes')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations without breaking out of the loop. This means that for all odd indices `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1` (inclusive), the condition `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` was never true. Therefore, the loop completes all its iterations and prints 'yes'.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, none of the conditions `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` were met for any odd index `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1`, so the loop finishes and outputs 'yes'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: The loop will execute for all odd numbers from 1 to `n-1` (inclusive). If during any iteration of the loop, the condition `a[i] == b[i+1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i-1] == '<'` is met, the loop will break and print 'No'. If the loop completes all its iterations without breaking, it will print 'yes'.

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, the output will be 'yes' if none of the conditions `a[i] == b[i+1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i-1] == '<'` are satisfied for any odd `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1`. Otherwise, if any of these conditions are met at any point, the output will be 'No'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` (which starts from 1 and increments by 2 each time) is less than `n`. After all iterations, if the loop does not encounter a condition where it prints 'No' and breaks, it will print 'yes'. 

The final output state would be:
- `i` will be equal to `n-1` if `n` is odd, or `n-2` if `n` is even, because the loop increments `i` by 2 starting from 1 up to but not including `n`.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `a` and `b` remain lists of characters as they were initialized.
- If the loop completes without finding any pair `a[i]` and `b[i+1]` or `a[i]` and `b[i-1]` both equal to '<', the final output will be 'yes'.
- If the loop finds such a pair at any point, it will print 'No' and exit the loop prematurely.

In summary, the output state after all iterations of the loop will be determined by whether the loop finds any pair `a[i]` and `b[i+1]` or `a[i]` and `b[i-1]` both equal to '<'. If no such pair is found, the output will be 'yes'; otherwise, it will be 'No'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
