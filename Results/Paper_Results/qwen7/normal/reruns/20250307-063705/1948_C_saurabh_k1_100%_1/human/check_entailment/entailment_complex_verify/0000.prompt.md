You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Output

    YES
    
Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
                print('No')
                break
        else:
            print('yes')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5 and n is even; the first line of each test case contains a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and/or '>'; the second line of each test case contains a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and/or '>'; there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
                print('No')
                break
        else:
            print('yes')
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will execute for all valid values of `t`, meaning it will run the inner loop for all integers from 1 to `n-1` with a step of 2. If during any iteration of the loop, the condition `a[i] == b[i+1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i-1] == '<'` is met, the loop will break and print 'No'. If the loop completes all its iterations without breaking, it will print 'yes'.
    #
    #In summary, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the output will be 'yes' if none of the conditions `a[i] == b[i+1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i-1] == '<'` are satisfied for any odd `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1`. Otherwise, if any of these conditions are met at any point, the output will be 'No'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each containing an integer \( t \) (number of test cases), an integer \( n \) (length of two character strings), and two strings of length \( n \) consisting of characters '<' and '/>'. For each test case, it checks if any pair of characters in the same position (odd index) of the two strings satisfy specific conditions (`a[i] == b[i+1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i-1] == '<'`). If any such condition is met, it prints 'No' and stops processing further test cases. If no such conditions are met for any test case, it prints 'Yes'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n). Specifically, the program checks only a few conditions and prints 'No' prematurely without considering all possible valid paths. Here is a counterexample:

Consider the following input:
```
4
<<>>
<>>
```

The robot starts at (1, 1). According to the arrows, it moves right to (1, 2), then down to (2, 2), and finally right to (2, 3). This path successfully reaches (2, n).

However, the program incorrectly prints 'No' for this input because it checks the condition `if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` and finds that `a[1] == '<'` and `b[2] == '>'`, which does not satisfy the condition, leading to an incorrect early termination.

Therefore, the program does not handle all valid paths correctly and thus is incorrect.
