You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5 and n is even; the first line of each test case contains a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and/or '>'; the second line of each test case contains a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and/or '>'; there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
                print('No')
                break
        else:
            print('yes')
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will execute for all valid values of `t`, meaning it will run the inner loop for all integers from 1 to `n-1` with a step of 2. If during any iteration of the loop, the condition `a[i] == b[i+1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i-1] == '<'` is met, the loop will break and print 'No'. If the loop completes all its iterations without breaking, it will print 'yes'.
    #
    #In summary, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the output will be 'yes' if none of the conditions `a[i] == b[i+1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i-1] == '<'` are satisfied for any odd `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1`. Otherwise, if any of these conditions are met at any point, the output will be 'No'.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input data through a series of test cases. Each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and n is even), and two strings of length n consisting of characters '<' and/or '>'. The function checks the relationship between these strings and returns a result based on the given constraints.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
