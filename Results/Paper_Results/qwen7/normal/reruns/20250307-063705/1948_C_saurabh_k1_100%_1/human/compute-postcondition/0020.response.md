Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations without breaking out of it. This means that for every `i` in the range `1` to `n-2` (inclusive) with a step of `2`, the condition `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` was never true. Therefore, the loop completes all its iterations and prints 'yes'.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the output state is that the loop did not encounter any instance where the specified conditions were met for any `i` in the given range, so it printed 'yes'.
