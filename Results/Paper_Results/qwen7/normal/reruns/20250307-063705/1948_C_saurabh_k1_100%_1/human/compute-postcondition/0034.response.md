Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `(i + 2) + 1` must be less than `n`, and either `a[i + 2]` is equal to `b[(i + 2) + 1]` which is '<', or `a[i + 2]` is equal to `b[(i + 2) - 1]` which is '<', and we break out of the most internal loop or conditional statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead exits the loop or conditional block it is within. Therefore, the conditions and values of the variables before the `break` statement remain unchanged.
