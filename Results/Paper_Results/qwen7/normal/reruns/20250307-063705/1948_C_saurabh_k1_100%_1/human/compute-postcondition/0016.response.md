Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is defined as `i + 2`. This means `i` is being set to a value that is 2 more than its current value. However, since `i` is not explicitly given a starting value, we can only refer to it as `i + 2`.
- `n` must be greater than `i + 2`. This means `n` is some value that satisfies this condition.

The print statement simply outputs the string `'No'`.

Output: **'No'**
