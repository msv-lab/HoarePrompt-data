Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `(x + 2) + 1` must be less than `n`, and either `a[x + 2]` is equal to `b[(x + 2) + 1]` which is '<', or `a[x + 2]` is equal to `b[(x + 2) - 1]` which is '<', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the loop or the most internal if statement. Therefore, the conditions and values of the variables before the `break` statement remain unchanged.
