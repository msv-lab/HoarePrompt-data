Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input string**.

Explanation: The variable `a` is assigned the value of the input provided by the user, which is treated as a string since no type conversion is specified. The conditions and values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
