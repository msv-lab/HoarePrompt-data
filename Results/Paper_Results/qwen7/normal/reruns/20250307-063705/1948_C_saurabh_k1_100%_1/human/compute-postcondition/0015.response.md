Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, n, 2)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is within the range defined by `range(1, n, 2)`. This means `i` must be an odd number between 1 (inclusive) and `n` (exclusive).

3. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is an index, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if either `i + 1 < n` and `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` is true.

4. **Calculate the next possible value of `i`**: Since the loop increments `i` by 2 each time (`range(1, n, 2)`), the next possible value of `i` would be `i + 2`.

5. **Check the loop condition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i + 2` must still be within the range defined by `range(1, n, 2)`.
   - Additionally, the conditions `i + 1 < n` and `a[i + 2] == b[i + 3] == '<'` or `a[i + 2] == b[i + 1] == '<'` must not be met to avoid breaking out of the loop.

6. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 2, so the new value of `i` will be `i + 2`.
   - `n` remains unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body, but since no modification is mentioned, it stays the same.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `n` must be greater than `i + 2`**.

To provide a concrete example, if `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, then `i` would be 3 at the start of the next iteration, and `n` must be greater than 3. 

Therefore, the final answer is:

State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `n` must be greater than `i + 2`**.
