Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Movement**: The logic in the loop does not correctly simulate the movement of the robot according to the rules specified in the problem. Specifically, the robot should move based on both the initial direction and the subsequent arrow direction, but the current implementation only checks the arrow directions at specific indices without considering the robot's actual path.

2. **Break Statement Misuse**: The `break` statement is used to prematurely exit the loop when a condition is met, but this condition is not correctly formulated to ensure the robot cannot reach the target cell. The condition `i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` does not accurately represent the robot's movement logic.

3. **Output Formatting**: The output should be in lowercase ('yes' or 'no') as per the problem statement, but the current code prints 'No' with a capital 'N'.

To correctly solve the problem, you need to simulate the robot's movement step-by-step, ensuring it follows the grid's arrows and checks if it can reach the target cell (2, n). Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        
        # Simulate the robot's movement
        x, y = 1, 1  # Start at (1, 1)
        while True:
            if x == 2 and y == n:
                print('yes')
                break
            elif x == 1:
                if y % 2 == 1 and a[y - 1] == '>':  # Move right
                    y += 1
                elif y % 2 == 0 and a[y - 1] == '<':  # Move left
                    y -= 1
                if y < 1 or y > n:
                    print('no')
                    break
                x = 2  # Move down
            elif x == 2:
                if y % 2 == 1 and b[y - 1] == '>':  # Move right
                    y += 1
                elif y % 2 == 0 and b[y - 1] == '<':  # Move left
                    y -= 1
                if y < 1 or y > n:
                    print('no')
                    break
                x = 1  # Move up
        else:
            print('no')

func()
```

This corrected version simulates the robot's movement step-by-step, checking if it can reach the target cell (2, n) based on the given grid configuration.
