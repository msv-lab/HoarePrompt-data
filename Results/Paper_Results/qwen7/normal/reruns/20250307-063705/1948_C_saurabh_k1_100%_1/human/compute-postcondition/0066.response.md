Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input data through a series of test cases. Each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and n is even), and two strings of length n consisting of characters '<' and/or '>'. The function checks the relationship between these strings and returns a result based on the given constraints.**

Note: The actual logic for processing the input and determining the result is not described here as per the instructions.
