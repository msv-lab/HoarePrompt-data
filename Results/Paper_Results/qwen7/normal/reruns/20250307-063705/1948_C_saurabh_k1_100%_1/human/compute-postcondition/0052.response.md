Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is defined by the `for i in range(1, n, 2)` statement. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i + 1 < n` and either `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` is true. However, since we are only adjusting the states at the start of the next iteration, we focus on the condition `i + 1 < n` and the increment of `i`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is greater than 1
   - `a` is a list of characters
   - `b` is a list of characters

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 2 each time (`range(1, n, 2)`), the next value of `i` will be `i + 2`.
   - Given `i` is currently 1, the next value of `i` will be `1 + 2 = 3`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i + 1` (which will be 4) must be less than `n`. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 4.

So, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 4, `a` is a list of characters, `b` is a list of characters**
