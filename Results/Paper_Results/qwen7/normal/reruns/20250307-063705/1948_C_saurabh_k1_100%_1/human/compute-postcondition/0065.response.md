Output State: The loop will execute for all valid values of `t`, meaning it will run the inner loop for all integers from 1 to `n-1` with a step of 2. If during any iteration of the loop, the condition `a[i] == b[i+1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i-1] == '<'` is met, the loop will break and print 'No'. If the loop completes all its iterations without breaking, it will print 'yes'.

In summary, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the output will be 'yes' if none of the conditions `a[i] == b[i+1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i-1] == '<'` are satisfied for any odd `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1`. Otherwise, if any of these conditions are met at any point, the output will be 'No'.
