Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i`, `n`, and the step value (which is 2). However, the step value is fixed and does not need to be adjusted. The key variables to focus on are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop `for i in range(1, n, 2)` will start with `i = 1` and increment by 2 until `i` is less than `n`.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 1 because the loop starts at 1 and increments by 2.

3. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - The variable `t` is not involved in the loop condition and does not need to be adjusted.
   - The variable `a` is not involved in the loop condition and does not need to be adjusted.
   - The variable `b` is not involved in the loop condition and does not need to be adjusted.
   - The variable `i` will start at 1, but since we are adjusting the state before the loop starts, we do not need to specify its initial value.
   - The variable `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `n` being greater than 1.

**State: **`n` must be greater than 1**
