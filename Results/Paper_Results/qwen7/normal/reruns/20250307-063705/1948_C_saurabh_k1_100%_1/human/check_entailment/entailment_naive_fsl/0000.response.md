Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n). Specifically, the program checks only a few conditions and prints 'No' prematurely without considering all possible valid paths. Here is a counterexample:

Consider the following input:
```
4
<<>>
<>>
```

The robot starts at (1, 1). According to the arrows, it moves right to (1, 2), then down to (2, 2), and finally right to (2, 3). This path successfully reaches (2, n).

However, the program incorrectly prints 'No' for this input because it checks the condition `if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` and finds that `a[1] == '<'` and `b[2] == '>'`, which does not satisfy the condition, leading to an incorrect early termination.

Therefore, the program does not handle all valid paths correctly and thus is incorrect.
