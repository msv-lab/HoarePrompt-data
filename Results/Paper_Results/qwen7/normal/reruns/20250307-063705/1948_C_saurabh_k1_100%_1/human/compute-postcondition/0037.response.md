Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `(x + 2) + 1` must be less than `n`.
- Either `a[x + 2]` is equal to `b[(x + 2) + 1]` which is '<', or `a[x + 2]` is equal to `b[(x + 2) - 1]` which is '<'.

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('No')
```

Given the conditions and the print statement, the output will be the string 'No' because the print statement directly outputs the string 'No' regardless of the conditions specified for the variables `n`, `x`, `a`, and `b`.

Output: **No**
