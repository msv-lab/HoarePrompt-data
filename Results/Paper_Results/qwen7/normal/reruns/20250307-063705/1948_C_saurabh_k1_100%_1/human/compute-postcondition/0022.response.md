The loop head contains the variable `t`, which controls the number of iterations of the loop. Since the loop has completed all its iterations without breaking, the value of `t` must be decremented by 1 to reflect that one iteration has been completed.

Given that the loop has executed all its iterations without breaking, it means that `t` was initially set to some value, and now it should be decreased by 1 to indicate that one complete cycle has been done.

State: **`t` is 0**
