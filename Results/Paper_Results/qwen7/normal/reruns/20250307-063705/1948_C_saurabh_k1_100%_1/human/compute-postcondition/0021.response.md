Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations without breaking out of the loop. This means that for all odd indices `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1` (inclusive), the condition `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` was never true. Therefore, the loop completes all its iterations and prints 'yes'.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, none of the conditions `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` were met for any odd index `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1`, so the loop finishes and outputs 'yes'.
