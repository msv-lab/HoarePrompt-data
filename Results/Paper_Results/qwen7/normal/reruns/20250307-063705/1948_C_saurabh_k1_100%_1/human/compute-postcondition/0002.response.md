Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes this precondition and the new variable `n` which holds the integer value of the user's input.
