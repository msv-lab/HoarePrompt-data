Output State: The loop will execute for all odd numbers from 1 to `n-1` (inclusive). If during any iteration of the loop, the condition `a[i] == b[i+1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i-1] == '<'` is met, the loop will break and print 'No'. If the loop completes all its iterations without breaking, it will print 'yes'.

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, the output will be 'yes' if none of the conditions `a[i] == b[i+1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i-1] == '<'` are satisfied for any odd `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1`. Otherwise, if any of these conditions are met at any point, the output will be 'No'.
