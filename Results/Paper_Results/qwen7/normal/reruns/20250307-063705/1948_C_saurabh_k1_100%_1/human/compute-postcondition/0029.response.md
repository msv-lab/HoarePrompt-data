Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, i + 1 is less than n, and either a[i] is equal to b[i + 1] which is '<' or a[i] is equal to b[i - 1] which is '<', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Therefore, the conditions involving `n`, `i`, `a[i]`, and `b[i + 1]` and `b[i - 1]` remain unchanged, and the only effect is that we break out of the loop or conditional block.
