Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable `i` is defined in the range `range(1, n, 2)`.
   - The loop variable `n` is also relevant as it defines the upper limit of the range.

2. **Understand the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to continue, `i + 1` must be less than `n`.
   - Additionally, either `a[i]` must be equal to `b[i + 1]` which is '<', or `a[i]` must be equal to `b[i - 1]` which is '<'.

3. **Determine the Current State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `i + 1` is less than `n`.
   - Either `a[i]` is equal to `b[i + 1]` which is '<', or `a[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]` which is '<'.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `i` increments by 2 each time, the next value of `i` would be `i + 2`.
   - We need to ensure that `i + 1` is still less than `n` for the next iteration.
   - Given that `i + 1` was less than `n` in the previous iteration, the next value of `i` (which is `i + 2`) should also satisfy this condition.

5. **Update the States:**
   - `i` will be incremented by 2, so the new value of `i` will be `i + 2`.
   - The condition `i + 1 < n` must still hold true for the next iteration.

Therefore, the updated states are:
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `i + 1` must be less than `n`.
- Either `a[i]` is equal to `b[i + 1]` which is '<', or `a[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]` which is '<'.

However, since `i` is incremented by 2, the new value of `i` is `i + 2`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `(i + 2) + 1` must be less than `n`, and either `a[i + 2]` is equal to `b[(i + 2) + 1]` which is '<', or `a[i + 2]` is equal to `b[(i + 2) - 1]` which is '<'**.
