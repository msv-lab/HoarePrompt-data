Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `i + 1` is less than `n`.
- Either `a[i]` is equal to `b[i + 1]` which is '<' or `a[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]` which is '<'.

The print statement simply outputs the string `'No'`.

Since no other variables or objects are involved in the print statement and their values do not affect the output, the print statement will directly output the string `'No'`.

Output: **No**
