Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 1, `(x + 2) + 1` must be less than `n`, and either `a[x + 2]` is equal to `b[(x + 2) + 1]` which is '<', or `a[x + 2]` is equal to `b[(x + 2) - 1]` which is '<'. After executing the if statement, if the condition is met, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
