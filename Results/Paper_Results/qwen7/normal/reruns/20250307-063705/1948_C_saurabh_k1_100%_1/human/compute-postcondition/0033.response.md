Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `(i + 2) + 1` must be less than `n`.
- Either `a[i + 2]` is equal to `b[(i + 2) + 1]` which is '<', or `a[i + 2]` is equal to `b[(i + 2) - 1]` which is '<'.

The print statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print('No')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'No'` without any dependencies on the variables `n`, `i`, `a`, or `b`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **No**
