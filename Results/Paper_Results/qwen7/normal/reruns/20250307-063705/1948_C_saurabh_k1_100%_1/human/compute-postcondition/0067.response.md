Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each containing an integer \( t \) (number of test cases), an integer \( n \) (length of two character strings), and two strings of length \( n \) consisting of characters '<' and '/>'. For each test case, it checks if any pair of characters in the same position (odd index) of the two strings satisfy specific conditions (`a[i] == b[i+1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i-1] == '<'`). If any such condition is met, it prints 'No' and stops processing further test cases. If no such conditions are met for any test case, it prints 'Yes'.**
