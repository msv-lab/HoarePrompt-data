Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 1, `(i + 2) + 1` must be less than `n`, and either `a[i + 2]` is equal to `b[(i + 2) + 1]` which is '<', or `a[i + 2]` is equal to `b[(i + 2) - 1]` which is '<'. After executing the if statement, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or conditional statement.**
