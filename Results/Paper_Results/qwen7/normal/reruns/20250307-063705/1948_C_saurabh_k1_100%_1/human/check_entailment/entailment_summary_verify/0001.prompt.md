You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Output

    YES
    
Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
                print('No')
                break
        else:
            print('yes')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each containing an integer \( t \) (number of test cases), an integer \( n \) (length of two character strings), and two strings of length \( n \) consisting of characters '<' and '/>'. For each test case, it checks if any pair of characters in the same position (odd index) of the two strings satisfy specific conditions (`a[i] == b[i+1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i-1] == '<'`). If any such condition is met, it prints 'No' and stops processing further test cases. If no such conditions are met for any test case, it prints 'Yes'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to determine if a robot starting at (1, 1) can reach (2, n) by moving according to the arrows in the grid.
2. **Key Points**:
   - The robot can only move within the grid boundaries.
   - The robot alternates between horizontal and vertical movements.
   - The grid has specific constraints: each cell contains either `<` (left) or `>` (right), and no arrow points outside the grid.
3. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases (`t`).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of columns (`n`), and the two rows of the grid.
   - It then iterates through every second column (i.e., odd-indexed columns) to check if the robot can move from the first row to the second row.
   - Specifically, it checks if the robot can move from column `i` to column `i+1` in the second row, or from column `i-1` to column `i` in the second row, with the condition that both cells must have arrows pointing inwards (i.e., `<`).

4. **Flaw in the Logic**:
   - The program only checks if the robot can move from the first row to the second row at specific positions. However, it does not account for the possibility of the robot moving back and forth between rows and columns to eventually reach (2, n).
   - The program breaks out of the loop immediately upon finding a single invalid path, which might not cover all possible paths the robot could take to reach (2, n).
   - The program does not consider the full traversal logic required to ensure the robot can indeed reach (2, n).

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - A more comprehensive approach would involve simulating the robot's movement through the grid and checking if it can reach (2, n) from (1, 1).
   - This would involve tracking the robot's position and ensuring it follows the arrows correctly until it reaches the target cell.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly simulate the robot's movement through the grid and does not account for all possible paths the robot could take to reach (2, n). Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
