Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `n`.
2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for values of `i` starting from 1 up to but not including `n`, with a step of 2. This means `i` will take on odd values (1, 3, 5, ..., n-1) as long as `i < n`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of characters, `b` is a list of characters, and the condition `i + 1 < n` and `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` is checked to determine if the loop should break.

Since the loop increments `i` by 2 each time, the next value of `i` would be 3 if the current value of `i` is 1. However, the loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

Given the current state:
- `i` is 1
- `n` is greater than 1

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be set to 3, and `n` must still be greater than 3 because the loop condition checks if `i + 1 < n` (which would be 2 < n).

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final State:**
State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, `a` is a list of characters, `b` is a list of characters**
