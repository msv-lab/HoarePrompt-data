Output State: **`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive. The conditions for `n`, the strings, and the constraints remain unchanged.**

This means that the variable `t` now holds the integer value entered by the user, constrained to be between 1 and 10^4 inclusive. All other conditions and variables from the initial state remain unchanged.
