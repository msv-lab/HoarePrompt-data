The function accepts parameters `n` (number of vertices), `k` (number of edges to be removed), and `edges` (list of tuples representing edges). It constructs an adjacency list representation of the graph, then performs a binary search to find a specific value `r`. Finally, it prints the value of `r`, which is the last calculated mid - 1 when the loop terminates.
