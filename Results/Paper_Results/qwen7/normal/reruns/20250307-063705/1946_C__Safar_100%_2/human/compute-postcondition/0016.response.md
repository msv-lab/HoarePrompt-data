Output State: **`stack` is a list containing three elements: [(1, 1), (node, x), (node, x)]; `x` is 1; `p` is 1; `A` is an integer; `g` is a dictionary representing the tree where keys are vertex indices and values are lists of adjacent vertices; `k` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq k < n - 1\); `n` is the number of vertices in the tree; `visited` is a set containing 1; `d` is a dictionary with key (1) and value 1; `r` is 0; `g[1]` contains at least one element; the current node is not equal to `p`; and `node` is the next adjacent vertex of `x` in `g[x]`.**

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(node, x)` to the `stack` list. Initially, `stack` contains the tuple `(1, 1)` and `(node, x)`. After executing the code, `stack` now contains three elements: `(1, 1)`, `(node, x)`, and `(node, x)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
