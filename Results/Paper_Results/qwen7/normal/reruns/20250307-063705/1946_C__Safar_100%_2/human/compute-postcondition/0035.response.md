Output State: **c is 0, l is either 1 or the last calculated mid + 1, r is either 1 or the last calculated mid - 1, mid is the final calculated mid value, and the loop has terminated based on the condition l > r.**

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, the variable `c` remains 0 because it was not modified within the loop. The variable `l` will be either the last calculated `mid + 1` if `check(mid)` returned `True` in the last iteration, or 1 if `check(mid)` returned `False` and `l` did not change from its previous value. Similarly, `r` will be either the last calculated `mid - 1` if `check(mid)` returned `False` in the last iteration, or 1 if `check(mid)` returned `True` and `r` did not change from its previous value. The variable `mid` will hold the final value of `mid` calculated before the loop condition `l > r` became true, indicating that the loop has terminated.
