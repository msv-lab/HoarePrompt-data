The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `edges`. 

- `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree.
- `k` is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed.
- `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple `(a, b)` represents an edge connecting vertices `a` and `b`.

After executing the function body, the function returns a value based on the following cases:
- Case_1: If `n` is an integer and `k` is an integer, the function returns a value indicating the result after removing `k` edges from the tree represented by `edges`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` representing the number of vertices, an integer `k` representing the number of edges to be removed, and a list of tuples `edges` representing the edges of a tree. The function then returns a value based on the operation of removing `k` edges from the tree.
