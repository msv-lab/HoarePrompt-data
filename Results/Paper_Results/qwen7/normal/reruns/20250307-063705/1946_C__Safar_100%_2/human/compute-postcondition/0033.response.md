Output State: **`stack` is now empty (was containing (1, 1)), `x` is 1, `p` is 1, `A` is an integer, `g` is a dictionary representing the tree where keys are vertex indices and values are lists of adjacent vertices, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < n - 1, `n` is the number of vertices in the tree, `visited` is a set containing the element 1 (but `x` which was 1 has been removed), `d` is a dictionary with key (1) and value either 1 or 2 depending on whether `d[x]` (which is `d[1]`) is greater than or equal to `A`, and `r` is 1 if `d[x]` is greater than or equal to `A`, otherwise `r` is 0.**

In this output state, the variable `visited` has had its element `x` (which was 1) removed. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state, except for `visited` which no longer contains `x`.
