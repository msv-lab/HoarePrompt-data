Output State: **`stack` is a list containing one tuple (1, 1), `x` is 1, `p` is 1, `A` is an integer, `g` is a dictionary representing the tree where keys are vertex indices and values are lists of adjacent vertices, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < n - 1, `n` is the number of vertices in the tree, `visited` is a set containing the element 1, `d` is a dictionary with key (1) and value 2 (since `d[p]` which is `d[1]` was initially 1 and now it is incremented by `d[x]` which is `d[1]` also 1), `r` is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `d[p]` (which is `d[1]`) has been updated to 2 by adding the value of `d[x]` (which is also 1). All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
