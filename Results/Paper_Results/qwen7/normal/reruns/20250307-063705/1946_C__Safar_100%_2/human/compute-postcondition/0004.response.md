The only variable in the loop head is the boolean condition `True`, which always evaluates to `True`. Therefore, no adjustments to the variables are necessary for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`stack` is a list containing one tuple (1, 1), A is an integer, g is a dictionary representing the tree where keys are vertex indices and values are lists of adjacent vertices, k is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < n - 1, n is the number of vertices in the tree, visited is an empty set, d is a dictionary with key (1) and value 1, r is 0**
