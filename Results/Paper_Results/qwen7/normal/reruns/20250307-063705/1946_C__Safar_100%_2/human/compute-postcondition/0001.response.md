Output State: **`stack` is a list containing one tuple (1, 1), A is an integer, g is a dictionary representing the tree where keys are vertex indices and values are lists of adjacent vertices, k is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < n - 1, n is the number of vertices in the tree, visited is an empty set.**

The code initializes an empty set named `visited`. No other changes are made to the existing variables or their values. Therefore, the values of `stack`, `A`, `g`, `k`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
