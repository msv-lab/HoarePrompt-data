Postcondition: **`stack` now contains [(1, 1), (node, 1)], `node` remains the next adjacent vertex of `x` in `g[x]`, `x` is 1, `p` is 1, `A` is an integer, `g` is a dictionary representing the tree where keys are vertex indices and values are lists of adjacent vertices, `k` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq k < n - 1\), `n` is the number of vertices in the tree, `visited` is a set containing 1, `d` is a dictionary with key (1) and value 1, `r` is 0, `g[1]` contains at least one element, and if `node` is not equal to `p`, `stack` contains an additional element (node, 1).**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the program variables after the execution of the if-else block. It indicates that regardless of whether the condition `node != p` is true or false, the final state of the stack and other variables remains consistent with the specified conditions.
