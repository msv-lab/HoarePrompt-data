Based on the initial state provided:

- `c` is 0.
- `l` is either 1 or the last calculated `mid` + 1.
- `r` is either 1 or the last calculated `mid` - 1.
- `mid` is the final calculated `mid` value.
- The loop has terminated based on the condition `l > r`.

Given that the loop has terminated with the condition `l > r`, it means that `l` is greater than `r`. Since `l` and `r` are either 1 or the last calculated `mid` + 1 or -1 respectively, the only way for `l > r` to be true is if `l` is the last calculated `mid` + 1 and `r` is the last calculated `mid` - 1. This implies that `l` and `r` are consecutive integers around the final calculated `mid` value.

Therefore, `r` must be the last calculated `mid` - 1.

Output: **r (where r is the last calculated mid - 1)**
