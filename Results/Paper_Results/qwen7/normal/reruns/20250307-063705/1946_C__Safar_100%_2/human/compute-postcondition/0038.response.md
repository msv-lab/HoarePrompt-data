The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `edges`. `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed, and `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple (a, b) represents an edge connecting vertices a and b. The function returns a result based on the number of vertices and edges provided.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` (number of vertices), `k` (number of edges to be removed), and `edges` (list of tuples representing edges). It returns a result based on these inputs.**
