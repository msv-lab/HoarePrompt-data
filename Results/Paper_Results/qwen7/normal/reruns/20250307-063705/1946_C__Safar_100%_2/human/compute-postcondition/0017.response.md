Postcondition: **`stack` is a list containing either two or three elements: [(1, 1), (node, x)]; `x` is 1; `p` is 1; `A` is an integer; `g` is a dictionary representing the tree where keys are vertex indices and values are lists of adjacent vertices; `k` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq k < n - 1\); `n` is the number of vertices in the tree; `visited` is a set containing 1; `d` is a dictionary with key (1) and value 1; `r` is 0; `g[1]` contains at least one element; the current node is not equal to `p`; and `node` is the next adjacent vertex of `x` in `g[x]`. If `node` is not equal to `p`, `stack` contains an additional element (node, x).**
