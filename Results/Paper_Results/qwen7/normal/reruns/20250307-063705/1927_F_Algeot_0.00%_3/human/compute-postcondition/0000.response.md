Output State: **`sys.recursionlimit` is set to 1000000, t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ min(⌊n⋅(n-1)/2⌋, 2⋅10^5), and the following edges are provided: u, v, and w are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v, and 1 ≤ w ≤ 10^6.**

Explanation: The code `sys.setrecursionlimit(10 ** 6)` sets the recursion limit to 1000000, which affects how deep recursion can go in the Python interpreter. However, this does not change the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `u`, `v`, and `w` which are defined in the problem statement. Therefore, the only change is to the recursion limit, and the conditions on `t`, `n`, `m`, `u`, `v`, and `w` remain the same.
