#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the number of test cases, n is an integer representing the number of mushrooms, v is a list of integers representing the magic powers of the mushrooms, and p is a list of integers representing a permutation of numbers from 1 to n.
def func_1(fillvalue):
    """Decorator to make a repr function return fillvalue for a recursive call."""
    return decorating_function
    #The program returns the decorating_function
#Overall this is what the function does:This function acts as a decorator, accepting a parameter `fillvalue`. Its purpose is to modify another function (`decorating_function`) so that when this modified function is called recursively, it returns the specified `fillvalue` instead of proceeding with the recursion. The function ultimately returns the modified `decorating_function`.
