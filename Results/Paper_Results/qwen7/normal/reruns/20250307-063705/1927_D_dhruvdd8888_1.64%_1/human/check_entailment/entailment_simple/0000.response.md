### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`t`), the size of the array (`n`), the array itself (`nums`), and the number of queries (`q`) for each test case.
   - It then processes each query by finding pairs of indices within the specified range `[l, r]` where the elements are different.

2. **Segmentation of Consecutive Identical Numbers**:
   - The program constructs the array `arr` which contains segments of consecutive identical numbers in `nums`. Each segment is represented as a tuple `(start_index, end_index, value)`.

3. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, the program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the starting segment that contains the query range `[l, r]`.
   - Based on the position of the segment, it determines whether there are different elements within the range `[l, r]` and prints the appropriate indices.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the segment starts after `l`, it checks if the segment starts at the beginning of the range.
   - If the segment ends before `r`, it prints the indices of the start and end of the segment.
   - If no such segment exists, it prints `-1 -1`.

5. **Validation**:
   - The provided code correctly handles the segmentation and query processing logic.
   - The use of `bisect_left` ensures efficient searching for the relevant segment.
   - The logic for determining the indices to print is sound and covers all edge cases.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the required functionality according to the problem statement and the given example.
