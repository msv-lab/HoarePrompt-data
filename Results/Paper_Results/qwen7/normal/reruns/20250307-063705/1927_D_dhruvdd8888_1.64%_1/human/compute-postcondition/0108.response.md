Postcondition: **`eli` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is greater than or equal to `(l, 0, 0)`, `l` is the first integer input, `r` is the second integer input, `s` is the start index of the segment in `arr` that `eli` points to, `e` is the end index of the segment in `arr` that `eli` points to, `new_l` is undefined, `r` is the second integer input, `arr` will contain segments of consecutive identical numbers from `nums`, `num` will be the last element of `nums`, `LA` is equal to `len(arr) - 1`, `ppp` remains unchanged as 23, `s` and `e` are updated to the start and end indices of the segment in `arr` that `eli` points to. If `e >= r`, `s` and `e` are updated to the start and end indices of the segment. Otherwise, if `e < r`, `s` and `e` are updated accordingly.**
