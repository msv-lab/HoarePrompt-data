Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the given problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input and Setting Up the Function:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`tc`).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array (`N`), the array itself (`nums`), and the number of queries (`q`).
   - It then processes each query.

2. **Processing the Array:**
   - The function `func_1` processes the array to identify segments where the element changes.
   - It uses a loop to iterate through the array and records the start and end of segments where the element remains the same.
   - This information is stored in the list `arr`.

3. **Handling Queries:**
   - For each query, it finds the relevant segment using binary search (`bisect_left`).
   - It checks if the segment starts after the query range or ends before the query range.
   - Depending on these conditions, it either prints a pair of indices indicating different elements or `-1 -1` if no such pair exists.

### Detailed Verification

1. **Segment Identification:**
   - The logic for identifying segments where the element changes is correct. It correctly captures the boundaries of segments where the element remains the same.

2. **Query Processing:**
   - The use of `bisect_left` to find the relevant segment is appropriate.
   - The conditions to check if the segment starts after the query range or ends before the query range are handled correctly.
   - The logic to print `-1 -1` when no such pair exists is also correct.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases like the first segment starting at index 0 and the last segment ending at the last index of the array.
   - It correctly handles cases where the segment starts exactly at the query range start or ends exactly at the query range end.

4. **Output Format:**
   - The output format matches the requirements specified in the problem statement.

### Conclusion

After reviewing the code, it appears that the program correctly implements the solution for the given problem. It identifies segments where the element changes and processes each query to find a pair of different elements within the query range or reports that no such pair exists.
