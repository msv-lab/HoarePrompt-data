Based on the initial state provided:

- `eli` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is greater than or equal to `(l, 0, 0)`.
- `l` is the first integer input.
- `r` is the second integer input.
- `s` is updated to the start index of the segment in `arr` that `eli` points to.
- `e` is updated to the end index of the segment in `arr` that `eli` points to.
- `new_l` is the next integer input.
- `r` is the second integer input again (redundant).
- `arr` contains segments of consecutive identical numbers from `nums`.
- `num` will be the last element of `nums`.
- `LA` is equal to `len(arr) - 1`.
- `ppp` remains unchanged as 23.
- If `s > new_l`, then `s` is either 1 or not 1; otherwise, `e` is either greater than or equal to `r` or less than `N`.

The `print(-1, -1)` statement simply prints the literal values `-1` and `-1`.

Output: **-1, -1**
