Output State: **`eli` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is greater than or equal to `(l, 0, 0)`, `l` is the first integer input, `r` is the second integer input, `s` is the start index of the segment in `arr` that `eli` points to, `e` is the end index of the segment in `arr` that `eli` points to, `new_l` is undefined, `r` is the second integer input, `arr` will contain segments of consecutive identical numbers from `nums`, `num` will be the last element of `nums`, `LA` is equal to `len(arr) - 1`, `ppp` remains unchanged as 23, and if `s > new_l`, then `s` is either 1 or not 1, otherwise `e` is either greater than or equal to `r` or less than `N`. Since the condition `ppp == 23` is always true, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition. We continue the loop or block we were in.**

This means that the `continue` statement does not change any variable values but continues the loop or block of code that was being executed. All the conditions and values of the variables remain the same as they were before the `continue` statement.
