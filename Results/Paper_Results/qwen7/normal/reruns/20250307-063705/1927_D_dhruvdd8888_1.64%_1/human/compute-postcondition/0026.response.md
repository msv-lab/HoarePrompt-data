Output State: **`num` is equal to `nums[i]`, the array `arr` contains an additional element `(1 + (i + 1), i + 1, nums[i + 1])`, and `arr` also contains the new element `(2 + i, i, num)` if `nums[i] != num`. If `nums[i] == num`, the array `arr` remains unchanged with the elements `(1 + (i + 1), i + 1, nums[i + 1])` and no new element added.**

Explanation: The code `num = nums[i]` simply assigns the value of `nums[i]` to the variable `num`. This does not affect the value of `nums[i + 1]` or the structure of the array `arr`. The precondition that `num` is equal to `nums[i + 1]` remains unchanged unless `nums[i]` is not equal to `num`, in which case the array `arr` will get an additional element `(2 + i, i, num)`. However, since the assignment `num = nums[i]` is made, the updated condition for the array `arr` is reflected in the output state.
