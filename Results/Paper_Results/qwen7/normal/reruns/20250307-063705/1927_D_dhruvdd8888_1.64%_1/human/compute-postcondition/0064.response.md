Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Description:**
   - `s` is the start index of the segment in `arr` that `eli` points to.
   - `e` is the end index of the segment in `arr` that `eli` points to.
   - `_` is discarded (not relevant for the print statement).
   - `eli` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is greater than or equal to `(l, 0, 0)`.
   - `l` is the first integer input.
   - `r` is the second integer input.
   - `arr` contains segments of consecutive identical numbers from `nums`.
   - `num` will be the last element of `nums`.
   - `s` and `e` are updated to the start and end indices of the segment in `arr` that `eli` points to.
   - `LA` is equal to `len(arr) - 1`.
   - `ppp` remains unchanged as 23.
   - If `tc` is less than or equal to 5, the conditions remain the same as the precondition.
   - `e` is less than `N`.

2. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   - The print statement is `print(s, e + 1)`.
   - This means it will print the value of `s` followed by `e + 1`.

Given the above, we need to determine the values of `s` and `e`:

- `s` is the start index of the segment in `arr` that `eli` points to.
- `e` is the end index of the segment in `arr` that `eli` points to.

Since these values are explicitly defined in the initial state, we can directly use them in the print statement.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **s, e + 1**
