Based on the initial state provided:

- `eli` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is greater than or equal to `(l, 0, 0)`.
- `l` is the first integer input.
- `r` is the second integer input.
- `s` is updated to the start index of the segment in `arr` that `eli` points to.
- `e` is updated to the end index of the segment in `arr` that `eli` points to.
- `new_l` is the next integer input.
- `r` is the second integer input (same as the original `r`).
- `arr` contains segments of consecutive identical numbers from `nums`.
- `num` will be the last element of `nums`.
- `LA` is equal to `len(arr) - 1`.
- `ppp` remains unchanged as 23.
- If `s > new_l`, then `s` is either 1 or not 1, otherwise `e` is either greater than or equal to `r` or less than `N`.

We need to determine the values of `s` and `s - 1` when the print statement `print(s - 1, s)` is executed.

From the conditions:
- `s` is the start index of the segment in `arr` that `eli` points to.
- If `s > new_l`, then `s` is either 1 or not 1.
- Otherwise, `e` is either greater than or equal to `r` or less than `N`.

However, the exact value of `s` is not explicitly given, but it is clear that `s` is an index in `arr`. Given the conditions, we cannot definitively determine the exact value of `s` without more specific information about `new_l` and the structure of `arr`.

Therefore, the most precise description we can provide is based on the conditions given:

Output: **s - 1, s (where s is the start index of the segment in arr that eli points to)**
