Postcondition: `num` is equal to `nums[i + 1]`, the array `arr` contains an additional element `(1 + (i + 1), i + 1, nums[i + 1])`. If `nums[i]` is not equal to `num`, then `s` is equal to `i`, and `num` is equal to `nums[i + 1]`, with the array `arr` containing an additional element `(1 + s, i, num)`.
