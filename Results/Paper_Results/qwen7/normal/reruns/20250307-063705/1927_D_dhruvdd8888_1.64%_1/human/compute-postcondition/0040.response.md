Output: **l, r (where l is the first integer input and r is the second integer input)**

Explanation:
- `l` is the first integer input.
- `r` is the second integer input.
The `print(l, r)` statement will simply print these two values as they are directly assigned from the inputs. No other variables or calculations are involved in determining their values for this specific print statement.
