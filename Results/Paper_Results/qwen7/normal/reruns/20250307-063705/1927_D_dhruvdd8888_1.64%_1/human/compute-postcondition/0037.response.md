Postcondition: `l` is the first integer input, `r` is the second integer input, `arr` will contain segments of consecutive identical numbers from `nums`, `num` will be the last element of `nums`, `s` and `e` will both be `N + 1`, `LA` is equal to `len(arr) - 1`, and `ppp` remains unchanged as 23, and `tc` is greater than 5.
