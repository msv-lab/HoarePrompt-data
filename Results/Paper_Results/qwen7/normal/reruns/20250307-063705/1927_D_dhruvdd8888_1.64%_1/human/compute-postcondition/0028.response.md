Output State: The array `arr` will contain pairs of indices and values from the list `nums` where each pair represents a segment of consecutive identical numbers in `nums`. Specifically, each pair in `arr` will have the form `(start_index, end_index, value)`, indicating that the value `value` starts at index `start_index` and ends at index `end_index - 1`. The variable `num` will be equal to the last element of `nums` after the loop completes. The variable `s` will be equal to `N`, and `e` will be equal to `N + 1` since the loop iterates from `0` to `N`, and `s` is updated to `i` at each iteration where `nums[i]` changes. The variable `i` will be equal to `N` after the loop completes.

In summary, `arr` will contain segments of consecutive identical numbers from `nums`, `num` will be the last element of `nums`, and `s` and `e` will both be `N + 1`.
