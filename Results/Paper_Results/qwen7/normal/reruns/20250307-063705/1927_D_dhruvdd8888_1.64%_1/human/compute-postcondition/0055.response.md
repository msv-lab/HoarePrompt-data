Based on the initial state provided:

- `eli` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is greater than or equal to `(l, 0, 0)`.
- `s` and `e` are updated to the start and end indices of the segment in `arr` that `eli` points to.
- `l` is the first integer input.
- `r` is the second integer input.
- `arr` contains segments of consecutive identical numbers from `nums`.
- `num` will be the last element of `nums`.
- `LA` is equal to `len(arr) - 1`.
- `ppp` remains unchanged as 23.
- If `tc` is greater than 5, the conditions remain the same as the precondition.
- The current value of `s` is not equal to 1.

Given the print statement:
```python
print(s - 1, s)
```

Since the current value of `s` is not equal to 1, `s - 1` will be a valid index in the array. The print statement will output the value of `s - 1` followed by the value of `s`.

Output: **s - 1, s**
