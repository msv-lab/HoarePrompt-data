Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `num` is equal to `nums[i]`
- The array `arr` contains an additional element `(1 + (i + 1), i + 1, nums[i + 1])`

### Loop Head
```
for i in range(N + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Loop Variable `i`:**
   - The loop starts from `0` and goes up to `N`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1.

2. **Array `arr`:**
   - The array `arr` gets an additional element at each iteration.
   - The new element added is `(1 + (i + 1), i + 1, nums[i + 1])`.

### Adjusting States
- **Variable `i`:**
  - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 at each iteration, if the previous `i` was `k`, then the new `i` will be `k + 1`.
  - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.

- **Array `arr`:**
  - At each iteration, the array `arr` gets an additional element.
  - The new element added is based on the current value of `i`.

### Updated State
- **`num`:**
  - `num` is still equal to `nums[i]`, but since `i` is incremented, `num` will now be `nums[i + 1]`.

- **Array `arr`:**
  - The array `arr` will have an additional element added at the position `(1 + (i + 1), i + 1, nums[i + 1])`.

### Final State
- `num` is equal to `nums[i + 1]`
- The array `arr` contains an additional element `(1 + (i + 1), i + 1, nums[i + 1])`

### Conclusion
State: **`num` is equal to `nums[i + 1]`, the array `arr` contains an additional element `(1 + (i + 1), i + 1, nums[i + 1])`**
