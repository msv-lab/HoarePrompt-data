Output State: The variable `num` will be equal to `nums[N]`, as the loop iterates through all indices of the `nums` list, updating `num` to the current element in each iteration. The array `arr` will contain pairs of tuples, where each tuple represents the start index (`1 + s` or `2 + i`), the current index `i`, and the value of `num` at that index. Specifically, `arr` will include all transitions where `nums[i]` changes, starting from the beginning of the list up to the last element `nums[N]`.

Each tuple in `arr` will follow the pattern `(start_index, current_index, num_value)`, capturing the moment when `num` changes or remains the same across consecutive elements in the `nums` list.
