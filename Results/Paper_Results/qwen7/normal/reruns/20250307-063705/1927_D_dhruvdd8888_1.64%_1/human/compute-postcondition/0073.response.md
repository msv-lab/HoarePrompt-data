Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `_` (which is used as a placeholder for the loop counter), and the input statement `int(input())`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as the input value is an integer. There is no explicit condition given in the loop itself, but the loop will terminate when the input is no longer an integer.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `s` is the start index of the segment in `arr` that `eli` points to.
   - `e` is the end index of the segment in `arr` that `eli` points to.
   - `_` is discarded.
   - `eli` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is greater than or equal to `(l, 0, 0)`.
   - `l` is the first integer input.
   - `r` is the second integer input.
   - `arr` will contain segments of consecutive identical numbers from `nums`.
   - `num` will be the last element of `nums`.
   - `s` and `e` are updated to the start and end indices of the segment in `arr` that `eli` points to.
   - `LA` is equal to `len(arr) - 1`.
   - `ppp` remains unchanged as 23.
   - If `s > l`, then `s` is either 1 or not 1, otherwise `e` is either greater than or equal to `r` or less than `N`.

4. **Adjusting the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues based on user input, the key variables that need to be adjusted are `l` and `r`, which are the inputs provided by the user.
   - The other variables (`s`, `e`, `eli`, `arr`, `num`, `LA`, `ppp`) will be updated within the loop body and do not need to be explicitly adjusted here.

5. **Formulate the New State**:
   - After each iteration, the values of `l` and `r` will change based on the user input.
   - Therefore, the new state should reflect the updated values of `l` and `r`.

Given the above reasoning, the new state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`s` is the start index of the segment in `arr` that `eli` points to, `e` is the end index of the segment in `arr` that `eli` points to, `_` is discarded, `eli` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is greater than or equal to `(new_l, 0, 0)`, `new_l` is the next integer input, `r` is the second integer input, `arr` will contain segments of consecutive identical numbers from `nums`, `num` will be the last element of `nums`, `s` and `e` are updated to the start and end indices of the segment in `arr` that `eli` points to, `LA` is equal to `len(arr) - 1`, `ppp` remains unchanged as 23, and if `s > new_l`, then `s` is either 1 or not 1, otherwise `e` is either greater than or equal to `r` or less than `N`**.
