Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Postcondition: `arr` will contain segments of consecutive identical numbers from `nums`, `num` will be the last element of `nums`, and `s` and `e` will both be `N + 1`; `LA` is equal to `len(arr) - 1`. The value of `ppp` remains unchanged as 23.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    l, r = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    if tc > 5:
        if ppp == 23:
            print(l, r)
        continue
    eli = bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))
    s, e, _ = arr[min(eli, LA)]
    if s > l:
        if s == 1:
            print(-1, -1)
        else:
            print(s - 1, s)
    elif e >= r:
        print(-1, -1)
    elif e < N:
        print(s, e + 1)
    else:
        print(-1, -1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `s` is the start index of the segment in `arr` that `eli` points to, `e` is the end index of the segment in `arr` that `eli` points to, `_` is discarded, `eli` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is greater than or equal to `(l, 0, 0)`, `l` is the first integer input, `r` is the second integer input, `arr` will contain segments of consecutive identical numbers from `nums`, `num` will be the last element of `nums`, `s` and `e` are updated to the start and end indices of the segment in `arr` that `eli` points to, `LA` is equal to `len(arr) - 1`, `ppp` remains unchanged as 23, and if `s > l`, then `s` is either 1 or not 1, otherwise `e` is either greater than or equal to `r` or less than `N`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `eli` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is greater than or equal to `(l, 0, 0)`, `l` is the first integer input, `r` is the second integer input, `s` is updated to the start index of the segment in `arr` that `eli` points to, `e` is updated to the end index of the segment in `arr` that `eli` points to, `new_l` is the next integer input, `r` is the second integer input, `arr` will contain segments of consecutive identical numbers from `nums`, `num` will be the last element of `nums`, `LA` is equal to `len(arr) - 1`, `ppp` remains unchanged as 23, and if `s > new_l`, then `s` is either 1 or not 1, otherwise `e` is either greater than or equal to `r` or less than `N`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `eli` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is greater than or equal to `(l, 0, 0)`, `l` is the first integer input, `r` is the second integer input, `s` and `e` are updated to the start and end indices of the segment in `arr` that `eli` points to. If `s > l`, `s` and `e` are updated to the start and end indices of the segment. Otherwise, if `e >= r`, `s` and `e` are updated to the start and end indices of the segment. Otherwise, if `e < r`, `s` and `e` are updated accordingly.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
