Output State: **`num` is equal to `nums[i + 1]`, the array `arr` contains an additional element `(1 + (i + 1), i + 1, nums[i + 1])`, and `arr` also contains the new element `(2 + i, i, num)`**.

Explanation: The code appends a new tuple to the array `arr`. The tuple is created using the values `1 + s`, `i`, and `num`. Given that `s` is equal to `i + 1` from the initial state, `1 + s` becomes `2 + i`. The value of `num` is equal to `nums[i + 1]`. Therefore, the new element added to `arr` is `(2 + i, i, num)`.
