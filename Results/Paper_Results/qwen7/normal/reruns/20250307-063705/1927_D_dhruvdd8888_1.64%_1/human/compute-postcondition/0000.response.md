Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6; `q` is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5; each query is represented by two integers l and r such that 1 <= l < r <= n; `input` is set to `sys.stdin.readline`**.

The code `input = sys.stdin.readline` simply assigns the function `sys.stdin.readline` to the variable `input`. This does not change the values of any existing variables but updates the `input` variable to refer to the `sys.stdin.readline` function. All other variables remain in their initial states.
