### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary to verify its correctness based on the problem description.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- Given an array \( a \) of \( n \) integers and \( q \) queries.
- Each query is defined by two integers \( l \) and \( r \).
- The task is to find two indices \( i \) and \( j \) within the range \( [l, r] \) such that \( a_i \neq a_j \), or determine that no such pair exists.

#### Function Summary Recap:
- The function `func_1()` processes the array `nums` and identifies segments of consecutive identical numbers.
- It stores these segments in `arr`.
- For each query, it determines the segment in `arr` that corresponds to the range `[l, r)` and outputs specific values based on the segment's start and end indices.
- If the queried segment is not fully contained within any identified segment, it returns `-1 -1`.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Segment Identification**:
   - The program correctly identifies segments of consecutive identical numbers and stores them in `arr`.
   - This ensures that each segment in `arr` represents a range where all elements are the same.

2. **Query Handling**:
   - For each query, the program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the relevant segment in `arr` that corresponds to the range `[l, r)`.
   - Based on the segment's start and end indices, the program determines whether there are different elements within the queried range.
   - If the segment's start index is greater than `l`, it suggests that the queried range starts within a segment of identical numbers, and the program returns the appropriate indices.
   - If the segment's end index is less than `r`, it suggests that the queried range ends within a segment of identical numbers, and the program returns the appropriate indices.
   - If neither condition is met, the program returns `-1 -1`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where the queried range is completely within a segment of identical numbers.
   - It correctly outputs `-1 -1` in such cases, as required by the problem description.

#### Example Verification:
Consider the example provided in the problem description:
```
5
1 1 1 1 1
1
1 5
```
- The program correctly identifies that all elements in the array are the same.
- For the query `1 5`, the program returns `-1 -1` because there are no different elements within the range `[1, 5)`.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all edge cases appropriately.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
