Output State: **`nums[i]` is not equal to `num`; `arr` contains an additional element `(1 + s, i, num)'; `s` is equal to `i`.**

Explanation: The variable `s` is assigned the value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state. Therefore, `nums[i]` is not equal to `num`, `arr` contains an additional element `(1 + s, i, num)`, and `s` is now equal to `i`.
