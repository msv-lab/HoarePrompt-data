Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where all elements in the queried subarray are the same. For instance, consider the following input:

```
5
1 1 1 1 1
1
1 5
```

The program will output `-1 -1` because it does not handle the scenario where all elements in the queried subarray are identical. However, according to the problem description, we should find a pair of different elements or output `-1 -1` if no such pair exists. Since the program fails to provide a valid pair when all elements are the same, it does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description.
