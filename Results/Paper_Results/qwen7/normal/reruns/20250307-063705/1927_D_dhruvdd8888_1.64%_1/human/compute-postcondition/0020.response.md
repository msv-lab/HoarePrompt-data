Output State: **`num` is equal to `nums[i]`, the array `arr` contains an additional element `(1 + (i + 1), i + 1, nums[i + 1])`.**

Explanation: The code `num = nums[i]` assigns the value of `nums[i]` to `num`. This means that `num` is now equal to `nums[i]`. The other conditions and the array `arr` addition remain unchanged from the initial state.
