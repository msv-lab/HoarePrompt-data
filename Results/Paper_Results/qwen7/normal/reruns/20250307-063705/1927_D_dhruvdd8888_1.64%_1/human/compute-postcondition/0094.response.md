Based on the initial state provided:

- `l` is the first integer input.
- `r` is the second integer input.
- `s` is the start index of the segment in `arr` that `eli` points to.
- `e` is the end index of the segment in `arr` that `eli` points to.
- `new_l` is undefined.
- `r` is the second integer input.
- `arr` contains segments of consecutive identical numbers from `nums`.
- `num` will be the last element of `nums`.
- `LA` is equal to `len(arr) - 1`.
- `ppp` remains unchanged as 23.
- If `s > new_l`, then `s` is either 1 or not 1, otherwise `e` is either greater than or equal to `r` or less than `N`.

The `print(l, r)` statement will print the values of `l` and `r`.

Output: **l, r**
