Output State: **`nums[i]` is not equal to `num`; `arr` contains an additional element `(1 + s, i, num)`**.

Explanation: The code appends a tuple to the list `arr`. The tuple consists of three elements: `1 + s`, `i`, and `num`. The value of `nums[i]` remains unchanged and is still not equal to `num`. The list `arr` now includes this new tuple.
