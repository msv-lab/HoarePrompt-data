### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies the key steps and logic of the program. Let's break down the reasoning to ensure the correctness of the program:

1. **Segment Identification:**
   - The program correctly identifies segments of consecutive identical numbers in the array `nums`. This is done by iterating through the array and recording the start and end indices of each segment where the element remains the same. This is stored in the list `arr`.

2. **Handling Queries:**
   - For each query, the program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the relevant segment in `arr` that corresponds to the query range `[l, r)`.
   - The program then checks if the segment starts after the query range or ends before the query range.
   - Based on these conditions, it either prints a pair of indices indicating different elements or `-1 -1` if no such pair exists.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles edge cases:
     - If the segment starts exactly at the query range start (`s > l`).
     - If the segment ends exactly at the query range end (`e >= r`).
     - If the segment extends beyond the query range (`e < N`).

4. **Output Format:**
   - The output format matches the requirements specified in the problem statement.

Given the detailed analysis, the program correctly implements the solution for the given problem. The original assessment accurately describes the logic and handling of the program.
