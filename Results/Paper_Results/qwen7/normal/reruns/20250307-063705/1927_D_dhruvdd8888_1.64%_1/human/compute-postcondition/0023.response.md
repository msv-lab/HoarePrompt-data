Output State: **`s` is equal to `i`, `num` is equal to `nums[i + 1]`, the array `arr` contains an additional element `(1 + (i + 1), i + 1, nums[i + 1])`, and `arr` also contains the new element `(2 + i, i, num)`**.

This means that the variable `s` is now assigned the value of `i`, while the values of `num` and `arr` remain unchanged from their initial states. The array `arr` still contains the elements it had before, plus the two new elements specified in the code.
