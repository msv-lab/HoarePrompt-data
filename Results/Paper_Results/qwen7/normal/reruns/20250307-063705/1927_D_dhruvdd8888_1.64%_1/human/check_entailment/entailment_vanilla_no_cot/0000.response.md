Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Queries**: The function `func_1` is designed to handle one test case at a time but does not properly handle multiple test cases. It uses a global variable `ppp` to check for specific test cases, which is not a standard way to handle multiple test cases in competitive programming.

2. **Array Construction Logic**: The logic to construct the `arr` array is flawed. It only considers changes in the value of `num` and does not correctly capture the range of indices where the same value occurs. This means that for some queries, it might incorrectly identify pairs of indices.

3. **Binary Search Usage**: The binary search (`bisect_left`) is used to find the relevant segment in `arr`, but the logic to extract the correct indices from this segment is not robust. Specifically, the conditions to determine the correct indices `s` and `e` are not fully implemented and can lead to incorrect results.

4. **Edge Cases Not Handled Properly**: The code does not handle edge cases well, such as when the query range is very small or when the same value spans the entire range.

To fix these issues, the solution should be revised to properly handle multiple test cases, correctly construct the segments, and use binary search effectively to find the required indices. Here's a more robust approach:

```python
from collections import defaultdict
from bisect import bisect_left

def solve():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
        queries = int(input())
        query_ranges = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(queries)]

        # Construct the segments
        segment_start = defaultdict(list)
        last_seen = {}
        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            if num not in last_seen:
                last_seen[num] = i
            segment_start[num].append(i)

        # Process each query
        for l, r in query_ranges:
            l -= 1
            r -= 1
            min_val = float('inf')
            max_val = float('-inf')
            for num in set(nums[l:r+1]):
                start = bisect_left(segment_start[num], l)
                end = bisect_left(segment_start[num], r+1)
                if start < end:
                    min_val = min(min_val, segment_start[num][start])
                    max_val = max(max_val, segment_start[num][end-1])
            if min_val == float('inf') or max_val == float('-inf'):
                print(-1, -1)
            else:
                print(min_val + 1, max_val + 1)

solve()
```

This revised solution constructs the segments correctly and uses binary search to efficiently find the required indices for each query.
