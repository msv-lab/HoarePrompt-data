Output State: **`s` is equal to `i`, `num` is equal to `nums[i + 1]`, the array `arr` contains an additional element `(1 + s, i, num)`**.

Explanation: The variable `s` is assigned the value of `i`. The values of `num` and the array `arr` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `num` is still equal to `nums[i + 1]`, and the array `arr` still contains the additional element `(1 + s, i, num)`.
