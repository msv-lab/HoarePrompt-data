### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step using the annotated code and the problem description.

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`tc`).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array (`N`), the array itself (`nums`), and the number of queries (`q`).
   - It then processes each query by finding a pair of indices `(i, j)` such that `a_i â‰  a_j` within the specified range `[l, r]`.

2. **Segmentation of Identical Elements:**
   - The program constructs an array `arr` that contains segments of consecutive identical elements in `nums`.
   - Each segment in `arr` is represented as a tuple `(start_index, end_index, value)`.
   - This segmentation helps in efficiently finding the required pair of indices for each query.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the first segment in `arr` that starts at or after the query range `[l, r]`.
   - Based on the position of this segment, the program determines the appropriate indices `(i, j)`:
     - If the start of the segment is greater than `l`, it prints `-1 -1` because there are no different elements in the queried range.
     - If the end of the segment is less than `r`, it prints the indices of the start and end of the segment.
     - If the end of the segment is exactly `N`, it checks if the segment covers the entire range `[l, r]` and prints `-1 -1` if it does.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where all elements in the queried subarray are the same by checking if the start of the segment is greater than `l` and if the end of the segment is less than `r`.
   - If the start of the segment is `1`, it prints `-1 -1` because there are no valid indices before the start of the segment.

Given the annotated code and the problem description, the program correctly handles the case where all elements in the queried subarray are the same. Here's why:

- When the start of the segment is greater than `l`, the program prints `-1 -1` because there are no different elements in the queried range.
- When the end of the segment is less than `r`, the program prints the indices of the start and end of the segment.
- When the end of the segment is exactly `N`, the program checks if the segment covers the entire range `[l, r]` and prints `-1 -1` if it does.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description and correctly handles all cases, including the edge case where all elements in the queried subarray are the same.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct according to the problem description and the provided test cases.
