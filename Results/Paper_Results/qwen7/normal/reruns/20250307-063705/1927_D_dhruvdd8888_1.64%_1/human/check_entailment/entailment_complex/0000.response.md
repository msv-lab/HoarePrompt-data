Reasoning:
1. The program correctly identifies segments of consecutive identical numbers in the array `nums` and stores them in the list `arr`.
2. For each query defined by `l` and `r`, the program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the appropriate segment in `arr` that corresponds to the range `[l, r)`.
3. The program then checks the start and end indices of the found segment to determine the output based on the specified conditions.
4. The logic within the loop correctly handles the cases where the queried segment is not fully contained within any identified segment, returning `-1 -1` in such cases.
5. The program does not modify the original list `nums` and only uses additional variables (`arr`, `ppp`, `tc`) for conditional checks without altering their values.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the required functionality as per the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
