Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6; `q` is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5; each query is represented by two integers l and r such that 1 <= l < r <= n; `N` is an integer obtained from `int(input())`.**

In this output state, the variable `N` is assigned the value obtained from the `int(input())` function, which reads an integer from the standard input. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
