Output State: **`num` is equal to `nums[i + 1]`, the array `arr` contains an additional element `(1 + s, i, num)`.**

Explanation: The code appends a new tuple to the array `arr`. The tuple consists of three elements: `1 + s`, `i`, and `num`. Given the initial state where `num` is equal to `nums[i + 1]`, the new element added to `arr` is `(1 + s, i, num)`. The values of `s`, `i`, and `num` remain unchanged from their initial state.
