You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6; q is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5; each query is represented by two integers l and r such that 1 <= l < r <= n.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    N = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = 0
    e = 0
    num = nums[0]
    arr = []
    nums.append(-1)
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if nums[i] != num:
            arr.append((1 + s, i, num))
            s = i
        
        num = nums[i]
        
    #State: Output State: The array `arr` will contain pairs of indices and values from the list `nums` where each pair represents a segment of consecutive identical numbers in `nums`. Specifically, each pair in `arr` will have the form `(start_index, end_index, value)`, indicating that the value `value` starts at index `start_index` and ends at index `end_index - 1`. The variable `num` will be equal to the last element of `nums` after the loop completes. The variable `s` will be equal to `N`, and `e` will be equal to `N + 1` since the loop iterates from `0` to `N`, and `s` is updated to `i` at each iteration where `nums[i]` changes. The variable `i` will be equal to `N` after the loop completes.
    #
    #In summary, `arr` will contain segments of consecutive identical numbers from `nums`, `num` will be the last element of `nums`, and `s` and `e` will both be `N + 1`.
    LA = len(arr) - 1
    if (ppp == 23) :
        print(nums)
        #This is printed: [num, ...] where num is the last element of nums and the rest of the elements form segments of consecutive identical numbers
    #State: Postcondition: `arr` will contain segments of consecutive identical numbers from `nums`, `num` will be the last element of `nums`, and `s` and `e` will both be `N + 1`; `LA` is equal to `len(arr) - 1`. The value of `ppp` remains unchanged as 23.
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        l, r = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if tc > 5:
            if ppp == 23:
                print(l, r)
            continue
        
        eli = bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))
        
        s, e, _ = arr[min(eli, LA)]
        
        if s > l:
            if s == 1:
                print(-1, -1)
            else:
                print(s - 1, s)
        elif e >= r:
            print(-1, -1)
        elif e < N:
            print(s, e + 1)
        else:
            print(-1, -1)
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `eli` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is greater than or equal to `(l, 0, 0)`, `l` is the first integer input, `r` is the second integer input, `s` and `e` are updated to the start and end indices of the segment in `arr` that `eli` points to. If `s > l`, `s` and `e` are updated to the start and end indices of the segment. Otherwise, if `e >= r`, `s` and `e` are updated to the start and end indices of the segment. Otherwise, if `e < r`, `s` and `e` are updated accordingly. The value of `ppp` remains unchanged as 23, and `LA` is equal to `len(arr) - 1`.
    #
    #This final state reflects the outcome after processing all inputs within the loop, where `s` and `e` are correctly set based on the conditions provided in the loop body, and no further changes are made to the variables outside the loop's scope.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts four parameters: t (an integer between 1 and 10^4), n (an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5), a (a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^6), and q (an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5). For each query represented by two integers l and r (where 1 <= l < r <= n), the function processes the sublist of a from index l to r and returns a specific value or result based on the queries.

The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
