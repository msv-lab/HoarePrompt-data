Postcondition: **`l` is the first integer input, `r` is the second integer input, `s` is the start index of the segment in `arr` that `eli` points to, `e` is the end index of the segment in `arr` that `eli` points to, `eli` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is greater than or equal to `(new_l, 0, 0)`, `new_l` is the next integer input, `r` is the second integer input, `arr` will contain segments of consecutive identical numbers from `nums`, `num` will be the last element of `nums`, `s` and `e` are updated to the start and end indices of the segment in `arr` that `eli` points to, `LA` is equal to `len(arr) - 1`, `ppp` remains unchanged as 23, and if `s > new_l`, then `s` is either 1 or not 1, otherwise `e` is either greater than or equal to `r` or less than `N`. We continue the loop or process.**
