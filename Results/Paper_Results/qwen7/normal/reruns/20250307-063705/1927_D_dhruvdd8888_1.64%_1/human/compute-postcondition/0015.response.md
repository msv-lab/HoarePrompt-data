Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in the given code is `i`, and it ranges from `0` to `N`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `num` is equal to `nums[i]`.
   - The array `arr` contains an additional element `(1 + i, i, nums[i])`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `N + 1`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value `k` (where `0 <= k < N`).
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will now be `k + 1`.
   - Since `arr` contains an additional element `(1 + i, i, nums[i])` at each iteration, after the previous iteration, `arr` should contain the element `(1 + (k + 1), k + 1, nums[k + 1])`.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `num` will now be equal to `nums[k + 1]` (since `i` is incremented by 1).
   - The array `arr` will contain the element `(1 + (k + 1), k + 1, nums[k + 1])` in addition to its previous contents.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
- `num` is equal to `nums[i + 1]`.
- The array `arr` contains an additional element `(1 + (i + 1), i + 1, nums[i + 1])`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`num` is equal to `nums[i + 1]`, the array `arr` contains an additional element `(1 + (i + 1), i + 1, nums[i + 1])`**.
