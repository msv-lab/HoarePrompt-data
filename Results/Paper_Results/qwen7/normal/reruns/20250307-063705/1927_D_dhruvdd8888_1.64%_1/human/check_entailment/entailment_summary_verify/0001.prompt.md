You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of n integers, and q queries.

Each query is represented by two integers l and r (1 \le l \le r \le n ). Your
task is to find, for each query, two indices i and j (or determine that they
do not exist) such that:

  * l \le i \le r ; 
  * l \le j \le r ; 
  * a_i \ne a_j . 

In other words, for each query, you need to find a pair of different elements
among a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r , or report that such a pair does not exist.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of the array a .

The third line of each test case contains a single integer q (1 \le q \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of queries.

The next q lines contain two integers each, l and r (1 \le l < r \le n ) — the
boundaries of the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of the
values of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each query, output two integers separated by space: i and j (l \le i, j
\le r ), for which a_i \ne a_j . If such a pair does not exist, output i=-1
and j=-1 .

You may separate the outputs for the test cases with empty lines. This is not
a mandatory requirement.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes a list of integers `nums` and handles a series of queries. It first identifies segments of consecutive identical numbers in `nums` and stores them in `arr`. For each query defined by `l` and `r`, it determines the segment in `arr` that corresponds to the range `[l, r)` and outputs specific values based on the segment's start and end indices. If the queried segment is not fully contained within any identified segment, it returns `-1 -1`. The function does not modify the original list `nums` and relies on the variables `ppp` and `tc` for conditional checks but does not change their values.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the given problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input and Setting Up the Function:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`tc`).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array (`N`), the array itself (`nums`), and the number of queries (`q`).
   - It then processes each query.

2. **Processing the Array:**
   - The function `func_1` processes the array to identify segments where the element changes.
   - It uses a loop to iterate through the array and records the start and end of segments where the element remains the same.
   - This information is stored in the list `arr`.

3. **Handling Queries:**
   - For each query, it finds the relevant segment using binary search (`bisect_left`).
   - It checks if the segment starts after the query range or ends before the query range.
   - Depending on these conditions, it either prints a pair of indices indicating different elements or `-1 -1` if no such pair exists.

### Detailed Verification

1. **Segment Identification:**
   - The logic for identifying segments where the element changes is correct. It correctly captures the boundaries of segments where the element remains the same.

2. **Query Processing:**
   - The use of `bisect_left` to find the relevant segment is appropriate.
   - The conditions to check if the segment starts after the query range or ends before the query range are handled correctly.
   - The logic to print `-1 -1` when no such pair exists is also correct.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases like the first segment starting at index 0 and the last segment ending at the last index of the array.
   - It correctly handles cases where the segment starts exactly at the query range start or ends exactly at the query range end.

4. **Output Format:**
   - The output format matches the requirements specified in the problem statement.

### Conclusion

After reviewing the code, it appears that the program correctly implements the solution for the given problem. It identifies segments where the element changes and processes each query to find a pair of different elements within the query range or reports that no such pair exists.
