Postcondition: **`eli` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is greater than or equal to `(l, 0, 0)`, `l` is the first integer input, `r` is the second integer input, `s` and `e` are updated to the start and end indices of the segment in `arr` that `eli` points to. If `s > l`, `s` and `e` are updated to the start and end indices of the segment. Otherwise, if `e >= r`, `s` and `e` are updated to the start and end indices of the segment. Otherwise, if `e < r`, `s` and `e` are updated accordingly.**
