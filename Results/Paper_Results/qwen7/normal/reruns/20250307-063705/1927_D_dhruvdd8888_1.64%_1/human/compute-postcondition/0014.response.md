Output State: **`num` is equal to `nums[i]`; the array `arr` contains an additional element `(1 + i, i, nums[i])`.**

Explanation: The code `num = nums[i]` assigns the value of `nums[i]` to the variable `num`. Additionally, the array `arr` gets an extra element `(1 + s, i, num)`, where `s` is equal to `i`. Therefore, the new element added to `arr` is `(1 + i, i, nums[i])`.
