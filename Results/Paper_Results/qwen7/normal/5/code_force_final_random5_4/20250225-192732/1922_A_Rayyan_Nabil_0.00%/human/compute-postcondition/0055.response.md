Postcondition: `i` is `n`, `t` is `n-2`, `l` is 'YES', `b` is an input from the user, `c` is an input from the user. If `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`, the condition remains unchanged. If the condition `a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]` is true, then the state of the variables stays the same as the precondition.
