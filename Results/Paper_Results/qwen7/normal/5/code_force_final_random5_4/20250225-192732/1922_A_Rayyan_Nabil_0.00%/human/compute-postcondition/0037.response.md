Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `t` is `n-1`, `l` is 'YES', `c` is the input from the user, `l` is 'YES'**

The code simply reassigns the variable `l` to the string `'YES'`. Since the initial state already had `l` as `'YES'`, this assignment does not change the value of `l`. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial states.
