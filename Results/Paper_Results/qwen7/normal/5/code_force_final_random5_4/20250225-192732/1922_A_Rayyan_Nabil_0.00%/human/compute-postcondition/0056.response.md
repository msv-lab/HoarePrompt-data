Postcondition: **`i` is `n`, `t` is `n-2`, `l` is 'YES', `b` is an input from the user, `c` is an input from the user. If `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]` is true, the condition remains unchanged. If the condition is false, the condition also remains unchanged since there is no else part to alter the state.**
