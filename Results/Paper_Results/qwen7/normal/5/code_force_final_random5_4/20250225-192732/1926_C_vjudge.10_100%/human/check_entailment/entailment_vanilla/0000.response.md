Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program initializes `inf` to \(2 \times 10^5 + 1\).
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It creates an array `values` of size `inf` initialized to zeros.

2. **Precompute the Sum of Digits:**
   - A loop runs from 1 to `inf` (200001).
   - For each number `i`, it calculates the sum of its digits (`sum_value_digits`).
   - It updates the `values` array such that `values[i]` stores the cumulative sum of the sums of digits from 1 to `i`.

3. **Processing Test Cases:**
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `value`.
   - It prints `values[value]`, which should be the sum of the sums of digits from 1 to `value`.

### Issues Identified:

1. **Infinite Range:**
   - The range `range(1, inf)` is not practical because `inf` is a very large number (200001). This will cause the program to run indefinitely or consume excessive memory.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Sum Calculation:**
   - The logic to calculate the sum of digits for each number and store it in the `values` array is flawed.
   - The `values[i]` should store the sum of the sums of digits from 1 to `i`, but the current implementation does not achieve this.

3. **Memory and Time Efficiency:**
   - Precomputing the sum of digits for all numbers up to `2 \times 10^5` is not efficient and may exceed the time limit of 0.5 seconds per test case.

### Correct Approach:

A more efficient approach would be to directly compute the sum of the sums of digits for each number in each test case without precomputing the entire array.

### Corrected Program:

```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        total_sum = 0
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            sum_value_digits = sum(int(digit) for digit in str(i))
            total_sum += sum_value_digits
        print(total_sum)

func_1()
```

### Conclusion:

The original program is incorrect due to the inefficiency and flawed logic. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
