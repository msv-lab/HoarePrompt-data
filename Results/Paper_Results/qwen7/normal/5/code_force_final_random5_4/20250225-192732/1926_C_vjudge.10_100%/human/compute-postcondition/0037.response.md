To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects present in the loop head. The loop head here is:

```python
for _ in range(t):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

From this, we can see that the only variable involved in the loop head is `t`. The loop will iterate `t` times.

Given the task description, the initial state before the loop starts is that the final state of `values` will be a list where each index `i` (from 0 to 200000) contains the cumulative sum of the digit sums from 1 to `i`. However, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that the variable `t` is set appropriately.

Since the loop will run `t` times, `t` must be a positive integer. The value of `t` determines how many times the loop will execute. If `t` is less than or equal to 200001, the loop will run for the required number of iterations to compute the cumulative sums up to 200000. If `t` is greater than 200001, the loop will still run, but the values beyond 200000 will not be computed as per the given task.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute correctly, `t` must be at least 200001.

State: **`t` must be at least 200001**
