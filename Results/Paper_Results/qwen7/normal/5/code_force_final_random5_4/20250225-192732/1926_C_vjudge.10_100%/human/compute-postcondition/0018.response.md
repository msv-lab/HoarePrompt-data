Output State: **`sum_value_digits` is the original value plus twice the integer value of the first character of the previous `i`, `i` is a non-empty string (one character shorter than the previous iteration)**.

Explanation: The code `sum_value_digits += int(x)` adds the integer value of `x` to `sum_value_digits`. Given the initial state, `x` is the first character of the string `i`, which means `x` is the first character of `i` converted to its integer value. Since `i` is a non-empty string and one character shorter than the previous iteration, the output state reflects that `sum_value_digits` has been updated by adding the integer value of the first character of the current `i`, and `i` remains a non-empty string one character shorter than the previous iteration.
