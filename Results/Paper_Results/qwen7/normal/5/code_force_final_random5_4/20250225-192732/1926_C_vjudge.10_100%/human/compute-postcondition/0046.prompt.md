Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: The final state of `values` will be a list where each index `i` (from 0 to 200000) contains the cumulative sum of the digit sums from 1 to `i`. In other words, `values[i]` will hold the sum of the digit sums of all integers from 1 to `i`. This means that for each index `i` in the `values` list, it will store the result of summing the digits of all numbers from 1 up to `i`.

For example, `values[1]` will be 1 (since the digit sum of 1 is 1), `values[2]` will be 3 (since the digit sum of 1+2 is 3), `values[3]` will be 6 (since the digit sum of 1+2+3 is 6), and so on, until `values[200000]`, which will be the sum of the digit sums of all numbers from 1 to 200000.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    value = int(input())
    print(values[value])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` must be at least 200001, `value` is an input integer.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` must be at least 200001, `value` is an input integer, `value` is assigned the integer input value.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` must be at least 200001, `value` is an input integer.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
