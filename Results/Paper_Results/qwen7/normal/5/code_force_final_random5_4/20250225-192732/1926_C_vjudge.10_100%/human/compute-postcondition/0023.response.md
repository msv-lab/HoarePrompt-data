Output State: **`values[i]` is the initial value plus the sum of the integer values of all characters in the original string `i` converted to integers, and `sum_value_digits` holds the same sum of these integer values.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `values[i]` by adding `sum_value_digits` to it. `sum_value_digits` contains the sum of the integer values of all characters in the original string `i` when each character is converted to an integer. The initial value of `values[i]` remains unchanged from its previous state, and `sum_value_digits` retains the sum of the integer values of the characters in the string `i`.
