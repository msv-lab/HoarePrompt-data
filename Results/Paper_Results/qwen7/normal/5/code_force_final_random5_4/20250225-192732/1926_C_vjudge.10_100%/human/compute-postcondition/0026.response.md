Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `x`, which iterates over each character in the string `str(i)`.
2. **Determine the initial state of the loop**: 
   - `values[i]` is the initial value plus the sum of the integer values of all characters in the original string `i` converted to integers.
   - `sum_value_digits` is 0.
   - `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**: The loop will iterate over each character in the string `str(i)`. Therefore, the loop can execute if the string `str(i)` is not empty.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over each character in `str(i)`, the string `str(i)` must contain at least one character for the loop to execute.
   - The variable `sum_value_digits` is initialized to 0 and will accumulate the sum of the integer values of the characters in the string `str(i)`.
   - The variable `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, but this does not affect the loop's ability to execute as long as the string is not empty.

Given these points, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the string `str(i)` to ensure it is not empty.

**State:**
- `values[i]` is the initial value plus the sum of the integer values of all characters in the original string `i` converted to integers.
- `sum_value_digits` is 0.
- `str(i)` must contain at least one character.

So, the final state is:
**`values[i]` is the initial value plus the sum of the integer values of all characters in the original string `i` converted to integers, `sum_value_digits` is 0, `str(i)` must contain at least one character.**
