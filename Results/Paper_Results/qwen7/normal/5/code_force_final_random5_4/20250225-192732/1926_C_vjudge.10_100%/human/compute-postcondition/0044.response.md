Output State: **`t` must be at least 200001, `value` is an input integer.**

The code `value = int(input())` assigns the integer value of the user's input to the variable `value`. The precondition that `t` must be at least 200001 remains unchanged, and the new variable `value` is assigned the integer value of the user's input.
