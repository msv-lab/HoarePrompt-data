Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases where each test case involves an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). For each test case, it reads another integer `value` (1 ≤ value ≤ 2 * 10^5) and prints the cumulative sum of the digit sums from 1 to `value`. The function precomputes and stores the cumulative sums of digit sums in a list `values` of size 200001 before processing any test cases. After processing all test cases, the final state of the program includes the precomputed list `values`.**
