Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for x in str(i):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `x` and `i`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `i` is a non-empty string. Once `i` becomes an empty string, the loop will terminate.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**: 
   - `i` must be a non-empty string.
   - `sum_value_digits` is the original value plus the integer value of the first character of `i`.

4. **Determine the Next State**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must still be a non-empty string. After the loop iterates once, `i` will lose its first character, making it a shorter string or potentially an empty string if it was a single-character string.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `i` loses its first character in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be one character shorter.
   - `sum_value_digits` remains unchanged unless the loop body modifies it, but based on the given information, it does not change within the loop.

Given the above reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `i` is now a string that is one character shorter than it was at the end of the previous iteration, and `sum_value_digits` remains the same.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` must be a non-empty string (one character shorter than the previous iteration), `sum_value_digits` is the original value plus the integer value of the first character of the previous `i`**.
