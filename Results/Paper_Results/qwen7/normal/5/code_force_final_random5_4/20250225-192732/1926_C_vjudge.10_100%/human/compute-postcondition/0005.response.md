Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for x in str(i):`.
   - The variables involved here are `x` and `i`.

2. **Determine the Initial State:**
   - Before the loop starts, `i` is 1.
   - The string representation of `i` is "1".

3. **Understand the Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over each character in the string representation of `i`.
   - For `i = 1`, the string is "1", so the loop will iterate once with `x` being '1'.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since the loop is iterating over the characters of `str(i)`, the variable `i` remains unchanged during the loop execution.
   - The variable `x` will take on the value of each character in the string "1" during each iteration.

5. **Final State Before Loop Execution:**
   - The initial state of `i` is 1.
   - The initial state of `sum_value_digits` is 0 (though this variable is not directly involved in the loop head).

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the string representation of `i`.

**State:**
**`i` is 1, `x` must be the first character of the string "1" (which is '1')**
