Output State: **`ind1` is 0, `inpstr` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', where 'W' represents a white cell and 'B' represents a black cell, with at least one 'B' in the string.**

Explanation: The code simply initializes `ind1` to 0. This does not affect the value of `inpstr`. The precondition that `inpstr` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', where 'W' represents a white cell and 'B' represents a black cell, with at least one 'B' in the string, remains unchanged.
