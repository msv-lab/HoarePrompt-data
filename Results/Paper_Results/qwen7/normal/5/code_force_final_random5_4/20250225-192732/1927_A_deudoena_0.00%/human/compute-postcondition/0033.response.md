Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `inpstr`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for each index `i` in the range from 0 to `len(inpstr) - 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `inpstr` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' that must contain at least one 'B'.

4. **Determine the next value of `i`**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, the next value of `i` will be `1 + 1 = 2`.

5. **Check the condition for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < len(inpstr)`.

6. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - `inpstr` remains the same because the loop body is omitted and no changes are made to `inpstr` within the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is 2, `inpstr` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' that must contain at least one 'B'**
