Output State: **`i` is 2; `ind2` is 2**

Explanation: The line `ind2 = i` assigns the current value of `i` (which is 2) to `ind2`. No other variables are affected, and the precondition that `inpstr` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' that must contain at least one 'B' remains unchanged.
