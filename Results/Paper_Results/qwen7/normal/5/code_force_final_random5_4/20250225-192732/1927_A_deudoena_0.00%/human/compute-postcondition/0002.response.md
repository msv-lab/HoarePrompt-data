Output State: **`ind1` is 0, `ind2` is 0, `inpstr` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', where 'W' represents a white cell and 'B' represents a black cell, with at least one 'B' in the string.**

Explanation: The code initializes `ind2` to 0. The values of `ind1` and `inpstr` remain unchanged from their initial states. `ind1` was initially 0, and `inpstr` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' with at least one 'B'. The new variable `ind2` is also set to 0.
