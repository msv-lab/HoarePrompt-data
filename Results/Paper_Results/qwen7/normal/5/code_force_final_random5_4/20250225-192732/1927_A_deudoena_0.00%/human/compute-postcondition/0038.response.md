Output State: ind1 is the index of the first 'B' in the string inpstr, ind2 is the index of the last 'B' in inpstr, inpstr is a string of length n consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' that must contain at least one 'B', outind is 0.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `ind2` will be set to the index of the last 'B' in the string `inpstr`. This is because the loop iterates over each character in `inpstr` from the end to the beginning, and as soon as it finds a 'B', it sets `ind2` to the current index `i` and breaks out of the loop. Since the loop runs for the entire length of `inpstr`, `ind2` will eventually be set to the index of the last 'B' in the string. The other variables (`ind1`, `inpstr`, and `outind`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
