### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Analysis**:
   - The goal is to find the minimum length of a continuous segment that, when painted white, will turn all black cells in the strip white.
   - This means we need to identify the smallest segment that includes all black cells.

2. **Function Summary Analysis**:
   - The function processes an input string `inpstr` consisting of 'W' and 'B'.
   - It finds the index of the first 'B' (`ind1`) and the index of the last 'B' (`ind2`).
   - It then prints the length of the string minus the sum of these two indices (`len(inpstr) - ind1 - ind2`).

3. **Evaluation of the Code**:
   - The code correctly identifies the first and last black cells using `ind1` and `ind2`.
   - However, the formula `len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1` does not necessarily give the minimum segment length. For example, consider the input "WBW". The first and last black cells are at positions 1 and 3, respectively. The calculated segment length would be `len("WBW") - 1 - 3 = 1`, but the actual minimum segment length is 2 (painting the segment "B" or "WB").

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To find the minimum segment length, we need to determine the distance between the first and last black cells plus one (to include both endpoints).
   - The correct formula should be `ind2 - ind1 + 1`.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The current implementation does not correctly calculate the minimum segment length. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
