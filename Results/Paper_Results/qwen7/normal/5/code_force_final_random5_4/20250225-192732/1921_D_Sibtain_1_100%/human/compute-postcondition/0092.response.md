Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 2, `ans` is updated with the new value of `max(t1, t2)`, `k` is `len(a)`, `t1` is `abs(a[1] - c[1])`, `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - 2] - c[len(c) - 2])`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers created from user input, `c` is a list of integers created from user input sorted in descending order, and `c` is now a list of integers split from the input.**

Explanation: The code `c = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, converts each integer to an int, and assigns the resulting list to `c`. The values of `i`, `j`, `ans`, `k`, `t1`, `t2`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. The list `a` is still a sorted list of integers created from user input, and its length is at least 4. The list `c` is now updated to be a list of integers split from the input and sorted in descending order.
