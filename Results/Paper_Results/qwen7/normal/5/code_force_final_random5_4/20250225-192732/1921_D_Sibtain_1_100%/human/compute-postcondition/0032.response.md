Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 3, `ans` is max(t1, t2), `k` is 1, `t1` is `abs(a[0] - c[0])`, `t2` is `abs(a[2] - c[2])`**

Explanation: The code `j += 1` increments the value of `j` by 1. Initially, `j` is 2, so after executing the code, `j` becomes 3. The values of `i`, `ans`, `k`, `t1`, and `t2` remain unchanged.
