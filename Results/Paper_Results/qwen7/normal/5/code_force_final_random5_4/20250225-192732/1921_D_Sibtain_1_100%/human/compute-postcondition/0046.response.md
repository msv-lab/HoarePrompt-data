Output State: `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `ans` is the sum of all `max(t1, t2)` values calculated during each iteration, `k` is 3, `t1` is `abs(a[2] - c[2])`, and `t2` is `abs(a[0] - c[1])`.

To explain this output state in natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to 2 (as it increments by 1 each time until it reaches the length of list `a`), and `j` will be equal to 4 (it starts at 1 and increments by 1 each time until it reaches the length of list `c`). The variable `ans` will hold the cumulative sum of the maximum of `t1` and `t2` from each iteration of the loop. The variable `k` will be equal to 3 because the loop runs for the length of list `a`. The values of `t1` and `t2` will be the last values calculated before the loop ends, which are `abs(a[2] - c[2])` and `abs(a[0] - c[1])`, respectively.
