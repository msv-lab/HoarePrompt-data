Output State: **`i` is equal to `len(a)`, `j` is equal to `len(c)`, `ans` is the cumulative sum of `max(t1, t2)` for each iteration of the loop, `k` is equal to `len(a)`, `t1` is `abs(a[len(a) - 1] - c[0])`, and `t2` is `abs(a[0] - c[len(c) - 1])`**.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to the length of list `a`, indicating that all elements in `a` have been processed. Similarly, `j` will be equal to the length of list `c`, indicating that all elements in `c` have been processed. The variable `ans` will hold the total cumulative sum of the maximum of `t1` and `t2` for each iteration of the loop. The variable `k` will be equal to the length of list `a`, as the loop runs for the length of list `a`. The value of `t1` will be the absolute difference between the last element of list `a` and the first element of list `c`, and the value of `t2` will be the absolute difference between the first element of list `a` and the last element of list `c`.
