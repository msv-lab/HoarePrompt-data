Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `j` is 2.
   - `ans` is updated with the new value of `max(t1, t2)`.
   - `k` is `len(a)`.
   - `t1` is `abs(a[1] - c[1])`.
   - `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - 2] - c[len(c) - 2])`.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `m` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers created from user input.
   - `c` is a list of integers created from user input sorted in descending order.
   - `c` is now a list of integers split from the input, and `a` is sorted, `c` is sorted in reverse order.

2. **Print Statement**:
   ```python
   print(max(abs(a[0] - max(c)), abs(a[0] - min(c))))
   ```

From the initial state, we know:
- `a` is a sorted list of integers.
- `c` is a list of integers sorted in descending order.

To determine what will be printed, let's focus on the expression inside the `max` function:
- `abs(a[0] - max(c))`: This calculates the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the maximum element of `c`.
- `abs(a[0] - min(c))`: This calculates the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the minimum element of `c`.

Since `c` is sorted in descending order, `max(c)` is the first element of `c` (let's call it `c[0]`), and `min(c)` is the last element of `c` (let's call it `c[-1]`).

Therefore, the expression simplifies to:
- `abs(a[0] - c[0])`: The absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the first element of `c`.
- `abs(a[0] - c[-1])`: The absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the last element of `c`.

The `max` function will return the larger of these two values.

Output: **max(abs(a[0] - c[0]), abs(a[0] - c[-1]))**
