Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5 and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5. a_i and b_i are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9 for all i.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    c = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if len(set(a)) == 1 and len(set(c)) == 1 and a[0] == c[0]:
        print(0)
        continue
    a.sort()
    c.sort(reverse=True)
    if len(a) == 1:
        print(max(abs(a[0] - max(c)), abs(a[0] - min(c))))
        continue
    i, j, ans = 0, 1, 0
    for k in range(len(a)):
        t1 = abs(a[i] - c[i])
        t2 = abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])
        if t2 > t1:
            j += 1
        else:
            i += 1
        ans += max(t1, t2)
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `ans` is the sum of all `max(t1, t2)` values calculated during each iteration, `k` is 3, `t1` is `abs(a[2] - c[2])`, and `t2` is `abs(a[0] - c[1])`.

To explain this output state in natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to 2 (as it increments by 1 each time until it reaches the length of list `a`), and `j` will be equal to 4 (it starts at 1 and increments by 1 each time until it reaches the length of list `c`). The variable `ans` will hold the cumulative sum of the maximum of `t1` and `t2` from each iteration of the loop. The variable `k` will be equal to 3 because the loop runs for the length of list `a`. The values of `t1` and `t2` will be the last values calculated before the loop ends, which are `abs(a[2] - c[2])` and `abs(a[0] - c[1])`, respectively.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: i is either 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, ..., len(a)-1; j is either 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, ..., len(c); ans is the sum of max(t1, t2) for each iteration; k is len(a); t1 is abs(a[i] - c[i]); t2 is abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j]); n is an input integer; m is an input integer; a is a sorted list of integers created from user input; c is a list of integers created from user input sorted in descending order; and len(a) must be at least 4.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `k` is equal to `len(a)`, `ans` is the sum of `max(abs(a[i] - c[i]), t2)` for each iteration of the loop, `t1` is `abs(a[i] - c[i])`, `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`, `i` is incremented for each iteration where `t2` is less than or equal to `t1`, and `j` is incremented for each iteration where `t2` is greater than `t1`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `k` will be equal to the length of the list `a`, `ans` will be the cumulative maximum of `t1` and `t2` for each iteration, `t1` and `t2` will hold their respective final values based on the last comparison inside the loop, and `i` and `j` will have been incremented according to the conditions specified within the loop body.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
