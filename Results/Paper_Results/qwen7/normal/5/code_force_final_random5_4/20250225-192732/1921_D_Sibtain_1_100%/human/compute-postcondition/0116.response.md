Output State: **`k` is 1, `ans` is `max(abs(a[i] - c[i]), t2)`, `t1` is `abs(a[i] - c[i])`, `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`, `i` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `i` is incremented by 1, but the exact new value of `i` is not specified in the initial state. The values of `k`, `ans`, `t1`, and `t2` remain unchanged from their initial states.
