Output State: **`i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is either 1 or 2, `ans` is `max(t1, t2)`, `k` is 3, `t1` is `abs(a[0] - c[0])`, `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers created from user input, `c` is a list of integers created from user input sorted in descending order, and `len(a)` must be at least 4.**

Explanation: The code updates `ans` by adding the maximum value between `t1` and `t2`. The values of `i`, `j`, `k`, `t1`, `t2`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `c` remain unchanged from their initial states. The updated value of `ans` is now the maximum of `t1` and `t2`.
