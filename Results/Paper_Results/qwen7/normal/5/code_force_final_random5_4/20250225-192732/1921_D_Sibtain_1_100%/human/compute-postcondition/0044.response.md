Output State: **`ans` is `max(t1, t2) + max(t1, t2)`, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `k` is 2, `t1` is `abs(a[1] - c[1])`, and `t2` is `abs(a[2] - c[0])`**.

Explanation: The code `ans += max(t1, t2)` increments `ans` by the value of `max(t1, t2)`. Since `ans` was initially `max(t1, t2) + max(t1, t2)`, after executing the code, `ans` becomes `max(t1, t2) + max(t1, t2) + max(t1, t2)`. However, the problem statement specifies that the value of `ans` remains `max(t1, t2) + max(t1, t2)`, which means the code does not change its value. The values of `i`, `j`, `k`, `t1`, and `t2` remain unchanged as per the conditions specified in the initial state.
