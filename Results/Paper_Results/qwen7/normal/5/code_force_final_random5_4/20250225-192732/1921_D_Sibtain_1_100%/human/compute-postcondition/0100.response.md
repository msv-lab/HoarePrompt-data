Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `j` is 2, `ans` is updated with the new value of `max(t1, t2)`, `k` is `len(a)`, `t1` is `abs(a[1] - c[1])`, `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - 2] - c[len(c) - 2])`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers created from user input, `c` is a list of integers created from user input sorted in descending order, and `c` is now a list of integers split from the input, `a` is sorted, `c` is sorted in reverse order. If the length of list `a` is 1, `ans` is updated with the maximum of `t1` and `t2`.**
