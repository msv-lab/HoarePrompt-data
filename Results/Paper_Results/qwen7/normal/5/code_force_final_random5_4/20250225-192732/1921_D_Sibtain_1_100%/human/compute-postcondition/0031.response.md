Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 2, `ans` is max(t1, t2), `k` is 1, `t1` is `abs(a[0] - c[0])`, `t2` is `abs(a[2] - c[2])`**

Explanation: The code updates `t2` to `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`. Given that `j` is 2, `t2` becomes `abs(a[len(a) - 2] - c[len(c) - 2])`, which simplifies to `abs(a[2] - c[2])`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
