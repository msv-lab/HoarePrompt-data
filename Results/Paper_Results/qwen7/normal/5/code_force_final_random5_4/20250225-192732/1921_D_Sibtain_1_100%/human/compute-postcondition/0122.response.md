Output State: **`k` is 2, `t1` is `abs(a[i] - c[i])`, `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`, `ans` is `max(abs(a[i] - c[i]), t2) + max(t1, t2)`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `t2` to `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`. The values of `k`, `t1`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `k` is still 2, `t1` is still `abs(a[i] - c[i])`, and `ans` is still `max(abs(a[i] - c[i]), t2) + max(t1, t2)`.
