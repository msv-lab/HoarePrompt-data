Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles the input by reading the number of test cases (`t`), and for each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m`, the array `a`, and the array `b`. This part is correct.

2. **Edge Case Handling**: The program checks if all elements in `a` and `c` are the same. If they are, it prints `0` and continues to the next test case. This is a correct approach to handle the edge case where the arrays are identical.

3. **Sorting Arrays**: The program sorts both arrays `a` and `c` in ascending and descending order, respectively. This is a key step to maximize the differences between corresponding elements of the two arrays.

4. **Main Logic**: The main logic iterates through the arrays using two pointers (`i` and `j`). It calculates the absolute differences between the corresponding elements and adds the maximum of these differences to the answer (`ans`). The logic ensures that the largest possible differences are chosen by always taking the maximum of the two calculated differences at each step. This approach is correct for maximizing the total difference.

5. **Final Output**: The program correctly outputs the final answer after processing all elements.

Given the above points, the program appears to be logically sound and correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
