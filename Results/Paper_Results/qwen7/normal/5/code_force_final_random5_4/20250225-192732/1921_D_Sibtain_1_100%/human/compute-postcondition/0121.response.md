Output State: **`k` is 2, `ans` is `max(abs(a[i] - c[i]), t2) + max(t1, t2)` with `t1` updated to `abs(a[i] - c[i])`, `t2` remains unchanged**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `t1` to `abs(a[i] - c[i])`. Since `t1` was previously defined as `abs(a[i] - c[i])`, updating `t1` does not change its value. The values of `k`, `ans`, and `t2` remain the same as they were in the initial state.
