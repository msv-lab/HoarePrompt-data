Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 2, `ans` is 0, `k` is 3, `t1` is `abs(a[0] - c[0])`, `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - (j - 1)] - c[len(c) - (j - 1)])`**

Explanation: The variable `j` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state. The expressions for `t1` and `t2` are updated based on the new value of `j`.
