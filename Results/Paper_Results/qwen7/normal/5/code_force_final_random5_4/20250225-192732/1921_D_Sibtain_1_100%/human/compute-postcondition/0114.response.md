Output State: **`k` is 1, `ans` is `max(abs(a[i] - c[i]), t2)`, `t1` is `abs(a[i] - c[i])`, `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `t2` to `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`. The values of `k`, `ans`, and `t1` remain unchanged from their initial states.
