Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not implement the required functionality. According to the problem description, the program needs to read an array of integers, perform a series of operations to maximize the sum of the elements, and output the maximum sum along with the sequence of operations. However, the program does not actually read the input array or perform any operations to modify the array. Instead, it hardcodes the output based on the length of the array, which does not account for the actual values in the array or the operations needed to maximize the sum.

For example, consider the input:
```
4
1 100 2 1
```
The program will output:
```
13 0
```
which is incorrect because the maximum sum achievable is 105, not 13. Additionally, the program does not provide any operations to achieve this sum, which is also incorrect.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is thus incorrect.
