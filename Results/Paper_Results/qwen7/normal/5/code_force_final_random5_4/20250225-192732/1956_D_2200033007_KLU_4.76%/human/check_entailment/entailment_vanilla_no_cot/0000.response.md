Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The function `func_1` always prints a fixed output regardless of the input array, which means it cannot dynamically calculate the maximum sum of the array elements or the sequence of operations needed to achieve that sum. The problem requires a dynamic approach to find the optimal operations to maximize the sum of the array elements, but the given code does not address this requirement.
