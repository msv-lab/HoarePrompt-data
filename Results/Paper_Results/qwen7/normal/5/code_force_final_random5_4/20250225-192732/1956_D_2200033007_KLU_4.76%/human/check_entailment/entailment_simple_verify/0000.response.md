### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not implement the required functionality. Let's break down the issues and verify them using the annotated code:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself from the input. This part is correct.
2. **Processing the Array**: The program calls `func_1(len(a))`, but `func_1` does not process the array in any way. Instead, it hardcodes the output based on the length of the array `c`. This means that regardless of the actual values in the array, the program always prints the same hardcoded values.
3. **Hardcoded Output**: 
   - If `c == 2`, the program prints `4 1` and `1 2`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `13 0`.

These hardcoded outputs do not depend on the actual values in the array or the operations needed to maximize the sum. For instance, the output `13 0` is incorrect for the input `1 100 2 1`, as the maximum sum achievable is 105, not 13. Similarly, the hardcoded operations do not reflect the necessary steps to achieve the maximum sum.

Given these observations, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. It fails to read the actual values in the array and does not perform any operations to maximize the sum of the elements.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not implement the required functionality of reading the array, performing operations to maximize the sum, and outputting the correct maximum sum along with the sequence of operations.
