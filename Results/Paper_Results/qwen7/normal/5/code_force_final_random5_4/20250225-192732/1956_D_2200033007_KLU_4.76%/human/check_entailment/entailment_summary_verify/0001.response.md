Reasoning:

1. The problem requires maximizing the sum of the elements of the array `a` using up to \(5 \times 10^5\) operations, where each operation involves setting a subarray to the MEX value of that subarray.
2. The provided code does not implement the logic to find the MEX value or perform the operations. Instead, it uses hardcoded values for different lengths of the array.
3. Let's analyze the examples given:
   - For `n = 2`, the initial array is `[0, 1]`. The code outputs `4 1` and the operation `1 2`, which correctly sets the array to `[2, 2]` to get a sum of `4`.
   - For `n = 3`, the initial array is `[1, 3, 9]`. The code outputs `13 0`, meaning no operations are needed since the sum is already maximized.
   - For `n = 4`, the initial array is `[1, 100, 2, 1]`. The code outputs `105 2` with operations `3 3` and `3 4`, which correctly sets the array to `[1, 100, 0, 0]` to get a sum of `101`, but the expected output is `105`, indicating the code is incomplete.
4. The code does not handle general cases where the array length is greater than 2, and it does not correctly compute the MEX value or perform the required operations. However, the examples provided show that the hardcoded values are correct for those specific cases.

Given the function summary, we can see that the function `func_1` is only used for arrays of length 2 and does not handle other cases. This means the program is incomplete and does not solve the general problem as described. The function summary confirms that the function does not implement the required logic to find the MEX value and perform the operations.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate because the program does not correctly implement the solution for the general case and does not handle the MEX value computation and operations as required.

Final: **False**
