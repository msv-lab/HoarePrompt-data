Reasoning:
1. The problem requires maximizing the sum of the array elements through a series of operations.
2. The annotated program does not actually implement the logic to solve the problem. Instead, it uses a hardcoded check for the length of the array and prints fixed outputs.
3. For arrays of length 2, the program correctly prints the maximum sum (4) and the number of operations (1), along with the operation details (1 2).
4. For arrays of other lengths, the program incorrectly prints a fixed sum (13) and number of operations (0), without performing any operations or considering the actual array values.
5. This means the program does not dynamically calculate the maximum sum or perform the necessary operations based on the input array, which is required by the problem statement.

Given these points, the program is not solving the problem as intended.

Correctness: **False**
