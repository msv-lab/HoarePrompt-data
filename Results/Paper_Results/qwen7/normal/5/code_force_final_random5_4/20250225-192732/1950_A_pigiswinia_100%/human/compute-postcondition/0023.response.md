Output State: **`t` is a value between 1 and 1000, `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the user input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The initial state of `t` and `i` remains unchanged. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` depend on the input provided by the user.
