Reasoning:
1. The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. It iterates over each test case using a loop.
3. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.
4. It checks the conditions for a stair (`a < b < c`) and a peak (`a < b > c`).
5. If the conditions are met, it prints the appropriate string ('STAIR' or 'PEAK').
6. If neither condition is met, it prints 'NONE'.
7. The logic in the function matches the problem description accurately.

Given the annotated program and the reasoning above, the function correctly implements the logic to determine whether the digits form a stair, a peak, or neither.

Correctness: **True**
