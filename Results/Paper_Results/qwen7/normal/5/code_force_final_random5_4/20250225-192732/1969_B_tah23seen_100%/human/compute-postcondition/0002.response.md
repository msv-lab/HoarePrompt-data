Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`, which is iterating over each character in the string `s`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: Since `i` is iterating through each character in the string `s`, the initial value of `i` should be set to the first character of `s`.

3. **Determine the Length of `s`**: For the loop to execute, the string `s` must contain at least one character. Given that `s` is a binary string with a length between 2 and 200,000, the minimum length is 2.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - The string `s` must have at least one character for the loop to execute.
   - The variable `i` must be set to the first character of `s`.

5. **Other Variables**: The variables `cost` and `one` are not directly involved in the loop head and their values do not affect the loop's execution based on the given information.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `s` must be a non-empty binary string.
- `i` must be set to the first character of `s`.

State: **`s` is a non-empty binary string, `i` is the first character of `s`**
