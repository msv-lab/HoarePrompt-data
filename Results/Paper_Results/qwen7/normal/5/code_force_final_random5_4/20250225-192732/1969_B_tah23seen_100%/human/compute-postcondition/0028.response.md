Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `s`, which is a binary string consisting of '0's and '1's with a length between 2 and 200000. It returns the sum of (one + 1) for each '0' encountered in `s` where `one` is greater than 0, plus an initial cost of 2 for each iteration where `i` is '1'.**
