Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `s` is a non-empty binary string.
   - `i` is the first character of `s`.
   - If the first character of `s` is '1', then `one` is set to 2.
   - If the first character of `s` is '0' and there exists at least one '1' in the string `s`, then `cost` is increased by 2.
   - Otherwise, the value of `cost` remains unchanged.

2. **Loop Head Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over each character in the string `s` using the variable `i`.

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop will continue as long as there are more characters in the string `s` to iterate over.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be the next character in the string `s`.
   - Since the loop is iterating through each character of `s`, the string `s` itself does not change within the loop body (assuming no modifications are made inside the loop).

4. **Determining the New State:**
   - The string `s` will lose its first character after the current iteration.
   - `i` will now be the second character of the updated string `s`.
   - The conditions for setting `one` and modifying `cost` will be checked based on the new value of `i`.

5. **Final State:**
   - `s` will be the original string `s` without its first character.
   - `i` will be the second character of the updated string `s`.
   - The values of `one` and `cost` will remain unchanged unless the new `i` meets the conditions specified in the postcondition.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`s` is a non-empty binary string with its first character removed, `i` is the second character of `s`, `one` is either 2 or unchanged, `cost` is either increased by 2 or unchanged**. 

Given that the exact values of `one` and `cost` depend on the previous iteration's conditions, we cannot specify their exact values here. However, we know they will remain as they were if the new `i` does not meet the conditions for changing them.

So, the final state can be summarized as:

State: **`s` is a non-empty binary string with its first character removed, `i` is the second character of `s`, `one` is either 2 or unchanged, `cost` is either increased by 2 or unchanged**.
