Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string using cyclic shifts. The logic in `func_1` does not account for the optimal way to perform cyclic shifts to sort the string. Here’s why the current implementation is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Cost Calculation**: The current implementation calculates the cost based on the positions of '0's and '1's without considering the cyclic nature of the shifts. It simply adds the count of '0's that appear after a '1' to the cost, which does not reflect the actual minimum cost required to sort the string through cyclic shifts.

2. **Lack of Cyclic Shift Handling**: The function does not handle the cyclic nature of the shifts properly. For example, in the string "101011", the optimal solution involves multiple cyclic shifts, but the current function does not capture this complexity.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to identify the longest prefix that is already sorted and then calculate the cost based on the remaining unsorted part. Here’s a corrected version of the code:

```python
t = int(input())
while t:
    s = input()
    n = len(s)
    cost = 0
    i = 0
    while i < n and s[i] == '0':
        i += 1
    j = i
    while j < n and s[j] == '1':
        j += 1
    while j < n:
        k = j
        while k < n and s[k] == '1':
            k += 1
        cost += (k - j + 1)
        j = k
        while j < n and s[j] == '0':
            j += 1
    print(cost)
    t -= 1
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Code:
1. **Identify the Sorted Prefix**: We first find the longest prefix that is already sorted.
2. **Calculate Cost for Unsorted Suffixes**: We then process the remaining part of the string, calculating the cost for each segment that needs to be shifted to its correct position.
3. **Sum Costs**: Sum up the costs for all segments to get the final minimum cost.

This approach ensures that we correctly account for the cyclic shifts needed to sort the string.
