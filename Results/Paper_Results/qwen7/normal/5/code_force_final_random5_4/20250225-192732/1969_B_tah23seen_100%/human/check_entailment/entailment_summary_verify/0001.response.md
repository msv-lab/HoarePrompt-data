### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Description and Input/Output Analysis**:
   - The problem requires calculating the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts.
   - The cost of a cyclic shift is the length of the substring being shifted.
   - The provided solution reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by calling `func_1(s)`.

2. **Function `func_1(s)` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1(s)` is designed to calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string `s`.
   - It initializes `cost` to 0 and `one` to 0.
   - It iterates through each character in the string `s`.
     - If the character is '1', it increments the counter `one`.
     - If the character is '0' and there has been at least one '1' encountered (`one > 0`), it adds `one + 1` to the `cost`.

3. **Function Summary Analysis**:
   - The provided function summary states that for each '0' in `s` where the count of preceding '1's (`one`) is greater than 0, it adds `one + 1` to the cost. Additionally, for each '1' in `s`, it adds 2 to the cost.
   - However, the actual implementation in `func_1(s)` only adds `one + 1` when encountering a '0' after at least one '1' has been seen, which matches the problem's requirement.

4. **Example Cases Verification**:
   - For "10", the cost is 2 (shift the entire string).
   - For "0000", no shifts are needed, so the cost is 0.
   - For "11000", the cost is calculated as 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 (as explained in the problem statement).
   - For "101011", the cost is 5 (explained similarly).
   - For "01101001", the cost is 11 (explained similarly).

5. **Original Assessment Evaluation**:
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that the logic in `func_1(s)` correctly calculates the minimum total cost according to the problem statement and handles the examples provided.
   - The function summary provided does not contradict the actual implementation, and the examples are correctly handled.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum total cost to sort the binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts.

**Final: True**
