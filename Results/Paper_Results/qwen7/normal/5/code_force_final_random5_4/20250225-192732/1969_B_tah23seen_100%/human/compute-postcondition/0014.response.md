Output State: **`s` is a non-empty binary string with its first character removed, `i` is the second character of `s`, `one` is 3, `cost` is either increased by 2 or unchanged**

Explanation: The variable `one` is incremented by 1, so if `one` was initially 2, it becomes 3. The values of `s`, `i`, and `cost` remain unchanged from their initial states.
