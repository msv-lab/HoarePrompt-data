Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Cost Calculation for Cyclic Shifts**: The program calculates the cost based on the positions of '1's and '0's without considering the actual cyclic shifts needed to sort the string. The given execution summary suggests an incorrect approach where it simply adds `one + 1` for each '0' following a '1', which does not account for the minimum cost of cyclic shifts.

2. **Cost Calculation Method**: The method `func_1` incorrectly assumes that each '0' following a '1' requires a cost of `one + 1`. This does not reflect the true minimum cost of cyclic shifts needed to sort the string. For example, consider the string "101011". According to the given logic, the cost would be calculated as follows:
   - First '0': cost = 2 (since there is 1 '1' before it)
   - Second '0': cost = 3 (since there are 2 '1's before it)
   - Total cost = 2 + 3 = 5
   However, the optimal solution involves multiple cyclic shifts:
   - Shift "10" to get "01": cost = 2
   - Shift "1011" to get "0111": cost = 4
   - Total cost = 2 + 4 = 6, which is higher than the provided logic.

3. **Cyclic Shifts and Minimum Cost**: The problem requires finding the minimum cost to sort the string using cyclic shifts. The given logic does not account for the optimal sequence of shifts that minimizes the total cost.

Given these points, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
