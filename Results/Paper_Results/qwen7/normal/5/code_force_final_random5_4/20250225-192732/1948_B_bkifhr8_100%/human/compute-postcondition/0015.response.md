Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `m` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `ans` is False, `i` is `m - 1`, `nums` is a list containing the integer value of the last element of `arr` before the index `i` and the current value of `arr[i]`, `arr[i - 1]` is updated to `nums[0]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `arr[i - 1]` to `nums[0]`. Since `nums[0]` is the integer value of the last element of `arr` before the index `i`, `arr[i - 1]` is now equal to that value. All other variables remain unchanged.
