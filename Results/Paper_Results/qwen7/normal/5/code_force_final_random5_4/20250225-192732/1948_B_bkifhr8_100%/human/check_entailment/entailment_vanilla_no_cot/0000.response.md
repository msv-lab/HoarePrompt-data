Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Checking Sorted Order**: The logic for checking if the array can be made sorted is flawed. Specifically, the code checks if the last element is less than the one before it and then attempts to merge them. This does not cover all cases where the array might become sorted after multiple operations.

2. **Merging Digits**: The merging of digits into a single number is done incorrectly. The code concatenates digits but does not ensure that the resulting number is the smallest possible number that can be formed by merging the digits of the two numbers.

3. **Handling All Test Cases**: The solution does not handle all test cases correctly. It only checks the last element against the second last element, which is insufficient for determining if the entire array can be sorted through the allowed operations.

4. **Output Format**: The output should be "YES" or "NO", but the code uses `['NO', 'YES'][ans]`, which is not a standard way to format the output. It should directly print "YES" or "NO".

A correct approach would involve repeatedly applying the merging operation to the array until no more merges can be performed, and then checking if the resulting array is sorted. Here's a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def can_sort_array(arr):
    while True:
        changed = False
        for i in range(len(arr) - 1):
            if arr[i] > arr[i + 1]:
                # Merge arr[i] and arr[i + 1]
                merged = list(str(arr[i]) + str(arr[i + 1]))
                merged.sort()
                merged_num = int(''.join(merged))
                arr[i] = merged_num // 10  # Update arr[i]
                arr[i + 1] = merged_num % 10  # Update arr[i + 1]
                changed = True
        if not changed:
            break
    return arr == sorted(arr)

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if can_sort_array(arr):
            print("YES")
        else:
            print("NO")

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the array is processed correctly and checks if it can be sorted using the allowed operations.
