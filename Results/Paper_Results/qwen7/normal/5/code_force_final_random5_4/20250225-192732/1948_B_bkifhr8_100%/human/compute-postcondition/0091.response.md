Postcondition: `ans` is `False`, `i` is `m - 1`, `m` must be at least 3, and either `arr[i]` is not less than `arr[i - 1]`, or `arr[i - 1]` is updated to the smallest value in the list `nums` (which is the sorted version of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`), and the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
