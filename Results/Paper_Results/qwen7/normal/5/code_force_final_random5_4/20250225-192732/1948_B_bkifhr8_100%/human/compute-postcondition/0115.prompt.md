Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(n):
    m = int(input())
    arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    ans = True
    for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
        if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
            nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
            if nums != sorted(nums):
                ans = False
                break
            arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
    print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `m` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `ans` is `False`, `i` is 0.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the value of `i` will be decremented until it reaches 0. The loop breaks when `arr[i] >= arr[i - 1]` for all `i` from `m-1` down to 1. Since `ans` is set to `False` and remains `False` even if the condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` is not met (as per the given conditions), `ans` will stay `False` regardless of the number of iterations. Therefore, after all iterations, `i` will be 0, `ans` will still be `False`, and the other variables will retain their final states from the last iteration of the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `ans` is either True or False, `i` is `m - 1`, `m` must be greater than 1, and `arr[i - 1]` is `nums[0]`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the value of `i` will be `m - 1` because the loop decrements `i` from `m - 1` down to 1. The variable `ans` will be False if at any point during the loop's execution, the condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` is met and the numbers in `arr[i - 1]` are not sorted when placed next to `arr[i]`. Otherwise, `ans` will remain True. The value of `arr[i - 1]` will be the first digit of the number formed by concatenating the digits of `arr[i - 1]` with `arr[i]` if the condition was met, otherwise it will remain unchanged as per the loop's logic.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: ans is False, i is 0, m is at least 3, and arr[i-1] is nums[0].




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
