Postcondition: `ans` is True, `i` is `m - 1`, `m` must be greater than 1, and `arr[i - 1]` is `nums[0]`. If `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, then `ans` is set to False and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `arr[i] >= arr[i - 1]`, `ans` remains True and the program continues without breaking.
