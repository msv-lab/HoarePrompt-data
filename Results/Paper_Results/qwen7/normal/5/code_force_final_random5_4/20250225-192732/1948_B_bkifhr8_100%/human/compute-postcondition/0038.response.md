Based on the initial state and the code snippet provided:

- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting an input string.
- `ans` is `False`.
- `i` is 0.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])
```

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The value of `ans` is explicitly stated to be `False`.
2. In Python, `False` is equivalent to `0` when used in indexing operations.
3. Therefore, the expression `['NO', 'YES'][ans]` translates to `['NO', 'YES'][0]`.
4. This results in the string `'NO'`.

So, the print statement will output `'NO'`.

Output: **'NO'**
