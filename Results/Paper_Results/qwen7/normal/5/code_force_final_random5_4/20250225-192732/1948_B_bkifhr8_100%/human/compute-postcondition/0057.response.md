Output State: **`ans` is `False`, `i` is `0`, `m` must be greater than `1`, `arr[i - 1]` remains `nums[0]`, `nums` is `[nums[0]] + [arr[0]]**.

Explanation: The variable `ans` is explicitly set to `False`. All other variables (`i`, `m`, `arr[i - 1]`, and `nums`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
