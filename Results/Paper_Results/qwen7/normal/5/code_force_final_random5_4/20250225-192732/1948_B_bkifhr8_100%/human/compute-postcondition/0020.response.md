Output State: **`nums` is a list containing integers derived from the string representation of `arr[i-1]` followed by the element `arr[i]`; `ans` is False.**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is assigned the boolean value `False`. The list `nums` remains unchanged from its initial state, which is defined as containing integers derived from the string representation of `arr[i-1]` followed by the element `arr[i]`.
