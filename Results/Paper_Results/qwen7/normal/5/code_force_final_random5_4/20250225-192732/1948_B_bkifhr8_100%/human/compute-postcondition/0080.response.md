Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `m`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values and Conditions for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The loop runs in reverse order starting from `m-1` down to `1`.
   - The loop will execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `1`.

3. **Initial Values Provided**:
   - `ans` is `True`.
   - `i` is `m - 2`.
   - `m` is an input integer.
   - `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input.
   - `arr[i - 1]` is `nums[0]`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - The initial value of `i` is `m - 2`. For the loop to start, `i` must be at least `1`. Since `i` is `m - 2`, `m` must be at least `3` (because `m - 2 >= 1` implies `m >= 3`).
   - The loop will start executing when `i` is `m - 1` and decrement until `i` reaches `1`.

Given these points, we need to adjust the state such that the loop can start executing.

**State:**
- `ans` is `True`.
- `i` must be `m - 1` to start the loop.
- `m` must be at least `3` to ensure `i` can start from `m - 1` and go down to `1`.

So, the final state should be:

**State: **`ans` is `True`, `i` is `m - 1`, `m` must be at least 3**.
