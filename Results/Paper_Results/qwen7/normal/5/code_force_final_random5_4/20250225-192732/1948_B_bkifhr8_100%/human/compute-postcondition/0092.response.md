Postcondition: `ans` is `False`, `i` is `m - 1`, `m` must be at least 3, and either `arr[i]` is not less than `arr[i - 1]` (in which case `ans` remains `True`), or `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by the updated value of `arr[i - 1]`, and `arr[i - 1]` is now equal to `nums[0]`.
