Output State: **`ans` remains `True`, `i` is `0`, `m` must be greater than `1`, `arr[i - 1]` is `nums[0]`, `nums` is `[nums[0]] + [nums[0]]**.

Explanation: The code `arr[i - 1] = nums[0]` updates `arr[i - 1]` to be equal to `nums[0]`. Given that `i` is `0`, `arr[i - 1]` becomes `arr[-1]`, which is out of bounds for a list that starts from index `0`. However, considering the context and the fact that `arr` was likely intended to be updated at index `0`, we interpret this as updating `arr[0]` to `nums[0]`. Since `nums` is initially `[nums[0]]`, after this operation, `nums` becomes `[nums[0]] + [nums[0]]`, which simplifies to `[nums[0], nums[0]]`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
