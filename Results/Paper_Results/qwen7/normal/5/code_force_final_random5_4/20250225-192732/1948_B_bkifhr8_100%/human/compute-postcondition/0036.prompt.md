Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `m` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `ans` is True.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
    if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
        nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
        if nums != sorted(nums):
            ans = False
            break
        arr[i - 1] = nums[0]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `m` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `ans` is False, `i` is `m - 1`. If `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, then `arr[i - 1]` is updated to `arr[i]` and `ans` remains False. Otherwise, `ans` remains True.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `arr[i - 1]` is now equal to `nums[0]`, where `nums` is a list containing integers derived from the string representation of `arr[i-1]` followed by the element `arr[i]`. If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is False and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `nums` is already sorted, no change occurs to `ans` and the loop or if statement continues as normal.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `arr[i - 1]` is now equal to `nums[0]`, `nums` is a list of integers derived from the string representation of `arr[i - 1]` followed by the element `arr[i]`, `ans` is `False`, `i` is `i - 1`, and `m` remains the same. If `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, `ans` remains `False`; otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged as `False`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
