Postcondition: `arr[i - 1]` is now equal to `nums[0]`, `nums` is a list of integers derived from the string representation of `arr[i - 1]` followed by the element `arr[i]`, `ans` is `False`, `i` is `i - 1`, and `m` remains the same, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `nums` is not sorted.
