Output State: **`ans` is True, `i` is `m - 1`, `m` must be greater than 1, `arr[i - 1]` is `nums[0]`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `nums[0]` followed by `arr[i]`.**

Explanation: The code creates a new list `nums` by converting the string representation of `arr[i - 1]` into a list of integers and appending `arr[i]` to it. Since `arr[i - 1]` is equal to `nums[0]`, the first element of the list `nums` is the same as `arr[i - 1]`. The other variables (`ans`, `i`, `m`) remain unchanged.
