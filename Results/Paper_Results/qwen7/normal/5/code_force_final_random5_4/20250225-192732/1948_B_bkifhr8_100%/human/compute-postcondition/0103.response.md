Output State: **`ans` is `False`, `i` is `m - 4`, `m` must be at least 3, `arr[i - 1]` is `nums[0]`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `nums[0]` followed by `arr[i]`.**

Explanation: The code creates a new list `nums` by converting the string representation of `arr[i - 1]` into a list of integers and appending `arr[i]` to it. Since `arr[i - 1]` is `nums[0]`, the first element of `nums` is the integer form of `nums[0]`. The values of `ans`, `i`, `m`, and the condition on `m` remain unchanged.
