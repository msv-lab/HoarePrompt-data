Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `m` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `ans` is True, `i` is `m - 1`, `nums` is a list containing the integer value of the last element of `arr` before the index `i` and the current value of `arr[i]`.**

Explanation: The code creates a new list `nums` by converting the integer value of `arr[i - 1]` into a list of its digits (using list comprehension) and then appending the integer value of `arr[i]` to this list. Since `arr[i]` is an integer, converting it to a list of digits using `int(i)` would result in a single-element list containing `arr[i]`. Therefore, `nums` contains the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`.
