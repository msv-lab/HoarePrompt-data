Postcondition: `nums` is a list containing integers derived from the string representation of `arr[i-1]` followed by the element `arr[i]`; if `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is False and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `nums` is already sorted, no change occurs to `ans` and the loop or if statement continues as normal.
