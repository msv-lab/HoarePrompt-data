Output State: **`arr[i - 1]` is now equal to `nums[0]`, `nums` is a list of integers derived from the string representation of `arr[i - 1]` followed by the element `arr[i]`, `ans` is `False`, `i` is `i - 1`, and `m` remains the same.**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is explicitly set to `False`. All other variables (`arr[i - 1]`, `nums`, `i`, and `m`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
