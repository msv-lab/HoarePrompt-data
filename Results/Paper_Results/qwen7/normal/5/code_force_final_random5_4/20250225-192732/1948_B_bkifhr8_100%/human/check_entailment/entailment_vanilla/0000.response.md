Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `m` and the array elements.
   
2. **Initialization:**
   - It initializes a boolean variable `ans` to `True`, indicating initially that the array can be sorted.
   - It splits the input array into individual integers and stores them in `arr`.

3. **Checking Sorted Order:**
   - The program iterates over the array from the end to the beginning (i.e., from `m-1` to `1`).
   - For each element, it checks if the current element `arr[i]` is less than the previous element `arr[i-1]`.
   - If `arr[i] < arr[i-1]`, it extracts the digits of `arr[i-1]` and appends `arr[i]` to form a new list `nums`.
   - It then checks if `nums` is sorted. If not, it sets `ans` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.

4. **Final Output:**
   - After processing all elements, it prints "YES" if `ans` is `True`, indicating the array can be sorted.
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Issues with the Given Program

1. **Incorrect Logic for Checking Sorted Order:**
   - The logic for checking if `nums` is sorted is flawed. The program should check if the digits of `arr[i-1]` and `arr[i]` combined in the correct order form a non-decreasing sequence.
   - The current implementation simply checks if the concatenated list of digits is sorted, which does not guarantee that the original numbers can be transformed into a sorted array.

2. **Handling Digits Properly:**
   - The program concatenates the digits of `arr[i-1]` and `arr[i]` but does not ensure that the resulting sequence can be achieved through the allowed operations.
   - For example, if `arr[i-1] = 45` and `arr[i] = 67`, the program would concatenate `[4, 5, 6, 7]` and check if this is sorted, which is true, but this does not mean the original numbers can be transformed into a sorted array.

### Corrected Approach

To correctly solve the problem, we need to ensure that the transformation of digits can lead to a sorted array. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the logic:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        ans = True
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                # Extract digits of arr[i-1] and arr[i]
                digits_i_minus_1 = [int(d) for d in str(arr[i - 1])]
                digits_i = [int(d) for d in str(arr[i])]
                # Check if the combined digits can form a non-decreasing sequence
                if digits_i_minus_1 + digits_i != sorted(digits_i_minus_1 + digits_i):
                    ans = False
                    break
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])
```

### Conclusion

The given program has logical flaws in how it checks if the array can be sorted. Therefore, the provided solution is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
