Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`.**

The code `t = int(input())` assigns the value of the input received from the user to the variable `t`. The initial conditions for `start` and `end` remain unchanged, with the constraint that `start` is less than or equal to `end`.
