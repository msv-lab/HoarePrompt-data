State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `i` is 0**

### Explanation:
- The loop `for i in range(t):` will execute `t` times.
- For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0.
- The variables `start` and `end` are not directly involved in the loop condition but are part of the initial state. They remain unchanged within the loop.
- The variable `i` is initialized to 0 when entering the loop.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `t` is greater than 0, and the other variables retain their initial conditions.
