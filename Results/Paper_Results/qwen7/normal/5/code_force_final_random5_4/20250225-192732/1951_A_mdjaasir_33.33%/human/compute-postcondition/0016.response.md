Based on the initial state provided:

- `count` is the number of '1's in the string `a`.
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `start` is an integer.
- `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`.
- `i` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- Either `a.index('1')` is the last index of '1' in `a`, or there is at least one '1' in `a` and the character following the first '1' is also '1'.

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('NO')
```

This statement does not depend on any of the variables or their values; it directly prints the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
