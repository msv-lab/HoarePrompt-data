You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and s is a string of length n containing only "U" and "D".
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        s = data[index + 1]
        
        index += 2
        
        count_u = s.count('U')
        
        if count_u % 2 == 1:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer equal to `data[0] - 3`, `count_u` is the number of 'U' in the final string `s`, `n` is now `int(data[index + 4])`, `s` is now `data[index + 3]`, and `index` is increased by 6 for each iteration, ending at `index` being increased by 6 * 3 = 18.
    #
    #In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` will be reduced by 3, reflecting the number of times the loop has run. The value of `count_u` will be the total number of 'U' characters in the final string `s` after all iterations. The variable `n` will be set to `int(data[6])` (since `index` starts at 1 and increases by 6 each time), and `s` will be `data[6]`. The variable `index` will be increased by 18 in total, aligning with the pattern of increasing by 6 for each of the 3 iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing multiple test cases where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), and a string s of length n containing only "U" and "D". For each test case, the function returns a specific value based on the string s.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
