Reasoning:
1. The provided program reads multiple test cases from standard input.
2. For each test case, it correctly extracts the number of coins \( n \) and the string \( s \) representing the initial state of the coins.
3. The program then counts the number of 'U' characters in the string \( s \).
4. Based on whether this count is odd or even, the program prints 'YES' or 'NO', respectively.
5. The logic for determining the winner is based on the parity of the number of 'U' coins, which aligns with the problem statement. Specifically, if the number of 'U' coins is odd, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins.
6. The execution summary indicates that the program processes each test case correctly and prints the appropriate result based on the count of 'U' coins.
7. There is no indication in the provided code that suggests any logical errors or discrepancies with the problem statement.

Given the above points, the provided program appears to be correct according to the problem description and the execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
