### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: 
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - This approach allows handling multiple test cases efficiently without needing to read input line by line.

2. **Loop Through Test Cases**:
   - The loop correctly iterates over each test case, extracting the necessary values (`n` and `s`) for processing.

3. **Counting Facing-Up Coins**:
   - The program counts the number of 'U' characters in the string `s` using `count('U')`.
   - This count is used to determine the winner based on the parity (odd or even) of the count.

4. **Winning Condition**:
   - If the count of 'U' is odd, the program prints 'YES', indicating Alice wins.
   - If the count of 'U' is even, the program prints 'NO', indicating Bob wins.

5. **Optimal Play**:
   - The problem states that if both players play optimally, the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will win.
   - The logic in the program correctly identifies the winner based on the initial configuration of coins, which aligns with the optimal play condition.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as when there are no 'U' coins (which results in an even count), correctly identifying that Bob wins.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the initial configuration of coins. It handles multiple test cases efficiently and outputs the correct result for each case.

### Correctness:

**True**
