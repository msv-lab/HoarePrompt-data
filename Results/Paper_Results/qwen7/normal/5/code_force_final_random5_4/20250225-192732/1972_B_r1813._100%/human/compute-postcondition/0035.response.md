Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases from standard input. Each test case consists of a positive integer \( t \) indicating the number of cases to process, followed by a positive integer \( n \) and a string \( s \) of length \( n \) containing only "U" and "D". For each test case, the function counts the number of 'U' characters in the string \( s \). If the count of 'U' characters is odd, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function implicitly reduces the value of \( t \) by 3, reflecting the number of test cases processed.**
