Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `s` is a string of length n containing only "U" and "D", `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.**

Explanation: The code `data = input().split()` reads a line of input from the standard input and splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and the variable `s` remains unchanged as well. The new variable `data` is created and assigned the list of strings resulting from the split operation.
