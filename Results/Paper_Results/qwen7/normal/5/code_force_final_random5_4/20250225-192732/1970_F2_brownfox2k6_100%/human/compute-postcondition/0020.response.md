Based on the initial state provided:

- `out` is a non-empty list.
- `p` is the first element of `out`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(t, p, 'ELIMINATED')
```

Since `t` is not defined in the initial state, it cannot be determined what its value is. Therefore, `t` will remain as `t` in the output.

Given that `p` is the first element of the list `out`, the value of `p` will be the first element of the list `out`.

Thus, the output will be:
Output: **t, [first element of out], 'ELIMINATED'**
