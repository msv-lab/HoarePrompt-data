Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The list `out` contains all player identifiers `p` for which `player[p]` was equal to `blud` at any point during the loop's execution. The variable `t` remains an integer. The dictionary `player` no longer contains any keys whose value was `blud` before being set to `[-1, -1]`.
Code of the loop:
for p in sorted(out):
    print(t, p, 'ELIMINATED')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `out` must be a non-empty list, `p` is the first element of `out`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `out` must be a non-empty list with the first element being the second element of the original `out`, and `p` is the first element of the updated `out`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `out` must be a non-empty list with the first element being the third element of the original `out`, and `p` is the second smallest element in the updated `out`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
