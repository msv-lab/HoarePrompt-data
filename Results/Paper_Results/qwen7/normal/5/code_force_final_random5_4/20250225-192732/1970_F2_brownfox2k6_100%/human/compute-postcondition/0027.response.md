Functionality: **The function processes a game scenario at a given time step `t`. It identifies players whose positions match the current positions of the Bludgers, marks them as eliminated by setting their positions to `[-1, -1]`, and prints a message for each eliminated player indicating the time step and player identifier. After processing, the function ensures that no players remain in the `player` dictionary with positions matching the Bludgers.**
