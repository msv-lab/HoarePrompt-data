Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `out` is an empty list, `t` is an integer representing the current time step in the game, `player` is a dictionary mapping player identifiers (e.g., 'R0', 'B0') to their current positions (a list of two integers [x, y]), `blud` is a list of positions (a list of two integers [x, y]) representing the current positions of the Bludgers on the field.
Code of the loop:
for p in player:
    if player[p] == blud:
        out.append(p)
        player[p] = [-1, -1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `out` is an empty list, `t` is an integer, `player` must have at least one key, and if `player[p]` equals `blud`, then `out` is updated to contain the element `p`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `out` is either an empty list or contains the element 'p', `t` is an integer, `player` must have at least one key, and `player[p]` is now `[-1, -1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `out` is a list containing the element 'p', `t` is an integer, and `player` does not contain the key `p` anymore. If `player[p]` equals `blud`, then `out` remains unchanged and `player[p]` is updated to `blud`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
