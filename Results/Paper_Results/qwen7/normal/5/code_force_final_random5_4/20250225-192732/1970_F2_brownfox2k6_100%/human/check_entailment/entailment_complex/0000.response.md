Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly updates the position of an object (player or ball) based on the direction of movement. It handles all possible directions ('U', 'D', 'L', 'R') and updates the coordinates accordingly. The function does not have any logic errors and maintains the state correctly.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function correctly identifies players who are in the same position as a Bludger and marks them as eliminated. It iterates through the players, checks if their current position matches the Bludger's position, and if so, updates their position to `[-1, -1]` and prints an elimination message. The function also sorts the players alphabetically before printing, which is consistent with the problem statement.

3. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main program correctly initializes the field and reads the initial state of players, goals, and the Quaffle.
   - It reads the number of steps and processes each step according to the given instructions.
   - The program correctly handles catching and throwing the Quaffle.
   - The program correctly updates the score when a player successfully scores a goal.
   - The program correctly identifies and prints player eliminations due to Bludger contact.
   - The final score is printed correctly after all steps are processed.

Given that all parts of the program correctly follow the problem description and handle all necessary actions and states as required, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
