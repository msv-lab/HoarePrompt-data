The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `t`, which is an integer representing the current time step in the game. It also accepts a parameter `player`, which is a dictionary mapping player identifiers (e.g., 'R0', 'B0') to their current positions (a list of two integers [x, y]). Additionally, it accepts a parameter `blud`, which is a list of positions (a list of two integers [x, y]) representing the current positions of the Bludgers on the field.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the current time step in the game, a dictionary `player` mapping player identifiers to their current positions, and a list `blud` of Bludger positions. Based on these inputs, the function determines the state or behavior related to the game at time step `t`, involving players and Bludgers.**
