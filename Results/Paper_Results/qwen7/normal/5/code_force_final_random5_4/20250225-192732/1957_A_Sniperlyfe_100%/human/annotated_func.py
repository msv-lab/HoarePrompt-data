#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where the first element is the number of sticks available (n), and the subsequent elements are the lengths of the sticks (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n). Each stick length is a positive integer not exceeding 100, and the number of sticks (n) is a positive integer not exceeding 100.
def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
        
    #State: Output State: The final output state after the loop executes all its iterations is a dictionary `freq` where each key is an integer from the list `arr` (excluding the first element which represents the count of sticks), and the corresponding value for each key is the total count of occurrences of that integer in `arr`.
    #
    #In more detail, if `arr` contains integers like `[5, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]`, then `freq` will be `{2: 2, 3: 3}` because `2` appears twice and `3` appears three times in the list. The first element `5` is not included as a key in `freq` since it was the count of how many sticks there were initially, not one of the stick lengths.
    return sum(v // 3 for v in freq.values())
    #The program returns the sum of the integer division of each value in the dictionary `freq` by 3.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers where the first element is the number of sticks available, and the subsequent elements are the lengths of those sticks. It calculates the frequency of each stick length (excluding the first element) and stores these frequencies in a dictionary. Finally, it returns the sum of the integer division of each frequency by 3.
