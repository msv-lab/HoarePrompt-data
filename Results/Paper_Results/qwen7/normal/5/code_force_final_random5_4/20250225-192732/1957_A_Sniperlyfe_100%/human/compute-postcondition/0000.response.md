Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where the first element is the number of sticks available (n), and the subsequent elements are the lengths of the sticks (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n); `freq` is an empty dictionary.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty dictionary named `freq`. This dictionary will be used to store the frequency of each stick length, but since no values are added to it in this snippet, it remains empty. The list `arr` is unchanged from its initial state.
