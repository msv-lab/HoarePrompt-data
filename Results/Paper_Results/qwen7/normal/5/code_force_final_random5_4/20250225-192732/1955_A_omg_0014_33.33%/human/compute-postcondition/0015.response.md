Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This means `t` can take any integer value within this range, but its specific value is not needed to determine the output of the print statement.
- `i` is 1.
- `n` must be greater than 0, but its value is not needed for the current print statement.
- `a` and `b` are integers from the input. Their specific values are required to determine the output of the print statement.
- `d` is equal to `c / 2`, where `c` is an integer from the input. Again, the specific value of `c` is not needed for the current print statement.

The print statement `print(a * b)` will output the product of `a` and `b`.

Output: **a * b (where a and b are integers from the input)**
