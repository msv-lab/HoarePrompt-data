Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This means `t` can take any integer value between 1 and 10,000 inclusive.
- `i` is 2.
- `n` must be greater than 0. This means `n` is a positive integer.
- `a` is an integer from the input.
- `b` is an integer from the input.
- `c` is an integer from the input.
- `d` is equal to `c / 2`.

The expression to be evaluated and printed is `round(a * d)`. Given that `d = c / 2`, we substitute `d` into the expression to get `round(a * (c / 2))`.

Since the exact values of `a` and `c` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact numerical result. However, we know that the expression will evaluate to the nearest integer of `a * (c / 2)`.

Therefore, the output will be the rounded value of `a * (c / 2)`.

Output: **round(a * (c / 2))**
