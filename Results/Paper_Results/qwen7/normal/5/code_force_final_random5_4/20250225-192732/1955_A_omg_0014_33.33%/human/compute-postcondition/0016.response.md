Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is 1.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `a` is an integer from the input.
- `b` is an integer from the input.
- `c` is an integer from the input.
- `d` is equal to `c / 2`.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(round(a * d))
```

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. `d` is defined as `c / 2`, so `d` is half of `c`.
2. The expression `a * d` simplifies to `a * (c / 2)`, which is equivalent to `(a * c) / 2`.
3. The `round` function is applied to the result of `(a * c) / 2`, which rounds the floating-point number to the nearest integer.

Since the values of `a` and `c` are not explicitly given, we can only describe the computation in terms of these variables.

Output: **round((a * c) / 2)**
