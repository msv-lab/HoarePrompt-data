Reasoning:
1. The program is designed to process multiple test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads three integers: `n`, `a`, and `b`.
3. It then calculates whether it's cheaper to buy the yogurts at the regular price (`a * b`) or at the promotional price (`a * d` where `d = c / 2`). However, the variable `c` is not defined in the code, which suggests a potential error.
4. The code uses `c` instead of `b` to calculate the promotional price, which is incorrect based on the problem statement. The correct promotional price should be `b` (the price for two yogurts).
5. The program should compare `a * b` with `2 * b` (since `b` is the price for two yogurts) to decide the minimum cost.
6. The `round` function is unnecessary here since we are comparing prices and not dealing with fractional values.

Given these points, the program is incorrect because it uses an undefined variable `c` instead of `b` and does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum cost.

Correctness: **False**
