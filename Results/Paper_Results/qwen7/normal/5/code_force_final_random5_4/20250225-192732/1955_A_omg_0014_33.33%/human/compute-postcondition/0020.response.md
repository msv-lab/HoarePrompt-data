Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, `c` is an integer from the input, `d` is equal to `c / 2`.**

Explanation: The code `d = c / 2` assigns the value of `c / 2` to `d`. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged from their initial states.
