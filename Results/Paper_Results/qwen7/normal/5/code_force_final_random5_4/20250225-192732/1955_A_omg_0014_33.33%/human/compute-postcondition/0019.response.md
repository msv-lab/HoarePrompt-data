Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, `c` is an integer from the input, `d` is equal to `c / 2`, `a` is assigned the first integer from the input, `b` is assigned the second integer from the input, `c` is assigned the third integer from the input.**

Explanation: The code `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` takes three integers as input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` respectively. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, and `d`) remain unchanged.
