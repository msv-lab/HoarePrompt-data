Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces for each iteration, `d` is equal to `c / 2` for each iteration, and the program prints either `a * b` or `round(a * d)` based on the if condition for each iteration.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` remains within the range of 1 to 10^4, `i` will be equal to the value of `n` (since `i` increments by 1 in each iteration of the loop until it reaches `n`), `n` itself remains as the input integer provided before the loop started, and for each iteration, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are taken from the input, `d` is calculated as `c / 2`, and the program prints either `a * b` or `round(a * d)` depending on whether `a * b` is less than `a * d` or not.
