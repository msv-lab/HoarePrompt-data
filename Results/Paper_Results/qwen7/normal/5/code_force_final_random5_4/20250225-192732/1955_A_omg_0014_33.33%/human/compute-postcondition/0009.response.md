Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is 0.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces.
- `d` is equal to `c / 2`.
- `a * b` is greater than or equal to `a * d`.

We need to determine the value of `round(a * d)`.

Given that `d = c / 2`, we substitute this into the expression `a * d`:

\[ a * d = a * \left(\frac{c}{2}\right) = \frac{a * c}{2} \]

Since `a * b` is greater than or equal to `a * d`, we have:

\[ a * b \geq \frac{a * c}{2} \]

This inequality holds true because `b` is another integer obtained from the input, and it must satisfy the condition relative to `c`.

When we round \(\frac{a * c}{2}\), the result will be the nearest integer to \(\frac{a * c}{2}\).

Therefore, the output will be the rounded value of \(\frac{a * c}{2}\).

Output: **round(a * c / 2)**
