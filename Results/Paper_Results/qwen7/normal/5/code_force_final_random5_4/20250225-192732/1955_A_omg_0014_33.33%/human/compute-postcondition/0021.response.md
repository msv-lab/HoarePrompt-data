Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is 2.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `a` is an integer from the input.
- `b` is an integer from the input.
- `c` is an integer from the input.
- `d` is equal to `c / 2`.

The `print(a * b)` statement will print the product of `a` and `b`.

Since the values of `a` and `b` are explicitly stated to be integers from the input, we cannot determine their exact values without additional information. Therefore, the output will be the product of these two integers.

Output: **[a] * [b] (where [a] and [b] are integers from the input)**
