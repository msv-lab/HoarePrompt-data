Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer input by the user, `arr` is the string input by the user, `results` is a list with either 'yes' or 'no' appended, and `i` is `i + 1`.**

The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the user's input (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. The other variables (`t`, `arr`, `results`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
