Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- **State at the end of the previous iteration:**
  - `results` is a list of strings that contains 'yes' or 'no' for each iteration.
  - `t` is the length of `results`.
  - `i` is `t-1`.

- **For Loop Statement:**
  ```python
  for i in results:
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables:**
   - The loop iterates over each element in the `results` list.
   - The variable `i` takes on each value from the `results` list during each iteration.

2. **Current State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `t-1`, meaning it has just finished iterating over the last element of the `results` list.

3. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be the next element in the `results` list.
   - Since `i` is currently `t-1`, the next value of `i` would be the first element of the `results` list (index 0).

### Adjusting the States:
- **`results`:** No change needed as it remains the same list.
- **`t`:** No change needed as it remains the same length.
- **`i`:** It needs to be set to the first element of the `results` list, which is `results[0]`.

### Final State:
- `results` is a list of strings that contains 'yes' or 'no' for each iteration.
- `t` is the length of `results`.
- `i` is the first element of the `results` list (`results[0]`).

**State:**
**`results` is a list of strings that contains 'yes' or 'no' for each iteration, `t` is the length of `results`, and `i` is the first element of the `results` list (`results[0]`)**.
