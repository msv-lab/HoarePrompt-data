Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer input by the user, `arr` is the new string input by the user, `results` is a list with either 'yes' or 'no' appended, `i` is `i + 1`. If the count of 'U' in `arr` is odd, then 'yes' is appended to `results`; otherwise, 'no' is appended to `results`.
