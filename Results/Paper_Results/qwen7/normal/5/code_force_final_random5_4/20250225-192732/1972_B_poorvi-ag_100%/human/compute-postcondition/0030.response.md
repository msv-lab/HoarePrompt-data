Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in results:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `results`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in the `results` list. Since `i` is iterating over the elements of `results`, the loop will stop when `i` has gone through all elements of `results`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `results` is a list of strings that contains 'yes' or 'no' for each iteration.
   - `t` is the length of `results`.
   - `i` is `t-1`, meaning `i` is currently pointing to the last element in the `results` list.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must point to the second-to-last element in the `results` list (since `i` starts from the last element and decrements).
   - Therefore, `i` should be `t-2`.
   - The length of the `results` list, `t`, remains the same.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `results` remains the same.
   - `i` changes from `t-1` to `t-2`.
   - `t` remains unchanged.

So, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `results` is a list of strings that contains 'yes' or 'no' for each iteration, `t` is the length of `results`, and `i` is `t-2`**
