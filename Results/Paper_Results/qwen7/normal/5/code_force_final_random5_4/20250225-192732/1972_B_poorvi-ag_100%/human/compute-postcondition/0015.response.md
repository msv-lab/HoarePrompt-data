Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer input by the user, `arr` is the string input by the user, `results` is a list with one additional element 'yes', `i` is `i + 1`.**

The code `results.append('yes')` adds the string `'yes'` to the list `results`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 0 and `i` is `i + 1` (implying `i` has been incremented) are still valid.
