#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and s is a string of length n containing only "U" and "D" representing the initial state of the coins.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        arr = input()
        
        if arr.count('U') % 2 == 1:
            results.append('yes')
        else:
            results.append('no')
        
    #State: Output State: The final output state will be a list named `results` that contains either 'yes' or 'no' for each iteration of the loop from 0 to `t-1`. For each iteration, if the count of 'U' in the string `arr` is odd, 'yes' is appended to `results`; otherwise, 'no' is appended. The variable `t` will be set to 0 after all iterations, as it is decremented by one in each iteration until it reaches 0. The variable `i` will be equal to `t-1` after all iterations since `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, `results` will contain 'yes' or 'no' based on whether the count of 'U' in each input string `arr` is odd or even, for a total of `t` such evaluations. The variable `t` will be 0, and `i` will be `t-1`, which means `i` will also be 0.
    for i in results:
        print(i)
        
    #State: The final output state will be a list named `results` that contains 'yes' or 'no' for each iteration from 0 to `t-1`. After all iterations, `t` will be 0, and `i` will also be 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), and a string `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D". For each test case, it determines whether the count of 'U' in the string `s` is odd or even and appends 'yes' or 'no' to a list `results`. After processing all test cases, it prints each element of `results`. The final state of the program is that `t` is 0, `i` is 0, and `results` contains 'yes' or 'no' for each test case based on the count of 'U' in the corresponding string `s`.
