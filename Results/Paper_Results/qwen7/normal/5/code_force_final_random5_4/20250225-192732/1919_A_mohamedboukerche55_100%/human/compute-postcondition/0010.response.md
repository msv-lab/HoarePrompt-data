Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `a` is the first integer from the input string `s`.
- `b` is the second integer from the input string `s`.
- `i` is 0.
- \((a + b) \% 2 \neq 0\), meaning the sum of `a` and `b` is odd.

The print statement is:

```python
print('Alice')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'Alice'`.

Output: **Alice**
