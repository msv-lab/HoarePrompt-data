Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` remains the same or is greater than 1.
- `i` is 2.
- `a` is the first integer in the input string `s`.
- `b` is the second integer in the input string `s`.
- The sum of `a` and `b` is even if `(a + b) % 2 == 0` is true; otherwise, it is odd.
- `s` is the input string from the user.
- `b` is now the second integer from the string `s`.

The `print('Alice')` statement will print the string "Alice".

Output: **Alice**
