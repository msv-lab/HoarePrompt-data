Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` is the first integer from the input string `s`, `b` is the second integer from the input string `s`, `i` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `b = int(list(s.split())[1])` splits the input string `s` into a list of substrings using spaces as delimiters, converts the second element of the resulting list to an integer, and assigns it to `b`. The first integer from the input string `s` is stored in `a`, and `i` remains unchanged at 0. The value of `t` is not affected by this operation.
