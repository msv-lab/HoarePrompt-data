Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for determining the winner based on the game rules. According to the problem statement, the key factor in determining the winner is whether the sum of the coins in both wallets is even or odd, not just the parity of the individual counts of coins. Specifically, the game's outcome depends on the sum \(a + b\):

- If \(a + b\) is even, Bob wins because he can always mirror Alice's moves, ensuring that he is the last one to make a move.
- If \(a + b\) is odd, Alice wins because she can force Bob into a losing position by always making a move that leaves the sum even after her turn.

However, the provided program incorrectly splits the input string and converts the parts back to integers, which is unnecessary and introduces potential errors. It should simply read the two integers directly and check the parity of their sum.

Given the correct logic and the provided execution summary, the program does not match the expected behavior. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
