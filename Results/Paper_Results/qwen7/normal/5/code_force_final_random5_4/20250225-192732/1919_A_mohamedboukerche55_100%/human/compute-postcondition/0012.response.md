Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` is the first integer from the input string `s`, `b` is the second integer from the input string `s`, `i` is 0, and the sum of `a` and `b` is even if the condition `(a + b) % 2 == 0` is true. Otherwise, the sum of `a` and `b` is odd.
