### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining the winner of a game between Alice and Bob based on the number of coins they have in their wallets. The game involves taking turns, where each player can either swap wallets or remove one coin from their own wallet. The player who cannot make a valid move loses.

2. **Key Insight**: The key insight here is that the game can be analyzed using the parity (odd or even nature) of the sum of the coins in both wallets. Specifically, if the sum of the coins in both wallets is even, Bob will always win; otherwise, Alice will win. This is because:
   - When the sum is even, the player whose turn it is can always force the sum to become odd by removing a coin.
   - Conversely, when the sum is odd, the player whose turn it is will always leave the sum even after their move, forcing the opponent to face an even sum next.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s` which contains the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets separated by a space.
   - It splits the string `s` into two parts and converts them to integers `a` and `b`.
   - It checks if the sum `(a + b)` is even or odd.
   - If the sum is even, it prints 'Bob'; otherwise, it prints 'Alice'.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in the program correctly identifies whether the sum of the coins is even or odd.
   - However, the program does not accurately simulate the game mechanics. The program assumes that the player whose turn it is can always force the sum to be odd or even, but this is not necessarily true in the context of the actual game rules. The program does not account for the fact that the player can choose to swap wallets, which changes the state of the game.
   - For example, consider the test case `1 1`. According to the game rules, Alice cannot make a valid move after her first turn, and Bob wins. However, the program incorrectly prints 'Bob' because the sum is even.
   - Similarly, for the test case `1 4`, Alice can swap wallets and then Bob cannot make a valid move, so Alice wins. But the program incorrectly prints 'Alice' because the sum is odd.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the winner based on the actual game rules. It only checks the parity of the sum of the coins, which is not sufficient to determine the winner in all cases.

**Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
