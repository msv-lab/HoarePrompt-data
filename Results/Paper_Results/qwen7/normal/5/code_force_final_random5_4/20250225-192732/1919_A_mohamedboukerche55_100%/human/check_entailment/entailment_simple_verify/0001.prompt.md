You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        a = int(list(s.split())[0])
        b = int(list(s.split())[1])
        if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, a and b are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        
        a = int(list(s.split())[0])
        
        b = int(list(s.split())[1])
        
        if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `t` remains the same or is greater than 1, `i` is now `t-1`, `a` and `b` are the first and second integers from the last input string `s`, the sum of `a` and `b` remains even if `(a + b) % 2 == 0` is true. Otherwise, the sum of `a` and `b` is odd, `s` is the input string from the user, and no further changes occur to `a` and `b` during the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining the winner of a game between Alice and Bob based on the number of coins they have in their wallets. The game involves taking turns, where each player can either swap wallets or remove one coin from their own wallet. The player who cannot make a valid move loses.

2. **Key Insight**: The key insight here is that the game can be analyzed using the parity (odd or even nature) of the sum of the coins in both wallets. Specifically, if the sum of the coins in both wallets is even, Bob will always win; otherwise, Alice will win. This is because:
   - When the sum is even, the player whose turn it is can always force the sum to become odd by removing a coin.
   - Conversely, when the sum is odd, the player whose turn it is will always leave the sum even after their move, forcing the opponent to face an even sum next.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s` which contains the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets separated by a space.
   - It splits the string `s` into two parts and converts them to integers `a` and `b`.
   - It checks if the sum `(a + b)` is even or odd.
   - If the sum is even, it prints 'Bob'; otherwise, it prints 'Alice'.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in the program correctly identifies whether the sum of the coins is even or odd.
   - Based on the parity of the sum, the program correctly determines the winner according to the game rules.
   - The program handles multiple test cases as expected.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the sum of the coins in both wallets. Therefore, the program is correct.
