You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where the length of the list is n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), and each element a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= n.
def func_1(arr):
    i = 0
    n = len(arr)
    j = len(arr) - 1
    while i < len(arr) - 1 and arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:
        i += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is the length of `arr`; `j` is the length of `arr` - 1; all consecutive elements in `arr` from index 0 to `i-1` must be equal.
    #
    #This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be equal to the length of `arr`, indicating that the loop has processed all elements in `arr` as long as they were consecutive duplicates. The variable `j` remains unchanged at the length of `arr` - 1, and all elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[i-1]` (which is effectively all elements in `arr`) must be identical.
    while j > 0 and arr[j] == arr[j - 1]:
        j -= 1
        
    #State: The value of `i` is the length of `arr`, `j` is 0, and all elements in `arr` are identical.
    if (arr[0] == arr[-1]) :
        return max(j - i - 1, 0)
        #The program returns the maximum value between 0 and the difference between j and i minus 1, given that j is 0 and i is the length of arr.
    #State: The value of `i` is the length of `arr`, `j` is 0, and not all elements in `arr` are identical
    return max(min(n - i - 1, j), 0)
    #The program returns the maximum value between the minimum of (the length of `arr` minus `i` minus 1) and `j`, and 0.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers. It returns the maximum value between 0 and the difference between j and i minus 1 when j is 0 and i is the length of `arr`. Otherwise, it returns the maximum value between the minimum of (the length of `arr` minus `i` minus 1) and `j`, and 0.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the maximum value between 0 and the difference between j and i minus 1, given that j is 0 and i is the length of arr.

Case_2: The program returns the maximum value between the minimum of (the length of `arr` minus `i` minus 1) and `j`, and 0.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
