Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not account for the possibility of making all elements equal by using the allowed operation (changing a subarray to a single value). Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Logic in `func_1`:**
   - The function tries to find the first and last unique elements in the array but does not consider the possibility of changing a subarray to a single value.
   - The logic in `func_1` only checks for adjacent equal elements and calculates the cost based on those checks, which is insufficient.

2. **Missing Key Steps:**
   - The solution should identify the minimum cost to make all elements equal by finding the optimal position to apply the operation.
   - The function should iterate through the array to find the minimum cost to make all elements equal to the most frequent element or any other chosen element.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, you would need to:
- Identify the most frequent element in the array.
- Calculate the cost of changing all elements to this most frequent element using the allowed operation.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import Counter

t = int(input())
while t:
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    
    # Count the frequency of each element
    freq = Counter(arr)
    
    # Find the most frequent element
    most_common_element = freq.most_common(1)[0][0]
    
    # Calculate the minimum cost to make all elements equal to the most frequent element
    min_cost = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] != most_common_element:
            min_cost += 1
    
    print(min_cost)
    t -= 1
```

This approach correctly identifies the most frequent element and calculates the minimum cost to change all elements to this value.
