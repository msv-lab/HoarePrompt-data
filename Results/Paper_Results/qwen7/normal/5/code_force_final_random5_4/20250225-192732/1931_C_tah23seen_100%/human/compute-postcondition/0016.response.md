Output State: **`j` is decreased by 1, and to ensure the loop continues, `j_new` must be greater than 0 and `arr[j_new]` must be equal to `arr[j_new - 1]'**

Explanation: The value of `j` is decreased by 1. For the loop condition to continue, `j_new` must still be greater than 1 and `arr[j_new]` must still be equal to `arr[j_new - 1]`. Since `j` was previously `j_new - 1`, after decrementing `j` by 1, `j_new` should now be `j + 1`. Therefore, `j_new` must be greater than 0 (which means the original `j_new` was at least 2) and the condition `arr[j_new] == arr[j_new - 1]` still holds true.
