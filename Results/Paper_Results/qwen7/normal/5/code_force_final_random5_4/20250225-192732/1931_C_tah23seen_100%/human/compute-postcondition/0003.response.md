Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `i < len(arr) - 1 and arr[i] == arr[i + 1]`.
2. **Analyze the variables in the loop head**: The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `arr`.
3. **Determine the current state of the variables**:
   - `i` is currently 0.
   - `j` is the length of `arr` - 1.
4. **Check the loop condition with the current state**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, both conditions in the loop head must be true.
   - The first condition `i < len(arr) - 1` is already satisfied because `i` is 0 and `len(arr) - 1` is `j`.
   - The second condition `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]` needs to be checked.

Given that `i` is 0, the condition `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]` becomes `arr[0] == arr[1]`. For the loop to execute the first time, `arr[0]` must be equal to `arr[1]`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `arr[0]` is equal to `arr[1]`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 0; `j` is the length of `arr` - 1 and `arr[0]` must be equal to `arr[1]`**
