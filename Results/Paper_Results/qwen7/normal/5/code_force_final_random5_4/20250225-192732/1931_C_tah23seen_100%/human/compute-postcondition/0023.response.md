Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns a non-negative integer. It first checks if all elements in `arr` are identical by verifying that `arr[0]` equals `arr[-1]`. If true, it calculates and returns the maximum value between 0 and the difference between `j` and `i` minus one, where `i` is the length of `arr` and `j` is initially the last index of `arr`. If false, it returns the maximum value between the minimum of (the length of `arr` minus `i` minus 1) and `j`, and 0.**
