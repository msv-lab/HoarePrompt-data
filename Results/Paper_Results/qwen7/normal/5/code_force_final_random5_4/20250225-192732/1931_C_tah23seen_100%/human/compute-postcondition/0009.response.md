Output State: `i` is the length of `arr`; `j` is the length of `arr` - 1; all consecutive elements in `arr` from index 0 to `i-1` must be equal.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be equal to the length of `arr`, indicating that the loop has processed all elements in the array, and all elements from index 0 to `i-1` (which is the entire array) are identical. The variable `j` remains as the length of `arr` minus one, and no other changes occur to the other variables or the array itself since they are not affected by the loop.
