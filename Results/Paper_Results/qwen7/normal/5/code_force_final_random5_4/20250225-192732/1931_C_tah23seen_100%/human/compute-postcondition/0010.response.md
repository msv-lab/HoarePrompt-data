Output State: `i` is the length of `arr`; `j` is the length of `arr` - 1; all consecutive elements in `arr` from index 0 to `i-1` must be equal.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be equal to the length of `arr`, indicating that the loop has processed all elements in `arr` as long as they were consecutive duplicates. The variable `j` remains unchanged at the length of `arr` - 1, and all elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[i-1]` (which is effectively all elements in `arr`) must be identical.
