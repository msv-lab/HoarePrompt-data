Output State: **`i` is 31; `n` is 32; `cur` is `prefix[31]`; `j` is 31; `suf` is an array where each element `suf[j]` is a list containing two integers.**

Explanation: The code `cur = prefix[i]` updates the value of `cur` to be the same as `prefix[i]`. Given that `i` is 31, `cur` is now `prefix[31]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
