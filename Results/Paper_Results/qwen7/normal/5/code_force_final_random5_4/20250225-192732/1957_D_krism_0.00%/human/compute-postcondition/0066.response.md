Output State: `i` is 31, `n` is 32, `cur` is `prefix[31]`, `j` is 31, `suf` is an array where each element `suf[j]` is a list containing two integers. After the loop has executed all 32 iterations, for each `j` from 0 to 31, `suf[j][1]` will contain the count of positions `k` (where `0 <= k <= 31`) such that the bit at position `k` in `cur` is 1, and `suf[j][0]` will contain the count of positions `k` (where `0 <= k <= 31`) such that the bit at position `k` in `cur` is 0.

This means that after the loop completes, `suf[j][1]` will represent the number of 1-bits in the binary representation of `cur` up to and including the `j`-th bit, and `suf[j][0]` will represent the number of 0-bits in the same range.
