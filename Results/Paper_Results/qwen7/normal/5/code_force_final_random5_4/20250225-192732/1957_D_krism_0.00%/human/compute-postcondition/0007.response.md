Output State: **`prefix` is a list containing the integer 0, another integer which is the result of `v ^ prefix[-1]`, and an additional element which is the result of `v ^ prefix[-1]`; `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer, and `arr` must have at least one element.**

In this output state, the `prefix` list has been updated by appending a new element, which is the result of `v` XORed with the last element of the `prefix` list. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
