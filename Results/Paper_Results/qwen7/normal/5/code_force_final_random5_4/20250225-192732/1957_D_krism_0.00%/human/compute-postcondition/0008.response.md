Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for v in arr:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `v` and `arr`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements left in the list `arr`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `prefix` is a list containing the integer 0, another integer which is the result of `v ^ prefix[-1]`, and an additional element which is the result of `v ^ prefix[-1]`.
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
   - `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer, and `arr` must have at least one element.

4. **Adjusting the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `arr`, at the end of the previous iteration, `arr` should have at least one element left.
   - The variable `v` will be the next element in `arr` for the next iteration.

Given that `arr` must have at least one element left for the loop to continue, and `v` will be the next element in `arr`, we need to ensure that `arr` has at least one element left.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `prefix` remains unchanged.
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `arr` must have at least one element left.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`prefix` is a list containing the integer 0, another integer which is the result of `v ^ prefix[-1]`, and an additional element which is the result of `v ^ prefix[-1]`; `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer, and `arr` must have at least one element.**
