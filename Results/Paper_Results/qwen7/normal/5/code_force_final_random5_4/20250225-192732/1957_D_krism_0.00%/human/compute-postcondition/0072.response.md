Output State: **`i` is 30, `j` is less than 32, and the value of `suf[j][1]` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code increments the value at `suf[j][1]` by 1. Since the initial condition states that `j` must be less than 32 and `(cur >> j & 1)` evaluates to true, `j` remains unchanged but its corresponding value in `suf[j][1]` is incremented. The values of `i` and the condition on `j` remain the same.
