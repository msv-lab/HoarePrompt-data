Output State: **`c` is an integer, `j` is an integer, `pre[j][0]` is 1, and the result of `(c >> j) & 1` is 0**

Explanation: The code `pre[j][0] += 1` increments the value at `pre[j][0]` by 1. Since no initial value for `pre` is given, we assume `pre[j][0]` was initially 0 (as implied by the condition `(c >> j) & 1` being 0). After the increment, `pre[j][0]` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged, and the condition `(c >> j) & 1` remains 0.
