Output State: **`j` is 0; `n` is 32; `y` is `arr[0]`; `k` is 5; `ans` is `pre[5][0] * suf[5][1] + pre[5][1] * suf[5][1]`; `c` is `prefix[1]` with the least significant bit at position `j` being 1; `suf[0][1]` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `suf[j][1] -= 1` decreases the value of `suf[j][1]` by 1. Given that `j` is 0, the specific variable affected is `suf[0][1]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
