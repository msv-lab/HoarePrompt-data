Output State: **`j` is 31, `n` is 32, `y` is `arr[31]`, `k` is 5, `ans` is `pre[5][0] * suf[5][1] + pre[5][1] * suf[5][1]`, `c` is `prefix[1]`, `i` is 32**

Explanation: The code `y = arr[i - 1]` updates the value of `y` to be the element at index `i - 1` in the array `arr`. Given that `i` is 32, `i - 1` is 31. Therefore, `y` is now `arr[31]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
