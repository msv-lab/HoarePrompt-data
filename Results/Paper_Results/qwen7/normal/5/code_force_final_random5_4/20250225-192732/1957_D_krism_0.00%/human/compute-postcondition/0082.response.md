Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 30
   - `j` is 0
   - The postcondition states that if the bit at position `j` of `cur` is 1, then `suf[j][1]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `suf[j][0]` is set to 1.

2. **Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to 31 (inclusive).

3. **Adjusting the State:**
   - The only variable in the loop head is `j`.
   - After the previous iteration, `j` was 0.
   - For the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` will become 1.

4. **Postcondition Analysis:**
   - The postcondition depends on the value of `cur` at bit position `j`.
   - Since `j` is now 1, we need to check the bit at position 1 of `cur`.
   - Depending on the value of this bit, either `suf[1][1]` will be incremented or `suf[1][0]` will be set to 1.

5. **Final State:**
   - `i` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `j` is incremented to 1.
   - The postcondition for `j = 1` needs to be considered, but since no specific values are given for `cur` and `suf`, we only update `j`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 30, `j` is 1**
