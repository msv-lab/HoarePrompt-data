Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in the given for loop is `i`.

2. **Determine the initial state before the loop starts**: The state at the end of the previous iteration is given as `i` is 32.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 0 to 31 (inclusive). This means the loop will run 32 times, starting from `i = 0` and ending at `i = 31`.

4. **Check the current value of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 32. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be within the range of 0 to 31.

5. **Adjust the state**: Since `i` is currently 32, it is outside the range of the loop. To allow the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be set to 0.

6. **Consider other variables**: The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and no other variables are mentioned or modified within the loop body. Therefore, no other variables need adjustment.

Based on this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 0**
