Output State: **`c` is an integer, `j` is an integer, `pre[j][0]` is 1, and `suf[j][0]` is decreased by 1.**

The code `suf[j][0] -= 1` decreases the value of `suf[j][0]` by 1. Since the initial value of `pre[j][0]` is 1 and the operation on `suf[j][0]` does not affect `pre[j][0]`, these values remain unchanged. The value of `suf[j][0]` is decreased by 1, but its exact new value is not specified since it was initially 1.
