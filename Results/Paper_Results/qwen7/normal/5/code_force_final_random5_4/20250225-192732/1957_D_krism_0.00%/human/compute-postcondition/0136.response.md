Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable `j` ranges from 0 to 31.
   - There are no other variables mentioned in the loop head.

2. **Understand the Loop Body:**
   - The loop body modifies `pre[j][1]`, `suf[j][1]`, `pre[j][0]`, and `suf[j][0]` based on the condition `c >> j & 1`.
   - If `c >> j & 1` is true, then `pre[j][1]` is increased by 1 and `suf[j][1]` is decreased by 1.
   - Otherwise, `pre[j][0]` is set to 1 and `suf[j][0]` is decreased by 1.

3. **Determine the State Adjustments:**
   - Since the loop variable `j` is the only variable in the loop head, we need to consider how `j` changes with each iteration.
   - Initially, `j` starts at 0 and increases by 1 with each iteration until it reaches 31.

4. **State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was some value, say `k`.
   - For the next iteration, `j` will be `k + 1`.

5. **Adjust the States:**
   - We need to adjust the state for `j` to be `k + 1`.
   - No other states need adjustment since the loop body does not modify any other variables outside the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`c` is an integer, `j` is an integer, `j` must be 1 more than the value it had at the end of the previous iteration.**
