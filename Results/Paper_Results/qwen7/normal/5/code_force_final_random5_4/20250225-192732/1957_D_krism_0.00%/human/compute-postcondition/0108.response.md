Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` is 32, `y` is `arr[0]`, `k` is 5, `ans` is `pre[5][0] * suf[5][1] + pre[5][1] * suf[5][1]`, `pre[5][1]` is increased by 1**

Explanation: The code `pre[j][1] += 1` increments the value of `pre[j][1]` by 1. Given that `j` is 1, this means `pre[1][1]` is increased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
