Output State: **`c` is an integer, `j` is an integer, `pre[j][0]` is increased by 1, `suf[j][0]` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code decrements the first element of the list `suf[j]` by 1. The value of `c` and `j` remain unchanged, and `pre[j][0]` is increased by 1 as per the initial state. Therefore, `suf[j][0]` is now one less than its previous value.
