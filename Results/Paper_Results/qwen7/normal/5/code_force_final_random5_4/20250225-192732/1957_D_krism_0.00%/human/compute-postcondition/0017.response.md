Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`.

2. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than 32.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `pre[i][0]` is increased by 1.
   - Since this is the end of the previous iteration, `i` must have been 31 (because the loop will increment `i` to 0 before the first iteration).

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented from 31 to 32.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than 32.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `i` is now 32 and the condition for the loop to continue is still valid (since 32 is not less than 32, but the loop will check this condition at the beginning of the next iteration).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 32**
