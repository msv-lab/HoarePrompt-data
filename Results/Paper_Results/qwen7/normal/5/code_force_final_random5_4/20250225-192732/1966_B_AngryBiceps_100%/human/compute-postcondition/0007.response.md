Output State: **`a` is a list with one element which is the input provided by the user, `first_row` is the first character of the input provided by the user.**

Explanation: The code `first_row += a[-1][0]` takes the last element of the list `a` (which is a single-element list containing the input provided by the user) and accesses its first character (`a[-1][0]`). This character is then added to the variable `first_row`. Since `a` contains only one element (the input provided by the user), `a[-1][0]` refers to the first character of that input. The other variables remain unchanged.
