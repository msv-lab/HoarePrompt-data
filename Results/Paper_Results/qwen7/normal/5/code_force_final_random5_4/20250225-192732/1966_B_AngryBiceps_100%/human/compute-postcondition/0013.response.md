Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `a` is a list with two elements.
   - `first_row` is the concatenation of `first_row` and the first character of the last element of `a`.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `last_row` is the last character of the new input provided by the user plus the last character of the last element of `a`.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented to 2 (i.e., `i` becomes 2).
   - `n` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`a` is a list with two elements, the first element is the initial input provided by the user, the second element is the new input provided by the user, `first_row` is the concatenation of `first_row` and the first character of the last element of `a`, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `last_row` is the last character of the new input provided by the user plus the last character of the last element of `a`**.
