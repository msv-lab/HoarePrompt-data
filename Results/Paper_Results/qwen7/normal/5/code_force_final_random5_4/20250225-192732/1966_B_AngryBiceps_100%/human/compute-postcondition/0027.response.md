Postcondition: **`a` is a list containing `n` elements, each element being an input provided by the user during the respective iteration of the loop; `first_row` is a string consisting of the first character of each string in the list `a`; `last_row` is a string consisting of the last character of each string in the list `a`, repeated according to their position in the list; `i` is `n`, indicating the loop has completed all its iterations; `n` remains as the initial input provided by the user; and `first_row` and `last_row` reflect the cumulative concatenations as described. If the first element of `a` consists of a single unique character, the last element of `a` also consists of a single unique character, and the first and last elements of `a` are different, then the function continues with these conditions. Otherwise, the function continues with the conditions where the first character of the first string in `a` is not the same for all strings in `a` or the last character of the last string in `a` is not the same for all strings in `a` or both.**
