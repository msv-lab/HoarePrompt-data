Postcondition: **`a` is a list containing `n` elements, each element being an input provided by the user during the respective iteration of the loop; `first_row` is a string consisting of the first character of each string in the list `a`; `last_row` is a string consisting of the last character of each string in the list `a`, repeated according to their position in the list (i.e., the last character of the first string appears once, the last character of the second string appears twice, and so on); `i` is `n`, indicating the loop has completed all its iterations; `n` remains as the initial input provided by the user; and `first_row` and `last_row` reflect the cumulative concatenations as described. The first element of `a` consists of a single unique character, the last element of `a` also consists of a single unique character, and the first and last elements of `a` are different.**
