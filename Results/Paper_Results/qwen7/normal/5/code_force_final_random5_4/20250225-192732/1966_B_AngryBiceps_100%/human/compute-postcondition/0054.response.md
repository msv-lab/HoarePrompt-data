Postcondition: **`a` is a list containing `n` elements, each element being the input provided by the user at each iteration; `first_row` is a string consisting of the first character of each element in `a`, concatenated together; `last_row` is a string consisting of the last character of each element in `a`, concatenated together; `i` is `n - 1`; `n` is the integer value of the first input provided by the user; `m` is the integer value of the second input provided by the user. Additionally, either the first element of `a` contains more than one unique character, the last element of `a` contains more than one unique character, or the first and last elements of `a` are the same. In the if part, if the first row and last row consist of only one unique character and they are different, no changes are made. In the else part, if the first row and last row consist of only one unique character and they are different, no changes are made.**
