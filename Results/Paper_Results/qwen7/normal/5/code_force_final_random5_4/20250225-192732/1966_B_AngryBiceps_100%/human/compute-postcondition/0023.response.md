Based on the initial state provided:

- `a` is a list containing `n` elements, each element being an input provided by the user during the respective iteration of the loop.
- `first_row` is a string consisting of the first character of each string in the list `a`.
- `last_row` is a string consisting of the last character of each string in the list `a`, repeated according to their position in the list.
- `i` is `n`, indicating the loop has completed all its iterations.
- `n` remains as the initial input provided by the user.
- Either the first character of the first string in `a` is not the same for all strings in `a` or the last character of the last string in `a` is not the same for all strings in `a` or both.
- The length of the set of characters in `first_row` is 1 and the length of the set of characters in `last_row` is 1.
- `first_row` is not equal to `last_row`.

Given this information, the `print('NO')` statement will directly print the string 'NO'.

Output: **NO**
