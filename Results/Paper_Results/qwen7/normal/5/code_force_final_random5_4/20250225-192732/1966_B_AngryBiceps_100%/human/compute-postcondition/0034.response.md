Output State: **`a` is a list containing one element which is the input provided by the user, `first_row` is an empty string, `last_row` is an empty string, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is the integer value of the first input provided by the user, `m` is the integer value of the second input provided by the user.**

Explanation: The code `a.append(input())` appends the input provided by the user to the list `a`. The length of `a` is now 1. The values of `first_row`, `last_row`, `i`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged except that `i` is decremented by 1 since `i` was initially set to `n` and is used in a context where it gets decremented (though not explicitly shown in the given code snippet).
