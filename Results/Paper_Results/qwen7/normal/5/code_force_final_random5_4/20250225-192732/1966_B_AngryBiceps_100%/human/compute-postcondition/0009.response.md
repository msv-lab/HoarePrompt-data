Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` is a list with one element which is the input provided by the user.
   - `last_row` is the last character of the input provided by the user.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range `range(n)`. This means the loop will run from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have been incremented by 1 (assuming it started from 0).
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

Given that `a` and `last_row` are not part of the loop head, their values remain unchanged for the next iteration of the loop.

5. **Determine the new value of `i`**:
   - If `i` was 0 at the start of the first iteration, after the first iteration, `i` would be 1.
   - Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be 1 and `n` must be greater than 1.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`a` is a list with one element which is the input provided by the user; `last_row` is the last character of the input provided by the user; `i` is 1; `n` must be greater than 1**
