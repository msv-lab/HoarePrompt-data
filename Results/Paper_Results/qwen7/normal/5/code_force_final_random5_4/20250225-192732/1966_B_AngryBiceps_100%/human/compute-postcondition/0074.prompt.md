Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is an empty list, `first_row` is an empty string, `last_row` is an empty string, `i` is `n - 2`, `n` is the integer value of the first input provided by the user plus one, `m` is the integer value of the second input provided by the user.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    a.append(input())
    first_row += a[-1][0]
    last_row += a[-1][-1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is a list containing one element which is the input provided by the user, `first_row` is the first character of the last element in the list `a`, `last_row` is the last character of the last element in the list `a`, `i` is `n - 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a list containing two elements, where the first element is the initial input provided by the user and the second element is the new input provided by the user; `first_row` is the first character of the last element in the list `a` concatenated with the first character of the last element in `a`; `last_row` is the last character of the last element in the list `a` concatenated with the last character of the last element in `a`; `i` is `n - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a list containing three elements, where the first element is the initial input provided by the user, the second element is the new input provided by the user, and the third element is the current input provided by the user; `first_row` is the first character of the last element in the list `a` concatenated with the first character of the last element in `a`, plus the first character of the last element in `a`; `last_row` is the last character of the last element in the list `a` concatenated with the last character of the last element in `a`, plus the last character of the last element in the list `a`; `i` is `n - 2`, and `last_row` is updated by adding the last character of the last element in the list `a` to its current value.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
