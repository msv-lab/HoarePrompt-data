Output State: **`a` is a list with one element which is the input provided by the user; `last_row` is the last character of the input provided by the user.**

Explanation: The code `last_row += a[-1][-1]` assumes that `a` is a list containing a single string (since the initial state mentions that `a` is a list with one element which is the input provided by the user). In this single-element list, `a[-1]` refers to the last (and only) element of the list, which is a string. The `-1` index of this string gives us the last character of the string. This last character is then added to `last_row`. Since `last_row` was not initialized before, it is assumed to be an empty string initially, and now it gets updated to the last character of the input string.
