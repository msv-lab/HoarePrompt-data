Based on the initial state provided:

- `a` is a list containing `n` elements, where each element is an input provided by the user.
- `first_row` is a string consisting of the first character of each element in `a`, concatenated together.
- `last_row` is a string consisting of the last character of each element in `a`, concatenated together.
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- `n` is the integer value of the first input provided by the user.
- `m` is the integer value of the second input provided by the user.

Additionally, it is mentioned that either the first element of `a` contains more than one unique character, the last element of `a` contains more than one unique character, or the first and last elements of `a` are the same. However, it is also specified that the first row and last row consist of only one unique character and they are not the same.

Given this information, the `print('YES')` statement will simply print the string "YES".

Output: **YES**
