Output State: `a` is a list containing `n` elements, each being the input provided by the user during each iteration of the loop; `first_row` is a string consisting of the first character of each element in the list `a`; `last_row` is a string consisting of the last character of each element in the list `a`, repeated according to their order in the list.

In more detail:
- The list `a` will contain `n` strings, each resulting from user inputs during the loop's iterations.
- `first_row` will be a string formed by concatenating the first character of each string in `a`.
- `last_row` will be a string formed by concatenating the last character of each string in `a`, with the last character of each subsequent string appended to the previous ones in sequence.
