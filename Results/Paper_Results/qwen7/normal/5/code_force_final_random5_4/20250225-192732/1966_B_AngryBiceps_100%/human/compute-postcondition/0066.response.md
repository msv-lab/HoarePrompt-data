Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` is a list containing one element which is the input provided by the user.
   - `first_row` is the first character of the last element in the list `a`.
   - `last_row` is the last character of the last element in the list `a`.
   - `i` is `n - 2`.

3. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `i` is initialized as `n - 2`, the loop will execute if `i + 1 < n` (i.e., `n - 1 < n`, which is always true), but it will stop when `i` reaches `n - 1`.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become `n - 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `a` remains the same.
   - `first_row` remains the same.
   - `last_row` remains the same.
   - `i` changes from `n - 2` to `n - 1`.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`a` is a list containing one element which is the input provided by the user, `first_row` is the first character of the last element in the list `a`, `last_row` is the last character of the last element in the list `a`, `i` is `n - 1`**.
