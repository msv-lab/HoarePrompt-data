Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the problem. The program checks only the first and last row and column to determine if it's possible to make all squares the same color. However, this approach is insufficient because it does not consider the entire grid.

Consider the following test case:
```
3 3
WBB
BBW
BWB
```

In this case, the program would incorrectly output "YES" because the first and last rows and columns are all 'B', but it is not possible to make all squares the same color using the allowed operations. Specifically, the operations can only change subrectangles of the same color, and there is no way to change the 'W' in the top-left corner to 'B' without also changing other 'W' values to 'B', which would violate the rule of selecting two squares of the same color.

Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly and is thus incorrect.
