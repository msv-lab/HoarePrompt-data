Output State: **`a` is a list containing `n` elements, each element being the input provided by the user at each iteration; `first_row` is a string consisting of the first character of each element in `a`, concatenated together; `last_row` is a string consisting of the last character of each element in `a`, concatenated together; `i` is `n - 2`; `n` is the integer value of the first input provided by the user plus one; `m` is the integer value of the second input provided by the user.**

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the user input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m`. The value of `n` is the integer value of the first input provided by the user plus one because `n` was previously `n - 1` in the previous state. The value of `m` is the integer value of the second input provided by the user. The list `a`, `first_row`, and `last_row` remain unchanged as they were not modified by this code. The variable `i` is now `n - 2` because it was decremented by 1 in the previous iteration.
