Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the first split value, `m` is an integer input from the second split value; `a` is an empty list, `first_row` is an empty string, `last_row` is an empty string.**

The code assigns an empty string to the variable `last_row`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `m`, `a`, or `first_row`. Therefore, their states remain unchanged.
