Output State: **`a` is a list with three elements, where the first element is the initial input provided by the user, the second element is the new input provided by the user, and the third element is the current input provided by the user; `first_row` is the concatenation of `first_row` and the first character of the last element of `a`; `i` is 3; `n` must be greater than 1; `last_row` is the last character of the new input provided by the user plus the last character of the last element of `a`.**

Explanation: The code `a.append(input())` appends the current input (provided by the user) to the list `a`. Initially, `a` had two elements: the first element was the initial input, and the second element was the new input. After appending the current input, `a` now has three elements. The other variables (`first_row`, `i`, `n`, and `last_row`) remain unchanged in terms of their conditions or expressions, but the value of `i` is incremented by 1.
