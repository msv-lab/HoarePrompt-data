Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, followed by a list of `n` integers representing the numbers on the cards.
   
2. **Handling Edge Case:**
   - If `k > n`, the program directly prints `n`. This is correct because if you cannot form a group of `k` cards, no exchanges can be made, and you keep all `n` cards.

3. **Frequency Calculation:**
   - The program calls a function `func_1(nums, k)` to calculate the frequency of each number in the list `nums`.
   - The function `func_1` correctly updates the frequency table such that no number appears more than `k` times. However, this step does not seem to be necessary for solving the problem as described.

4. **Determining Minimum Cards Left:**
   - After calculating the frequency, the program checks if `k` itself is present as a value in the frequency dictionary.
     - If `k` is a value, it prints `k - 1`. This logic is flawed because the presence of `k` as a value does not necessarily mean we can achieve `k - 1` cards.
     - If `k` is not a value, it prints `n`. This is also incorrect because it doesn't consider the possibility of reducing the number of cards further.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to count how many groups of `k` cards can be formed and then determine the minimum number of cards left.

### Correct Solution:
```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Count the frequency of each number
    freq = {}
    for num in nums:
        freq[num] = freq.get(num, 0) + 1
    
    # Calculate the minimum number of cards left
    min_cards_left = n
    for count in freq.values():
        min_cards_left -= count // k * (k - 1)
    
    print(min_cards_left)
```

### Explanation of the Correct Solution:
1. **Count Frequencies:** We count the frequency of each number in the list.
2. **Calculate Minimum Cards Left:** For each frequency, we calculate how many cards can be reduced by performing the exchange operation. Specifically, for each group of `count` cards, we can reduce `(count // k) * (k - 1)` cards.

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in determining the minimum number of cards left. The correct approach involves counting the frequency of each number and then calculating the reduction in the number of cards based on the exchange operation.

**Correctness: **False**
