Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `arr` is a non-empty list of integers, and `frequency_table` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `arr` and its value is the maximum frequency of that integer in `arr` up to `k`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `frequency_table` will contain each unique number from `arr` as a key, and the corresponding value will be the highest frequency any single number appears in `arr`, but capped at `k`.
