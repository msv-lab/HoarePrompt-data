Output State: **The program returns a dictionary `frequency_table` where each key is a unique integer from the list `arr` and its corresponding value is the minimum of the frequency of that integer in `arr` and the integer `k`.**

This means that for every unique integer in the list `arr`, the `frequency_table` will store the integer along with the lesser value between how many times it appeared in `arr` and the given limit `k`. If an integer appeared more than `k` times in `arr`, its count in `frequency_table` will be capped at `k`.
