Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for num in arr:`. The objects involved here are `num` and `arr`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `arr` is a list of integers representing the numbers on the cards.
   - `num` is a variable that will take on each value from `arr` during each iteration of the loop.
   - `frequency_table` is an empty dictionary and is not part of the loop head.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will iterate over each element in `arr`. The loop will start with the first element of `arr` and continue until all elements have been processed.

4. **Adjust the states for the loop to execute**:
   - Since the loop starts with the first element of `arr`, `num` should be set to the first element of `arr`.
   - `arr` should be a non-empty list because if `arr` is empty, the loop will not execute at all.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `arr` must be a non-empty list.
- `num` must be the first element of `arr`.

State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of integers, `num` is the first element of `arr`**
