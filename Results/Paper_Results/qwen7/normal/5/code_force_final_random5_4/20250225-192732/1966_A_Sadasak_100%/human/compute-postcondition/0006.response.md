The only objects in the loop head are variables `num` and `arr`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num` and the list `arr`. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` is a non-empty list of integers. The loop body updates the `frequency_table[num]` to `k` if it is greater than `k`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `num` must be the next element in the list `arr`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `num` is the next integer in the list `arr`.

State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of integers, `num` is the next integer in the list `arr`**
