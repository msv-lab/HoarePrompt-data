Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `arr`, a list of integers, and `k`, an integer where 2 <= k <= 100. It returns a dictionary `frequency_table` where each key is a unique integer from the list `arr` and its corresponding value is the minimum of the frequency of that integer in `arr` and the integer `k`.**
