Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `arr` is a non-empty list of integers, and for every integer `num` in `arr`, `frequency_table[num]` is the minimum value between the frequency of `num` in the list `arr` and the integer `k`.

In simpler terms, after running through all the elements in the list `arr`, the `frequency_table` will contain each unique number from `arr` with its count capped at `k`. If any number appears more than `k` times in `arr`, its count in `frequency_table` will be set to `k`.
