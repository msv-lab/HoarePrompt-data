Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers representing the numbers on the cards, and k is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100; `frequency_table` is an empty dictionary.**

The code initializes an empty dictionary named `frequency_table`. The initial state of `arr` and `k` remains unchanged. Therefore, `arr` is still a list of integers representing the numbers on the cards, and `k` is still an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100. After executing the line of code, `frequency_table` is an empty dictionary.
