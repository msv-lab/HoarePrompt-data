Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n + 1`
   - `res` must have at least one element
   - `n` is a non-negative integer
   - If `r[a[n + 1] - 1]` is 2, then `ur` is 2 more than its previous value.
   - If `r[a[n + 1] - 1]` is not 2, the values of `i`, `res`, `n`, and `ur` remain unchanged from their preconditions, and `ul` equals `ur`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
   ```

Given the initial state, let's determine the values involved in the print statement:

- `i` is defined as `n + 1`.
- `a` is a list, but no specific elements of `a` are provided in the initial state.
- `a[i]` refers to the element at index `i` in the list `a`.

Since `i` is `n + 1`, `a[i]` corresponds to the element at index `n + 1` in the list `a`.

The print statement will print `a[i]` twice, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

However, without knowing the specific value of `a[n + 1]`, we cannot provide a precise numerical value. Therefore, the output will be a description of the elements being printed.

Output: **a[n + 1] a[n + 1]**
