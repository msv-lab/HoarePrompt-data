Postcondition: `i` is 9, `n` is at least 9, `l[a[8] - 1]` is either 2 or remains unchanged, `ul` is the original value of `ul` plus 6, `r[a[3] - 1]` is incremented by 3, `r[a[5] - 1]` is incremented by 2, `r[a[6] - 1]` is incremented by 1, `k` is `2 * k - ul`. If `k` is true, then `i` becomes 12, `a[11]` has been accessed, and if `l[a[11] - 1]` equals `k`, then `re` is 3 and `res` is a list containing the elements `a[11]`, `a[10]`, and `a[9]`. Otherwise, the values of `re` and `res` remain unchanged.
