Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in res:`. The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `res`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute again, `res` must contain at least one element, and `i` must be an element from `res`.

3. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**: The problem states that `res` must contain at least one element.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**: 
   - Since `res` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute, and `i` is an element from `res`, we need to ensure that `res` still contains at least one element for the next iteration.
   - After the previous iteration, `res` must still contain at least one element for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `res` still contains at least one element, and `i` is an element from `res`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`res` must contain at least one element, and `i` is an element from `res`**.
