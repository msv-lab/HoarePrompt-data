Step-by-step reasoning:

1. From the initial state, we know that `i` is equal to `n`, and `n` is a positive integer.
2. We also know that `a` is a list of integers.
3. The variable `r` is a list where the element at index `a[i] - 1` is equal to 2. Since `i` is `n`, this means the element at index `a[n] - 1` in list `r` is 2.

Given these points, let's determine what will be printed:

- `a[i]` is equivalent to `a[n]` because `i` is `n`.
- The value of `a[n]` is not explicitly given, but it does exist as an index in the list `a`.
- The `end=' '` parameter in the `print` function ensures that there is a space after the first `a[i]` value, but no newline.

Therefore, the print statement will output the value of `a[n]` followed by another `a[n]` with a space in between.

Output: **a[n] a[n]**
