Postcondition: `i` is `n + 2`, `n` is a positive integer, and `r[a[i] - 1]` is set to 2 if it was equal to 2. If the condition `ul == ur` is true, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains unchanged if the condition `ul == ur` is false.
