Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is an integer greater than 0.
   - `l[a[i] - 1]` is equal to 2.
   - There is a postcondition that if `ul` is equal to `k * 2`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

3. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is defined outside the loop and does not change within the loop itself.

4. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Given that `i` is currently 0 and `n` is an integer greater than 0, the loop can continue as long as `n` remains an integer greater than 0.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be 1 at the start of the next iteration.
   - `n` must remain an integer greater than 0.
   - The condition `l[a[i] - 1] == 2` will be checked with `i` now being 1, so `l[a[1] - 1]` needs to be considered.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 0, and `l[a[1] - 1]` is equal to 2**.
