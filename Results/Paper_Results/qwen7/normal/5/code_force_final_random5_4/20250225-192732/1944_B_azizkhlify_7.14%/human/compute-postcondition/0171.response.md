Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `i` is explicitly given as 8.
   - `a[i]` refers to `a[8]`. Since `i` is 8, `a[8]` is the 9th element of the list `a`.
   - `l[a[8] - 1]` is either 2 or remains unchanged. This means that the value of `l[a[8] - 1]` depends on the value of `a[8] - 1`. If `a[8]` is 9, then `a[8] - 1` is 8, and `l[8]` would be checked. However, since the value of `l[8]` is not provided and it is stated that `l[a[8] - 1]` is either 2 or remains unchanged, we can infer that `l[a[8] - 1]` is 2.
   - `ul` retains its original value, but its value is not relevant to the print statement.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement is `print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')`.
   - Since `i` is 8, `a[i]` is `a[8]`.
   - We need to determine the value of `a[8]`. Although the value of `a[8]` is not explicitly given, we know that `l[a[8] - 1]` is 2. This implies that `a[8] - 1` must be such that `l[a[8] - 1]` equals 2. Given that `l[8]` is 2, `a[8]` must be 9.

Therefore, `a[8]` is 9, and the print statement will output `9 9`.

Output: **9 9**
