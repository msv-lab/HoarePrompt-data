Output State: **`i` is 3; `n` must be greater than or equal to 4; `r[a[3] - 1]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `r[a[i] - 1] += 1` increments the value of `r[a[3] - 1]` by 1 because `i` is 3. The precondition that `n` must be greater than or equal to 4 remains unchanged, and the value of `i` also remains unchanged. The updated value of `r[a[3] - 1]` is not explicitly known without knowing the initial value of `r` and `a`, but we know it has been incremented by 1.
