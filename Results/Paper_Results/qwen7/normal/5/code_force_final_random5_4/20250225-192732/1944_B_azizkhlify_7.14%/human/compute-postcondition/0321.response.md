Based on the initial state provided:

- `l` is a list of integers.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `res` is a list.
- `i` is `i + 1`.

The value of `i` is not explicitly defined, but it is stated as `i + 1`. Since `i` itself is not given, we cannot determine its exact value. However, we know that `i` is being incremented by 1.

Given this, the print statement `print(a[i], end=' ')` will attempt to access the element at index `i` in the list `a`. Since `i` is `i + 1`, the index being accessed is one more than whatever the original value of `i` was.

Therefore, the output will depend on the original value of `i` before it was incremented. If we denote the original value of `i` as `original_i`, then the index being accessed is `original_i + 1`.

Output: **[element at index original_i + 1 in list a]**
