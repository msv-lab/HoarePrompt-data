Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `res` is a list that contains elements from `a` where `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 1, up to a maximum of `k` elements if `k` is non-zero.
   - `i` is the next element in `res`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `res`: This list is populated with elements from `a` such that `l[a[i] - 1] == 1`. The list `res` can contain up to `k` elements.
   - `i`: This is the index of the next element that would be added to `res` if it meets the condition (`l[a[i] - 1] == 1`).

3. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   - The print statement `print(i, end=' ')` simply prints the value of `i`.

Given this understanding, the print statement will output the value of `i`, which is the index of the next element that would be added to `res` if it meets the condition.

Output: **i (where i is the index of the next element in res that would be added if it meets the condition l[a[i] - 1] == 1)**
