Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 0, and `l[a[1] - 1]` remains equal to 2.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or the innermost enclosing block that is a loop or a match statement. In this case, since the `break` statement does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, or `l[a[1] - 1]`, their values remain unchanged. The `break` statement itself does not modify any variables, so the output state includes the unchanged values of the variables from the initial state.
