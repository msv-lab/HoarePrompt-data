Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `n + 2`
- `res` must have at least one element (though `res` itself is not used in the print statement)
- `n` is a non-negative integer
- `ur` is 2 more than its previous value (though `ur` itself is not used in the print statement)
- `ul` equals `ur` (though `ul` itself is not used in the print statement)
- The most internal loop or if statement is broken out (though this does not affect the print statement)

The print statement is:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

Here, `a[i]` refers to the element at index `i` in the list `a`. Since `i` is defined as `n + 2`, the print statement will print the element at index `n + 2` in the list `a`, repeated twice, followed by a space due to the `end=' '` parameter.

Output: **a[n + 2] a[n + 2]**
