Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 0, and `l[a[i] - 1]` is equal to 2, and `ul` is equal to `k * 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no variables are reassigned or their values altered by the `break` statement, the values of `i`, `n`, `l[a[i] - 1]`, and `ul` remain unchanged from their initial states.
