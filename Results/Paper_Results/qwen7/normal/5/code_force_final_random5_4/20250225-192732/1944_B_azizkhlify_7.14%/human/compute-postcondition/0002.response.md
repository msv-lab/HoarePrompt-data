Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer, storing these integers in a list called `a`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state.
