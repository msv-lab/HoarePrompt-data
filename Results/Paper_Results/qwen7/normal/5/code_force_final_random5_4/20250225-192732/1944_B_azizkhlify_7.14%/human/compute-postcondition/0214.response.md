Postcondition: **`i` is 12, `n` is at least 9, `a[11]` has been accessed, `l[a[8] - 1]` is either 2 or remains unchanged, `ul` is the original value of `ul` plus 6, `r[a[3] - 1]` is incremented by 3, `r[a[5] - 1]` is incremented by 2, `r[a[6] - 1]` is incremented by 1, `k` is `2 * k - ul`, `re` and `res` remain unchanged if `l[a[11] - 1]` is not equal to `k`, otherwise `re` is 3 and `res` is a list containing the elements `a[11]`, `a[10]`, and `a[9]`.**
