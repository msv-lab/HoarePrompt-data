Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n, 2 * n)`. The only variable that changes within the loop head is `i`.

2. **Determine the Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the postcondition given is that `i` is equal to `n`, and if `r[a[i] - 1]` equals 2, then `ur` is set to 2. Additionally, if the value of `ul` is equal to `ur`, the variables remain unchanged.

3. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop starts from `i = n` and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, the next value of `i` will be `n + 1`.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `n + 1`.

4. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`r`, `a`, `ur`, `ul`) do not change within the loop head and their values remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `r`, `a`, `ur`, and `ul` are the same as at the end of the previous iteration**
