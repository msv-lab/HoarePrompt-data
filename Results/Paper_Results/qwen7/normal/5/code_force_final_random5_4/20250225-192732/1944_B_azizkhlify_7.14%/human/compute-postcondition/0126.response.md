Postcondition: **The loop will continue to print each element in `res` until `res` is empty. If the condition `ul == ur` is met or the loop has iterated through all elements from `n` to `2 * n - 1`, `i` will be `2 * n`, `n` is a positive integer, and `r[a[i] - 1]` is set to 2 if it was equal to 2 during any iteration. The variable `ur` will be incremented by 2 for each element in `a` that meets the condition `r[a[i] - 1] == 2`. If `ul` equals `ur` at any point during the loop, the loop will exit prematurely.**
