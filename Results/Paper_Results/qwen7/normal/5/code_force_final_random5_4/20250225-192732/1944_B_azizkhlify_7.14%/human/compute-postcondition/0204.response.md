Given the initial state where `i` is 11 and `n` is at least 9, we need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(a[i], end=' ')`.

From the initial state, we know:
- `i` is explicitly given as 11.
- `n` is at least 9, but this does not directly affect the value of `i` or what is printed from `a[i]`.

However, the variable `a` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its contents. Since the problem does not provide any information about the list `a`, we must assume that `a` is a list and `a[i]` refers to the element at index 11 of that list.

Without the actual content of `a`, we can only say that `a[i]` refers to the element at index 11 of the list `a`.

Output: **a[11]**
