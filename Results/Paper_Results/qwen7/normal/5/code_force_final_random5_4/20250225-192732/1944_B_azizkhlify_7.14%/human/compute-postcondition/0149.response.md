Output State: **`i` is 6, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `r[a[3] - 1]` is incremented by 3, `r[a[5] - 1]` is incremented by 2, `r[a[6] - 1]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = n` to `i = 2 * n - 1`. Given that the loop executes 3 times as per the provided states, it means `n` must be at least 4. After 3 iterations, `i` will be `n + 3 - 1`, which is `6` if `n` is 4. During these iterations, the loop increments `r[a[i] - 1]` for each `i` from `n` to `2 * n - 1`. Specifically, `r[a[3] - 1]` is incremented 3 times, `r[a[5] - 1]` is incremented 2 times, and `r[a[6] - 1]` is incremented 1 time.
