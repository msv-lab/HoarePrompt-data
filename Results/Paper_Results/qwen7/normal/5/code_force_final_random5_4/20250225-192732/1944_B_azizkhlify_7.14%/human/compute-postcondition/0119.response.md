Output State: **`i` is `n + 2`, `n` is a positive integer, `ur` is `ur + 2`, and `r[a[i] - 1]` is set to 2 if it was equal to 2.**

Explanation: The variable `ur` is incremented by 2, making `ur` equal to its original value plus 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The condition for `r[a[i] - 1]` to be set to 2 is also preserved.
