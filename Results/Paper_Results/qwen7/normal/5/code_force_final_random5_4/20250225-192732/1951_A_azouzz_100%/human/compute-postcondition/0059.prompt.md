You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: start and end are integers such that start <= end, and both start and end represent valid folder names in the current directory (i.e., they are digits).
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        s = input()
        
        cnt1 = s.count('1')
        
        if cnt1 > 2 and cnt1 % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        elif cnt1 > 2:
            print('NO')
        elif cnt1 == 1:
            print('NO')
        elif '11' in s:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer input for each iteration, and `s` is a string input for each iteration. The variable `cnt1` is the count of '1's in the string `s` for each iteration. The final state of `t`, `n`, and `s` will depend on the inputs provided during each iteration of the loop, but `t` will be decremented by 1 for each iteration until it reaches 0. For each iteration, if `cnt1` is greater than 2 and even, the loop prints 'YES' and does not change `t`, `n`, or `s`. If `cnt1` is not greater than 2 or not even, the loop prints 'NO' and does not change `t`, `n`, or `s`. If '11' is found in `s`, the loop prints 'NO' and does not change `t`, `n`, or `s`. The final value of `t` will be 0, and the values of `n` and `s` will be the last inputs provided during the loop iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and returns None.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
