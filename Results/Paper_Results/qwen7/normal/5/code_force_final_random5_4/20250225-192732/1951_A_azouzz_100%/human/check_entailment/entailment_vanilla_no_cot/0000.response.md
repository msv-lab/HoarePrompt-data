Correctness: **False**

The provided Python program does not match the problem description. The function `generate_files_for_html_in_range` is defined and used correctly according to the problem statement, but there is an additional function `func_1` and its corresponding input/output logic that are unrelated to the described task. The program seems to be designed to handle a different problem, specifically checking a condition related to binary strings. Therefore, the overall program is incorrect for the given problem description.
