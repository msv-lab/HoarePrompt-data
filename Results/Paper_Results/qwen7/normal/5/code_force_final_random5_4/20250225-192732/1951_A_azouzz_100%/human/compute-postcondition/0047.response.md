Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 1 (though this variable is not used in the print statement).
- `n` is an input integer (though this variable is not used in the print statement).
- `s` is a new string input by the user (though this variable is not used in the print statement).
- `cnt1` is the number of times '1' appears in `s` (though this variable is not used in the print statement).

The print statement simply outputs the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
