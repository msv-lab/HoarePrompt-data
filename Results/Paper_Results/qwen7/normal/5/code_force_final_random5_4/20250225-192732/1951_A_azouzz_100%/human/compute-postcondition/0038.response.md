Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is a new input integer, `s` is a new string input by the user, `cnt1` is the number of times '1' appears in `s`. If `cnt1` is greater than 2, no changes are made to `t`, `n`, `s`, or `cnt1`. Otherwise, if '11' is not found in `s`, no changes are made to `t`, `n`, `s`, or `cnt1`.**
