Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: start and end are integers such that start <= end, t is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    cnt1 = s.count('1')
    if cnt1 > 2 and cnt1 % 2 == 0:
        print('YES')
    elif cnt1 > 2:
        print('NO')
    elif cnt1 == 1:
        print('NO')
    elif '11' in s:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string input by the user, `cnt1` is the number of times '1' appears in `s`. If `cnt1` is greater than 2 and even, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition. Otherwise, if `cnt1` is 1, `cnt1` remains 1. If `cnt1` is 2 or more, `cnt1` is either greater than 2 or odd if '11' is a substring of `s`, or less than or equal to 2 or even if '11' is not a substring of `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is a new input integer, `s` is a new string input by the user, `cnt1` is the number of times '1' appears in `s`. If `cnt1` is greater than 2 and even, no changes are made to `t`, `n`, `s`, or `cnt1`. Otherwise, if '11' is not found in `s`, no changes are made to `t`, `n`, `s`, or `cnt1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a new string input by the user, `cnt1` is the number of times '1' appears in `s`. If `cnt1` is greater than 2 and even, no changes are made to `t`, `n`, `s`, and `cnt1`. If `cnt1` is not greater than 2 or not even, no changes are made to `t`, `n`, `s`, and `cnt1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
