The function reads multiple inputs from the user, including an integer `t`, followed by `t` pairs of integers `n` and strings `s`. For each pair, it checks if the count of '1's in the string `s` is greater than 2 and even, or if '11' is present in `s`. Based on these conditions, it prints either 'YES' or 'NO'. After processing all inputs, the function returns nothing.
