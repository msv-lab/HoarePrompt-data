Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string input by the user, `cnt1` is the number of times '1' appears in `s`, `n` is a new input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The initial values of `t`, `s`, and `cnt1` remain unchanged, and a new input integer is assigned to `n`.
