Output State: **`t` is an input integer, and for each test case, a binary string `s` is provided on a new line where 2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5 and `s` consists only of '0' and '1'.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This integer represents the number of test cases. For each test case, a binary string `s` is expected to be provided on a new line, but since the code snippet does not include the part where `s` is read, the state of `s` remains undefined.
