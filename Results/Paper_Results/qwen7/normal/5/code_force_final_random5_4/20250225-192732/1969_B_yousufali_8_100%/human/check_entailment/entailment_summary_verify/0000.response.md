### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and its function summaries to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to find the minimum total cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts.
- Each cyclic shift operation has a cost equal to the length of the substring chosen for the shift.

#### Function Summaries:
- `func_1`: This function processes a single binary string and calculates the cost based on the given logic.
- `func_2`: This function processes multiple test cases by repeatedly calling `func_1`.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
```python
def func_1():
    s = input()
    n = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '1':
            n += 1
        if s[i] == '0' and n != 0:
            ans += n + 1
    print(ans)
```
- The logic in `func_1` is flawed because it assumes that each '0' encountered after a sequence of '1's contributes to the cost of shifting that sequence to the end. This is not always the optimal solution.

#### Example Analysis:
Consider the input string "101011":
- The program would incorrectly calculate the cost as follows:
  - First '0' after '11': Cost = 3 (shift "101" to end)
  - Second '0' after '11': Cost = 3 (shift "101" to end again)
  - Third '0' after '11': Cost = 3 (shift "101" to end again)
  - Total cost = 3 + 3 + 3 = 9

However, the optimal solution involves:
1. Choosing the substring [2, 4]: "010" -> "001"
2. Choosing the substring [3, 5]: "011" -> "0011"
3. Total cost = 3 + 3 = 6

This example clearly shows that the program does not correctly compute the minimum cost.

#### Function `func_2` Analysis:
```python
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
```
- This function simply iterates over the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case. Since `func_1` is flawed, `func_2` will also produce incorrect results.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. Therefore, the final evaluation should be:

**Final: False**
