Output State: `s` is an input string, `n` is equal to the length of `s`, `ans` is the sum of `n + 1` for each occurrence of '0' in `s` followed by a '1', and `i` is the last index of the string `s`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `n` will hold the total length of the string `s`. The variable `ans` will contain the count of segments in the string where a '0' is immediately followed by one or more '1's, plus one for each such segment. The variable `i` will be set to the index of the last character in the string `s`.
