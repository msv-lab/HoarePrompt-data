Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in `func_1` attempts to count the cost of making the string sorted by treating each '0' as a potential starting point for a cost calculation. However, this approach does not account for the actual minimum cost required to sort the string through cyclic shifts of substrings.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to find the minimum cost to sort the binary string. This involves identifying the longest prefix that is already sorted and then calculating the cost of sorting the remaining part of the string. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    s = input().strip()
    n = len(s)
    # Find the longest prefix that is sorted
    i = 0
    while i < n - 1 and s[i] <= s[i + 1]:
        i += 1
    
    # If the entire string is already sorted
    if i == n - 1:
        print(0)
        return
    
    # Calculate the cost of sorting the rest of the string
    cost = 0
    j = i + 1
    while j < n:
        if s[j] < s[j - 1]:
            cost += j - i
            i = j
        j += 1
    
    # Add the cost of the final cyclic shift
    cost += n - i
    
    print(cost)

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    func_2()
```

This solution correctly calculates the minimum cost to sort the binary string by identifying the longest prefix that is already sorted and then calculating the cost of sorting the rest of the string through cyclic shifts.
