Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`.
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `_` (which is just a placeholder) and `t`.

2. **Determine the State Adjustments:**
   - The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not affect the loop execution directly. It is used as a counter within the loop.
   - The variable `t` represents the number of iterations the loop will perform. For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1.

3. **Initial State:**
   - The initial state given is that `t` is an input integer.

4. **Adjust the State:**
   - Since the loop will run `t` times, `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` being greater than 0.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
