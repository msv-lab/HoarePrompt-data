The function processes a binary string `s`, counting the number of '1's encountered. It then calculates and returns the total cost `ans`, which is the sum of `n + 1` for each occurrence of '0' immediately followed by one or more '1's in the string. After processing the entire string, the function prints the total cost `ans`.
