### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts.
   - Each cyclic shift operation has a cost equal to the length of the substring being shifted.
   - The goal is to find the minimum total cost to achieve a sorted string.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes a binary string `s` as input.
   - It initializes `n` to count consecutive '1's and `ans` to accumulate the cost.
   - It iterates through the string:
     - If the current character is '1', it increments `n`.
     - If the current character is '0' and `n` is not zero, it adds `n + 1` to `ans` and resets `n`.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic in `func_1` does not correctly simulate the cyclic shift operations.
   - It simply counts the number of '0's followed by '1's and adds their positions plus one to the cost.
   - This approach does not account for the actual cost of cyclic shifts needed to sort the string.

4. **Example Analysis:**
   - For the string "10", `func_1` will output 2, which is correct because a single cyclic shift is needed.
   - For the string "0000", `func_1` will output 0, which is also correct because no shifts are needed.
   - However, for more complex strings like "101011", the logic fails to calculate the correct minimum cost.

5. **Detailed Analysis with Annotations:**
   - **Initial State:** `s` is a binary string, `n` is initialized to 0, and `ans` is initialized to 0.
   - **Loop Execution:**
     - For the string "101011":
       - `i = 0`: `s[0] == '1'`, `n = 1`.
       - `i = 1`: `s[1] == '0'` and `n != 0`, so `ans += 1 + 1 = 2`, `n = 0`.
       - `i = 2`: `s[2] == '1'`, `n = 1`.
       - `i = 3`: `s[3] == '0'` and `n != 0`, so `ans += 1 + 1 = 4`, `n = 0`.
       - `i = 4`: `s[4] == '1'`, `n = 1`.
       - `i = 5`: `s[5] == '1'` and `n != 0`, so `ans += 1 + 1 = 6`, `n = 0`.
       - The final output is `ans = 6`, which is incorrect.
   - **Other Test Cases:**
     - For "0000", `ans = 0` is correct.
     - For "10", `ans = 2` is correct.
     - For "11000", `ans = 9` is correct.
     - For "01101001", `ans = 11` is correct.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - While the function `func_1` provides the correct output for some simple cases, it fails to handle more complex strings correctly. The logic does not account for the actual minimum cost of cyclic shifts required to sort the string.
