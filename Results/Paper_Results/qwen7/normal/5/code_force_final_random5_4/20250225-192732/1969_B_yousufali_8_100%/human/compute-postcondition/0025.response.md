The function `func_1` accepts no explicit parameters but uses local variables `s` (a binary string consisting only of '0's and '1's) and `n` (an integer representing the count of '1's encountered until the current index, initialized to 0) and `ans` (an integer representing the total cost, also initialized to 0). The function processes the string `s` character by character, updating `n` each time a '1' is encountered and adding a certain value to `ans` based on the value of `n`. The function does not return any value directly but modifies `ans` during its execution.

Functionality: **The function processes a binary string `s`, counts the number of '1's encountered, and updates a total cost `ans` based on the count of '1's.**
