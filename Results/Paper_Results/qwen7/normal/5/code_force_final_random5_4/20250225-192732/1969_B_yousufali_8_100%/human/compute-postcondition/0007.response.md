Output State: `t` must be greater than 0.

In natural language: The value of `t` must be greater than 0 after the loop has executed all its iterations. This is because the loop continues to run as long as `t` is greater than 0, and since the loop has completed all its iterations, it means `t` was initially greater than 0 and has not been modified in a way that would make it less than or equal to 0 within the loop.
