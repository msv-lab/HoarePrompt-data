### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts.
   - Each cyclic shift operation has a cost equal to the length of the substring being shifted.
   - The goal is to find the minimum total cost to achieve a sorted string.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes a binary string `s` as input.
   - It initializes `n` to count consecutive '1's and `ans` to accumulate the cost.
   - It iterates through the string:
     - If the current character is '1', it increments `n`.
     - If the current character is '0' and `n` is not zero, it adds `n + 1` to `ans` and resets `n`.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic in `func_1` does not correctly simulate the cyclic shift operations.
   - It simply counts the number of '0's followed by '1's and adds their positions plus one to the cost.
   - This approach does not account for the actual cost of cyclic shifts needed to sort the string.

4. **Example Analysis:**
   - For the string "10", `func_1` will output 2, which is correct because a single cyclic shift is needed.
   - For the string "0000", `func_1` will output 0, which is also correct because no shifts are needed.
   - However, for more complex strings like "101011", the logic fails to calculate the correct minimum cost.

5. **Detailed Example Analysis:**
   - Consider the string "101011":
     - The first '0' is followed by three '1's, so the cost would be 4 (3 + 1).
     - The second '0' is followed by two '1's, so the cost would be 3 (2 + 1).
     - The third '0' is followed by one '1', so the cost would be 2 (1 + 1).
     - Total cost: 4 + 3 + 2 = 9.
   - The function `func_1` will incorrectly calculate the cost as follows:
     - First '0': `ans += 2` (cost = 2).
     - Second '0': `ans += 3` (cost = 5).
     - Third '0': `ans += 4` (cost = 9).
     - Total cost: 9.
   - This matches the expected output, but the logic used is flawed because it does not account for the optimal sequence of cyclic shifts.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - While the function `func_1` produces the correct output for the given examples, it does not generalize to all possible cases. The logic used to calculate the cost is not optimal and does not ensure the minimum total cost.
