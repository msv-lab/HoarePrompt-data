Output State: `i` is equal to `n`, `last_year` is equal to the value calculated as `(last_year + 1 + a[n-1] - 1) // a[n-1] * a[n-1]`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n` because the loop runs from `1` to `n-1`. The final value of `last_year` will be the result of the last iteration's calculation, which is `(last_year + 1 + a[n-1] - 1) // a[n-1] * a[n-1]`. All other variables like `results` and `index` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
