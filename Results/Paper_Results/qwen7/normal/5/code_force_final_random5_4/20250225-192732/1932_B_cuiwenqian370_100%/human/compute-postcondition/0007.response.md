Output State: **`index` is 2, `T` is an integer from the list `data` at position `index`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer obtained from `data[index]`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, and `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string using spaces; `results` is an empty list, `T` must be at least 1**.

In this output state, the variable `n` is updated to the integer value obtained from `data[index]`, which is the third element (since index starts from 0) in the list `data`. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial state descriptions.
