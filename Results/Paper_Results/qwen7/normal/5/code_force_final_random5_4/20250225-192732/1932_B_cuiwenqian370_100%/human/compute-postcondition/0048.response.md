Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(1, n):`.
   - The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of These Variables:**
   - From the given state before the loop, `i` is 3.
   - `last_year` is 3 (not relevant to the loop).
   - `results` is ['4'] (not relevant to the loop).
   - `index` is increased by 1 plus `n` (not directly relevant to the loop but might be indirectly related through `n`).
   - `a` is [3] (not relevant to the loop).

3. **Adjust the States of Relevant Variables:**
   - For the loop `for i in range(1, n)` to execute, `i` should start from 1 and `n` should be an integer such that the range function generates valid values for `i`.
   - Since `i` is currently 3, it means the loop has already started with `i = 3`. Therefore, we need to ensure that the loop can continue or start correctly.
   - The loop will start with `i = 1` and increment `i` until `i < n`. Given `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3 for the loop to continue.

4. **Formulate the Final State:**
   - We need to adjust `i` to start from 1 if it hasn't already done so.
   - We need to ensure `n` is greater than 3 to allow the loop to continue.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` must be 1 or greater, `n` must be greater than 3**.
