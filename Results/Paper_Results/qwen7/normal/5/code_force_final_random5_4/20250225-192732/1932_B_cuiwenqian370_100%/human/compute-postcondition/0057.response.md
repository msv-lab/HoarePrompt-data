Output State: `i` is equal to `n`, `last_year` is equal to the value calculated after the last iteration of the loop, which is `(last_year + 1 + a[n-1] - 1) // a[n-1] * a[n-1]`.

In natural language: After all the iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has completed its execution. The variable `last_year` will hold the value calculated after the last iteration, which is determined by the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[n-1] - 1) // a[n-1] * a[n-1]`, where `n-1` is the index of the last element in the list `a`.
