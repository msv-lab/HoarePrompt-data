Output State: **`index` is incremented by 1; `n` is assigned the value of `data[index]`.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(data[index])` assigns the value of `data[index]` to `n` after converting it to an integer. Additionally, since the index is used to access the list `data`, `index` is incremented by 1 to prepare for the next iteration of the loop. The conditions for the loop to continue executing (i.e., `T` being greater than the current number of iterations) remain unchanged.
