Output State: `i` is `n`, `n` must be at least 1, `last_year` equals `next_year`, `next_year` is `(last_year + a[n-1] - 1) // a[n-1] * a[n-1]`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be equal to `n`, since the loop runs from `1` to `n-1`. The variable `last_year` will be updated in each iteration according to the formula provided in the loop body. Specifically, `last_year` will be set to `next_year`, which is calculated as `(last_year + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]` for each `i` from `1` to `n-1`. By the end of the loop, `last_year` will hold the final value after applying this update rule `n-1` times, starting from the initial value of `last_year` which is the first element of the list `a`.
