You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a_1, a_2, ..., a_n are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(T):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        
        index += n
        
        last_year = a[0]
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            next_year = (last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]
            last_year = next_year
        
        results.append(str(last_year))
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is equal to `n`, `last_year` is the final value after processing all elements in the list `a` and appending it to `results`, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `last_year` for each iteration.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`, indicating that all elements in the list `a` have been processed. The variable `last_year` will hold the final computed value after processing the last element in the list `a` through the inner loop. The `results` list will contain the final `last_year` value as a string for each iteration that was executed, which in this case would be the final value of `last_year` after all iterations.
    sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(results) + '\n')
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing multiple test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of subsequent test cases, followed by an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6). For each test case, it processes the list of integers and returns a result based on the given conditions.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
