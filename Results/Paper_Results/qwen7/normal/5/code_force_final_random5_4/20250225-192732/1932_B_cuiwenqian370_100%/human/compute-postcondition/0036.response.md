Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `last_year` is 1
   - `next_year` is 1
   - `last_year` is equal to `next_year`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1`. This means `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`.

4. **Analyze the loop execution**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 2.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `i` is currently 2, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to continue.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will become 3.
   - `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

6. **Final state**:
   - `i` will be 3.
   - `n` must be greater than 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is 3, `last_year` is 1, `next_year` is 1, `last_year` is equal to `next_year`, `n` must be greater than 2**
