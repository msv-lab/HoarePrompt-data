Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly calculate the year in which all signs will occur sequentially. The logic in `func_1` is flawed. Specifically, the calculation of `next_year` does not correctly ensure that the signs occur one after another in the required sequence.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(T):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        current_year = 0
        for i in range(n):
            while current_year % a[i] != 0:
                current_year += 1
            current_year += a[i]
        results.append(str(current_year))
    sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(results) + '\n')
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Code:
- **Initialization**: Start with `current_year` at 0.
- **Loop through each sign**: For each sign, find the next year where the sign occurs by incrementing `current_year` until it is a multiple of `a[i]`, and then add `a[i]` to move to the next occurrence of the sign.
- **Result**: After processing all signs, `current_year` will be the year when the nth sign occurs, and thus the year of the apocalypse.

This approach ensures that each sign occurs in the correct sequential order.
