Output State: **`i` is 2, `last_year` is 1, `next_year` is 1**

Explanation: 
- Initially, `i` is 2.
- The value of `last_year` is calculated as `(last_year + 1 - 1) // a[1] * a[1]`. Given that `last_year` is initially undefined in the context of the calculation but from the format, it seems it might be derived from a previous context or defaulting to 0, we can assume `last_year` is 0 for the calculation. Thus, `last_year` becomes `(0 + 1 - 1) // a[1] * a[1]` which simplifies to `0 // a[1] * a[1]` resulting in `0`.
- The code then calculates `next_year` as `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`. Since `last_year` is 0 and `i` is 2, `a[i]` would be `a[2]`. Assuming `a[2]` is 1 (as no specific value was given and it follows a pattern from `a[1]` which is implicitly 1), `next_year` becomes `(0 + 1 + 1 - 1) // 1 * 1` which simplifies to `1 // 1 * 1` resulting in `1`.

Therefore, the updated values are `i` is 2, `last_year` is 1, and `next_year` is 1.
