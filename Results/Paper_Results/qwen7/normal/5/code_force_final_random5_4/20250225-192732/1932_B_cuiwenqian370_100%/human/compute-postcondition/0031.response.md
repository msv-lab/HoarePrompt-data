Output State: **`i` is 1; `next_year` is `(last_year + 1 - 1) // a[1] * a[1]`**.

Explanation: The code calculates `next_year` using the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`. Given that `i` is 1, the formula simplifies to `(last_year + 1 - 1) // a[1] * a[1]`, which further simplifies to `last_year // a[1] * a[1]`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from the initial state, and `n` being greater than 1 is still a valid condition.
