Output State: **`index` is 2, `T` is an integer from the list `data` at position `index`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, and `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string using spaces.**

Explanation: The value of `index` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The values of `T`, `t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, and `data` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
