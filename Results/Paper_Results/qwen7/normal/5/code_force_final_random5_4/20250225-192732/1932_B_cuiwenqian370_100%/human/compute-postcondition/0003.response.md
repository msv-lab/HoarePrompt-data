Output State: **`index` is 1, `T` is an integer from the list `data` at position `index`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, and `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string using spaces.**

Explanation: The code `T = int(data[index])` assigns the integer value from the list `data` at the current index (`index`) to the variable `T`. Since `index` was initially 0, after executing the code, `index` is incremented to 1 (to move to the next element in the list). The value of `T` is now the integer from `data` at the new index. All other variables remain unchanged.
