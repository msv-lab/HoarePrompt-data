Output State: **`a` is greater than 3, `i` is 1, `b[i]` is 0, `b[i + 2]` is `b[3] - b[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `b[i] -= b[i]` subtracts `b[i]` from itself, which results in `b[i]` becoming 0. Since `i` is 1, `b[i]` is now `b[1]` and its value is 0. The other conditions and values remain unchanged.
