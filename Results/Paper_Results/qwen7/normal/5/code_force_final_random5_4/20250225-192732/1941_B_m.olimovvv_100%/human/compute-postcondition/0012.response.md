Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` must be at least 2, and `i` is 1; `b[i]` is decreased by `b[i]`, making `b[i]` equal to 0.**

The code `b[i] -= b[i]` subtracts `b[i]` from itself, effectively setting `b[i]` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
