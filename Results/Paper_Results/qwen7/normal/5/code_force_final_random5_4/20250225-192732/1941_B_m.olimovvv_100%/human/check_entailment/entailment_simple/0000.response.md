Reasoning:
1. The provided solution iterates through the array and checks if any element is negative before performing the operations. If any element is found to be negative, it immediately prints 'NO' because the operations cannot make a negative value positive.
2. The operations are applied correctly according to the problem statement: for each valid index `i`, it reduces `a[i-1]`, `a[i]`, and `a[i+1]` by 1, 2, and 1 respectively.
3. After the loop, it checks if the last two elements are zero. If they are not, it prints 'NO', indicating that not all elements can be made zero. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.
4. The logic handles the constraints and examples provided correctly. It ensures that the operations do not result in negative values and checks the final state of the array.

Given the above reasoning, the provided solution appears to be correct based on the problem description and the execution states provided.

Correctness: **True**
