Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `a`.

2. **Determine the initial values or conditions required for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop `for i in range(0, a - 2):` will execute if the condition `0 <= i < a - 2` holds true.
   - For the loop to start executing, `a - 2` must be greater than 0 (since `i` starts from 0 and goes up to `a - 3`). This means `a` must be at least 2.

3. **Adjust the given states**:
   - We know `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This value is not directly relevant to the loop execution and does not need to be adjusted.
   - The variable `a` must be at least 2 for the loop to start executing.
   - The variable `i` will start at 0, but this is not something we need to explicitly adjust since it is the starting point of the range function.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `a` and `i`. Specifically, `a` must be at least 2, and `i` will start at 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` must be at least 2, `i` is 0**
