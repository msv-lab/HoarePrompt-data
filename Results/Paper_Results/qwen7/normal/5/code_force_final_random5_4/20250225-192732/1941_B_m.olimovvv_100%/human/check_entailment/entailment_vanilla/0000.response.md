Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   
2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program iterates through the array from index `0` to `a - 3` (i.e., `a - 2`).
   - For each index `i`, it checks if `b[i]` is less than 0. If so, it prints 'NO' and breaks out of the loop because the operation cannot be applied with negative values.
   - If `b[i]` is non-negative, it performs the operation:
     - `b[i+1] -= b[i] * 2`
     - `b[i+2] -= b[i]`
     - `b[i] -= b[i]` (which makes `b[i]` zero)
   - After processing all indices, it checks if the last two elements (`b[-1]` and `b[-2]`) are zero. If either is non-zero, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

### Issues Identified

1. **Incorrect Operation Application:**
   - The program incorrectly implements the operation. According to the problem statement, the operation should be:
     - `a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1`
     - `a_i = a_i - 2`
     - `a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1`
   - However, the program subtracts `b[i] * 2` from `b[i+1]` and `b[i]` from `b[i+2]`. This is incorrect.

2. **Break Statement:**
   - The break statement inside the loop is unnecessary and incorrect. It should only check the final state of the array after all operations are performed.

3. **Final Check:**
   - The final check for `b[-1]` and `b[-2]` being zero is correct, but the way the operations are applied is incorrect.

### Corrected Program

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Apply the operation for each valid index
        for i in range(1, n - 1):
            if b[i] > 0:
                b[i - 1] -= 1
                b[i] -= 2
                b[i + 1] -= 1
        
        # Check if all elements are zero
        if all(x == 0 for x in b):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified, the original program is incorrect. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
