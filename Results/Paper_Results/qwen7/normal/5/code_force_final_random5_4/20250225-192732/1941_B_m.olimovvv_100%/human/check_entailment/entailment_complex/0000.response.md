Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly describes the logic of the function.
2. The function processes each test case individually.
3. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
4. It then iterates through the array from index 0 to `n-3` (inclusive), performing the specified operations.
5. The operations are designed to reduce the values of the array elements according to the rules given in the problem statement.
6. If at any point during the iteration, an element becomes negative, the function immediately prints 'NO' and breaks out of the loop, indicating that it's not possible to make all elements zero.
7. After the loop, it checks if the last two elements of the array are zero. If they are, it prints 'YES', otherwise 'NO'.
8. The logic correctly follows the problem statement and the provided examples.

Given the above reasoning, the annotated program accurately reflects the intended functionality and correctly determines whether it is possible to make all elements of the array zero using the specified operations.

Correctness: **True**
