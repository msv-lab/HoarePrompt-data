Output State: **`a` is greater than 3, `i` is 1, `b[i]` is 0**

Explanation: The code `b[i] -= b[i]` subtracts `b[i]` from itself, effectively setting `b[i]` to 0. The value of `a` and `i` remain unchanged. The expression `b[i + 2]` is not directly affected by the code, so its value remains as `b[i + 2] - b[i]`. However, since `b[i]` is now 0, the expression simplifies to just `b[i + 2]`. But according to the initial state, this expression was already defined as `b[i + 2] - b[i]`, and since `b[i]` is now 0, it can be simplified to just `b[i + 2]`. Therefore, the updated state shows `b[i]` as 0.
