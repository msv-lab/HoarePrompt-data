Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(0, a - 2)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `a`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < a - 2`. After each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `b[i + 1]` is decreased by `2 * b[i]`
   - `b[i + 2]` is decreased by `b[i]`
   - `i` is `i + 1`
   - `b[i]` is `b[i] - b[i]`, which results in `0`

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must still be less than `a - 2`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be updated to `i + 1`.
   - `b[i]` will be `0` (as it was set to `0` in the previous iteration).
   - `b[i + 1]` and `b[i + 2]` will be updated based on the new value of `i`.

Given the above steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` will be `i + 1`.
- `b[i]` will be `0`.
- `b[i + 1]` and `b[i + 2]` will be updated according to the rule in the loop body, but since we don't know the exact values of `b[i + 1]` and `b[i + 2]` from the previous iteration, we only need to focus on the loop head variables.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `b[i]` is `0`**
