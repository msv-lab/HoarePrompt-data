Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` must be greater than 4, and `i` is 2. If `b[i]` is less than 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains unchanged from the precondition if `b[i]` is not less than 0.
