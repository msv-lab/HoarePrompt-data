Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the condition `range(0, a - 2)`.

2. **Understand the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `a - 2`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `a` is greater than 4.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `b[2]` is 0.

4. **Determine the Next Value of `i`**: Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 2. Therefore, in the next iteration, `i` will be 3.

5. **Check the Condition for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `a - 2`. Given that `i` is now 3, the condition becomes `3 < a - 2`, which simplifies to `a > 5`.

6. **Adjust the State**: The only variables that need to be adjusted are `i` and the condition `a > 5`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is greater than 5, `i` is 3; `b[3]` is 0**.
