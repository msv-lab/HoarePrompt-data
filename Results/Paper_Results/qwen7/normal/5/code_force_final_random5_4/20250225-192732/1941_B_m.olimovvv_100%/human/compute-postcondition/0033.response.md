Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an input integer, `i` is equal to `a - 2`, `b[3]` is 0, `b[4]` is equal to \(-6 \times (a-5)\), `b[5]` is equal to \(-6 \times (a-5)\), and all elements `b[i]` for `i` from 0 to 2 are 0. After executing `b = list(map(int, input().split()))`, `b` is updated with the new list of integers from the input, and `i` remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the list `b` is updated to contain integers from the input, while the other variables retain their previous values.
