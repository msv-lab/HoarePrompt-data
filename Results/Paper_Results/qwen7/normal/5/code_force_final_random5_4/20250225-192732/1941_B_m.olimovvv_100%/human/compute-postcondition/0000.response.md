Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is the input value that will be used as the range for the loop.

2. **Determine the State Adjustments**: The loop will execute based on the input value. Since the input value is not known beforehand, we need to ensure that the loop can execute by adjusting the state to reflect that an input will be provided and it will be within the valid range specified (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).

3. **Adjust the State**: We need to ensure that the input will be a valid integer within the specified range. Therefore, we can adjust the state to reflect that an input will be taken and it will be within the given bounds.

Given the constraints and the nature of the loop, the state before the loop should be adjusted to reflect that an input will be taken and it will be within the valid range.

**Final Answer**:
State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
