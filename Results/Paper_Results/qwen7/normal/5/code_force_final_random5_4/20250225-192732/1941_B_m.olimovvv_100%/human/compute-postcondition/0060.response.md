Output State: All elements in the list `b` are 0.

Explanation: Given the conditions and the operations performed within the loop, after each iteration, the value of `b[i]` becomes 0. Since the loop continues as long as `b[i]` is non-negative, once `b[i]` becomes 0, it will remain 0 for subsequent iterations. The loop updates `b[i+1]` and `b[i+2]` based on the value of `b[i]`, but since `b[i]` is 0, these updates do not change the values of `b[i+1]` and `b[i+2]`. Therefore, after all iterations, all elements in the list `b` will be 0.
