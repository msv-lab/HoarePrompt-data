Output State: `a` is greater than 5, `i` is 3, `b[i]` is 0, `b[i + 2]` is `b[4] - b[1]`.

Explanation: The loop runs until `a - 2`, meaning it will run 3 times if `a` is 5. After 3 iterations, `i` will be 3 (since it starts at 0 and increments by 1 each iteration). The conditions in the loop ensure that `b[i]` becomes 0 after each iteration, and the values of `b[i + 2]` are updated based on the previous values of `b[i]`. After 3 iterations, `b[3]` is updated based on `b[1]`, and `b[5]` (if it exists) would be updated based on `b[3]`, but since we are only considering up to the third iteration, `b[5]` remains as `b[4] - b[1]`.
