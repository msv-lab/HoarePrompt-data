Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then constructs a permutation `p` of length `n` such that for each index `i`, `p[i]` equals `mex - a[i]`, where `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the list `p`. After constructing the permutation, it prints the elements of `p`. The function does not return any value but modifies and prints the permutation `p` for each test case.**
