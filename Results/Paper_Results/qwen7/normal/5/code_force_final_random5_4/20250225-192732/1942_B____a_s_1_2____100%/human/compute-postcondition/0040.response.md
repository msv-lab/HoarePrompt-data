Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The loop runs in reverse order from `n-1` to `0` (inclusive), decrementing by 1 each time.
   - For the loop to start, `n` must be at least 1 because if `n` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.

3. **Adjust the State**:
   - We need to ensure that `n` is at least 1 so that the loop can start.
   - The variable `i` will take on the values from `n-1` to `0` during the loop iterations, but we don't need to specify its initial value since it will be set by the loop itself.

4. **Other Variables**:
   - `a`, `p`, and `mex` are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
