Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs in reverse order from `n-1` to `0`. Therefore, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since the loop starts with `i = 0` and goes down to `0`, the loop will execute if `n > 0`.
   - The value of `i` will be adjusted within the loop, but we need to ensure that the loop can start.

Given this information, we need to adjust the state such that the loop can start executing. This means ensuring that `n > 0`.

**State:**
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 0 (as given).

So, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
