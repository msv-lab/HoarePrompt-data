Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the size `n` of the permutation and the array `a`.
3. It initializes a list `p` with `-1` values, which will be used to store the permutation.
4. The variable `mex` is initialized to `n`, which will be used to find the minimum non-negative integer not present in the current state of `p`.
5. The loop iterates backward from `n-1` to `0`, setting each `p[i]` to `mex - a[i]` and updating `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and the newly assigned `p[i]`.
6. This approach ensures that `p[i]` is set to the correct value to satisfy the MEX condition for the subarray `p[0...i]`.
7. After the loop completes, the list `p` should contain a valid permutation that satisfies the given conditions.
8. The program prints the permutation `p` for each test case.

Given the logic and the steps involved, the program appears to correctly implement the solution based on the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
