Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `i` is `n-2`; `mex` is updated to be the minimum of `mex` and `p[i]`; `p[i]` is now `mex - a[i]`.**

Explanation: The code updates `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`. Since `i` is `n-2`, `p[i]` is updated to `mex - a[i]`. The initial conditions for `n`, `i`, `mex`, and `p[i]` remain valid, but `mex` and `p[i]` are updated based on their current values.
