Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `p` is a list of length `n` where every element is -1, `mex` is equal to `n`.**

Explanation: The variable `mex` is assigned the value of `n`. Since `n` is an input integer, `mex` also becomes an input integer with the same value as `n`. The lists `a` and `p` remain unchanged.
