### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to construct a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \) such that for each \( i \), \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \).
   - \(\texttt{MEX}\) of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

2. **Given Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and the array \( a \).
   - It initializes a list `p` with `-1` values.
   - It calculates the \(\texttt{MEX}\) value (`mex`) and updates the permutation `p` in reverse order.
   - For each index \( i \), it sets \( p[i] = \texttt{MEX} - a[i] \) and updates the \(\texttt{MEX}\) value to be the minimum of the current \(\texttt{MEX}\) and the newly set \( p[i] \).

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic in the given program is flawed because it attempts to calculate \(\texttt{MEX}\) in reverse order and directly updates the permutation, which does not correctly reflect the \(\texttt{MEX}\) calculation based on the current state of the permutation.
   - The correct approach would be to construct the permutation in a forward manner, ensuring that each element \( p[i] \) is the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in the permutation up to that point.

4. **Example Verification:**
   - Let's verify with the provided examples:
     - For the first example: \( n = 5 \), \( a = [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] \)
       - The correct permutation could be \( p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] \).
       - Calculating \(\texttt{MEX}\) correctly for each step:
         - \( \texttt{MEX}([0]) = 1 \Rightarrow a_1 = 1 - 0 = 1 \)
         - \( \texttt{MEX}([0, 1]) = 2 \Rightarrow a_2 = 2 - 1 = 1 \)
         - \( \texttt{MEX}([0, 1, 4]) = 2 \Rightarrow a_3 = 2 - 4 = -2 \)
         - \( \texttt{MEX}([0, 1, 4, 2]) = 3 \Rightarrow a_4 = 3 - 2 = 1 \)
         - \( \texttt{MEX}([0, 1, 4, 2, 3]) = 5 \Rightarrow a_5 = 5 - 3 = 2 \)
       - This matches the given \( a \).

5. **Correct Implementation:**
   - A correct implementation would involve constructing the permutation in a forward manner, ensuring that each element \( p[i] \) is the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in the permutation up to that point.
   - Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = [-1] * n
        used = set()
        mex = 0
        for i in range(n):
            while mex in used:
                mex += 1
            p[i] = mex
            used.add(p[i])
            a[i] = mex - a[i]
        print(*p)
```

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The given program does not correctly implement the logic to find the \(\texttt{MEX}\) and update the permutation. It uses a reverse approach which can lead to incorrect results.
