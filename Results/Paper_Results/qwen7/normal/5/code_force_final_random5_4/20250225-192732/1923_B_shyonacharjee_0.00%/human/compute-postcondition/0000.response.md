Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^4, and t is now set to the integer value entered by the user.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial condition that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 3 \cdot 10^4\) is preserved, but now `t` specifically holds the integer value entered by the user.
