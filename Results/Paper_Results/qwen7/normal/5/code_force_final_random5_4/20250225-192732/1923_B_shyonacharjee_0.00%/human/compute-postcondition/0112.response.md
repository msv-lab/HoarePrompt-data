Output State: **`total_bullets_used` is increased by `bullets_needed`, `success` is False, `monsters` remains a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions, `i` is `i + 1`, `position` is the first element of the tuple at index `i + 1` in `monsters`, `health` is the second element of the tuple at index `i + 1` in `monsters`, `distance` is `abs(position)`, `time_available` is equal to `distance`, and `bullets_needed` is equal to `health`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This means that the `break` statement causes the loop or conditional block to exit, but none of the variable values are altered by the `break` itself. The values of `total_bullets_used`, `success`, `monsters`, `i`, `position`, `health`, `distance`, and `time_available` remain as they were before the `break` statement was executed.
