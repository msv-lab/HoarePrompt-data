Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `success` is `False`
   - `monsters` remains a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions
   - `n` is an input integer
   - `i` must be between 0 and `n-1` inclusive
   - `position` is the position of the `i`-th monster in the `monsters` list
   - `health` is the health of the `i`-th monster in the `monsters` list
   - `distance` is the absolute value of the position of the `i`-th monster in the `monsters` list
   - `time_available` is equal to `distance`
   - `bullets_needed` is the health of the `i`-th monster
   - `total_bullets_used` is `total_bullets_used` + `bullets_needed`

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues if `i < n`, and at the end of the previous iteration `i` was within the range `[0, n-1]`, the next value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - Therefore, `i` will be updated to `i + 1`.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `success` remains `False` (since it hasn't changed yet)
   - `monsters` remains a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions (no change needed here)
   - `n` remains the same
   - `i` is updated to `i + 1`
   - `position` is now the position of the `(i + 1)`-th monster
   - `health` is now the health of the `(i + 1)`-th monster
   - `distance` is now the absolute value of the position of the `(i + 1)`-th monster
   - `time_available` is now equal to `distance` of the `(i + 1)`-th monster
   - `bullets_needed` is now the health of the `(i + 1)`-th monster
   - `total_bullets_used` is updated to `total_bullets_used + bullets_needed` from the previous iteration

Given these updates, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`success` is False, `monsters` remains a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions, `n` is an input integer, `i` is `i + 1`, `position` is the position of the `(i + 1)`-th monster, `health` is the health of the `(i + 1)`-th monster, `distance` is the absolute value of the position of the `(i + 1)`-th monster, `time_available` is equal to `distance` of the `(i + 1)`-th monster, `bullets_needed` is the health of the `(i + 1)`-th monster, `total_bullets_used` is `total_bullets_used` + `bullets_needed` from the previous iteration**
