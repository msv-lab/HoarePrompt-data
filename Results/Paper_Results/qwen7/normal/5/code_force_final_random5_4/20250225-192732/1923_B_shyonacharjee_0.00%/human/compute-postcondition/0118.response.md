Output State: `success` is False, `monsters` remains a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions, `i` is `n`, `position` is undefined, `health` is undefined, `distance` is undefined, `time_available` is undefined, `bullets_needed` is undefined, `total_bullets_used` is the sum of `bullets_needed` for all iterations.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the loop condition `i < n` will no longer be satisfied since `i` will be incremented up to `n`. The variable `success` remains `False` because it was set to `False` during one of the iterations and never changed afterward. The `monsters` list remains unchanged as no modifications were made to it within the loop. Since the loop has ended, all other variables that were updated inside the loop are no longer relevant and are therefore undefined. The `total_bullets_used` is the sum of the `health` values of all monsters, as each monster's `health` was added to `total_bullets_used` in each iteration.
