Output State: **`total_bullets_used` is 0, `success` is True, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions, `i` is less than `n - 2`, `position` is now the first element of the tuple at index `i + 3` in `monsters`, `health` is now the second element of the tuple at index `i + 3` in `monsters`, `distance` is now `abs(position)` of the tuple at index `i + 3` in `monsters`, `time_available` is now equal to `distance` of the tuple at index `i + 3` in `monsters`, `bullets_needed` is `health` of the tuple at index `i + 3` in `monsters`, `healths` is a list of integers converted from the input split by spaces, `positions` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The variable `success` is directly assigned the value `True` by the code. All other variables retain their previous values and states.
