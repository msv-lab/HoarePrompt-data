Postcondition: `success` is False, `monsters` remains a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions, `i` is `i + 1`, `position` is the position of the `(i + 1)`-th monster, `health` is the health of the `(i + 1)`-th monster, `distance` is the absolute value of the position of the `(i + 1)`-th monster, `time_available` is equal to `distance`, `bullets_needed` is the health of the `(i + 1)`-th monster, and either we break out of the most internal loop or if statement because `total_bullets_used + bullets_needed` exceeds `time_available`.
