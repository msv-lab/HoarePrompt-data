Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 3 \cdot 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `healths` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `positions` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.**

Explanation: The code `positions = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `positions`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `healths` remain unchanged from their initial state.
