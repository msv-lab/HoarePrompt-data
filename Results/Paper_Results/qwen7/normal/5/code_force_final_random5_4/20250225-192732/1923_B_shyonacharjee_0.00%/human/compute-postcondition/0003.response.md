Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 3 \cdot 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `healths` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer using the `map` function. The resulting list of integers is assigned to the variable `healths`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
