Output State: **`total_bullets_used` is increased by `bullets_needed`, `success` is False, `monsters` remains a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions, `i` is `i + 1`, `position` is the first element of the tuple at index `i + 1` in `monsters`, `health` is the second element of the tuple at index `i + 1` in `monsters`, `distance` is `abs(position)`, `time_available` is equal to `distance`, and `bullets_needed` is equal to `health`.**

Explanation: The line `success = False` simply assigns the value `False` to the variable `success`. None of the other variables (`total_bullets_used`, `monsters`, `i`, `position`, `health`, `distance`, `time_available`, `bullets_needed`) are affected by this assignment. Therefore, their previous values remain unchanged.
