Postcondition: **`success` is True, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions, `n` is the first integer input, `i` is less than `n`, `position` is now a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `health` is a list of integers converted from the input, `position` is now updated to be the position from the tuple in the `monsters` list at index `i`, `health` is now updated to be the health from the tuple in the `monsters` list at index `i`, `distance` is the absolute value of the position from the tuple in the `monsters` list at index `i`, `time_available` is equal to `distance`, `bullets_needed` is `health`, `total_bullets_used` is 0, and the total bullets used plus the bullets needed is greater than the time available.**
