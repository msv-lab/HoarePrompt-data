Output State: **`success` is False, `monsters` remains a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions, `i` is `i + 1`, `position` is the position of the `(i + 1)`-th monster, `health` is the health of the `(i + 1)`-th monster, `distance` is the absolute value of the position of the `(i + 1)`-th monster, `time_available` is equal to `distance`, `bullets_needed` is the health of the `(i + 1)`-th monster, and `total_bullets_used` is increased by `bullets_needed`.**

Explanation: The code `total_bullets_used += bullets_needed` increments the value of `total_bullets_used` by the value of `bullets_needed`, which is the health of the `(i + 1)`-th monster. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
