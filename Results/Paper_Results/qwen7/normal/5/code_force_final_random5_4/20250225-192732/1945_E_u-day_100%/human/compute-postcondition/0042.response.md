Output State: `low` is either 0 or one of the previously calculated `mid` values, `high` is either `n` or one of the previously calculated `mid` values, `mid` is the final calculated midpoint value from the last iteration, `pos` is 3, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()` call, and `i` is n; `st` is a set containing all the unique `mid` values calculated during the loop iterations.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, the variable `low` will be the smallest index where `arr[low]` is greater than or equal to `k`, or it will be 0 if no such index exists. Similarly, `high` will be the largest index where `arr[high]` is less than `k`, or it will be `n` if no such index exists. The variable `mid` will hold the final calculated midpoint value from the last iteration of the loop. The variable `st` will contain all the unique midpoint values calculated during the loop iterations. The values of `pos`, `k`, `arr`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
