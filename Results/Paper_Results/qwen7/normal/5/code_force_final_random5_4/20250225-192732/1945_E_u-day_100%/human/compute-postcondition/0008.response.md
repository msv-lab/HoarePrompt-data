Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values at the start of the loop**:
   - `i` is 0 (as given in the postcondition).
   - `n` is a positive integer (as given in the postcondition).

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

4. **Analyze the loop body**: Although the loop body is omitted, we know that the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration.

5. **Update the state after one iteration**:
   - Initially, `i` is 0.
   - After one iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged.

6. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` changes from 0 to 1.
   - `n` remains the same (a positive integer).

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`pos` is -1, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()` call, `i` is 1**
