Postcondition: `pos` is 3, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()` call, and `i` is 3. If `arr[i]` equals `k`, then the values remain unchanged. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition when the if condition is not met.
