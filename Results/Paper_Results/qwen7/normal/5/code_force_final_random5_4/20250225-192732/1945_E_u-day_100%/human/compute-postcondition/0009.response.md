Output State: **`pos` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()` call, `i` is 2**.

Explanation: The code `pos = i` assigns the current value of `i`, which is 1, to `pos`. After this assignment, `i` is incremented by 1, making its new value 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
