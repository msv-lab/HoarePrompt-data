Output State: **`low` is 0, `high` is n, `pos` is 3, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()` call, and `i` is n.**

Explanation: The code initializes two new variables, `low` and `high`, with the values `0` and `n`, respectively. The values of `pos`, `n`, `k`, `arr`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
