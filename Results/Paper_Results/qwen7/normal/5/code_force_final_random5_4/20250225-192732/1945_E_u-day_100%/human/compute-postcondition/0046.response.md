Based on the initial state provided:

- `low` is either 0 or one of the previously calculated `mid` values.
- `high` is either `n` or one of the previously calculated `mid` values.
- `mid` is the final calculated midpoint value from the last iteration.
- `pos` is 3.
- `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n.
- `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()` call.
- `i` is `n`.
- `st` is a set containing all the unique `mid` values calculated during the loop iterations.
- `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`.

The code snippet to execute is:
```python
print(1)
```

This `print` statement simply outputs the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
