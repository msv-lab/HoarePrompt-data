Based on the initial state provided:

- `low` is the smallest index where `arr[low]` is greater than or equal to `k`, or it is 0 if no such index exists.
- `high` is the largest index where `arr[high]` is less than `k`, or it is `n` if no such index exists.
- `mid` is the final calculated midpoint value from the last iteration of the loop.
- `pos` is 3.
- `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n.
- `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()` call.
- `i` is `n`.
- `st` is a set containing all the unique `mid` values calculated during the loop iterations.
- The current value of `arr[low]` is equal to `k`.

The print statement is simply:

```python
print(0)
```

This statement will directly print the integer `0`.

Output: **0**
