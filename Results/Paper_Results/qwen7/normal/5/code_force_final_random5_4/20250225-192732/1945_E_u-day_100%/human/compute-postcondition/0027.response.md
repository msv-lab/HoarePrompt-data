Postcondition: **`low` is either 0 or `mid`, `high` is either `(0 + n) // 2` or `n`, `mid` is `(0 + n) // 2`, `pos` is 3, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()` call, and `i` is n; `st` is a set containing the value `(0 + n) // 2`.**

This postcondition describes the possible states of the variables after the execution of the if-else block. If the condition `arr[mid] > k` is true, then `low` becomes 0 and `high` becomes `(0 + n) // 2`. Otherwise, `low` becomes `mid` and `high` becomes `n`. All other variables retain their original values as specified in the precondition.
