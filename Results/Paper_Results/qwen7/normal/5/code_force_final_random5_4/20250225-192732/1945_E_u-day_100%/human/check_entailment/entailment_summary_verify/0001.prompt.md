You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Anton got bored during the hike and wanted to solve something. He asked Kirill
if he had any new problems, and of course, Kirill had one.

You are given a permutation p of size n , and a number x that needs to be
found. A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers
from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

You decided that you are a cool programmer, so you will use an advanced
algorithm for the search — binary search. However, you forgot that for binary
search, the array must be sorted.

You did not give up and decided to apply this algorithm anyway, and in order
to get the correct answer, you can perform the following operation no more
than 2 times before running the algorithm: choose the indices i , j (1\le i, j
\le n ) and swap the elements at positions i and j .

After that, the binary search is performed. At the beginning of the algorithm,
two variables l = 1 and r = n + 1 are declared. Then the following loop is
executed:

  1. If r - l = 1 , end the loop 
  2. m = \lfloor \frac{r + l}{2} \rfloor 
  3. If p_m \le x , assign l = m , otherwise r = m . 

The goal is to rearrange the numbers in the permutation before the algorithm
so that after the algorithm is executed, p_l is equal to x . It can be shown
that 2 operations are always sufficient.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 2\cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follow
the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x \le n
\le 2\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the permutation and the number to be found.

The second line contains the permutation p separated by spaces (1 \le p_i \le
n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not
exceed 2\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output an integer k (0 \le k \le 2 ) on the first line —
the number of operations performed by you. In the next k lines, output 2
integers i , j (1 \le i, j \le n ) separated by a space, indicating that you
are swapping the elements at positions i and j .

Note that you do not need to minimize the number of operations.

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 3 : The function processes a permutation array `arr` of length `n` and an integer `k` (where 1 ≤ k ≤ n). It first finds the position of `k` in the array. Then, it uses binary search to determine the smallest index `low` where `arr[low]` is greater than or equal to `k`, or 0 if no such index exists. If `arr[low]` equals `k`, it prints `0`. Otherwise, it prints `1`, `low + 1`, and `pos + 1`, where `pos` is the initial position of `k` found earlier. The function does not return any value but modifies the output through print statements.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Problem Description**: We need to find a way to rearrange the permutation `p` using at most 2 swaps such that the element `x` is at position `l` after performing a binary search. The binary search should end with `p[l] == x`.

2. **Binary Search Algorithm**: The binary search algorithm is designed to find the target value `x` in the array `p`. It starts with `l = 1` and `r = n + 1` and repeatedly halves the search interval until it finds the target.

3. **Key Points**:
   - The program should identify the position of `x` in the permutation.
   - It should ensure that the binary search can correctly identify `x` after at most 2 swaps.

### Program Analysis

1. **Function Definitions**:
   - `func_1()`: Reads a line of input and splits it into integers.
   - `func_2()`: Converts the result of `func_1()` into a list of integers.
   - `func_3()`: Implements the main logic for solving the problem.

2. **Main Logic in `func_3()`**:
   - **Step 1**: Read the input values `n` and `k`.
   - **Step 2**: Read the permutation `arr`.
   - **Step 3**: Find the position `pos` of `k` in the permutation.
   - **Step 4**: Initialize `low` and `high` for the binary search.
   - **Step 5**: Perform the binary search:
     - Calculate the middle index `mid`.
     - Add `mid` to a set `st` to avoid infinite loops.
     - Adjust `low` and `high` based on the comparison between `arr[mid]` and `k`.
   - **Step 6**: Check if `arr[low]` equals `k`:
     - If true, print `0` (no swaps needed).
     - Otherwise, print `1` and the positions to swap.

### Issues Identified

1. **Incorrect Binary Search Implementation**:
   - The binary search logic in the provided code does not correctly handle the case where `arr[low]` is not equal to `k` after the initial binary search.
   - The program assumes that the binary search will always find `k` without considering the possibility of needing additional swaps.

2. **Swapping Logic**:
   - The program attempts to swap elements to place `k` at the correct position, but it does not ensure that the binary search will work correctly after the swaps.
   - The logic for determining the positions to swap is not robust and may not always produce the correct result.

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified, the provided program does not correctly implement the solution as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
