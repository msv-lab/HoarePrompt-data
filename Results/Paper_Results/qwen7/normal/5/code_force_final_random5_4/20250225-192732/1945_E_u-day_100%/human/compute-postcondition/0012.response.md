Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `pos` is 1
   - `n` is a positive integer
   - `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n\)
   - `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()` call
   - `i` is 2

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 3.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged because it is determined by the loop head and not modified within the loop body.

5. **Construct the new state**:
   - `pos` remains 1 (no change)
   - `n` remains a positive integer (no change)
   - `k` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n\) (no change)
   - `arr` remains the result of the function `func_2()` call (no change)
   - `i` is now 3

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`pos` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()` call, `i` is 3**
