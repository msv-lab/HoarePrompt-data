Output State: **`low` is either 0 or `mid`, `high` is updated to `(low + high) // 2`, `mid` is updated to `(low + high) // 2`, `pos` is 3, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()` call, and `i` is n; `st` is a set containing the values `(0 + n) // 2` and `mid`.**

Explanation: The code updates `high` to be equal to `mid`. Since `mid` was previously updated to `(low + high) // 2`, both `high` and `mid` now hold the same value, which is `(low + high) // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
