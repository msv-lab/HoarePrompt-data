Output State: **`low` is either 0 or `mid`, `high` is equal to `mid`, `mid` is either `0 + ((0 + n) // 2) // 2` or `mid + ((mid + n) // 2) // 2`, and `st` is a set containing the value of `mid`.**

Explanation: The code `high = mid` assigns the value of `mid` to `high`. All other variables (`low`, `mid`, and `st`) remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `high` is updated to be equal to `mid`, while `low`, `mid`, and `st` retain their original values as described in the initial state.
