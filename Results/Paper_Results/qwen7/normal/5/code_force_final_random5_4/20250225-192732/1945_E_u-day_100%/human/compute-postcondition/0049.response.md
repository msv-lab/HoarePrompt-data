Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies that it works with a permutation array `arr` of length `n` and an integer `k` where 1 ≤ k ≤ n. It returns a specific element from the array `arr` based on the index `k-1`.**

Note: The actual implementation details and logic are not provided here, only the functionality based on the given constraints and output cases.
