Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation array `arr`, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`, and the values of `n` and `k` are the results of the function `func_1()` call.**

This means that the function `func_1()` has been called, and it has returned two values: one for `n` and one for `k`. These values maintain the constraints specified in the initial state, i.e., `n` is a positive integer and `k` is an integer within the range 1 to `n`.
