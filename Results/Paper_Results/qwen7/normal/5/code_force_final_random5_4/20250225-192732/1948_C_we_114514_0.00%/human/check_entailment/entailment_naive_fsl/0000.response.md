Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic for determining if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) is flawed. Here is a counterexample:

Consider the following input:
```
4
4
<<>>
>>>>
```

In this case, the robot starts at (1, 1). It can move left to (1, 0), but since the grid only has columns from 1 to 4, it cannot actually move left from (1, 1). Therefore, the robot should not be able to reach (2, 4), but the program incorrectly prints "YES" because it does not account for the robot being unable to move left from the first column.

The program should check if the robot can move within the bounds of the grid before making the move. Here is a corrected version of the logic:

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test_case in test_cases:
        (n, (row1, row2)) = test_case
        reachable_first_row = True
        reachable_second_row = False
        for j in range(n):
            if reachable_first_row:
                if row1[j] == '>':
                    if j == n - 1:
                        reachable_second_row = True
                else:
                    reachable_first_row = False
                    if j < n - 1 and row2[j] == '>':
                        reachable_second_row = True
            if reachable_second_row:
                if row2[j] == '>':
                    if j == n - 1:
                        reachable_second_row = True
        if reachable_second_row:
            results.append('YES')
        else:
            results.append('NO')
    return results
```

This version ensures that the robot cannot move left from the first column, which is necessary to correctly determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n). However, the original logic still has issues with handling the movement correctly. A more robust solution would involve simulating the robot's movements step-by-step while ensuring it stays within the grid boundaries.
