Output State: **`reachable_second_row` is `True`, `j` is `n - 1`, `n` is a positive integer, the condition `reachable_first_row` is true, and the current value of `row1[j]` is '>'**.

Explanation: The code simply assigns `True` to the variable `reachable_second_row`. This assignment does not affect the values of `j`, `n`, `reachable_first_row`, or the value of `row1[j]`. Therefore, these variables retain their original values from the initial state.
