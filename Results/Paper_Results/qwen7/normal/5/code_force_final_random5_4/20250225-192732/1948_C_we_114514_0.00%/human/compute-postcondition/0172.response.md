Postcondition: `j` is either `n - 1` or `0`, `n` is a positive integer, and the condition `reachable_first_row` is true. If `j` is `n - 1`, the current value of `row1[j]` remains '>', and `reachable_second_row` remains `True`. If `j` is `0`, `reachable_second_row` is determined based on whether `row2[0]` is equal to '>', otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.
