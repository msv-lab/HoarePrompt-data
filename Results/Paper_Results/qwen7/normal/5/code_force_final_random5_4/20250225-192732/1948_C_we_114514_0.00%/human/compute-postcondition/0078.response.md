Postcondition: **`j` will be equal to `n-1`, `reachable_first_row` will be `False`, `reachable_second_row` will be `False`, and the current value of `row2[n-1]` will be '>', assuming that `row2[j]` was '>' for all `j` from 0 to `n-1`. The variable `results` will remain an empty list since it is not modified within the loop, and `t` will also remain unchanged as it is not used within the loop body.**
