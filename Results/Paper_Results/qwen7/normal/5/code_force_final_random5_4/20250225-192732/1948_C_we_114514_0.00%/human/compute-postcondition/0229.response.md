Output State: **The `results` list will contain either 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case in `test_cases`, depending on whether the conditions within the loop were met for each test case.**

In more detail, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `results` list will have been populated with the outcome ('YES' or 'NO') for each test case in `test_cases`. The decision to append 'YES' or 'NO' to `results` is based on whether `reachable_second_row` is `True` after the inner loop completes for each test case. If `reachable_second_row` is `True` for a given test case, the corresponding entry in `results` will be 'YES'; otherwise, it will be 'NO'. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop. The variables `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` are reset for each test case, ensuring that the outcome for each test case is independent of the others.
