Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `results` is an empty list, t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; each test case in test_cases is a list containing three elements: an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and n is even), and two strings representing the first and second rows of the grid, where each string consists of exactly n characters that are either '<' or '>'.
Code of the loop:
for test_case in test_cases:
    n, (row1, row2) = test_case
    reachable_first_row = True
    reachable_second_row = False
    for j in range(n):
        if reachable_first_row:
            if row1[j] == '>':
                if j == n - 1:
                    reachable_second_row = True
            else:
                reachable_first_row = False
                if j < n - 1 and row2[j] == '>':
                    reachable_second_row = True
        if reachable_second_row:
            if row2[j] == '>':
                if j == n - 1:
                    reachable_second_row = True
    if reachable_second_row:
        results.append('YES')
    else:
        results.append('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After executing the if-else block, `j` will be equal to `n-1`, `reachable_first_row` will be `False`, and `reachable_second_row` will be either `True` or `False`. `row2[j]` will be '>', `results` will either contain ['YES'] or ['NO'], and `t` will remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `j` equals `n`, `reachable_second_row` is either `True` or `False` based on the if condition, `reachable_first_row` remains in its last known state from the loop's final iteration, and `results` is a list containing either `['YES']` or `['NO']`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `j` is `n - 1`, `n` is a positive integer, `reachable_first_row` is `True` if `row1[n-1]` is `'>'`, otherwise it is `False`, `reachable_second_row` is `True` if `reachable_second_row` was `True` before the if else block, otherwise it is `False`, `results` list contains either `'YES'` or `'NO'` depending on the condition inside the if else block.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
