Postcondition: `j` is 1, `n` is a valid integer from the `test_cases` list, `reachable_first_row` is false, `reachable_second_row` is true, and the current value of `row2[0]` is '>', regardless of whether `j` equals `n - 1` or not, and if `j < n - 1` and `row2[j] == '>'`, no changes are made to these conditions; otherwise, the conditions remain as initially stated.
