Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `j` is less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is 1
   - `n` is a valid integer from the `test_cases` list
   - `reachable_first_row` is false
   - `reachable_second_row` is true
   - The current value of `row2[0]` is '>'

4. **Loop body behavior**:
   - If `j < n - 1` and `row2[j] == '>'`, no changes are made.
   - Otherwise, the conditions remain as initially stated.

5. **Next iteration**:
   - Since `j` is currently 1, the next value of `j` will be 2 (assuming `n` is at least 3).
   - We need to check if `j < n - 1` and `row2[j] == '>'`. Given the initial state, `row2[1]` (which corresponds to `j = 1`) is '>', so no changes are made.
   - The conditions `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` remain unchanged unless the loop body modifies them, but since no such modification is specified, they stay as they are.

6. **Adjusting the states**:
   - `j` will be incremented to 2.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `reachable_first_row` remains false.
   - `reachable_second_row` remains true.
   - `row2[0]` remains '>'.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`j` is 2, `n` is a valid integer from the `test_cases` list, `reachable_first_row` is false, `reachable_second_row` is true, and the current value of `row2[0]` is '>'**.
