Output State: **`j` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `reachable_first_row` is `False`, `reachable_second_row` is `True`**.

Explanation: The line `reachable_second_row = True` updates the value of `reachable_second_row` to `True`. All other variables (`j`, `n`, `reachable_first_row`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
