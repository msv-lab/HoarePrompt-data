Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`), and for each test case, it reads the dimensions `n` and the two rows of the grid (`row1` and `row2`). This part is handled correctly.

2. **Function `func_1` Logic**:
   - The function iterates through each test case and checks if the robot can reach the cell `(2, n)` using the given grid configuration.
   - It maintains two flags: `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` to track whether the robot can stay in the first row or move to the second row.
   - The logic for determining if the robot can move from the first row to the second row seems flawed. Specifically:
     - If the robot is in the first row and encounters a `'>`' arrow, it should check if it can move to the second row. However, the current implementation only checks if the next column has a `'>`' arrow without considering the possibility of moving down to the second row.
     - The flag `reachable_second_row` is only set to `True` if the robot can move to the next column with a `'>`' arrow, but this does not account for the robot's movement down to the second row.
   - The logic for checking if the robot can stay in the second row is also incomplete. It only checks if the current column has a `'>`' arrow and does not consider the possibility of moving further to the right.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases where the robot might get stuck in a loop or cannot move to the desired cell `(2, n)` due to the configuration of arrows.

Given these observations, the provided solution does not correctly implement the logic to determine if the robot can reach the cell `(2, n)`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
