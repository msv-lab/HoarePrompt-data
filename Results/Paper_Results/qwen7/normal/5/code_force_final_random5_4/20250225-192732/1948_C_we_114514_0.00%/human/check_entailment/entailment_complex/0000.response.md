Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly parses the input and organizes it into a list of test cases.
2. The `func_1` function iterates through each test case and checks if the robot can reach the cell (2, n).
3. The logic in `func_1` is designed to check if the robot can move from the first row to the second row by moving right and following the arrows. However, there is a flaw in the logic for determining if the robot can move from the first row to the second row.

Specifically, the logic for transitioning from the first row to the second row is flawed. The current implementation only checks if the current cell in the first row has a right arrow (`>`), and if the next cell in the second row also has a right arrow. This is not sufficient to ensure that the robot can transition from the first row to the second row.

To fix this, the logic should ensure that the robot can move from the first row to the second row by checking if there is a sequence of right arrows in the first row that leads to a column where the robot can move down to the second row.

Given the provided example and the expected output, the current logic does not accurately reflect the required behavior. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
