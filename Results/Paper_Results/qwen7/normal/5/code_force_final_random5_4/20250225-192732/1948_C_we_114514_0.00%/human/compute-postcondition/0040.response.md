Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` is a valid integer from the `test_cases` list, `reachable_first_row` is false, `reachable_second_row` is true, and the current value of `row2[0]` is '>'**.

Explanation: The code sets `reachable_first_row` to `False`. This changes the value of `reachable_first_row` but does not affect the values of `j`, `n`, `reachable_second_row`, or the value of `row2[0]`.
