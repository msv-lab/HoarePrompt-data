Postcondition: `j` is an integer, `n` is a positive integer. If `reachable_first_row` is true, then:
- If `j` is `n - 1` and `row1[j]` is '>', `j` remains `n - 1` and `reachable_second_row` remains `True`.
- If `j` is 0 and `reachable_first_row` is false, `j` remains 0.
- If `j` is between 0 and `n - 1` (inclusive) and `row1[j]` is '>', `j` is incremented by 1 and `reachable_second_row` becomes `True`.
Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.
