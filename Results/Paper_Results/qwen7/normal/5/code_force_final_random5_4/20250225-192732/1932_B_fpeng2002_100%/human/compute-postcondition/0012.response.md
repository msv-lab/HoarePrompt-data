Output State: `num_tests` is greater than -1 but less than or equal to 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `start_year` is the result of iteratively applying the formula `start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` for each `x` in the range from 0 to the length of `nums` minus one.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `start_year` will be the final value obtained by repeatedly updating it based on the elements of the `nums` list according to the given formula. The other variables (`num_tests`, `n`, and `nums`) will retain their initial conditions and the state they had after the third iteration.
