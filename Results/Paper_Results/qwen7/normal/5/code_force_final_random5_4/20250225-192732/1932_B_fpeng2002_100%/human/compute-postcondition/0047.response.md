Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. It then calculates a value `start_year` by iteratively applying the formula `(start_year // a_i + 1) * a_i` for each element `a_i` in the list, starting with `start_year` initialized to 0. After processing all test cases, it prints the final `start_year` value for each test case.**
