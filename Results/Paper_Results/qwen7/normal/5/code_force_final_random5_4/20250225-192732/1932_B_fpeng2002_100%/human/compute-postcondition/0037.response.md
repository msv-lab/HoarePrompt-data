Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `x` is 0
- `start_year` is `(start_year // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0]`

### Loop Head
The loop is defined as:
```python
for x in range(0, len(nums)):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Variable `x`:**
   - The loop iterates over the range from 0 to `len(nums) - 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `x` is 0.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `x` needs to be incremented to 1.

2. **Variable `start_year`:**
   - The value of `start_year` is determined by the expression `(start_year // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0]`.
   - This expression does not depend on the loop variable `x`, but rather on the initial value of `start_year` and the first element of the list `nums`.
   - Since the loop body is omitted, we cannot determine if `start_year` changes within the loop. Therefore, the value of `start_year` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.

### Conclusion
The only variable that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is `x`.

### Updated State
- `x` is 1 (since it needs to be incremented from 0 to 1 for the next iteration)
- `start_year` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

### Final Answer
State: **`x` is 1, `start_year` is `(start_year // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0]`**
