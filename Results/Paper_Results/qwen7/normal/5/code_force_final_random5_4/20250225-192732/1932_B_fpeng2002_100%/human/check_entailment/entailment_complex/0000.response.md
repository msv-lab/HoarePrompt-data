Reasoning:
The annotated program describes a function that correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the function is correct:

1. **Initialization**: The function initializes `num_tests` by reading the number of test cases from the input. This is done correctly.
2. **Loop Through Test Cases**: The function uses a `while` loop to process each test case. For each test case, it decreases `num_tests` by 1, ensuring that the loop runs exactly `t` times.
3. **Reading Input for Each Test Case**: For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `nums`.
4. **Calculating the Start Year**: The function initializes `start_year` to 0. It then iterates through the list `nums` and updates `start_year` using the formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`. This formula ensures that `start_year` is the smallest year in which all previous signs have occurred and the current sign can start occurring.
5. **Output**: After processing all test cases, the function prints the final `start_year` for each test case.

Given the problem description and the provided example, the function correctly calculates the year in which the nth sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen. The logic used in the function matches the requirements of the problem.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **True**
