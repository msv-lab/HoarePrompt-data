Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `x` and `nums`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop iterates over the range from `0` to `len(nums)`.
   - For each iteration, `x` takes on values from `0` to `len(nums) - 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `num_tests` is `0`.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least one element.
   - `x` is `0`.
   - `start_year` is `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `x` starts from `0` and the loop increments `x` by `1` in each iteration, the next value of `x` will be `1`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `x` should be less than `len(nums)`.
   - Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be `1` and `nums` must have at least one element.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `num_tests` remains `0` because the loop body is omitted and no operations are performed on `num_tests`.
   - `n` remains the same as it is not involved in the loop.
   - `nums` must still have at least one element.
   - `x` is updated to `1`.
   - `start_year` is recalculated based on the new value of `x` (which is `1`). However, since the exact value of `start_year` is not given and the loop body is omitted, we don't need to update `start_year` explicitly unless there are specific operations inside the loop that affect it.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`num_tests` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `x` is 1, `start_year` is `(start_year // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1]`**
