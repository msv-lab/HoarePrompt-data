Output State: **`x` is 0; `start_year` is `(start_year // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0]`**

Explanation: The variable `x` is initially set to 0. The code updates `start_year` to the value of `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`. Since `x` is 0, this expression becomes `(start_year // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0]`. The values of `start_year` and `nums` remain unchanged except for the new value of `start_year` based on the given expression.
