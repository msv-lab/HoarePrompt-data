Output State: **`num_tests` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces, `start_year` is the final value calculated after iterating through all elements in `nums` using the formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` for each `x` in the range of `len(nums)`**.

Explanation: The code takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element into an integer, storing these integers in the list `nums`. The variables `num_tests` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states. The calculation for `start_year` will be performed later when the list `nums` is iterated over, but the structure and initial value of `start_year` remain as described.
