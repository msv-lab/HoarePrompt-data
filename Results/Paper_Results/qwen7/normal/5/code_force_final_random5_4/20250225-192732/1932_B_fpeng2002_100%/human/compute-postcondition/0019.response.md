Output State: **`num_tests` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces, `start_year` is 0**

Explanation: The code sets `start_year` to 0. This initializes `start_year` to a specific value, which overrides its previous value (which was calculated as the final value after iterating through all elements in `nums`). All other variables remain unchanged.
