Output State: `num_tests` is greater than -1 but less than or equal to 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `start_year` is the final value calculated after iterating through all elements in `nums` using the formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` for each `x` in the range of `len(nums)`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `start_year` will be the result of applying the given formula to each element in the `nums` list sequentially, starting from the first element and updating `start_year` accordingly until all elements have been processed.
