Output State: The loop will have executed `t` times, where `t` is the initial value of `data[0]`. After all iterations, `index` will be increased by `1 + n * t`, where `n` is the integer value of `data[index]` for each iteration. `results` will be a list containing the return values of `func_1(array)` for each iteration. Each `array` is a list of integers extracted from `data` starting from `index` and having length `n` for each iteration. `t` will be reduced to 0 after all iterations, and `n` will be the integer value of `data[index]` for the last iteration.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `index` will have advanced through the `data` list by a total of `1 + n * t`, `results` will contain the outcomes of applying `func_1` to `array` for each iteration, and `t` will be 0.
