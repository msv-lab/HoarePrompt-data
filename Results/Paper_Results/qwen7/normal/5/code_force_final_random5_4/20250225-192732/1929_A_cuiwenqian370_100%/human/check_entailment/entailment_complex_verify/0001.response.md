### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Analysis:**
   - The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements, i.e., \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).

2. **Given Code Explanation:**
   - **func_1(array):**
     - This function sorts the array.
     - It calculates the beauty of the array using the sorted order.
     - The beauty is calculated as the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements.
   - **func_2():**
     - This function reads input from stdin.
     - It processes multiple test cases.
     - For each test case, it calls `func_1` with the array and appends the result to a list.
     - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

3. **Reasoning:**
   - **Sorting the Array:**
     - Sorting the array ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are minimized when the array is in ascending or descending order.
     - For a sorted array \([a_1, a_2, ..., a_n]\), the beauty is \(\sum_{i=2}^{n} |a_i - a_{i-1}|\).
     - In the worst case, this would be \((a_n - a_1)\) if the array is sorted in ascending or descending order.
   - **Maximizing Beauty:**
     - To maximize the beauty, we should consider the differences between the smallest and largest elements.
     - By sorting the array, we ensure that the largest difference is between the smallest and largest elements, which maximizes the beauty.
   - **Handling Multiple Test Cases:**
     - The `func_2` function correctly handles multiple test cases by reading input and processing each one separately.
     - It uses `func_1` to calculate the beauty for each test case and prints the results.

4. **Annotated Code Evaluation:**
   - The annotations in the code are somewhat misleading. They suggest that the `beauty` value is 15, `i` is 4, and the array length is greater than 4 after the loop, which is not necessarily true for all inputs.
   - The actual behavior of the code is to sort the array and then calculate the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements, which aligns with the problem requirements.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The given code correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array by sorting it and calculating the sum of differences between consecutive elements.
   - The approach is sound and should work for all valid inputs as per the problem description.
