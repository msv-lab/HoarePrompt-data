You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(array):
    array.sort()
    beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, len(array)):
        beauty += abs(array[i] - array[i - 1])
    return beauty

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        array = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = func_1(array)
        results.append(result)
    for result in results:
        print(result)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function processes `t` test cases, each involving an array of `n` integers. For each test case, it calls `func_1(array)` to calculate the maximum beauty of the array and stores the result in the `results` list. After processing all test cases, it prints each result in the `results` list. The final state of the program includes `t` being 0, `results` containing the calculated maximum beauties for each test case, and `index` pointing to the position right after the last processed data.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the given code step by step to determine if the solution is correct.

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements, i.e., \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).

### Given Code Explanation
1. **func_1(array):**
   - This function sorts the array.
   - It calculates the beauty of the array using the sorted order.
   - The beauty is calculated as the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements.

2. **func_2():**
   - This function reads input from stdin.
   - It processes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1` with the array and appends the result to a list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

### Reasoning
1. **Sorting the Array:**
   - Sorting the array ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are minimized when the array is in ascending or descending order.
   - For a sorted array \([a_1, a_2, ..., a_n]\), the beauty is \(\sum_{i=2}^{n} |a_i - a_{i-1}|\).
   - In the worst case, this would be \((a_n - a_1)\) if the array is sorted in ascending or descending order.

2. **Maximizing Beauty:**
   - To maximize the beauty, we should consider the differences between the smallest and largest elements.
   - By sorting the array, we ensure that the largest difference is between the smallest and largest elements, which maximizes the beauty.

3. **Handling Multiple Test Cases:**
   - The `func_2` function correctly handles multiple test cases by reading input and processing each one separately.
   - It uses `func_1` to calculate the beauty for each test case and prints the results.

### Conclusion
The given code correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array by sorting it and calculating the sum of differences between consecutive elements. The approach is sound and should work for all valid inputs as per the problem description.
