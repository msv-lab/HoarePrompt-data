Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `index` is 1, `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `array` is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^9], `results` is now an empty list, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    array = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
    index += n
    result = func_1(array)
    results.append(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `data[0]` must be a positive integer; `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `index` is increased by 1 + `n`; `array` is a list of integers obtained from `data[index - n:index]`; `result` is the return value of `func_1(array)`; `results` is a list to which `result` has been appended.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `data[0]` must be a positive integer; `index` is increased by `4 + n`; `result` is the return value of `func_1(array)`, `results` is a list to which `result` has been appended; `t` is decreased by 1; `n` is the integer value of `data[index - n]`; `array` is now updated to `list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))`; `results` is a list with an additional element `result`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `data[0]` must be a positive integer; `index` is increased by `5 + n + n`; `result` is the return value of `func_1(array)`, `results` is a list to which `result` has been appended; `t` is greater than 0; `array` is now updated to `list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))`; `results` is a list with an additional element `result`; `n` is the integer value of `data[index - n]`; `array` is now a list of integers extracted from `data` starting from `index` and having length `n`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
