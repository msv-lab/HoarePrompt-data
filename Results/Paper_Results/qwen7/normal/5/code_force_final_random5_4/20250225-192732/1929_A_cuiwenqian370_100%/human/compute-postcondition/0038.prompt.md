You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases; n is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 100 representing the length of the array; array is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^9]; results is a list to store the maximum beauty for each test case.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        array = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        
        index += n
        
        result = func_1(array)
        
        results.append(result)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will have executed `t` times. After all iterations, `index` will be increased by `1 + t*n`, where `t` is the initial value of `data[0]` converted to an integer, and `n` is the sum of `n` values specified in `data` for each iteration. `results` will be a list containing the return values of `func_1(array)` for each iteration. The final state of `t` will be 0, as it is decremented by 1 after each iteration until it reaches 0. `array` will be updated in each iteration based on the current value of `n` and the slice of `data` starting from `index` and having length `n`. `n` itself will be updated at the start of each iteration to the integer value of `data[index]`, and `index` will be incremented accordingly after each iteration.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `index` will point to the position right after the last processed data, `t` will be 0, `results` will contain the outputs of `func_1(array)` for each iteration, and `array` will be updated in each iteration based on the current value of `n` and the corresponding slice of `data`.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `t` will be 0, `results` will be a list containing the outputs of `func_1(array)` for each iteration, `index` will point to the position right after the last processed data, `array` will be updated in each iteration based on the current value of `n` and the corresponding slice of `data`, and `data` must be a list containing integers. The final state of `t` will be 0, as it is decremented by 1 after each iteration until it reaches 0. `results` will contain the outputs of `func_1(array)` for each iteration, and `array` will be updated in each iteration based on the current value of `n` and the corresponding slice of `data`. `index` will be increased by `1 + t*n` after all iterations, where `t` is the initial value of `data[0]` converted to an integer, and `n` is the sum of `n` values specified in `data` for each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes `t` test cases, each involving an array of `n` integers. It calculates the maximum beauty for each test case and stores these values in the `results` list.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
