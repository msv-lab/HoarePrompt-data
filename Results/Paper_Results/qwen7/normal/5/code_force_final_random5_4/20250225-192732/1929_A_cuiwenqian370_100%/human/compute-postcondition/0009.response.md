Output State: **`data[0]` must be a positive integer; `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `index` is increased by 1 + `n`; `array` is a list of integers obtained from `data[index - n:index]`.**

Explanation: The code `index += n` increases the value of `index` by `n`. The other variables (`data[0]`, `n`, and `array`) remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `index` is now `index + n`, and `array` is still a list of integers obtained from `data[index - n:index]`.
