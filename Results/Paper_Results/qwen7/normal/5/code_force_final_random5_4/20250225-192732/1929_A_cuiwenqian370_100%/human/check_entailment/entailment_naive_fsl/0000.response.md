Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the `func_1` function calculates the beauty of the array by sorting it and then computing the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements. However, this approach does not guarantee the maximum beauty because sorting does not necessarily maximize the sum of differences.

To illustrate, consider the following input:

- **Input:**
  ```
  2
  5
  100 54 80 43 90
  3
  2 1 3
  ```

- **Expected Output:**
  ```
  57
  2
  ```

- **Actual Output using `func_1`:**
  ```
  57
  2
  ```

While the output for the first test case is correct, the output for the second test case is incorrect. The correct maximum beauty for the array `[1, 2, 3]` is `2`, but `func_1` returns `2` after sorting, which is also `2`. However, the correct rearrangement to maximize the beauty is `[3, 1, 2]`, which gives a beauty of `(3 - 1) + (1 - 2) = 2 - 1 - 1 = 0`.

Therefore, the program does not handle all cases correctly, making it incorrect.
