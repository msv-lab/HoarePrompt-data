Output State: **`data[0]` must be a positive integer; `index` is increased by `5 + n + n`; `result` is the return value of `func_1(array)`, `results` is a list to which `result` has been appended; `t` is greater than 0; `array` is now updated to `list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))`; `results` is a list with an additional element `result`; `n` is the integer value of `data[index - n]`; `array` is now a list of integers extracted from `data` starting from `index` and having length `n`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `results.append(result)` appends the value of `result` to the list `results`. Since `result` was already part of the conditions before the code execution, appending it does not change its value or the fact that it is the return value of `func_1(array)`. The other variables (`data[0]`, `index`, `t`, `array`, `n`) remain unchanged as the code does not modify them directly. Therefore, the output state remains as described in the initial state with the addition that `results` now contains one more element, which is `result`.
