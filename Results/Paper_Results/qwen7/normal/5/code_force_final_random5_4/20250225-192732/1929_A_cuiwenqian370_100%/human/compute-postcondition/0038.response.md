Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, each involving an array of `n` integers. For each test case, it calls `func_1(array)` to calculate the maximum beauty of the array and stores the result in the `results` list. After processing all test cases, it prints each result in the `results` list. The final state of the program includes `t` being 0, `results` containing the calculated maximum beauties for each test case, and `index` pointing to the position right after the last processed data.**
