### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: 
   - The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array, which is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the array.
   - To maximize the beauty, the optimal strategy is to sort the array and then compute the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements. This is because sorting ensures that the largest differences are between the smallest and largest elements, thus maximizing the beauty.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` sorts the input array and then computes the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
   - The provided state information indicates that the function correctly computes the beauty of the sorted array, which is the intended behavior.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2` reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It correctly handles the reading of multiple test cases and arrays, sorts each array, and computes the beauty using `func_1`.
   - The final results are printed correctly.

4. **Overall Program Correctness**:
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases.
   - Each test case is processed independently, and the correct beauty is computed for each array.
   - The results are printed in the correct order.

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem statement.
