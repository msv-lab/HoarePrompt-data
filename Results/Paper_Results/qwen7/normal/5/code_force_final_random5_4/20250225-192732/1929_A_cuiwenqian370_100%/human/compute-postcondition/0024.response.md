Output State: **`data[0]` must be a positive integer; `index` is increased by `5 + n + n`; `result` is the return value of `func_1(array)`, `results` is a list to which `result` has been appended; `t` is decreased by 1; `n` is the integer value of `data[index - n]`; `array` is now updated to `list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))`; `results` is a list with an additional element `result`; `t` is greater than 0; `array` is now a list of integers extracted from `data` starting from `index` and having length `n`.**

Explanation: The code `result = func_1(array)` assigns the return value of `func_1(array)` to the variable `result`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state, except for `index` which is increased by `5 + n + n`, and `t` which is decreased by 1. The value of `n` remains the integer value of `data[index - n]`, and `array` is updated to be a list of integers extracted from `data` starting from `index` and having length `n`. The `results` list now contains an additional element, which is the `result` of `func_1(array)`.
