Output State: `ans` is the concatenation of all `s[i]` values where `(i, j)` pairs are taken from the list `d` until `d` becomes empty, `i` is the first value of each tuple in `d`, `j` is the second value of each tuple in `d`, `d` is an empty list of tuples sorted by the maximum depth of nested parentheses and then by negative index, and `ans` is a string resulting from the concatenation of all selected `s[i]` values.

In simpler terms, `ans` will contain the concatenation of all substrings from `s` starting at the indices specified by the tuples in `d`, in the order they appear in `d`. After all iterations, `d` will be an empty list, and `ans` will hold the final concatenated result.
