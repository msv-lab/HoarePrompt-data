Output State: **`i` is 0; `len(s)` is `n`; `d[i + 1]` is `d[1]` which is 1.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `d[i + 1]` to `d[i] + 1`. Given that `i` is 0, `d[i + 1]` becomes `d[1]` and is assigned the value of `d[0] + 1`. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `d[0]`, we assume it to be 0 (a common default value for uninitialized variables). Therefore, `d[1]` is set to `0 + 1`, which is 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
