Output State: **`i` is 0; `len(s)` is `n`; `d[i + 1]` is `d[1]` and its value is `d[0] - 1`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `d[i + 1]` to `d[i] - 1`. Given that `i` is initially 0, `d[i + 1]` becomes `d[1]` and its value is set to `d[0] - 1`. The other variables (`i`, `len(s)`, and `s[i]`) remain unchanged.
