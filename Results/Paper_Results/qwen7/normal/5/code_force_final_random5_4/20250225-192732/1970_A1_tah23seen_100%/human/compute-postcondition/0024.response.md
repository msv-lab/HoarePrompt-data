Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `len(s)` is `n`, `d[n]` is the maximum depth of nested parentheses in the string `s`, and `d` is a list with one less element than before because `d.pop(n)` removed the element at index `n`, and `ans` remains an empty string.**

Explanation: The code `d.pop(n)` removes the element at index `n` from the list `d`. This means that `d[n]` no longer exists, and the length of `d` is reduced by one. The other variables (`i`, `len(s)`, and `ans`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
