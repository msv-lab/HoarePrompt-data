Output State: **`i` is 2, `len(s)` is `n`, `d[2]` is `d[1] + 1`, `d[3]` is `d[2] + 1`**

Explanation: The code `d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1` updates the dictionary `d` such that the value of `d[3]` (since `i + 1` equals 3) is set to the value of `d[2]` plus 1. Given that `d[2]` is either `d[1] + 1` if `s[2] == '('` or `d[1] - 1` if `s[2] != '('`, the updated value of `d[3]` will be `d[2] + 1`. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
