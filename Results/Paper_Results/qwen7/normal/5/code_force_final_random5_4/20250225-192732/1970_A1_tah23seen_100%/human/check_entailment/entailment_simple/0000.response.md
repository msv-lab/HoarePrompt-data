Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input string `s`.
2. It defines a function `func_1` to perform the required operations.
3. Inside `func_1`, it creates a dictionary `d` to store the balance at each index of the string `s`.
4. The dictionary `d` is populated with the balance of the prefix up to each character.
5. After populating `d`, it removes the entry for the last index (`n`) and sorts the dictionary items based on the balance and position.
6. Finally, it constructs the balanced shuffle by concatenating characters from `s` based on the sorted indices stored in `d`.

However, there is a critical issue in the implementation:
- The function does not handle the case where multiple entries in the dictionary `d` have the same balance but different positions. According to the problem statement, when sorting, if two entries have the same balance, they should be sorted in decreasing order of position. The current implementation uses a lambda function that sorts by balance and then by negative position, which does not guarantee that positions are sorted in decreasing order when balances are equal.

To fix this, the sorting should explicitly handle the case where balances are equal by sorting positions in descending order. Here's the corrected part of the code:

```python
d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]), reverse=True)
```

With this correction, the function should work as intended.

Given the provided code, the current implementation does not fully meet the requirements due to the sorting issue. Therefore, the correctness of the provided program is:

Correctness: **False**
