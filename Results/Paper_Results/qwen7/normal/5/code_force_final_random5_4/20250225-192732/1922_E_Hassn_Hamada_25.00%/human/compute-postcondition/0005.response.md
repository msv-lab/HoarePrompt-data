Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition:**
   The loop condition is `(1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number`.

2. **Understand the Loop Head Variables:**
   The variables involved in the loop head are `size` and `number`.

3. **Initial States:**
   - `number` is a positive integer.
   - `sequence` is a list of integers with size 0 (this is not relevant to the loop condition).
   - `size` is 1.

4. **Evaluate the Loop Condition with Initial Values:**
   - When `size = 1`, the expression becomes `(1 << (1 + 1)) - 1 <= number`.
   - Simplifying, this is `(1 << 2) - 1 <= number`, which is `3 <= number`.

5. **Determine Necessary Adjustments:**
   - For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `3 <= number` must be true.
   - Since `number` is initially a positive integer, it could be any positive integer.
   - To ensure the loop executes, `number` must be at least 3.

### Conclusion:
The only variable in the loop head that needs adjustment is `number`. It must be at least 3 for the loop to execute the first time.

### Final Answer:
State: **`number` must be at least 3, `sequence` is a list of integers with size 0, `size` is 1**
