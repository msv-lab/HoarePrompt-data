Output State: **`sequence` has the last element appended with the value of `i`, and `i` retains its previous value.**

Explanation: The line `sequence.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` to the list `sequence`. The value of `i` remains unchanged after this operation. Therefore, the updated state includes that `sequence` now contains its previous elements plus the current value of `i`, and `i` retains its original value.
