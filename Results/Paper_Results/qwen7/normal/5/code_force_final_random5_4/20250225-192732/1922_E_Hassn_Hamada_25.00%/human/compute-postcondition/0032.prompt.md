You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: number is a positive integer and sequence is a list of integers.
def func_1(number, sequence):
    """
    Generates a sequence of numbers based on the input number.

    Args:
        number (int): The input number to generate sequence for
        sequence (List[int]): The output sequence 

    Returns: 
        int: The size of generated sequence
    """
    if (number == 0) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State: number is a positive integer, sequence is a list of integers with size 0
    size = 1
    while (1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number:
        size += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `number` must be at least 31, `sequence` is a list of integers with size 0, `size` is 5.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop continues to increment `size` as long as `(1 << size + 1) - 1` is less than or equal to `number`. After each iteration, `size` increases by 1. Starting from `size = 1`, the condition will hold true until `size = 5`, where `(1 << 5 + 1) - 1 = 63` would break the condition if `number` is 31 or less. Therefore, after all iterations, `size` will be 5, and `number` must be at least 31 for the loop to have completed all its iterations.
    for i in range(size):
        sequence.append(i)
        
    #State: Output State: `sequence` is `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`, `i` is `4`, and `size` is `5`.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `size` reaches 5, meaning the loop runs 5 times. In each iteration, `i` increments by 1 starting from 0, so after 5 iterations, `i` will be 4. During these iterations, `sequence` is populated with integers from 0 to 4, resulting in `sequence` being `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`.
    result = func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)
    for i in range(size):
        assert -len(sequence) <= -result - i - 1 <= -1
        
        sequence[-result - i - 1] += result
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is 7, `size` is 5, the element at index `-result - i - 1` in `sequence` is incremented by `result`.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop runs from `i` starting at 4 up to `size` which is 5. Therefore, the loop will run 6 times in total (from 4 to 9 inclusive). After 3 iterations, `i` is 5. Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, after all 6 iterations, `i` will be 7. The condition inside the loop modifies the `sequence` array based on the current value of `i` and `result`. Given that the modification happens in every iteration and the loop runs 6 times, the final value of `i` will be 7, and the specified element in `sequence` will be incremented by `result` 6 times.
    return size + result
    #The program returns 11, where `result` is 6 and `size` is 5.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: `number`, which is a positive integer, and `sequence`, which is a list of integers. It returns 0 in Case_1, and 11 in Case_2, where `result` is 6 and `size` is 5.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 0

Case_2: The program returns 11, where `result` is 6 and `size` is 5.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
