Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `number`, a positive integer, and `sequence`, a list of integers. It generates a sequence of integers and modifies the `sequence` list based on certain conditions. If `number` is 0, it returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates the size of the sequence, populates the `sequence` list with integers from 0 to 4, and recursively calls itself. Finally, it returns the sum of the calculated `size` and `result`, where `result` is determined by the recursive call and the modifications made to the `sequence` list.**
