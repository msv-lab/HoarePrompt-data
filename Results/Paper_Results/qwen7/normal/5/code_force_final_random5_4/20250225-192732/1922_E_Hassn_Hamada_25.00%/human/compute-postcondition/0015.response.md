Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `size`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `size`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `sequence` has the last element appended with the value of `i`.
   - `i` retains its previous value.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 at each iteration, `i` will increase by 1 for the next iteration.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must still be less than `size`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - `sequence` will have the last element appended with the new value of `i`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated value of `i` and the condition for the loop to continue.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`sequence` has the last element appended with the value of `i+1`, and `i` is incremented by 1.** 

In terms of the exact values:
- `i` will be `i + 1`.
- `sequence` will have the last element appended with `i + 1`.

So, if `i` was previously `k`, then at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be `k + 1`.
- `sequence` will have the last element appended with `k + 1`.

Therefore, the state can be generalized as:
State: **`sequence` has the last element appended with the value of `i+1`, and `i` is incremented by 1.**
