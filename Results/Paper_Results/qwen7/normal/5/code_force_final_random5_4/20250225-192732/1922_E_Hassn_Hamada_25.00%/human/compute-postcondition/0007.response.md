Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Identify the Loop Condition:**
   The loop condition is given by:
   \[
   (1 << size + 1) - 1 \leq number
   \]
   This condition checks if the left-hand side expression is less than or equal to `number`.

2. **Current States:**
   - `number` must be at least 3.
   - `sequence` is a list of integers with size 0.
   - `size` is 2.

3. **Evaluate the Loop Condition with Current Values:**
   - Substitute `size = 2` into the condition:
     \[
     (1 << (2 + 1)) - 1 \leq number
     \]
     Simplifying this:
     \[
     (1 << 3) - 1 \leq number
     \]
     \[
     8 - 1 \leq number
     \]
     \[
     7 \leq number
     \]

4. **Determine the Next State:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the condition must still hold true after the next iteration.
   - Since `number` must be at least 3 initially, and the condition requires `number` to be at least 7, `number` must be at least 7 for the loop to continue.

5. **Adjust the States:**
   - The only variable involved in the loop condition is `number`.
   - Therefore, `number` must be at least 7 for the loop to execute one more time.

### Final Answer

State: **`number` must be at least 7, `sequence` is a list of integers with size 0, `size` is 2**
