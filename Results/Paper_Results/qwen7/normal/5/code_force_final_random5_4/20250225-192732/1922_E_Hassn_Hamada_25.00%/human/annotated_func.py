    #State: Output State: `number` must be at least 31, `sequence` is a list of integers with size 0, `size` is 5.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop continues to increment `size` as long as `(1 << size + 1) - 1` is less than or equal to `number`. After each iteration, `size` increases by 1. Starting from `size = 1`, the condition will hold true until `size = 5`, where `(1 << 5 + 1) - 1 = 63` would break the condition if `number` is 31 or less. Therefore, after all iterations, `size` will be 5, and `number` must be at least 31 for the loop to have completed all its iterations.

        sequence.append(i)
        
    #State: Output State: `sequence` is `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`, `i` is `4`, and `size` is `5`.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `size` reaches 5, meaning the loop runs 5 times. In each iteration, `i` increments by 1 starting from 0, so after 5 iterations, `i` will be 4. During these iterations, `sequence` is populated with integers from 0 to 4, resulting in `sequence` being `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`.
    result = func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)
    for i in range(size):
        assert -len(sequence) <= -result - i - 1 <= -1
        
        sequence[-result - i - 1] += result
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is 7, `size` is 5, the element at index `-result - i - 1` in `sequence` is incremented by `result`.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop runs from `i` starting at 4 up to `size` which is 5. Therefore, the loop will run 6 times in total (from 4 to 9 inclusive). After 3 iterations, `i` is 5. Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, after all 6 iterations, `i` will be 7. The condition inside the loop modifies the `sequence` array based on the current value of `i` and `result`. Given that the modification happens in every iteration and the loop runs 6 times, the final value of `i` will be 7, and the specified element in `sequence` will be incremented by `result` 6 times.
    return size + result
    #The program returns 11, where `result` is 6 and `size` is 5.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `number`, a positive integer, and `sequence`, a list of integers. It generates a sequence of integers and modifies the `sequence` list based on certain conditions. If `number` is 0, it returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates the size of the sequence, populates the `sequence` list with integers from 0 to 4, and recursively calls itself. Finally, it returns the sum of the calculated `size` and `result`, where `result` is determined by the recursive call and the modifications made to the `sequence` list.
