Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and `size`.

2. **Understand the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `sequence` has its last element updated to `i+1`.
   - `i` is incremented by 1.

3. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**:
   - The loop condition is `i < size`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `size`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, let's denote the new value of `i` as `i_new = i + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i_new` must be less than `size`.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - The sequence state (`sequence` having its last element updated) does not change for the loop condition check.
   - The new value of `i` is `i_new = i + 1`.
   - The condition for the next iteration is `i_new < size`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`sequence` has its last element updated to `i+1`, and `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now `i+1`, and for the loop to execute again, `i+1` must be less than `size`.**
