Output State: `number` must be at least 31, `sequence` is a list of integers with size 0, `size` is 5.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `size` as long as `(1 << size + 1) - 1` is less than or equal to `number`. After each iteration, `size` increases by 1. Starting from `size = 1`, the condition will hold true until `size = 5`, where `(1 << 5 + 1) - 1 = 63` would break the condition if `number` is 31 or less. Therefore, after all iterations, `size` will be 5, and `number` must be at least 31 for the loop to have completed all its iterations.
