Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `size`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 4
   - `size` is 5
   - `sequence` is modified such that the element at index `-result - i - 1` is incremented by `result`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for each value of `i` in the range from 0 to `size - 1`.

4. **Calculate the next value of `i`**: Since the loop increments `i` by 1 at each iteration, the next value of `i` will be `i + 1`. Given that `i` is currently 4, the next value of `i` will be 5.

5. **Check if the loop should continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i < size`. Since `size` is 5 and the next value of `i` is 5, the loop will stop because `5 >= 5`.

6. **Adjust the states**: The only variables that change within the loop head are `i` and `size`. However, since `size` does not change within the loop, it remains the same. The variable `i` changes to 5.

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration (which would actually be the final iteration in this case) is:

**State: **`i` is 5, `size` is 5**
