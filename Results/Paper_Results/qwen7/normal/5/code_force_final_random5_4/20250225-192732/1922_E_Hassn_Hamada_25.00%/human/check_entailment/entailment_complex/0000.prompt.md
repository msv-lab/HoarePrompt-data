Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

    while (1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number:
        size += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `number` must be at least 31, `sequence` is a list of integers with size 0, `size` is 5.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop continues to increment `size` as long as `(1 << size + 1) - 1` is less than or equal to `number`. After each iteration, `size` increases by 1. Starting from `size = 1`, the condition will hold true until `size = 5`, where `(1 << 5 + 1) - 1 = 63` would break the condition if `number` is 31 or less. Therefore, after all iterations, `size` will be 5, and `number` must be at least 31 for the loop to have completed all its iterations.
    for i in range(size):
        sequence.append(i)
        
    #State: Output State: `sequence` is `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`, `i` is `4`, and `size` is `5`.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `size` reaches 5, meaning the loop runs 5 times. In each iteration, `i` increments by 1 starting from 0, so after 5 iterations, `i` will be 4. During these iterations, `sequence` is populated with integers from 0 to 4, resulting in `sequence` being `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`.
    result = func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)
    for i in range(size):
        assert -len(sequence) <= -result - i - 1 <= -1
        
        sequence[-result - i - 1] += result
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is 7, `size` is 5, the element at index `-result - i - 1` in `sequence` is incremented by `result`.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop runs from `i` starting at 4 up to `size` which is 5. Therefore, the loop will run 6 times in total (from 4 to 9 inclusive). After 3 iterations, `i` is 5. Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, after all 6 iterations, `i` will be 7. The condition inside the loop modifies the `sequence` array based on the current value of `i` and `result`. Given that the modification happens in every iteration and the loop runs 6 times, the final value of `i` will be 7, and the specified element in `sequence` will be incremented by `result` 6 times.
    return size + result
    #The program returns 11, where `result` is 6 and `size` is 5.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `number`, a positive integer, and `sequence`, a list of integers. It generates a sequence of integers and modifies the `sequence` list based on certain conditions. If `number` is 0, it returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates the size of the sequence, populates the `sequence` list with integers from 0 to 4, and recursively calls itself. Finally, it returns the sum of the calculated `size` and `result`, where `result` is determined by the recursive call and the modifications made to the `sequence` list.
