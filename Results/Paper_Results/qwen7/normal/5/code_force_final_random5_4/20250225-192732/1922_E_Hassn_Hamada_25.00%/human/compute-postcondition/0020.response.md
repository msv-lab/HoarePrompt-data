Output State: `sequence` is `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`, `i` is `4`, and `size` is `5`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `size` reaches 5, meaning the loop runs 5 times. In each iteration, `i` increments by 1 starting from 0, so after 5 iterations, `i` will be 4. During these iterations, `sequence` is populated with integers from 0 to 4, resulting in `sequence` being `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`.
