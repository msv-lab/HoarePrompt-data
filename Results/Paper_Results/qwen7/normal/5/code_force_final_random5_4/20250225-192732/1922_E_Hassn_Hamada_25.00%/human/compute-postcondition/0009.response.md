Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- The loop condition is `(1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number`.
- At the end of the previous iteration:
  - `number` must be at least 7.
  - `sequence` is a list of integers with size 0.
  - `size` is 3.

### Loop Condition Analysis:
The loop continues as long as the condition `(1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number` holds true. 

- Let's evaluate the left side of the condition:
  - `size` is 3.
  - `1 << size + 1` means `1 << 4` (since `size + 1 = 4`).
  - `1 << 4` equals `16` (binary `10000`).
  - Therefore, `(1 << 4) - 1` equals `15`.

So, the loop condition simplifies to `15 <= number`.

### Current State:
- `number` must be at least 7.
- `sequence` is a list of integers with size 0.
- `size` is 3.

### Determining the Next State:
- For the loop to continue, `number` must be at least 15.
- Since `number` must be at least 7, but now it needs to be at least 15, we need to update `number` to meet this new requirement.
- The values of `sequence` and `size` do not affect the loop condition, so they do not need to be adjusted.

### Final Answer:
State: **`number` must be at least 15, `sequence` is a list of integers with size 0, `size` is 3**
