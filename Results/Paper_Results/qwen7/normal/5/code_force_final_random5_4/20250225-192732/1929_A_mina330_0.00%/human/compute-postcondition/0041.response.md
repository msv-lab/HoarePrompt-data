Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers.
   - `i` is `len(a) // 2`.
   - `kq` is `kq + a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]`.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(0, len(a) // 2, 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Head Variables:**
   - The loop head variables are `i`.

4. **Adjusting the State:**
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, we need to determine the new value of `i` for the next iteration.
   - Initially, `i` is set to `len(a) // 2`.
   - After the first iteration, `i` becomes `len(a) // 2 + 1`.

5. **New State Calculation:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `len(a) // 2`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be `len(a) // 2 + 1`.

6. **Other Variables:**
   - `a` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `kq` is updated based on the values of `a[len(a) - i - 1]` and `a[i]`, but its exact value is not needed for the next iteration's condition check.

7. **Final State:**
   - `a` remains the same.
   - `i` is now `len(a) // 2 + 1`.
   - `kq` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is `len(a) // 2 + 1`, `kq` is `kq + a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]`**.
