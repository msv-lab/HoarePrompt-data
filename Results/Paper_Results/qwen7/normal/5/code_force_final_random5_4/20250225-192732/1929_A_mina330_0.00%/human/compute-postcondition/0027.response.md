Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements; `i` is `i + 1`; `kq` is the sum of `kq` and the difference between the element at index `len(a) - i - 1` and the element at index `i`.**

Explanation: The code updates `kq` by adding the difference between the element at index `len(a) - i - 1` and the element at index `i` to `kq`. After this operation, the value of `i` is incremented by 1. The precondition that `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements remains unchanged.
