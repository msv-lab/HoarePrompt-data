Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input data consisting of a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) representing the number of test cases, followed by t sets of input. Each set includes an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). For each set, the function returns a specific output based on the given inputs.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, where for each test case, it takes an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, and processes them according to some unspecified logic (since the logic itself is not provided in the problem statement). The function then returns different outputs for each test case based on the input data.
