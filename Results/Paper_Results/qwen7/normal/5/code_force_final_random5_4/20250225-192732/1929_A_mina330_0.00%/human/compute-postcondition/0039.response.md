Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers.
   - `i` is `len(a) // 2 - 1`.
   - `kq` is the original value of `kq` plus `a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]`.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(0, len(a) // 2, 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 until it reaches `len(a) // 2`.
   - The loop condition is `0 <= i < len(a) // 2`.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `len(a) // 2 - 1`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` will become `len(a) // 2`.
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1, the new value of `i` will be `len(a) // 2`.

5. **Updating Other Variables:**
   - `a` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `kq` is updated based on the values of `a[len(a) - i - 1]` and `a[i]`. Since `i` is now `len(a) // 2`, the update to `kq` will be `kq += a[len(a) - (len(a) // 2) - 1] - a[len(a) // 2]`.

6. **Final State:**
   - `a` remains a sorted list of integers.
   - `i` is now `len(a) // 2`.
   - `kq` is updated to include the difference between `a[len(a) - (len(a) // 2) - 1]` and `a[len(a) // 2]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is `len(a) // 2`, `kq` is the original value of `kq` plus `a[len(a) - (len(a) // 2) - 1] - a[len(a) // 2]`**.
