Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: ntest is an input integer, and t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.
Code of the loop:
for itest in range(0, ntest, 1):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort()
    kq = 0
    for i in range(0, len(a) // 2, 1):
        kq = kq + a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]
    print(kq)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `ntest` is an input integer, `itest` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty list of sorted integers, `kq` is the sum of `a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]` for each `i` from 0 to `len(a) // 2 - 1`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `kq` will hold the sum of the differences between the elements at symmetric positions from the start and end of the list `a`. Specifically, for each index `i` from 0 to `len(a) // 2 - 1`, `kq` accumulates the value of `a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]`. The other variables (`ntest`, `itest`, and `n`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `a` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is equal to `len(a) // 2`, and `kq` is the sum of `kq` and the difference between the element at index `len(a) - i - 1` and the element at index `i` for each iteration from `0` to `len(a) // 2 - 1`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `a` remains a sorted list of integers. The variable `i` will be set to half the length of the list (rounded down if necessary), meaning the loop has processed all pairs of elements from both ends towards the center. The variable `kq` will hold the cumulative sum of the differences between the last and first elements, second last and second elements, and so on, up to the middle of the list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `a` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is `len(a)`, `kq` is the sum of `a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]` for all iterations from `i=0` to `i=len(a)//2-1`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `a` remains a sorted list of integers. The variable `i` will be equal to `len(a)` because the loop increments `i` from `0` to `len(a) // 2 - 1`. The variable `kq` will hold the cumulative result of adding `a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]` for each iteration of the loop. This means `kq` will be the sum of the differences between the elements at symmetric positions from both ends of the list up to the middle.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
