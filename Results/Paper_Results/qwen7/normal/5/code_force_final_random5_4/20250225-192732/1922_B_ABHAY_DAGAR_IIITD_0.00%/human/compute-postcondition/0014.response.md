Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a non-empty list of integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where the key `x` (the second element in `num_list`) either has its value incremented by 1 or is set to 1, depending on whether `x` is already in `num_of_lens`, and `num_of_lens[x]` is incremented by 1.**

In this output state, the variable `num_of_lens[x]` has been incremented by 1. The other variables retain their previous states as described in the initial state.
