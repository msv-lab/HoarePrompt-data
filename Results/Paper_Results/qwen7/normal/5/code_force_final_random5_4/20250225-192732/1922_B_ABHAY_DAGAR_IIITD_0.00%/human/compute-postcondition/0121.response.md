Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `x` and `num_list`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in `num_list`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key `x` from `num_list` has a corresponding value representing the count of occurrences of `x`.
   - `res` is the sum of all values calculated according to the conditions within the loop for each `x` in `num_list` and the new `num_list`.
   - `total_count` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` and the new `num_of_lens`.
   - `results` is a list containing the final value of `res`.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `num_list` is a list of integers updated with integers from the input split and mapped to integers.
   - `x` is the first element in `num_list`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `x` is the first element in `num_list`, it will be processed in the next iteration.
   - After processing `x`, `num_list` will be updated (it will be the rest of the list without the first element).
   - `num_of_lens` might be updated based on the value of `x`.

Given this, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `num_list` will be updated to exclude the first element `x`.
- `num_of_lens` might be updated depending on the value of `x`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key `x` from `num_list` has a corresponding value representing the count of occurrences of `x`. `res` is the sum of all values calculated according to the conditions within the loop for each `x` in `num_list` and the new `num_list`. `total_count` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` and the new `num_of_lens`. `results` is a list containing the final value of `res`, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers updated with integers from the input split and mapped to integers (excluding the first element), and `x` is the second element in the updated `num_list`.**
