Output State: **`num_of_lens` remains unchanged, `res` is the sum of all values calculated according to the conditions within the loop for each `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()`, `total_count` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens`, and `results` is a list containing the final value of `res`, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. This changes the value of `n`, making it an input integer. However, the initial values of `num_of_lens`, `res`, `total_count`, and `results` remain unchanged as no operations were performed on these variables within the given code snippet.
