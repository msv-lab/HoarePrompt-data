`results` is a list that now includes the current value of `res`. The value of `res` is appended to the list `results`, but the actual value of `res` itself does not change. The value of `total_count` remains the sum of all values from `num_of_lens.values()`, and the value of `res` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`total_count` is the sum of all values from `num_of_lens.values()`, `res` is the cumulative result of the loop's operations, and `results` is a list containing the value of `res`.**
