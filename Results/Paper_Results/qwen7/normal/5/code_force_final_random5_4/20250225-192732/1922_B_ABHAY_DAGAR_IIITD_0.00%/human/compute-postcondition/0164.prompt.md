Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(test_cases):
    n = int(input())
    num_list = list(map(int, input().split()))
    num_of_lens = {}
    for x in num_list:
        if x in num_of_lens:
            num_of_lens[x] += 1
        else:
            num_of_lens[x] = 1
    res = 0
    total_count = 0
    for cnt in num_of_lens.values():
        if cnt >= 3:
            res += cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6
        if cnt >= 2:
            res += cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count
        total_count += cnt
    results.append(res)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `num_of_lens` is processed as before, `total_count` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens`, `res` contains the cumulative result of applying the formulas for each value in `num_of_lens` that meets the conditions, and `results` now includes the current value of `res`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `num_of_lens` remains unchanged, `res` is the sum of all values calculated according to the conditions within the loop for each `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()`, and `total_count` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens`; `results` is a list containing the final value of `res`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `total_count` is the sum of all values from `num_of_lens.values()`, `res` is the cumulative result of the loop's operations, and `results` is a list containing the value of `res`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
