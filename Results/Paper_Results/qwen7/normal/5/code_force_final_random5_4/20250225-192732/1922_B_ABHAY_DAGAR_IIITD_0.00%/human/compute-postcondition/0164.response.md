Output State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, `total_count` will be the sum of all values from `num_of_lens.values()` for every iteration. The variable `res` will contain the cumulative result of applying the formulas for each value in `num_of_lens` that meets the conditions across all iterations. The list `results` will contain the value of `res` after each iteration of the loop.**

This means that `total_count` accumulates the count of all numbers seen across all inputs, and `res` accumulates the result based on the given formulas for each unique number encountered in all inputs. The `results` list will have one entry for each iteration, showing the intermediate cumulative result of `res` after each pass through the loop.
