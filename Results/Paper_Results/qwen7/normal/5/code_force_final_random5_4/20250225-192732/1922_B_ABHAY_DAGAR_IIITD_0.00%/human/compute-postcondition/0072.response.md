Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `num_of_lens`: retains its properties.
- `total_count`: retains its properties.
- `res`: retains its properties.
- `test_cases`: retains its properties.
- `results`: retains its properties.
- `num_list`: retains its properties.
- `x`: retains its properties.

### Loop Head
The loop iterates over each element `x` in `num_list`.

### Loop Body
- If `x` is found in `num_of_lens`, `num_of_lens[x]` is incremented by 1, and `test_cases` is decremented by 1.
- If `x` is not found in `num_of_lens`, `num_of_lens[x]` is set to 1, and `test_cases` is also decremented by 1.

### Adjusting States for the Next Iteration
At the end of the previous iteration, we need to determine the state of `x` for the next iteration. Since the loop is iterating over `num_list`, the value of `x` will change for each iteration. However, the key variables that need adjustment are `num_of_lens` and `test_cases`.

#### Step-by-Step Adjustment
1. **Determine the Value of `x` for the Next Iteration**: The value of `x` will be the next element in `num_list`.
2. **Check if `x` is Found in `num_of_lens`**:
   - If `x` is found, increment `num_of_lens[x]` by 1.
   - Decrement `test_cases` by 1.
   - If `x` is not found, set `num_of_lens[x]` to 1.
   - Decrement `test_cases` by 1.

Since we don't know the exact value of `x` for the next iteration, we can only describe the general adjustment based on the loop condition.

### Final State
State: **`num_of_lens` is updated based on the next `x` in `num_list`, `test_cases` is decremented by 1, and all other variables (`total_count`, `res`, `results`, `num_list`) retain their properties.**

To provide a concrete example, let's assume the next `x` in `num_list` is `5`:

- If `5` is found in `num_of_lens`, `num_of_lens[5]` is incremented by 1.
- If `5` is not found in `num_of_lens`, `num_of_lens[5]` is set to 1.

Thus, the final state would be:

State: **`num_of_lens` is updated (either `num_of_lens[5] += 1` or `num_of_lens[5] = 1`), `test_cases` is decremented by 1, `total_count`, `res`, `results`, and `num_list` retain their properties.**
