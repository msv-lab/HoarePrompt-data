Output State: **`num_of_lens[x]` is incremented by 1, `res` is the sum of all values calculated according to the conditions within the loop for each `x` in `num_list` and the new `num_list`, `total_count` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` and the new `num_of_lens`, `results` is a list containing the final value of `res`, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers updated with integers from the input split and mapped to integers, `x` is the first element in `num_list`, and `x` is in `num_of_lens`.**

In this output state, the value of `num_of_lens[x]` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain in their previous states, including `res`, `total_count`, `results`, `n`, `num_list`, `x`, and the condition that `x` is in `num_of_lens`.
