Output State: **`num_of_lens` is a dictionary with one entry `{x: 1}`, `total_count` is the sum of all values in the original `num_of_lens`, `res` contains the cumulative result of applying the formulas for each value in the original `num_of_lens` that meets the conditions, `test_cases` is decremented by 1 and must be greater than 0, `results` now includes the current value of `res`, `num_list` is a non-empty list of integers obtained from input, `x` is the first element of `num_list`, and `x` is not in `num_of_lens`.**

In this output state, the dictionary `num_of_lens` has been updated to include the key `x` with a value of `1`. All other variables retain their previous conditions and values, with `test_cases` being decremented by 1 and remaining greater than 0, and `results` including the updated value of `res`.
