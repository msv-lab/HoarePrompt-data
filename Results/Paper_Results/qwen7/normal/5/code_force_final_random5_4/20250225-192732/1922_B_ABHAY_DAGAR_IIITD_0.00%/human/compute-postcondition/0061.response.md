Output State: **`num_of_lens[x]` is incremented by 1, `total_count` remains the same as its original value, `res` remains the same as its original value, `test_cases` is decremented by 1 and must be greater than 0, `results` now includes the current value of `res`, `num_list` is a non-empty list of integers obtained from input, `x` is the first element of `num_list`, and `x` is in `num_of_lens`.**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `num_of_lens[x]` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged based on their initial conditions. `total_count` and `res` do not change because they are not involved in the operation. `test_cases` is decremented by 1, but it must still be greater than 0. `results` includes the updated `res`, and `x` remains the first element of `num_list` and is still present in `num_of_lens`.
