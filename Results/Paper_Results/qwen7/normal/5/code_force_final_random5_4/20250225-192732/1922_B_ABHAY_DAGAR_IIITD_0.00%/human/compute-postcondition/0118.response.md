Output State: **`num_of_lens` is now a dictionary with key `x` and value `1`, `res` is the sum of all values calculated according to the conditions within the loop for each `x` in `num_list` and the new `num_list`, `total_count` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` and the new `num_of_lens`, `results` is a list containing the final value of `res`, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers updated with integers from the input split and mapped to integers, `x` is the first element in `num_list`, and `x` is not in `num_of_lens`**.

In more detail:
- The dictionary `num_of_lens` now contains the key `x` with a value of `1`.
- The variable `res` remains unchanged, representing the sum of all values calculated according to the conditions within the loop for each `x` in `num_list` and the new `num_list`.
- The variable `total_count` remains unchanged, representing the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` and the new `num_of_lens`.
- The list `results` remains unchanged, containing the final value of `res`.
- The variable `n` remains unchanged, being an input integer.
- The list `num_list` remains unchanged, being a list of integers updated with integers from the input split and mapped to integers.
- The variable `x` remains unchanged, being the first element in `num_list` and not previously in `num_of_lens`.
