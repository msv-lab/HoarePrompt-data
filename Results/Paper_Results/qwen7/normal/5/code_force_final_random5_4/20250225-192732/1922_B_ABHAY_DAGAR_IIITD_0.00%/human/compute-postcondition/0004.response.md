Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, results is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary.**

The code initializes an empty dictionary `num_of_lens`. This does not affect the values of `test_cases`, `results`, `n`, or `num_list`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states, and a new dictionary `num_of_lens` is created and remains empty.
