Postcondition: `num_of_lens` remains unchanged, `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens` that is greater than or equal to 3 after the calculation, and `res` is increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, or `cnt * (cnt - 1) * total_count // 2` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2.
