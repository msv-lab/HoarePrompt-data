Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `total_count` is 0, `test_cases` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a non-empty list of integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key from `num_list` either has its value incremented by 1 or is set to 1, depending on whether the key is already present in `num_of_lens`, `res` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for cnt in num_of_lens.values():
    if cnt >= 3:
        res += cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6
    if cnt >= 2:
        res += cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count
    total_count += cnt


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `total_count` is increased by `cnt`, `test_cases` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a non-empty list of integers, `num_of_lens` must contain at least one key-value pair, and `res` remains 0 if `cnt` is less than 2. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is set to `cnt` * (`cnt` - 1) * (`cnt` - 2) // 6.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `total_count` is increased by `cnt`, `test_cases` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a non-empty list of integers, `num_of_lens` must contain at least one key-value pair, and `res` is updated to `res` + `cnt` * (`cnt` - 1) // 2 * `total_count` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `total_count` is increased by `cnt`, `test_cases` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a non-empty list of integers, `num_of_lens` must contain at least one key-value pair, and `res` is updated to `res` + `cnt` * (`cnt` - 1) * (`cnt` - 2) // 6 + `cnt` * (`cnt` - 1) // 2 * `total_count` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
