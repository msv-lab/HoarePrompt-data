Output State: **`total_count` is increased by the new `cnt`, `test_cases` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a non-empty list of integers, `num_of_lens` must contain at least one key-value pair, and `res` is updated to `res` + `cnt` * (`cnt` - 1) * (`cnt` - 2) // 6 + `cnt` * (`cnt` - 1) // 2 * `total_count`**.

Explanation: The code updates `res` by adding `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` to its current value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
