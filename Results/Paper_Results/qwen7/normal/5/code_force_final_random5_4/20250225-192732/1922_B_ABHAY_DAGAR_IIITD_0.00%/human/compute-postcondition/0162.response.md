Output State: **`total_count` is the sum of all values from `num_of_lens.values()`, and `res` is the cumulative result of the loop's operations.**

In the final state after all iterations of the loop, `total_count` will be the sum of all values obtained from `num_of_lens.values()`. For each value `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()`, if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is incremented by `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is further incremented by `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`. This process continues for every value in `num_of_lens.values()`, updating `res` accordingly based on the conditions specified in the loop body.
