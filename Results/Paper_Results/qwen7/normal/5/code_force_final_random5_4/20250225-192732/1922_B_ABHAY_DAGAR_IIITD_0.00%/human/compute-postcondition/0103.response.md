Output State: **`num_of_lens` remains unchanged, `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens` that is greater than or equal to 3 after the calculation, and `res` is increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) * total_count // 2`**.

Explanation: The code updates `res` by adding `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` to its current value. Here, `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens` that is greater than or equal to 3, and `total_count` remains unchanged from the initial state. The output state includes the updated `res` value, which now includes the contribution from the current `cnt` value, and the unchanged `num_of_lens` and `cnt` (which is the next eligible value in `num_of_lens`).
