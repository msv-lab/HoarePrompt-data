Postcondition: `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key `x` from `num_list` has a corresponding value representing the count of occurrences of `x`. `res` is the sum of all values calculated according to the conditions within the loop for each `x` in `num_list` and the new `num_list`. `total_count` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` and the new `num_of_lens`. `results` is a list containing the final value of `res`, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers updated with integers from the input split and mapped to integers, and `x` is the first element in `num_list`. If `x` is already in `num_of_lens`, its count is incremented by 1; otherwise, a new entry with key `x` and value 1 is added to `num_of_lens`.
