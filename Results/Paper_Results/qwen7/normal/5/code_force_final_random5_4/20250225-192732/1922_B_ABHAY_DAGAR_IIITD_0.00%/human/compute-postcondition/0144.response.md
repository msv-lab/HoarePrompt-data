Postcondition: `total_count` remains 0, `cnt` is the first value from `num_of_lens.values()`, and `res` is updated as follows: if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is set to `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `res` remains unchanged; `res` is further updated by adding `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` to its current value.
