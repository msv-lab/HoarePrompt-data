State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, results is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a non-empty list of integers, `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary, `x` is the first element in `num_list`** 

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `x` which iterates over the elements of `num_list`.

2. **Determine Initial State of `x`**: Since the loop is about to start, `x` should be set to the first element of `num_list` to begin the iteration.

3. **Check Conditions for Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute, `num_list` must contain at least one element. If `num_list` is empty, the loop will not execute.

4. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`test_cases`, `results`, `n`, and `num_of_lens`) do not directly affect the loop's ability to execute and can remain as given in the initial state.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `x` is initialized to the first element of `num_list`, and `num_list` must be non-empty for the loop to execute.
