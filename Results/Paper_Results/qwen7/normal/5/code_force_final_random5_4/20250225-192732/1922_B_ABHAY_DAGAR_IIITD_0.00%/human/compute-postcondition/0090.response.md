Output State: **`num_of_lens` remains unchanged, `cnt` remains greater than or equal to 3, and `res` is increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6 + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * (total_count + cnt)`.**

Explanation: The code `total_count += cnt` increments the value of `total_count` by the current value of `cnt`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial postconditions. Therefore, `num_of_lens` remains unchanged, `cnt` remains greater than or equal to 3, and `res` is updated by adding `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6 + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * (total_count + cnt)` to its current value.
