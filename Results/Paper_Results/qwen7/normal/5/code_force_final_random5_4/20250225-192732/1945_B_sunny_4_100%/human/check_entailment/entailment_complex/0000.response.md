Reasoning:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case individually.
2. **Variable Initialization**: For each test case, the program initializes the variables \( a \), \( b \), and \( m \) correctly using the input values.
3. **Calculation of Maximum Simultaneous Fireworks**: The formula used to calculate the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously is \( \text{ans} = \left\lfloor \frac{m}{a} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{m}{b} \right\rfloor + 2 \). This formula accounts for the fact that each firework is visible for \( m+1 \) minutes and considers the overlap between the intervals of the two installations.
4. **Output**: The program prints the result for each test case, which is the correct output format.

Given the problem description and the provided annotations, the program accurately follows the steps required to solve the problem and produces the correct results.

Correctness: **True**
