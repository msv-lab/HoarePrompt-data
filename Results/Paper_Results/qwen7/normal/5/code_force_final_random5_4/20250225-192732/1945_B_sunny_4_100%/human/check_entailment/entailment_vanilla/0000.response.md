### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `a`, `b`, and `m`.

2. **Calculation of Fireworks Visible**:
   - The program calculates the number of fireworks launched by the first installation within the visibility period `m` using `m // a + 1`.
   - Similarly, it calculates the number of fireworks launched by the second installation within the visibility period `m` using `m // b + 1`.
   - However, there is an error in the calculation of the total number of fireworks visible at the same time. The formula used `A + B` is incorrect because it does not account for the overlap between the two sets of fireworks.

3. **Overlap Consideration**:
   - To find the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time, we need to consider the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`. The LCM gives us the interval at which both installations launch fireworks simultaneously.
   - The correct approach should involve calculating the number of fireworks launched by each installation separately and then finding the maximum number of fireworks visible at any given time, considering overlaps.

4. **Correct Formula**:
   - The correct formula to calculate the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is:
     \[
     \text{ans} = \left\lfloor \frac{m}{\text{lcm}(a, b)} \right\rfloor + 1 + \left\lfloor \frac{m}{a} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{m}{b} \right\rfloor - 1
     \]
   - Here, `\left\lfloor \frac{m}{\text{lcm}(a, b)} \right\rfloor + 1` accounts for the fireworks launched simultaneously by both installations.
   - `\left\lfloor \frac{m}{a} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{m}{b} \right\rfloor` accounts for the fireworks launched by each installation individually.
   - Subtracting 1 corrects for the double-counted simultaneous fireworks.

### Conclusion:

The provided program uses an incorrect formula to calculate the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
