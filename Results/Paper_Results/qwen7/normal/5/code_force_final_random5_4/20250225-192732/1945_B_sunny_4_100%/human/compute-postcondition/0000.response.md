Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, a, b, and m are updated to their respective values from input; A and B are calculated as A = int(m/a) + 1 and B = int(m/b) + 1, and A + B is printed for each test case.**

Explanation: The code first reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m`. It then calculates `A` and `B` using the formulas `A = int(m/a) + 1` and `B = int(m/b) + 1`, respectively. After calculating these values, it prints the sum `A + B`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are updated for each test case, but `t` remains unchanged. The output state includes the updated values of `a`, `b`, and `m` for each test case, along with the calculation and printing of `A + B`.
