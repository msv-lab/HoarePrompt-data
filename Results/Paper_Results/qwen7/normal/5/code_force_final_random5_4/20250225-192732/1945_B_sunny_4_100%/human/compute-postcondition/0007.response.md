Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `qi` is 1, `a` is the first integer input, `b` is the second integer input, `m` is the third integer input, `ans` is `m // a + m // b + 2`, the values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are updated to the integers from the input.**

Explanation: The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `m`. The values of `t`, `qi`, and `ans` remain unchanged. The new values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are those provided by the user's input.
