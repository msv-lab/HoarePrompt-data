Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, and we read an input for `t`.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The precondition that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 remains valid, and now `t` holds the value of the input. All other variables (a, b, m, A, B) are not yet defined and will be updated later in the program.
