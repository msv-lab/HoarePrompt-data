The variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust these two variables. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than or equal to `n - 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than or equal to `n - 1`. Given that `i` is currently 2, `n` must be greater than 3 (since `i` must be less than or equal to `n - 1`).

Therefore, we need to adjust `n` to be greater than 3.

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 3, list `l` has elements such that `l[0]` equals 2 and `l[1]` equals 1.**
