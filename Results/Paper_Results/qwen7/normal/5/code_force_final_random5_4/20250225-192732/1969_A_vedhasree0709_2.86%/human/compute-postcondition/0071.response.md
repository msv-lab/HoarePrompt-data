Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 0**

The code `j = 0` simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `j`. The initial values of `i` and `j` are not affected by this assignment. The list `l` remains unchanged as well. Therefore, the output state is that `i` is still 0, `j` is now 0, and `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
