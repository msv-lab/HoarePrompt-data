Output State: **`n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The initial state only mentions that `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input()` waits for user input and `int()` converts it to an integer. No other variables are mentioned in the initial state, so their values remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is that `n` is an input integer, and no other variables are affected.
