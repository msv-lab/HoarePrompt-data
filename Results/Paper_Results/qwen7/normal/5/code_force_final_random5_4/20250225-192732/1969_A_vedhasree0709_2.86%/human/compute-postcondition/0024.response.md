Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 4, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `j` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `i`, `n`, `l`, and `j`. It only indicates that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were inside. Since no such loop or if statement is mentioned in the given code snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged.
