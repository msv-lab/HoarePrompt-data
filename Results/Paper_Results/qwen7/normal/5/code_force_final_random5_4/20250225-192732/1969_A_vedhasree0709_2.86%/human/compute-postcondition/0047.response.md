Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 1, and either `l[0]` is equal to 2 and `l[1]` is equal to 1, in which case the loop or if statement is broken, or there is no change to the variables as there is no else part.**

The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. The conditions for `n` and the list `l` remain unchanged since the code does not modify them. The loop or if statement behavior (breaking or not) remains the same as per the initial postcondition.
