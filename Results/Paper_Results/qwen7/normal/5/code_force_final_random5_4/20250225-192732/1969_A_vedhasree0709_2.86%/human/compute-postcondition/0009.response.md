Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be at least 1, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `j` is 1, the current value of `l[0]` is 2, the current value of `l[1]` is 1**

Explanation: The variable `j` is assigned the value 1. The values of `i`, `n`, `l`, `l[0]`, and `l[1]` remain unchanged from their initial states.
