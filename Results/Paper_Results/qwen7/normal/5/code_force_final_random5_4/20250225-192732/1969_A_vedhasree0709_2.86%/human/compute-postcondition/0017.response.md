Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `j` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no loop or if statement specified in the code, the only effect is that the program would exit the current loop or if statement it is in. All other variables retain their initial or previously calculated states.
