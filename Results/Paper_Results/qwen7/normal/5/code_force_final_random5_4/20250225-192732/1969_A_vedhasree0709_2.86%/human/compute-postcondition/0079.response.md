Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, list `l` has elements such that `l[0]` equals 2 and `l[1]` equals 1, and if the condition `l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1` is true, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement with `j` equal to 1. If the condition is false, no changes occur.
