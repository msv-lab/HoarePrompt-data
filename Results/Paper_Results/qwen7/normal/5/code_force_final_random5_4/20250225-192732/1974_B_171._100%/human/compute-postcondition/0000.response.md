Output State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length n satisfies 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `unique_chars` is a list of the sorted unique characters from `encoded`.**

The code `unique_chars = sorted(set(encoded))` creates a set of unique characters from the string `encoded` and then sorts them. Since the initial state does not provide specific values for `encoded`, the only information we can derive is that `unique_chars` is now a list containing the sorted unique characters from `encoded`. The length constraint on `encoded` remains unchanged.
