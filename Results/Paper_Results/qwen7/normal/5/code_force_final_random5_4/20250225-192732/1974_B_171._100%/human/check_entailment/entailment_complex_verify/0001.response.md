### Reasoning

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly decodes the encoded strings according to the provided problem description.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into parts.
   - It then iterates through the test cases, extracting the necessary information (`n`, `b`) for each test case.

2. **Decoding Function (`func_1`)**:
   - This function takes an encoded string `b` as input.
   - It creates a list of unique characters in the encoded string and sorts them alphabetically.
   - It then creates a mapping where each character is paired with its symmetric counterpart in the sorted list of unique characters.
   - Finally, it uses this mapping to decode the entire encoded string.

3. **Main Loop**:
   - For each test case, the program calls the `func_1` function with the encoded string and appends the result to a list.
   - After processing all test cases, it prints the decoded strings.

### Verification of Correctness

1. **Unique Characters and Sorting**:
   - The program correctly identifies all unique characters in the encoded string and sorts them alphabetically. This part is correct.

2. **Mapping Characters**:
   - The program correctly pairs each character with its symmetric counterpart. This is done by iterating through the sorted list of unique characters and creating a dictionary where the key is the character and the value is its symmetric counterpart.
   - The logic in the loop is correct:
     ```python
     for i in range(len_unique):
         char_map[unique_chars[i]] = unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]
     ```
     This ensures that each character in `unique_chars` is mapped to its corresponding character from the end of the list.

3. **Decoding Process**:
   - The program correctly decodes the encoded string by replacing each character with its mapped symmetric counterpart. This is done using a list comprehension that iterates through the encoded string and looks up each character in the dictionary.
   - The decoding logic is correct:
     ```python
     decoded = ''.join(char_map[ch] for ch in encoded)
     ```

4. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**:
   - The program handles multiple test cases correctly by reading all input at once and then processing each test case individually.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the decoding process as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer

Final: **True**

The original assessment was accurate.
