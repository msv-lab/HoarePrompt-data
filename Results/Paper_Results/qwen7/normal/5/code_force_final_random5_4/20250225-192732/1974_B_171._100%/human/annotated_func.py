#State of the program right berfore the function call: encoded is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length n satisfies 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. The string encoded is the result of encoding some original string s using the specified algorithm.
def func_1(encoded):
    unique_chars = sorted(set(encoded))
    char_map = {}
    len_unique = len(unique_chars)
    for i in range(len_unique):
        char_map[unique_chars[i]] = unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is equal to `len_unique`; `len_unique` must be greater than 0; for every key `k` in `char_map`, `char_map[k]` is equal to `unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all the iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `i` will be equal to `len_unique`. The dictionary `char_map` will map each character in `unique_chars` to its corresponding character from the end of the list, such that `char_map[unique_chars[i]]` will be `unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]` for all valid indices `i`. This means that each character in `unique_chars` is mapped to its mirror image from the end of the list.
    decoded = ''.join(char_map[ch] for ch in encoded)
    return decoded
    #The program returns a string `decoded` where each character is replaced by its corresponding character from the end of `unique_chars` as per the mapping defined in `char_map`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `encoded` and returns a new string `decoded` where each character in `encoded` is mapped to its corresponding character from the end of the unique characters in `encoded`, based on a reverse mapping defined within the function.
