### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies a potential issue with the program when handling an empty encoded string. However, upon closer inspection, the provided function summary and the implementation of `func_1` suggest that the function already handles the case where `encoded` is an empty string.

Let's break down the function `func_1`:

1. **Function Logic**:
   - The function first checks if `encoded` is empty.
   - If `encoded` is empty, it immediately returns an empty string.
   - If `encoded` is not empty, it proceeds to create a list of unique characters sorted in alphabetical order.
   - It then creates a dictionary `char_map` that maps each character in `unique_chars` to its corresponding character from the end of `unique_chars`.
   - Finally, it decodes the `encoded` string using the `char_map`.

Given this logic, the function already includes a check for an empty string and returns an empty string in that case. Therefore, the original assessment's suggestion to add an explicit check for an empty string is unnecessary because the function already handles this case correctly.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**

The original assessment was accurate in identifying the need to handle an empty string, but the function already does so correctly. Thus, the program is correct as it stands.
