Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. It then iterates over the test cases, extracting the necessary information (length of the encoded string and the encoded string itself).

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Unique Characters Mapping**: The function `func_1` correctly computes the mapping from each unique character in the encoded string to its corresponding character from the end of the list of unique characters. This is done by creating a dictionary `char_map` where each character is mapped to its mirror image from the end of the list of unique characters.
   - **Decoding Process**: After constructing the `char_map`, the function uses it to decode the encoded string by replacing each character in the encoded string with its corresponding character from `char_map`.

3. **Output**: The decoded strings are collected in a list and printed out one by one.

Given the problem description and the provided annotated program, the logic implemented in the function `func_1` accurately decodes the encoded string according to the specified algorithm. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
