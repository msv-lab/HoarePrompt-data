Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes inputs through a series of test cases, each consisting of three positive integers n, a, and b. It returns the total cost based on the given conditions: n is the number of buns, a is the usual price of a bun, and b is the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price (0 ≤ k ≤ min(n, b)).**
