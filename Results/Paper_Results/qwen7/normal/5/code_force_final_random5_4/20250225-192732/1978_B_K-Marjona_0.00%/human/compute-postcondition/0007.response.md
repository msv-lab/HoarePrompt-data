Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an integer input from the user.
   - `a` is an integer input from the user.
   - `b` is an integer input from the user.
   - `k` is the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`.
   - The condition `b > a` is true.

2. **Expression to Evaluate:**
   \[
   \text{print}\left(\frac{(b + (b - k + 1))}{2} \times k + (n - k) \times a\right)
   \]

3. **Step-by-Step Calculation:**
   - First, determine the value of `k`:
     \[
     k = \min(n, b - a)
     \]
   - Next, substitute `k` into the expression:
     \[
     \frac{(b + (b - k + 1))}{2} \times k + (n - k) \times a
     \]
   - Simplify the term inside the parentheses:
     \[
     \frac{(b + b - k + 1)}{2} = \frac{(2b - k + 1)}{2}
     \]
   - So the expression becomes:
     \[
     \left(\frac{2b - k + 1}{2}\right) \times k + (n - k) \times a
     \]
   - This can be further simplified to:
     \[
     \frac{k(2b - k + 1)}{2} + (n - k) \times a
     \]

4. **Final Expression:**
   - The expression evaluates to a combination of arithmetic operations involving `b`, `k`, `n`, and `a`.

Given the initial state and the expression, the output will be the result of the arithmetic operations described above.

Output: **\(\frac{k(2b - k + 1)}{2} + (n - k) \times a\)**
