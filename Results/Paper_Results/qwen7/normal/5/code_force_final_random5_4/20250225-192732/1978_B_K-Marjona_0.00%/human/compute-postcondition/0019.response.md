Output: **a * n (where a is an integer from the input and n is an integer from the input)**

Explanation:
- `n` is an integer from the input.
- `a` is an integer from the input.
- `b` is an integer from the input.
- `k` is the minimum of `n` and `b - a`.

The print statement `print(a * n)` simply multiplies `a` (an integer from the input) by `n` (an integer from the input) and prints the result. Since the exact values of `a` and `n` are not specified, we describe them as integers from the input.
