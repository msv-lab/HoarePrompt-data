### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize Bob's profit by choosing an optimal \( k \).
   - If \( b \leq a \), selling all buns at the usual price \( a \) is the best option.
   - Otherwise, we need to find the optimal \( k \) such that the sum of the modified prices for the first \( k \) buns plus the usual price for the remaining \( n - k \) buns is maximized.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution:**
   - The function iterates over the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \).
   - It calculates \( k \) as \( \min(n, b - a) \). This ensures \( k \) is within the valid range and reflects the difference between the usual price and the modified price.
   - If \( b \leq a \), it prints \( a \times n \) because selling all buns at the usual price is optimal.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the profit using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Profit} = \left( \frac{(b + (b - k + 1))}{2} \right) \times k + (n - k) \times a
     \]
     This formula is derived from the sum of an arithmetic series for the first \( k \) buns and the usual price for the remaining \( n - k \) buns.

3. **Verification:**
   - The logic for calculating \( k \) is correct.
   - The condition \( b \leq a \) correctly handles the scenario where selling all buns at the usual price is optimal.
   - The profit calculation formula is correct and aligns with the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The given solution correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all buns under the given conditions.

### Correctness:
**True**
