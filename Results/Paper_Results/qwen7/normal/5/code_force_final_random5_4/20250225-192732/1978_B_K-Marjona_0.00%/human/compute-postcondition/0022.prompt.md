Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of three positive integers n, a, and b, where n is the number of buns, a is the usual price of a bun, and b is the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price (0 ≤ k ≤ min(n, b)).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
    k = min(n, b - a)
    if b <= a:
        print(a * n)
    else:
        print((b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `n`, `a`, `b`, and `k` are integers. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, then `k` is the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`. If `b` is greater than `a`, then `k` remains the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers updated to the values of the first three integers entered by the user; `k` is the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`, regardless of whether `b <= a` or not.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer from the input, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, and `k` is the minimum of `n` and `b - a`. Since the if condition `b <= a` is not met in the else part, the value of `k` remains as the minimum of `n` and `b - a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
