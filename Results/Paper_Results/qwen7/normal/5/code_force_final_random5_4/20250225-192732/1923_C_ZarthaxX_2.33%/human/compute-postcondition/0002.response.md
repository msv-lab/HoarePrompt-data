Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `q` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 × 10^5, `c` is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces, `ones` is a list of length n+1 where each element is 0**.

Explanation: The code initializes a list `ones` with `n + 1` elements, all set to 0. The values of `t`, `n`, `q`, `c`, and `nums` remain unchanged from their initial state.
