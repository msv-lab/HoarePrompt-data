Based on the initial state provided:

- `onesInRange` is calculated as `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`.
- `sumInRange` is calculated as `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`.
- `q` must be greater than 0.
- `l` is an integer from input.
- `r` is an integer from input.
- The value of `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange` is less than or equal to `sumInRange`.

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('YES')
```

Given the information, the print statement will output the string 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
