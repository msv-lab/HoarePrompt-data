Based on the initial state provided:

- `onesInRange` is calculated as `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`.
- `sumInRange` is calculated as `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`.
- `q` must be greater than 1.
- `l` and `r` are integers from input.
- The condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange` is compared with `sumInRange`.

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('NO')
```

This statement will print the string 'NO' regardless of the values of `onesInRange`, `sumInRange`, `q`, `l`, and `r`. The condition mentioned does not affect the execution of the print statement itself.

Output: **NO**
