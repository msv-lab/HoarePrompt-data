Output State: **t is a positive integer, n and q are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 × 10^5, c is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9, nums is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `nums = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` takes input from the user, splits it by spaces, and converts each element to an integer. It then assigns this list of integers to the variable `nums`. The values of `t`, `n`, `q`, and `c` remain unchanged from their initial state.
