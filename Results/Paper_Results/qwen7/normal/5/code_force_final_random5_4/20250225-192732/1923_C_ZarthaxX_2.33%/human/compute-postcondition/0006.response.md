Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `q` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 × 10^5, `c` is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces, `ones` is a list of length n+1 where each element is 0, `sum` is a list of n+1 elements where each element is 0, `i` is 3, `sum[2]` is `sum[1] + nums[1] - 1**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `sum[2]` by adding `sum[1]` to `nums[1]` and then subtracting 1. The value of `i` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
