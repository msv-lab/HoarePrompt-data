Postcondition: **`onesInRange` is `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`, `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`, `q` must be greater than 1, `l` and `r` are integers from input, and the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange` is compared with `sumInRange`. Since the if condition `l == r` is met, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.**
