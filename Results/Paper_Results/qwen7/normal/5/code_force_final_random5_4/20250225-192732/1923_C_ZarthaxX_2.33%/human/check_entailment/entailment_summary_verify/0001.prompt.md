You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    1
    
    5 4
    
    1 2 1 4 5
    
    1 5
    
    4 4
    
    3 4
    
    1 3

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO

- Program:
import math

testCases = int(input())
for i in range(testCases):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, q) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    nums = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    ones = [0 for i in range(n + 1)]
    sum = [0 for i in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        ones[i] = ones[i - 1] + (1 if nums[i - 1] == 1 else 0)
        sum[i] = sum[i - 1] + nums[i - 1] - 1
    for _ in range(q):
        (l, r) = map(int, input().split(' '))
        if l == r:
            print('NO')
            continue
        onesInRange = ones[r] - ones[l - 1]
        sumInRange = sum[r] - sum[l - 1]
        if 2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of positive integers and a series of queries. For each query, it checks whether a certain condition involving the count of 1's and the sum of elements in a specified subarray of the list is satisfied. If the condition is met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value but prints the results of the queries directly.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis
1. **Good Array Definition**:
   - An array \(a\) of length \(m\) is considered good if there exists an integer array \(b\) of length \(m\) such that:
     - \(\sum_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum_{i=1}^{m} b_i\)
     - \(a_i \neq b_i\) for every index \(i\) from 1 to \(m\)
     - \(b_i > 0\) for every index \(i\) from 1 to \(m\)

2. **Subarray Query**:
   - We need to check if a given subarray \(c_{l_i}, c_{l_i+1}, \dots, c_{r_i}\) is good.

### Given Program Analysis
The given program has the following issues:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is defined but never called after the initial `func_1()` call inside the loop.
   - This means the function body is never executed, leading to an infinite loop or unexpected behavior.

2. **Logic for Checking Good Subarray**:
   - The logic for checking if a subarray is good is flawed.
   - The current logic uses the count of 1s (`onesInRange`) and the sum of elements (`sumInRange`) to determine if the subarray can be transformed into a good array.
   - However, this approach does not correctly account for the necessary conditions for a subarray to be good.

### Correct Approach
To correctly determine if a subarray is good, we need to consider the following:
- The sum of the subarray must be even because each element in \(b\) must be positive and different from the corresponding element in \(a\).
- The subarray must contain at least two distinct elements to allow for the transformation into a good array.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def is_good_subarray(nums, l, r):
    # Check if the sum of the subarray is even
    subarray_sum = sum(nums[l-1:r])
    if subarray_sum % 2 != 0:
        return False
    
    # Check if there are at least two distinct elements in the subarray
    distinct_elements = len(set(nums[l-1:r]))
    if distinct_elements < 2:
        return False
    
    return True

testCases = int(input())
for _ in range(testCases):
    (n, q) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    nums = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    
    for _ in range(q):
        (l, r) = map(int, input().split(' '))
        if is_good_subarray(nums, l, r):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

```

### Conclusion
The given program is incorrect due to the issues mentioned above. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
