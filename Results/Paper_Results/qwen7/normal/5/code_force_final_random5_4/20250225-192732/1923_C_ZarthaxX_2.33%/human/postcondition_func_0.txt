The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of positive integers and a series of queries. For each query, it checks whether a certain condition involving the count of 1's and the sum of elements in a specified subarray of the list is satisfied. If the condition is met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value but prints the results of the queries directly.
