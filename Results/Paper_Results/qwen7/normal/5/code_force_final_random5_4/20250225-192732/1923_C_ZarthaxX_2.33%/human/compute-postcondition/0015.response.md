Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Loop Head Variables:**
   - The loop head in the given code is `for _ in range(q):`.
   - The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and `q`.

2. **Determine Loop Execution Condition:**
   - Whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `q`.
   - The loop will execute as long as `q` is greater than 0.

3. **Current State Before Loop:**
   - `t` is a positive integer.
   - `n` and `q` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, q \leq 3 \times 10^5\).
   - `c` is a list of `n` positive integers where \(1 \leq c_i \leq 10^9\).
   - `nums` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces.
   - `ones` is a list of length `n+1` where each element is 0.
   - `sum` is a list of `n+1` elements where each element is 0.
   - `i` is `n+1`.
   - `ones[n]` is the sum of 1's in `nums` up to index `n-1`.
   - `sum[n+1]` is the sum of all elements in `nums` minus the count of 1's in `nums`.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - Since the loop depends on `q`, we need to ensure that `q` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
   - The other variables (`t`, `n`, `c`, `nums`, `ones`, `sum`, `i`, `ones[n]`, `sum[n+1]`) are not directly involved in determining whether the loop can execute and do not need to be adjusted.

### Final Answer:
State: **`q` must be greater than 0**

This ensures that the loop will execute at least once if `q` is greater than 0.
