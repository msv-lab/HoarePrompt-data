Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `q` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 × 10^5, `c` is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces, `ones` is a list of length n+1 where each element is 0, `sum` is a list of n+1 elements where each element is 0, `i` is 2, `ones[1]` is 1 if the first element of `nums` is 1, otherwise 0.**

Explanation: The code updates the `ones` list. Specifically, `ones[i]` is set to `ones[i - 1] + (1 if nums[i - 1] == 1 else 0)`. Initially, `i` is 1, so `ones[1]` is updated to `ones[0] + (1 if nums[0] == 1 else 0)`. Since `ones[0]` is 0 (as specified in the initial state), `ones[1]` becomes 1 if the first element of `nums` is 1, or 0 otherwise. All other variables remain unchanged.
