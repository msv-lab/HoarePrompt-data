Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `onesInRange` is defined as `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`.
   - `sumInRange` is defined as `sum[r] - sum[l]`.
   - `q` must be greater than 1.
   - `l` equals `r`.

2. **Substitute `l = r`:**
   - Since `l` equals `r`, we can substitute `l` with `r` in the expressions for `onesInRange` and `sumInRange`.
   - Therefore, `onesInRange` becomes `ones[r] - ones[r - 1]`.
   - And `sumInRange` becomes `sum[r] - sum[r]`, which simplifies to `0`.

3. **Expression Simplification:**
   - We need to evaluate the expression `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange`.
   - Substituting `l = r` into the expression, it simplifies to `2 * (ones[r] - ones[r - 1]) + (r - r + 1) - (ones[r] - ones[r - 1])`.
   - This further simplifies to `2 * (ones[r] - ones[r - 1]) + 1 - (ones[r] - ones[r - 1])`.
   - Which is `ones[r] - ones[r - 1] + 1`.

4. **Comparison with `sumInRange`:**
   - We compare `ones[r] - ones[r - 1] + 1` with `sumInRange`, which is `0`.
   - So, we need to check if `ones[r] - ones[r - 1] + 1` is equal to `0`.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - For `ones[r] - ones[r - 1] + 1` to be equal to `0`, `ones[r] - ones[r - 1]` must be `-1`.
   - However, since `ones[r] - ones[r - 1]` represents the number of 1s between indices `r-1` and `r`, it cannot be negative. Thus, the comparison `ones[r] - ones[r - 1] + 1 == 0` will never be true.

Given this analysis, the print statement `print('NO')` will always execute because the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange == sumInRange` will never be met.

Output: **NO**
