Output State: **After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be `n+1`. The `ones` list will contain the cumulative count of 1's encountered so far in the `nums` list, with the last element being the total count of 1's in the entire list. The `sum` list will store the cumulative sum of the elements in `nums`, adjusted by subtracting the count of 1's, with the last element being the final adjusted sum. Each iteration of the loop processes a query defined by `l` and `r`, and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the condition involving `onesInRange` and `sumInRange`.**

In simpler terms, after running the loop through all its iterations (up to `q` times), the value of `i` will be `n+1`, indicating that all elements in the `nums` list have been processed. The `ones` list will have the cumulative count of 1's in `nums`, and the `sum` list will have the cumulative sum of `nums` elements adjusted by subtracting the count of 1's. Each query processed during the loop will result in a 'YES' or 'NO' printed based on the given condition.
