Output State: **`onesInRange` is `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`, `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l]`, `q` must be greater than 1, `l` equals `r`, and `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange` is compared with `sumInRange`.**

Explanation: The code updates `sumInRange` to `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`, which simplifies to `sum[r] - sum[l]` because `sum[l - 1]` becomes `sum[l]` when `l` equals `r`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
