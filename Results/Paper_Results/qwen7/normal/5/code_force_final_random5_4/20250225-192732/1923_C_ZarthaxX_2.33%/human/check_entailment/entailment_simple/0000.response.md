Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining if a subarray is "good" based on specific conditions.
2. The annotated program correctly initializes variables and processes each test case and query.
3. The logic within the function `func_1()` is designed to check if a subarray is good:
   - It calculates the cumulative count of 1s (`ones`) and the adjusted sum (`sum`) for the entire array.
   - For each query, it checks if the subarray is good using the given conditions.
4. The program handles the input and output as specified in the problem statement.
5. The logic for checking if a subarray is good is correct:
   - A subarray is good if the sum of the elements in the subarray minus the count of 1s is at least twice the count of 1s plus the length of the subarray minus the count of 1s.
6. The program correctly prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each query based on the result of the condition check.

Given the above analysis, the annotated program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
