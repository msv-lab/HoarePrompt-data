#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers representing the dimensions N and M of the field, respectively, where 3 ≤ N, M ≤ 99 and N and M are odd. The field is represented as a list of strings, where each string contains M characters and there are N such strings. The list contains descriptions of the field as described in the problem statement. Additionally, the function takes a list of strings, where each string represents an action in the game as described in the problem statement.
def func_1(a, b):
    x, y = a
    dx, dy = b
    return x + dx, y + dy
    #The program returns x + dx, y + dy, where x is assigned to a, y is assigned to a, dx is the first part of b split, and dy is the second part of b split.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. Parameter `a` is expected to be a tuple containing an integer representing the dimension N of the field, and parameter `b` is a string that is split into two parts, representing the dimension M of the field. The function returns the values `x + dx` and `y + dy`, where `x` and `y` are both assigned the value of `a[0]`, and `dx` and `dy` are the first and second parts of `b` split into two separate values.
