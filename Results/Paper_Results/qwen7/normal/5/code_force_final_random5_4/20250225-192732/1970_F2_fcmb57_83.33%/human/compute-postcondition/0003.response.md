Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, where `a` is an integer representing the dimension N of the field, and `b` is a string representing the dimension M of the field split into two parts. The function returns the values `x + dx` and `y + dy`, where `x` and `y` are initially assigned the value of `a`, and `dx` and `dy` are the first and second parts of `b` split into two separate values.**

This means the function takes two integers `a` and `b`, assigns both `x` and `y` to `a`, then splits `b` into two parts, assigning the first part to `dx` and the second part to `dy`, and finally returns the sum of `x` and `dx`, and the sum of `y` and `dy`.
