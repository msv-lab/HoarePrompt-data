### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given problem and the provided code step-by-step.

#### Problem Description Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Provided Code Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   ```python
   def func_1(a, b):
       while b:
           (a, b) = (b, a % b)
       return a
   ```
   This function correctly computes the GCD of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. However, it is not used in the main function `func_2`.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   ```python
   def func_2(n, m):
       cnt = 0
       for i in range(1, m):
           x = n - (i * i - i)
           y = i * i
           cnt = cnt + x // y + (i > 1)
       if cnt == 0:
           return 1
       return cnt
   ```
   The function `func_2` has a significant issue. Let's break down what it does:
   - It iterates through a loop from 1 to \(m-1\).
   - For each \(i\), it calculates \(x = n - (i^2 - i)\) and \(y = i^2\).
   - It then updates the counter `cnt` by adding \(x // y\) and a condition check `(i > 1)`.

   The calculations for \(x\) and \(y\) do not align with the problem requirements. Specifically, \(x\) and \(y\) are not related to the conditions \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

   The logic inside the loop does not correctly determine the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\).

#### Function Summary Analysis:
The provided function summary states that `func_2` always returns 1 regardless of the input values. This is incorrect because the function should return the correct count of valid pairs.

#### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to iterate through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if they satisfy the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * func_1(a, b)) == 0:
                cnt += 1
    return cnt
```

This approach iterates through all pairs \((a, b)\) and uses the GCD function to check the condition.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. The function `func_2` does not follow the correct logic and always returns 1, which is incorrect.

**Final: False**
