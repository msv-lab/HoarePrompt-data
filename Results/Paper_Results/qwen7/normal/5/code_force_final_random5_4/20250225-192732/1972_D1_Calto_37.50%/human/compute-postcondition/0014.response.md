Output State: `cnt` is 1, `i` is 4, `m` must be greater than 3, `x` is -20, `y` is 16.

Explanation: The loop continues until `i` reaches `m`. From the given information, we can see that after the third iteration, `i` is 3 and `m` must be greater than 3. Since `i` increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` will be 4. However, the value of `cnt` does not change from the third iteration because the condition `i > 1` is still true but the term `x // y` results in a negative or zero value, which does not contribute to increasing `cnt`. Therefore, `cnt` remains at 1. The values of `x` and `y` continue to decrease as per the formula `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i`, respectively. For `i = 4`, `x` becomes `-20` and `y` becomes `16`.
