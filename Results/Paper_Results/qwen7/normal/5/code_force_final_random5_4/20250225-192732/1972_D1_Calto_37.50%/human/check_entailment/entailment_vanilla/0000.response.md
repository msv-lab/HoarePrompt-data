Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - The implementation is correct and efficient.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function is intended to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions.
   - The function iterates through values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m-1\).
   - For each \(b\), it calculates \(x\) and \(y\) as follows:
     - \(x = n - (i * i - i)\)
     - \(y = i * i\)
   - It then increments the count `cnt` by \(x // y + (i > 1)\).

### Problem Description Analysis

The problem requires us to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
- \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Issues with the Given Program

1. **Incorrect Calculation of \(x\) and \(y\)**:
   - The expressions for \(x\) and \(y\) do not align with the problem requirements.
   - Specifically, \(x = n - (i * i - i)\) and \(y = i * i\) do not seem to be related to the GCD condition.

2. **Logic for Counting Valid Pairs**:
   - The logic inside the loop does not correctly implement the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The current approach seems to be trying to count something else, likely related to squares, which is not relevant to the problem.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function returns 1 if `cnt` is 0, but this does not handle the case where no valid pairs exist properly.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the provided function `func_2` does not correctly implement the required logic to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
