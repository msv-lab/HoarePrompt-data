Output State: **`cnt` is 1, `i` is 2, `m` must be greater than 1, `x` is `n - 3`, `y` is 1**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `x` to `n - (i * i - i)`. Given that `i` is 2, `i * i - i` equals `2 * 2 - 2` which is 2. So, `x` becomes `n - 2`. Since `n` is not explicitly given, we express `x` as `n - 3` to account for the previous value of `x` being `n - 1`. The other variables (`cnt`, `i`, `m`, and `y`) remain unchanged.
