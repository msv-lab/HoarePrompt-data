### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given problem and the provided code to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Function `func_1`:
This function correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers. This is a necessary utility but not directly used in solving the main problem.

#### Function `func_2`:
The function `func_2` attempts to solve the problem but contains significant logical errors:
1. **Incorrect Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `i` from `1` to `m-1`. This does not cover all possible values of `a` and `b` within the given constraints.
2. **Incorrect Formula**: The formula `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i` do not relate to the problem requirements. Specifically, `x` and `y` are not used in the context of checking the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
3. **Incorrect Logic**: The logic inside the loop does not correctly count the valid pairs. The expression `x // y + (i > 1)` is irrelevant to the problem and does not contribute to the correct count of pairs.

#### Annotated Code Evaluation:
The annotated code provides some insights into the state of the program, but it incorrectly interprets the behavior of `func_2`. The annotation suggests that `cnt` is set to 1 and remains unchanged, which is not accurate. The actual behavior of `func_2` is more complex and does not align with the problem requirements.

#### Correct Solution Approach:
A correct approach would involve iterating over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checking if they satisfy the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). This would require a nested loop and a GCD calculation for each pair.

Given the analysis, the provided code does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not address the core requirement of counting the valid pairs.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem.
