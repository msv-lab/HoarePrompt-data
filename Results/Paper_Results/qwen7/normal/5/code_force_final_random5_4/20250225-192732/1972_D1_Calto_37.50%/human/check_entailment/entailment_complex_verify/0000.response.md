### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the problem statement to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Statement Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Code Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to compute the GCD of two numbers \(a\) and \(b\).
   - However, this function is not used in the main logic of the program.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function attempts to solve the problem but does not correctly implement the required logic.
   - The function iterates over a range from 1 to \(m-1\) and calculates some values \(x\) and \(y\), but these calculations do not align with the problem requirements.
   - Specifically, the logic inside the loop does not check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Annotated Code Analysis:
- The annotated code provides insights into the state of the program, but it incorrectly suggests that the function always returns 1. This is not true.
- The loop in `func_2` should be checking the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\), but it does not do so.

#### Test Case Verification:
Consider the test case \(n = 2\), \(m = 3\):

- Expected output: 3 (as mentioned in the example output).
- Running the provided code with this input will not produce the correct result.

Let's manually verify the expected pairs:
- For \(a = 1\):
  - \(b = 1\): \(1 + 1 = 2\) and \(1 \cdot \gcd(1, 1) = 1\). \(2\) is a multiple of \(1\).
  - \(b = 2\): \(1 + 2 = 3\) and \(2 \cdot \gcd(1, 2) = 2\). \(3\) is not a multiple of \(2\).
  - \(b = 3\): \(1 + 3 = 4\) and \(3 \cdot \gcd(1, 3) = 3\). \(4\) is not a multiple of \(3\).
- For \(a = 2\):
  - \(b = 1\): \(2 + 1 = 3\) and \(1 \cdot \gcd(2, 1) = 1\). \(3\) is a multiple of \(1\).
  - \(b = 2\): \(2 + 2 = 4\) and \(2 \cdot \gcd(2, 2) = 2\). \(4\) is a multiple of \(2\).
  - \(b = 3\): \(2 + 3 = 5\) and \(3 \cdot \gcd(2, 3) = 3\). \(5\) is not a multiple of \(3\).

Thus, the valid pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), and \((2, 2)\), which gives us 3 pairs.

#### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not address the core requirement of counting ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final:
**False**
