Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies the range for the variable `i` as `range(1, m)`. Therefore, the variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `m`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `cnt` is 1
   - `i` is 1
   - `m` must be greater than 1
   - `x` is `n - 1`
   - `y` is 1

3. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `m`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `m` must be greater than 1.

4. **Update the state**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented to 2.
   - `m` must remain greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - `m` must still be greater than 1.

Given these points, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`cnt` is 1, `i` is 2, `m` must be greater than 1, `x` is `n - 1`, `y` is 1**
