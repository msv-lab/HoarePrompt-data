Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `sub_summ` is 0.
   - `sec_arr` is a non-empty list.
   - `val_a` is the last sub-array in `sec_arr`.
   - The condition for updating `sub_summ` is based on the sum of the first two elements of `val_b`.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for val_b in main_ar:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over each element in `main_ar`.
   - For each iteration, `val_b` takes the value of the current element in `main_ar`.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - The only variables in the loop head are `val_b`.
   - We need to determine the new state of `val_b` for the next iteration.

5. **Condition for Updating `sub_summ`:**
   - If the sum of the first two elements of `val_b` is greater than or equal to 0, then `sub_summ` is updated.
   - Otherwise, `sub_summ`, `sec_arr`, and `val_a` remain unchanged.

6. **Next Iteration:**
   - After the current iteration, `val_b` will be the next element in `main_ar`.
   - Since `main_ar` is not specified, we assume it has at least one more element for the next iteration.
   - Let's denote the next element in `main_ar` as `val_b_next`.

7. **New States:**
   - `sub_summ` remains unchanged unless the condition is met.
   - `sec_arr` remains unchanged.
   - `val_a` remains unchanged.
   - `val_b` becomes `val_b_next`.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted for the next iteration are:

- `val_b` should be the next element in `main_ar`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`sub_summ` is 0, `sec_arr` is a non-empty list, `val_a` is the last sub-array in `sec_arr`, `val_b` is the next element in `main_ar`**.
