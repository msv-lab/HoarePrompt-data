Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program uses `func_1` and `func_2` to read input.
   - `func_1` reads an integer.
   - `func_2` reads multiple integers separated by spaces and returns them as a tuple.
   
2. **Main Function:**
   - The main function seems to be missing and is not defined in the provided code snippet.
   - The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are placeholders for reading input, but they are not used in the logic to solve the problem.

3. **Function 3:**
   - `func_3` takes two arrays, `main_ar` and `sec_arr`.
   - It calculates the sum of elements in `sec_arr` (`sub_summ`).
   - It iterates through `main_ar` and adds `val_b[0] + val_b[1]` to `sub_summ` if `val_b[0] + val_b[1] >= 0`.

### Problem Understanding:
- Alice wants to maximize her profit.
- Bob wants to minimize Alice's profit.
- If Alice buys less than `k` items, Bob takes all items for free.
- If Alice buys `k` or more items, Bob takes `k` items for free and Alice pays for the remaining items.

### Correct Approach:
- Alice should choose the items with the highest difference `b_i - a_i` to maximize her profit.
- Bob will choose the `k` most expensive items (from Alice's perspective) to minimize Alice's profit.

### Issues in the Given Code:
1. **Missing Main Logic:**
   - The main logic to solve the problem is not present in the given code.
   - The function `func_3` does not seem to implement the required logic.

2. **Incorrect Calculation:**
   - The function `func_3` sums up values without considering the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob.
   - It does not handle the scenario where Bob takes `k` items for free.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not contain the necessary logic to solve the problem correctly. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
