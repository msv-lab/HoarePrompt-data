Precondition: **main_ar is a list of pairs (a_i, b_i), where a_i and b_i are integers representing the prices for Alice and Bob respectively; sec_arr is a list of pairs (val_a, val_b) where val_a and val_b are integers.** 

However, based on the problem description and the provided function, it seems there might be a misunderstanding or misalignment between the function and the problem statement. The function `func_3` does not directly relate to the described game scenario involving Alice and Bob. Instead, it appears to be calculating a sum based on some conditions. Given the context, let's clarify the correct precondition based on the problem description:

Precondition: **main_ar is a list of pairs (a_i, b_i), where a_i and b_i are integers representing the prices for Alice and Bob respectively; n is the length of main_ar; k is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n.**
