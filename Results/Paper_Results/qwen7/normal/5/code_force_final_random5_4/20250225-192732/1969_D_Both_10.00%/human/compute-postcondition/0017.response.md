Postcondition: `sub_summ` is 0 plus `val_b[0]` plus `val_b[1]`, `sec_arr` is a non-empty list, `val_a` is the last sub-array in `sec_arr`, `val_b` is the next element in `main_ar`, if `val_b[0] + val_b[1]` is greater than or equal to 0. Otherwise, `sub_summ` remains 0, `sec_arr` is a non-empty list, `val_a` is the last sub-array in `sec_arr`, and `val_b` is the next element in `main_ar`.
