Output State: **The program returns the total count of '0' digits from the end of `num` until the first non-zero digit is encountered**

This means that the program returns a value representing how many trailing zeros the initial integer `num` had before encountering its first non-zero digit. If `num` consists entirely of zeros, the returned value would be the total number of these zeros. If there are no trailing zeros or if `num` is not composed entirely of zeros, the return value will be the count of trailing zeros up to the point where the first non-zero digit appears.
