Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `counter` is 1 if the last digit of `num` is '0'. Otherwise, `counter` remains 0.
   - `num` must be an integer such that \(1 \leq num \leq 10^9\).
   - `i` is `len(num) - 1`.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Head Variables:**
   - The loop head involves the variable `i`.

4. **Adjusting the State:**
   - Since the loop is iterating from `len(num) - 1` down to `0`, at the end of each iteration, `i` is decremented by 1.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i - 1`.

5. **Post-Iteration State:**
   - `counter` remains unchanged unless the loop body modifies it, but since the loop body is omitted, `counter` stays as it was.
   - `num` remains unchanged.
   - `i` becomes `i - 1`.

6. **Condition for Next Iteration:**
   - The loop continues as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0.

Given the initial state where `i` is `len(num) - 1`, the next value of `i` would be `len(num) - 2`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`counter` is 1 if the last digit of `num` is '0'. Otherwise, `counter` remains 0, `num` must be an integer such that \(1 \leq num \leq 10^9\), and `i` is `len(num) - 2`.**
