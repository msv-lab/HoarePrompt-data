Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State
- `counter` is 2 if the character at position `i` (which is `len(num) - 2`) in `num` is '0', otherwise `counter` is 1.
- `num` is an integer such that \(1 \leq num \leq 10^9\).
- `i` is `len(num) - 2`.

### Loop Head
The loop iterates from `len(num) - 1` down to `0` with a step of `-1`. The loop variable `i` starts at `len(num) - 2` and decreases by 1 each iteration.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initial Values:**
   - `i` starts at `len(num) - 2`.
   - The loop will run until `i` becomes less than `0`.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - In the current iteration, `i` is `len(num) - 2`.
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `0`.

3. **Next Iteration:**
   - After the current iteration, `i` will be decremented by 1, so `i` will become `len(num) - 3`.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - The only variable in the loop head is `i`.
   - Therefore, we need to adjust the value of `i` to `len(num) - 3`.

### Final State
- `counter` remains unchanged unless the condition inside the loop body changes it.
- `num` remains unchanged.
- `i` is now `len(num) - 3`.

### Answer
State: **`counter` is 2 if the character at position `i` (which is `len(num) - 2`) in `num` is '0', otherwise `counter` is 1; `num` is an integer such that \(1 \leq num \leq 10^9\); `i` is `len(num) - 3`**.
