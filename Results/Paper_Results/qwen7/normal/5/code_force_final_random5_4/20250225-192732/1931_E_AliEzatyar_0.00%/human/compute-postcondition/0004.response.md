Output State: **`counter` is 1, `num` must be an integer such that 1 <= num <= 10^9, `i` is len(num) - 1, and the current value of `num[i]` is '0'.**

Explanation: The variable `counter` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. The other variables (`num`, `i`, and the current value of `num[i]`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
