Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:
   - `e` is a non-empty string.
   - `q` is the first character of `e`.
   - If `q` is '+', then `P` is 1. Otherwise, `q` is not '+' and `M` is 1.

2. **Loop Head**: The loop iterates over each character in the string `e`. The loop variable `q` takes on each character of `e` sequentially.

3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `q` needs to be set to the next character in the string `e`.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since `e` is a non-empty string, it will always have at least one character. After the first iteration, `e` still contains characters left to iterate over.
   - `q` will now be the second character of `e`.
   - If the new `q` is '+', then `P` will be 1. Otherwise, `M` will be 1.

5. **Updated State**: After the loop advances to the next character:
   - `e` remains the same (non-empty).
   - `q` is now the second character of `e`.
   - If the new `q` is '+', then `P` is 1. Otherwise, `M` is 1.

Given this reasoning, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`e` is a non-empty string, `q` is the second character of `e`. If `q` is '+', then `P` is 1. Otherwise, `q` is not '+' and `M` is 1.**
