Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for q in e:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `q` and `e`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are characters left in the string `e`. After each iteration, `q` takes the value of the current character from `e`, and `e` loses that character.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `s` is an input integer.
   - `e` is a non-empty string that is one character shorter than it was before the loop started.
   - If `q` equals '+', then `P` is 2 and `M` is 0. Otherwise, `M` is 2 and `P` is 0.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `e` is one character shorter at the end of the previous iteration, it means one character has been processed by the loop.
   - Therefore, `e` must now be a non-empty string that is two characters shorter than it was at the beginning.
   - `q` is the character that was just processed from `e`.
   - Depending on the value of `q`, either `P` or `M` will change.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `s` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the loop.
   - `e` is now a non-empty string that is two characters shorter than it was at the start.
   - `q` is the character that was just processed from `e`.
   - Based on the value of `q`, either `P` or `M` will change.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `e` (which is now two characters shorter), `q` (the character just processed), and the values of `P` and `M` based on the value of `q`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`s` is an input integer, `e` is a non-empty string that is two characters shorter, `q` is the last character processed from `e`, if `q` equals '+', then `P` is 2 and `M` is 0, otherwise `M` is 2 and `P` is 0**.
