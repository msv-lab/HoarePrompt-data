Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(int(input())):`. The variables involved in this loop are `i` and the value of `int(input())`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `int(input())`. 

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `s` is an input integer.
   - `e` is an empty string.
   - `P` is the total number of '+' characters encountered in `e`.
   - `M` is the total number of '-' characters encountered in `e`.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop condition is based on `i < int(input())`, we need to increment `i` by 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `int(input()) + 1`.
   - Therefore, `i` will be incremented by 1 from its current value.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `s` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `e` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `P` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `M` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - `int(input())` remains the same as it is the upper limit for the loop.

Given the above steps, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `s` is an input integer, `e` is an empty string, `P` is the total number of '+' characters encountered in `e`, `M` is the total number of '-' characters encountered in `e`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `int(input())` is the same as before.**

However, since we are only adjusting the states of objects in the loop head, the final answer is:

**State: `s` is an input integer, `e` is an empty string, `P` is the total number of '+' characters encountered in `e`, `M` is the total number of '-' characters encountered in `e`, `i` is incremented by 1.**
