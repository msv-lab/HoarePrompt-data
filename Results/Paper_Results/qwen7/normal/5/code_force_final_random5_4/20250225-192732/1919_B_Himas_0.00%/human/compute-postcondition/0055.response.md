Output State: **`e` is the input string, `P` is 0, `M` is the total number of characters in `e` that are not '+', `i` is `len(e) + 1`, `q` is the last character of `e`, and `s` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `P = 0` sets the variable `P` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
