Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem. The task requires calculating the minimum possible penalty based on the optimal way to split the array `a` derived from the string `s`. However, the current implementation simply counts the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string `s` and prints their difference. This approach does not consider the optimal way to split the array `a` to minimize the penalty.

To correctly solve the problem, one needs to consider how to split the array `a` into segments such that the sum of the penalties is minimized. The current implementation does not address this requirement at all.

Correctness: **False**
