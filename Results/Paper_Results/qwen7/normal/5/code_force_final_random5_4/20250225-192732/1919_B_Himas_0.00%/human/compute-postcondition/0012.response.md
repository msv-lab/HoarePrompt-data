Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `q` and `e`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each character in the string `e`. The variable `q` takes on each character of `e` in sequence.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `s` is an input integer.
   - `e` is a non-empty string.
   - `P` is either 1 or 0 depending on whether `q` equals '+'.
   - `M` is 1 if `q` does not equal '+' and 0 otherwise.

4. **Analyze the loop execution**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `q` was the last character processed from the string `e`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `q` must be the next character in the string `e`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `q` is the current character being processed, it will change to the next character in the string `e`.
   - `P` and `M` will be updated based on the new value of `q`.

Given these points, let's update the states:

- `s` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
- `e` remains the same as it is not being modified within the loop.
- `q` will be the next character in the string `e`.
- `P` will be 1 if `q` equals '+' and 0 otherwise.
- `M` will be 1 if `q` does not equal '+' and 0 otherwise.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `s` is an input integer, `e` is a non-empty string, `q` is the next character in the string `e`, `P` is 1 if `q` equals '+' and 0 otherwise, `M` is 1 if `q` does not equal '+' and 0 otherwise.**
