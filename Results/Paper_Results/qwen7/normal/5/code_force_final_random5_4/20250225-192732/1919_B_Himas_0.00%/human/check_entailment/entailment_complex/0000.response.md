Reasoning:
The provided function does not correctly solve the given problem. The function counts the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string `s` for each test case and prints the difference between the counts. However, the problem requires splitting the array `a` (represented by the string `s`) into non-empty subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized.

The function does not implement the logic required to find the optimal way to split the array `a` to minimize the penalty. Instead, it simply counts the number of '+' and '-' characters and outputs their difference, which does not consider the penalty calculation based on the lengths of the subarrays.

Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **False**
