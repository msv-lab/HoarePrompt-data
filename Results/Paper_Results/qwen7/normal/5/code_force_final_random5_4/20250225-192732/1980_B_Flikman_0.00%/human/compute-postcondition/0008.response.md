Output State: **`value` is equal to `favorite_value`, `same_value_count` is 1**

Explanation: The variable `same_value_count` is incremented by 1. Since it was initially equal to 0 (implied by the context), after executing the line `same_value_count += 1`, its value becomes 1. The values of `value` and `favorite_value` remain unchanged from their initial state.
