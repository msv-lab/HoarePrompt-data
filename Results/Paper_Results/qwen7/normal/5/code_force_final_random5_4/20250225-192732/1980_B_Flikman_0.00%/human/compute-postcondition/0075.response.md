Postcondition: `greater_count` is either 1 or 0, `same_value_count` is equal to the total number of elements in list `a` that are equal to `favorite_value`, `value` is the first element in the list `a`, `t` will be decreased by the total number of iterations (which is the length of list `a`), and `n`, `f`, and `k` will remain unchanged, `a` must have at least one element.
