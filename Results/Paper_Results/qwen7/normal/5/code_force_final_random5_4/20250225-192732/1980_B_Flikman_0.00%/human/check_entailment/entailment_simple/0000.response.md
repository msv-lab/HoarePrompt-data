Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `f`, and `k`.
3. It then reads the list of values `a` for the cubes.
4. The program calculates the number of cubes with the same value as the favorite cube (`same_value_count`) and the number of cubes with a greater value than the favorite cube (`greater_count`).
5. Based on these counts, the program determines whether the favorite cube will be removed:
   - If `greater_count` is greater than or equal to `k`, the favorite cube will definitely be among the first `k` cubes after sorting, so the program prints 'YES'.
   - If `greater_count + same_value_count` is less than or equal to `k`, the favorite cube will definitely not be among the first `k` cubes after sorting, so the program prints 'NO'.
   - Otherwise, the outcome is uncertain, so the program prints 'MAYBE'.

Given the logic and the provided examples, the program appears to handle all edge cases and conditions correctly.

Correctness: **True**
