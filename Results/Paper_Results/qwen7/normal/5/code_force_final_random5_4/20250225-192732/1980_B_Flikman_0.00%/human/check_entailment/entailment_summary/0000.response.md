Reasoning:
1. The provided program correctly identifies the conditions under which Dmitry's favorite cube will be removed.
2. It calculates the count of elements greater than the favorite cube's value and the count of elements equal to the favorite cube's value.
3. If the count of elements greater than the favorite cube's value is at least \( k \), it prints 'YES', indicating the cube will definitely be removed.
4. If the sum of elements greater than and equal to the favorite cube's value is less than \( k \), it prints 'NO', indicating the cube will definitely not be removed.
5. In all other cases, where the sum of elements greater than and equal to the favorite cube's value is between \( k \) and \( k + \text{same\_value\_count} - 1 \), it prints 'MAYBE', indicating the cube might or might not be removed depending on the exact positions of these elements after sorting.
6. The logic aligns with the problem statement and the examples provided in the execution summary.

Given this analysis, the program correctly implements the required functionality.

Correctness: **True**
