Functionality: **The function accepts a single integer `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, it processes three integers `n`, `f`, and `k` where 1 ≤ f, k ≤ n ≤ 100, and a list `a` containing `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n. The function does not return a specific value but processes the input according to the given constraints.**
