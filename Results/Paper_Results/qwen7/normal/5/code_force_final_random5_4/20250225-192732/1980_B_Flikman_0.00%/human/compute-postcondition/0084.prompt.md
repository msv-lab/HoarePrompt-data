Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `greater_count` is 0, `same_value_count` will be equal to the total number of elements in list `a` that are equal to `favorite_value`, the value of `value` will be the last element in the list `a` that was compared during the loop execution, `t` will be decreased by the total number of iterations (which is the length of list `a`), and `n`, `f`, and `k` will remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for value in a:
    if value > favorite_value:
        greater_count += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `greater_count` is either 1 or 0, `same_value_count` is equal to the total number of elements in list `a` that are equal to `favorite_value`, `value` is the first element in the list `a`, `t` will be decreased by the total number of iterations (which is the length of list `a`), and `n`, `f`, and `k` will remain unchanged, `a` must have at least one element.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `greater_count` is either 2 or remains 1, `same_value_count` is equal to the total number of elements in list `a` that are equal to `favorite_value`, `value` is the second element in the list `a`, `t` is decreased by 1, and `a` must have at least one element remaining.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `greater_count` is either 3 or 2, `same_value_count` is equal to the total number of elements in list `a` that are equal to `favorite_value`, `value` is the third element in the list `a`, `t` is decreased by 1, and `a` must have at least one element remaining.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
