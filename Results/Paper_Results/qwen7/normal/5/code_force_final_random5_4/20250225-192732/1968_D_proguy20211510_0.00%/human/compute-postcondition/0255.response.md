Postcondition: **`b` and `s` are lists. If `a[ps - 1]` equals `maxa` and `foundb` is True, `b` contains the value `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` appended to it, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. If `a[ps - 1]` equals `maxa` and `foundb` is False, `b` remains unchanged and the most internal loop or if statement continues. If `a[ps - 1]` does not equal `maxa`, `b` contains the value `a[ps - 1]` appended to it, and `s` remains unchanged with `pb` now equal to `p[ps - 1]`. Additionally, `s` contains the value `a[ps - 1]` appended to it, `pb` is updated to `p[ps - 1]`, and `ps` is now equal to `p[ps - 1]`.**
