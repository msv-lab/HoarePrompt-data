Output State: **`ptsb` is an empty list, `ptss` is an empty list, `i` is 12, `ss` is the sum of all elements in `s` up to index 11, `sb` is the sum of all elements in `b` up to index 11, `preb` is the list of cumulative sums of `b` up to each index, `pres` is the list of cumulative sums of `s` up to each index.**

This output state reflects that the lists `ptsb` and `ptss` are initialized as empty lists, while the other variables retain their values from the initial state, including the final values of `i`, `ss`, `sb`, `preb`, and `pres`.
