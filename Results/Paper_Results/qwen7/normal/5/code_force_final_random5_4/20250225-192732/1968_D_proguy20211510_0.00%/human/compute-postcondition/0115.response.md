Output State: **`i` is `k+1`, `len(s)` is `k^2`, `sb` is `preb[-1] + b[i-1]`, `pres` is `ss + s[i]`**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `ss + s[i]` to the list `pres`. The values of `i`, `len(s)`, and `sb` remain unchanged from their initial states. The new state of `pres` is updated with the appended value.
