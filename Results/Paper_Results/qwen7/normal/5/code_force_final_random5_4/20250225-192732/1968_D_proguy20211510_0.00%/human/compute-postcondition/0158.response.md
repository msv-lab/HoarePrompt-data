Output State: **`n` is the first value from input split, `k` is the second value from input split, `pb` is the third value from input split, `ps` is the fourth value from input split, `maxs` is the maximum value among the elements in `ptss`, `maxb` is the maximum value among the elements in `ptsb`, the input value for the next iteration is `n - 1`**.

This output state reflects that the input values for `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` have been assigned from the input split, while `maxs` and `maxb` remain unchanged as they were part of the initial state and no operation altered their values. The condition for the next iteration's input value is also updated to `n - 1`.
