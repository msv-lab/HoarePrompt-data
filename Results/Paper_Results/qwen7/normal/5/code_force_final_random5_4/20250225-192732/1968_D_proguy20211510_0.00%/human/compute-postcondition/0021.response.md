Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range 1 to \(10^4\), `k` is an integer, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `maxa` is the maximum value in list `a`, `a[ps - 1]` is equal to `maxa`, either `a[pb - 1]` is not equal to `a[ps - 1]` or at least one of `a[pb - 1]` and `a[ps - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`, and `a[pb - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**

The `continue` statement does not change any variable values but instead moves the control to the next iteration of the loop. All the conditions and values of the variables remain the same as they were before the `continue` statement was executed.
