Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n, k, P_B, P_S are positive integers such that 1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9; p is a permutation of length n; a is an array of positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i; YES and NO are string values 'YES' and 'NO' respectively.**

The code defines two string constants `YES` and `NO` with the values 'YES' and 'NO' respectively. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, or `a`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial conditions.
