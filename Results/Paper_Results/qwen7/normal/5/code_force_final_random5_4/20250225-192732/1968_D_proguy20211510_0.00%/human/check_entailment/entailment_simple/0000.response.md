Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input parameters and initializes necessary variables.
2. It handles the special case where both players start with the maximum value in the array `a`, leading to a draw.
3. The program simulates the game for `k` turns, updating the positions of both players based on the permutation `p` and accumulating scores in lists `b` and `s`.
4. The cumulative sums of scores for both players are calculated using the lists `b` and `s`.
5. The program then determines the maximum possible scores for both players and compares them to decide the winner.
6. The logic for handling the game simulation and score calculation seems correct, and the conditions for determining the winner are properly implemented.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to follow the problem statement accurately and should produce the correct output for the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
