Output State: **`maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`, `n` is an integer converted from the original `n`, `k` is an integer converted from the original `k`, `pb` is an integer converted from the original `pb`, `ps` is an integer converted from the original `ps`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`, `b` is an empty list, `s` is an empty list.**

The code initializes two empty lists `b` and `s`. The values of `maxs`, `maxb`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
