Output State: **`preb` is an empty list, `pres` is an empty list, `sb` is 0, `ss` is 0**

Explanation: The code initializes two new variables `sb` and `ss` with the value `0`. The initial states of `preb` and `pres` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code. Therefore, `preb` is still an empty list and `pres` is still an empty list.
