Output State: **`i` is `k+2`, `len(s)` is `k^2`, `sb` is `preb[-1] + b[k+1]`, `pres` is `ss + s[k+1]`, `ss` is `ss + s[k+1]`, `preb` is `[sb + b[i]]`**

Explanation: The code `preb.append(sb + b[i])` appends the value of `sb + b[i]` to the list `preb`. Given the initial state, `i` is `k+2`, and `sb` is `preb[-1] + b[k+1]`. Since `preb` was not initialized before this line, it is assumed to be an empty list before this operation. After appending `sb + b[i]` to `preb`, the updated state includes the new value in the list `preb`. All other variables remain unchanged.
