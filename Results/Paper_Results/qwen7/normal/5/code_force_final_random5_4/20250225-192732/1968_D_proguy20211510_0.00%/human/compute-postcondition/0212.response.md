Postcondition: `i` is 2, `k` is a positive integer, `foundb` is either True or False, `founds` is True if `a[ps - 1]` equals `maxa`, otherwise `founds` is True. `b` contains elements which are `(k - 1) * maxa` and possibly `a[pb - 1]`, and `s` contains elements which are `(k - 2) * maxa` and possibly the last element of `s` is equal to `a[ps - 1]`.
