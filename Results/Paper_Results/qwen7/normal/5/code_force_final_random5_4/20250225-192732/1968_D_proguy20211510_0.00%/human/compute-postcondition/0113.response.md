Output State: **`i` is `k+1`, `len(s)` is `k^2`, `preb` is a list with the last element being `sb + b[i-1]`**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `sb + b[i]` to the list `preb`. Initially, `i` is `k`, so after the operation, `i` becomes `k+1`. The length of `s` remains unchanged at `k^2`. The list `preb` now contains all its previous elements plus the new element `sb + b[k]`.
