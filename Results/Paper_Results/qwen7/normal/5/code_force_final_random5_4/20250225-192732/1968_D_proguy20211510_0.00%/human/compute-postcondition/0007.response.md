Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4, `k` is an integer, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `a`. The values of `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` remain unchanged. The list `p` is updated to reflect the new list `a` obtained from the input.
