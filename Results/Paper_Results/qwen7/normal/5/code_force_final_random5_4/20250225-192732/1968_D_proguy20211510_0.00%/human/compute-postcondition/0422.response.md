Output State: **`i` is 4, `rem` is `k - i - 1`, `ptsb` contains the value `preb[1] + (k - 1) * b[1]`, `ptss` contains the value `pres[3] + (k - 1) * s[3]`.**

Explanation: The variable `rem` is updated to `k - (i + 1)`, which means `rem` is now `k - 4 - 1` or `k - i - 1`. The other variables (`i`, `ptsb`, and `ptss`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
