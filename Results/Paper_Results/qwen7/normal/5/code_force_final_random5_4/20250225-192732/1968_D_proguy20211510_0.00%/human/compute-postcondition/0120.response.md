Output State: **`i` is `k+2`, `len(s)` is `k^2`, `sb` is `sb + b[i-1]`, `pres` is `ss + s[k+1]` and `pres` is appended with `ss + s[i]`, `ss` is `ss + s[k+1]`, `preb` is `[sb + b[i-1]]`**

Explanation: The code `pres.append(ss + s[i])` appends the value of `ss + s[i]` to the list `pres`. Given the initial conditions:
- `i` is `k+2`
- `len(s)` is `k^2`
- `sb` is `sb + b[i-1]`
- `pres` is `ss + s[k+1]`
- `ss` is `ss + s[k+1]`
- `preb` is `[sb + b[i-1]]`

After executing the code, `pres` will contain the original value of `ss + s[k+1]` plus the new value `ss + s[i]`. Since `i` is `k+2`, the new value added to `pres` is `ss + s[k+2]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
