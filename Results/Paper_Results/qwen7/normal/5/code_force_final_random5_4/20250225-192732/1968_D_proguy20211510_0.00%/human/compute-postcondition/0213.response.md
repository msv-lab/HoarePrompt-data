Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(k)`. The variables involved in this loop are `i` and `k`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 2.
   - `k` is a positive integer.
   - `foundb` is either True or False.
   - `founds` is True if `a[ps - 1]` equals `maxa`, otherwise `founds` is True.
   - `b` contains elements which are `(k - 1) * maxa` and possibly `a[pb - 1]`.
   - `s` contains elements which are `(k - 2) * maxa` and possibly the last element of `s` is equal to `a[ps - 1]`.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2. For the next iteration, `i` will be 3.
   - The value of `k` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop head.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 3.
   - `k` remains the same (it is a positive integer, but its specific value is not changed).

5. **Final State**:
   - `i` is now 3.
   - `k` is still a positive integer.
   - `foundb` remains either True or False.
   - `founds` remains True if `a[ps - 1]` equals `maxa`, otherwise `founds` is True.
   - `b` and `s` remain as described, as they are not directly affected by the loop head variables `i` and `k`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 3, `k` is a positive integer, `foundb` is either True or False, `founds` is True if `a[ps - 1]` equals `maxa`, otherwise `founds` is True, `b` contains elements which are `(k - 1) * maxa` and possibly `a[pb - 1]`, and `s` contains elements which are `(k - 2) * maxa` and possibly the last element of `s` is equal to `a[ps - 1]`**.
