Output State: **`i` is 3, `k` is an integer within the range 1 to \(10^4\), `founds` is True if `a[ps - 1] == maxa` is true, otherwise it is False, `s` is a list with three elements \([(k - 2) * maxa, a[ps - 1], (k - (i + 1)) * maxa]\), `b` is a list with four elements \([b[0], a[pb - 1], (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, a[pb - 1]]\), `ps` is `p[ps - 1]` if `a[ps - 1] != maxa`, and `foundb` is True.**

Explanation: The code snippet appends `a[pb - 1]` to the list `b`. Initially, `b` had three elements: `[b[0], a[pb - 1], (k - (i + 1)) * maxa]`. After appending `a[pb - 1]`, the list `b` now has four elements: `[b[0], a[pb - 1], (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, a[pb - 1]]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
