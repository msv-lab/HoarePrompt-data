Output State: **`i` is 4, `rem` is `k - i - 1`, `ptsb` contains the value `preb[1] + (k - 1) * b[1] + preb[4] + (k - i - 1) * b[4]`, `ptss` contains the value `pres[3] + (k - 1) * s[3]`.**

Explanation: The code appends a new value to the list `ptsb`. The new value is calculated as `preb[i] + rem * b[i]`, which translates to `preb[4] + (k - i - 1) * b[4]` since `i` is 4 and `rem` is `k - i - 1`. The other variables (`i`, `rem`, `ptsb`, and `ptss`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
