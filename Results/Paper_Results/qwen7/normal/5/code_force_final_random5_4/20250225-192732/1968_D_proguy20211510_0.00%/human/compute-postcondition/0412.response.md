Output State: **`i` is 10; `preb` includes the value of `sb + b[i]`; `ss` is updated to include `s[9]`; `sb` is updated to `sb + b[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `sb += b[i]` updates the value of `sb` by adding the value of `b[i]` to it. Given that `i` is initially 10, the value of `sb` is updated to `sb + b[10]`. The other variables (`preb` and `ss`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
