Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(k)`. The only variable directly involved in the loop condition is `i`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 2.
   - `k` is an integer within the range 1 to \(10^4\).
   - `founds` is True if `a[ps - 1] == maxa` is true, otherwise it is False.
   - `s` is a list with two elements \([(k - 2) * maxa, a[ps - 1]]\).
   - `b` is a list with two elements \([b[0], a[pb - 1]]\).
   - `ps` is `p[ps - 1]` if `a[ps - 1] != maxa`.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop condition is `i < k`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 3.

4. **Adjust the State**:
   - The value of `i` changes from 2 to 3.
   - The values of `k`, `founds`, `s`, `b`, and `ps` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 3, `k` is an integer within the range 1 to \(10^4\), `founds` is True if `a[ps - 1] == maxa` is true, otherwise it is False, `s` is a list with two elements \([(k - 2) * maxa, a[ps - 1]]\), `b` is a list with two elements \([b[0], a[pb - 1]]\), and `ps` is `p[ps - 1]` if `a[ps - 1] != maxa**.
