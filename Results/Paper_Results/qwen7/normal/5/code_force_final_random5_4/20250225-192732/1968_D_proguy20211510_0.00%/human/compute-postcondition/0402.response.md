Output State: **`i` is 5; `sb` is `preb`[:-1] + b[5]**.

Explanation: Initially, `i` is 5 and `preb` contains the element `sb + b[4]`. The code `sb += b[i]` increments `sb` by the value of `b[i]`, where `i` is 5. So, `sb` becomes `sb + b[5]`. Since `preb` was `sb + b[4]`, removing `b[4]` from `preb` gives us the updated `sb`. Therefore, `sb` is now `preb` without its last element plus `b[5]`.
