Output State: **`i` must be less than `len(pres)`, `rem` is now `k - i - 2`, `ptss` is a list with an additional element which is `pres[i] + rem * s[i]`, `ptsb` is a list with two additional elements which are `preb[i] + (k - i - 2) * b[i]` and `preb[i] + rem * b[i]`**

Explanation: The code appends a new element to the `ptss` list, which is calculated as `pres[i] + rem * s[i]`. The value of `rem` remains unchanged as it was previously defined as `k - i - 2`. The `ptsb` list already had two additional elements before this line of code, and those remain unchanged. The `ptss` list now has one more element due to the append operation.
