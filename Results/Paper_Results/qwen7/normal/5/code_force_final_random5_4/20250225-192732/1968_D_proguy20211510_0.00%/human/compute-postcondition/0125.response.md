Output State: **`i` is `k+3`, `len(s)` is `k^2`, `sb` is `sb + b[k+2] + b[k+3]`, `pres` is `pres + ss + s[k+3] + s[k+3]`, `ss` is `ss + s[k+3] + s[k+3]`, `preb` is `[sb + b[k+2], sb + b[k+3]]`, `pres` is appended with `ss + s[i]` which is `ss + s[k+3]`**.

Explanation: 
- The value of `i` remains unchanged as `k+3`.
- The length of `s` remains unchanged as `k^2`.
- `sb` is updated to include `b[k+2] + b[k+3]`.
- `pres` is updated to include `ss + s[k+3] + s[k+3]`.
- `ss` is updated to include `ss + s[k+3] + s[k+3]`.
- `preb` remains unchanged as `[sb + b[k+2], sb + b[k+3]]`.
- `pres.append(ss + s[i])` appends `ss + s[k+3]` to `pres`.
