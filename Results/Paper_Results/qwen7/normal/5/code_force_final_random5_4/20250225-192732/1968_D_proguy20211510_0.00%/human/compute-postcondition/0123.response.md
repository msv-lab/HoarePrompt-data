Output State: **`i` is `k+3`, `len(s)` is `k^2`, `sb` is `sb + b[k+2]`, `pres` is `pres + ss + s[k+3]`, `ss` is `ss + s[k+3]`, `preb` is `[sb + b[k+2], sb + b[k+3]]**.

Explanation: The code `preb.append(sb + b[i])` appends the value of `sb + b[i]` to the list `preb`. Given that `i` is `k+3`, the expression `sb + b[i]` becomes `sb + b[k+3]`. Therefore, `preb` now contains both `[sb + b[k+2]]` and `sb + b[k+3]`, resulting in `[sb + b[k+2], sb + b[k+3]]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
