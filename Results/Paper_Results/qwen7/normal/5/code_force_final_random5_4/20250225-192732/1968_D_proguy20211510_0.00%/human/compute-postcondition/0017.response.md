Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4, `k` is an integer, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `maxa` is the maximum value in list `a`, `a[pb - 1]` is equal to `maxa`.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to any variables when `continue` is executed, all the variables retain their previous values. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
