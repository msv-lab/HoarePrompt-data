Output State: **`i` is 3, `k` is a positive integer, `foundb` is True, `founds` is True, `b` contains elements which are `(k - 1) * maxa`, `a[pb - 1]`, and an additional element `(k - 4) * maxa`, `s` contains elements which are `(k - 2) * maxa`, and the last element of `s` is equal to `a[ps - 1]`, and `s` now includes an additional element which is `(k - 4) * maxa**, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

Explanation: The line `founds = True` simply updates the value of `founds` to `True`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
