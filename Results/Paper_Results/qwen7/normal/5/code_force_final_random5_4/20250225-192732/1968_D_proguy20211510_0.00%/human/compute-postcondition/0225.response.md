Postcondition: `i` is 3, `k` is a positive integer, `foundb` is True, `founds` is True if `a[ps - 1]` equals `maxa`, otherwise `founds` is True, `b` contains elements which are `(k - 1) * maxa`, `a[pb - 1]`, and possibly `(k - 4) * maxa`, and `s` contains elements which are `(k - 2) * maxa`, and possibly the last element of `s` is equal to `a[ps - 1]`, and `s` now includes an additional element which is `(k - 4) * maxa`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

This postcondition summarizes both cases of the if-else block. If `a[pb - 1] == maxa`, then `i` remains 3, `k` remains a positive integer, `foundb` becomes True, and the additional elements in `b` and `s` are as specified. If `a[pb - 1] != maxa`, then `i` remains 3, `k` remains a positive integer, `foundb` remains either True or False, `founds` remains True if `a[ps - 1]` equals `maxa`, otherwise `founds` remains True, `b` contains elements which are `(k - 1) * maxa` and possibly `a[pb - 1]`, and `b` now includes an additional element which is `(k - 4) * maxa`, `pb` is now equal to `a[pb - 1]`, and `s` contains elements which are `(k - 2) * maxa` and possibly the last element of `s` is equal to `a[ps - 1]`, and `s` now includes an additional element which is `(k - 4) * maxa`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.
