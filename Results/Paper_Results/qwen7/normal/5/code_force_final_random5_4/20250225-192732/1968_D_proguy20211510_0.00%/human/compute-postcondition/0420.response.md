Output State: **`i` is 3; `rem` is `k - 1`; `ptsb` contains the value `preb[1] + (k - 1) * b[1]`; `ptss` contains the value `pres[3] + (k - 1) * s[3]`.**

Explanation: The code appends a new value to the list `ptss`. This value is calculated as `pres[i] + rem * s[i]`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2, so now `i` is incremented to 3. The value of `rem` remains unchanged as `k - 1`. The value of `ptsb` is not affected by this line of code. The new value appended to `ptss` is `pres[3] + (k - 1) * s[3]`.
