Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is an integer within the range 1 to \(10^4\), `founds` is True, `s` is a list with two elements \([(k - 2) * maxa, a[ps - 1]]\), `b` is a list with two elements \([b[0], a[pb - 1]]\), and the condition `a[ps - 1] == maxa` is true.**

Explanation: The code `s.append(a[ps - 1])` appends the value of `a[ps - 1]` to the list `s`. Given that `a[ps - 1] == maxa` is true, the new list `s` will have two elements: the first element is \((k - 2) * maxa\) and the second element is `maxa`. All other variables remain unchanged.
