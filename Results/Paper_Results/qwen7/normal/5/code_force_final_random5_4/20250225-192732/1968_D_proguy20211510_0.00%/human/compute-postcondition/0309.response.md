Output State: **`maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`, `n` is an integer converted from the original `n`, `k` is an integer converted from the original `k`, `pb` is an integer converted from the original `pb`, `ps` is an integer converted from the original `ps`**.

Explanation: The code snippet converts the strings `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` into integers. The variables `maxs` and `maxb` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code. The original strings `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` are now replaced by their integer counterparts.
