Output State: **`i` is 5; `pres` is updated with `ss + s[5]`**

Explanation: The code appends `ss + s[i]` to the list `pres`. Given that `i` is 5, `s[i]` refers to `s[5]`. The value of `ss` is not specified in the initial state, so it remains unchanged. The list `pres` is updated with the new value `ss + s[5]`. The other variables remain in their initial states.
