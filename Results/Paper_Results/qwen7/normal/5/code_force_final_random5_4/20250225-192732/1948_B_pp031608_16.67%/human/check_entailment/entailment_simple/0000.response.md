Reasoning:
1. The annotated program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the loop that attempts to sort the list by breaking down large numbers into their constituent digits does not correctly handle the transformation process.
2. The `func_1` function checks if the list is sorted but does not help in transforming the list to be sorted through the allowed operations.
3. The main loop incorrectly assumes that breaking down a number into its digits and inserting them back into the list will always lead to a sorted list. This is not true because the relative order of elements that are not broken down might still cause the list to be unsorted after the operation.
4. The program does not account for the possibility that some numbers might need to be broken down multiple times to achieve a sorted list, and it does not ensure that the list remains non-decreasing throughout the process.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if it is possible to transform the array into a sorted one using the specified operations.

Correctness: **False**
