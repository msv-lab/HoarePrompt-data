Reasoning:
The provided program has a few issues that need to be addressed to correctly solve the problem:

1. The main loop iterates through the elements of the list but does not actually perform the required operation of splitting large numbers into their individual digits and inserting them back into the list.
2. The function `func_1` is only used to check if the final list is sorted, but it doesn't help in transforming the list to a sorted state.
3. The logic inside the main loop is flawed because it calls `func_1` before performing any operations, which means it won't attempt to sort the list even if it's not initially sorted.

To fix these issues, the program should:
- Split the large numbers into their digits and insert them back into the list.
- Check after each operation if the list is sorted.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Function to split a number into its digits and insert them back into the list
    def split_and_insert(num, index):
        digits = [int(d) for d in str(num)]
        list1.pop(index)
        list1[index:index] = digits
    
    # Main logic to transform the list into a sorted one
    while True:
        sorted_list = sorted(list1)
        if list1 == sorted_list:
            print('Yes')
            break
        for j in range(len(list1)):
            if list1[j] >= 10:
                split_and_insert(list1[j], j)
                break
        else:
            print('No')
            break
```

With this corrected version, the program will correctly attempt to split and reorder the numbers until the list is sorted or determine that it cannot be sorted.

Correctness: **False**

The original program does not correctly implement the logic needed to solve the problem as described.
