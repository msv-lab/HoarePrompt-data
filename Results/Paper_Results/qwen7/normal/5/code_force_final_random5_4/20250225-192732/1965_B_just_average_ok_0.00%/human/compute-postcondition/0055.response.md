Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State Description:**
   - `num_tests` is a positive integer such that \(0 < \text{num_tests} \leq 999\).
   - `n` is the integer obtained from the first input split. This value is not relevant to the current code snippet.
   - `k` is at least 8.
   - `nums` is a list containing the following elements:
     \[
     [2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, (k-64), (k+1), (k + nums[3] + 1)]
     \]
   - `idx` is 3.

2. **Code Snippet Analysis:**
   - The code snippet is:
     ```python
     print(len(nums))
     ```

3. **Determine the Length of `nums`:**
   - From the initial state, `nums` contains 24 predefined elements plus three additional elements:
     - `(k-64)`
     - `(k+1)`
     - `(k + nums[3] + 1)`
   - Since `nums` initially has 24 elements, adding these three more elements means the total length of `nums` is \(24 + 3 = 27\).

4. **Final Output:**
   - The `print(len(nums))` statement will print the length of the `nums` list, which is 27.

Output: **27**
