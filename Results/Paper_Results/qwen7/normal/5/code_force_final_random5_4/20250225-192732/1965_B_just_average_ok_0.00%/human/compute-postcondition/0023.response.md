Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `k >= 1 << idx`.
2. **Determine the current values of the variables involved in the loop condition**:
   - `k` is at least 16777216.
   - `idx` is 0.

3. **Evaluate the loop condition with the current values**:
   - The expression `1 << idx` when `idx` is 0 evaluates to `1 << 0`, which is `1`.
   - Therefore, the loop condition becomes `k >= 1`.

4. **Check if the loop condition is satisfied**:
   - Since `k` is at least 16777216, which is much greater than 1, the condition `k >= 1` is already true.

Given that the loop condition is already satisfied with the current values of `k` and `idx`, no adjustments are needed to make the loop execute the first time.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`num_tests` is a positive integer such that 0 < num_tests <= 999, `n` is the integer obtained from the first input split, `k` is at least 16777216, `nums` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608], `idx` is 0**
