Output State: **`num_tests` is a positive integer such that 0 < num_tests <= 999, `n` is the integer obtained from the first input split, `k` is at least 16777216, `nums` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608], `idx` is 0.**

The code simply sets `idx` to 0, which changes the value of `idx` from its initial value of 24 to 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
