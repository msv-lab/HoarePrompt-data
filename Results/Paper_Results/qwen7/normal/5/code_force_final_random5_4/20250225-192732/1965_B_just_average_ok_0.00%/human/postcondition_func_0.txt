The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers n and k. For each test case, it generates a list `nums` containing 25 specific integers based on the value of k. The list includes powers of 2 up to the largest power of 2 less than or equal to k, plus three additional elements derived from k. After processing all test cases, it prints the length of `nums` and the elements of `nums` for each case.
