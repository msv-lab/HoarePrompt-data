You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, n and k are integers satisfying 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n. Additionally, the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 10^7.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        nums = [(1 << i) for i in range(24)]
        
        idx = 0
        
        while k >= 1 << idx:
            idx += 1
        
        idx -= 1
        
        nums.append(k - nums[idx])
        
        nums.append(k + 1)
        
        nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)
        
        nums.remove(1 << idx)
        
        print(len(nums))
        
        print(*nums)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will execute for each test case provided by the user. After all iterations, `num_tests` will be the total number of test cases processed, which is a positive integer such that 1 <= num_tests <= 1000. For each test case, `n` will be the integer obtained from the first input split, and `k` will be an integer within the range 2 <= k <= n. The variable `nums` will be a list containing specific integers based on the value of `k` for each test case. Specifically, `nums` will include the powers of 2 up to the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`, plus three additional elements: `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`. After removing the largest power of 2 from the list, `nums` will contain exactly 25 elements. The variable `idx` will be set to the index of the largest power of 2 removed from the list, which will vary depending on the value of `k`.
    #
    #In summary, after all iterations of the loop, the output state will reflect the processing of all test cases, with `num_tests` indicating the total number of cases, `n` and `k` representing the parameters for each case, and `nums` being the final list of 25 integers for each case as described above.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes a series of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 <= t <= 1000), and for each t, two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 10^6, 1 <= k <= n) are provided. The function returns a result based on the conditions specified for n and k within each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
