Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `num_tests` is a positive integer such that `1 <= num_tests <= 1000`.
   - `n` is an integer obtained from the first input split. This value is not directly relevant to the code snippet.
   - `k` is at least `16777216`.
   - `nums` is a list containing integers from `1` to `16777216` with an additional element `k - nums[24]` and now includes `k + 1`.
     - Initially, `nums` contains integers from `1` to `16777216`.
     - An additional element `k - nums[24]` is added to `nums`.
     - Another element `k + 1` is also added to `nums`.
   - `idx` is `24`.
   - `nums` is updated to exclude `1 << idx`.

2. **Understanding `1 << idx`:**
   - `1 << idx` means shifting the binary number `1` to the left by `idx` positions.
   - Since `idx` is `24`, `1 << 24` is `16777216`.

3. **Updating `nums`:**
   - The list `nums` initially contains integers from `1` to `16777216`, plus two additional elements: `k - nums[24]` and `k + 1`.
   - After updating, `16777216` (which is `1 << 24`) is removed from `nums`.

4. **Length of `nums`:**
   - Initially, `nums` had `16777218` elements (from `1` to `16777216` plus two additional elements).
   - After removing `16777216`, the length of `nums` is reduced by `1`.
   - Therefore, the length of `nums` after the update is `16777217`.

Given this analysis, the code snippet `print(len(nums))` will print the length of the updated `nums` list.

Output: **16777217**
