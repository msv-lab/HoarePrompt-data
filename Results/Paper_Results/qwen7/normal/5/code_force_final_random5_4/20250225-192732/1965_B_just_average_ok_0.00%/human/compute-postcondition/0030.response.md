Output State: `num_tests` is a positive integer such that \(0 < \text{num_tests} \leq 999\), `n` is the integer obtained from the first input split, `k` is less than 1 << 4 (which equals 16), `nums` is a list containing \([1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608]\), `idx` is 4.

Explanation: The loop continues as long as `k` is greater than or equal to \(1 << \text{idx}\). Given that `k` starts at least at 16777216 and `idx` increases by 1 each iteration, the loop will continue until `k` is less than \(1 << 4\) (which is 16). Since `k` is initially at least 16777216, it will take 24 iterations for `idx` to reach 24 (since \(16777216 = 1 << 24\)). After 24 iterations, `idx` becomes 24, and `k` is no longer greater than or equal to \(1 << 24\), so the loop terminates. However, based on the provided information, we see that after 3 iterations, `idx` is 4. This implies that the loop will continue until `idx` reaches 24, making the final value of `idx` 24. At this point, `k` would be less than \(1 << 24\), which is 16777216, thus breaking the loop.
