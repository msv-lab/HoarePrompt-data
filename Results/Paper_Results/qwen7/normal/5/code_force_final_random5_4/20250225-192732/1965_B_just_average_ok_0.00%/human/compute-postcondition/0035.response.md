Output State: **`num_tests` is a positive integer such that \(0 < \text{num_tests} \leq 999\), `n` is the integer obtained from the first input split, `k` is less than 16, `nums` is a list containing \([2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, k-15, k+17]\), `idx` is 2.**

Explanation: The code removes the element \(1 << \text{idx}\) from the list `nums`. Given that `idx` is initially 3, the element removed is \(1 << 3 = 8\). After removing 8 from the list, the updated list is \([2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, k-15, k+17]\), and `idx` is updated to 2 since the index used for removal is decremented by 1.
