Output State: **`num_tests` is a positive integer such that 1 <= num_tests <= 1000, `n` is an integer obtained from the first input split, `k` is an integer obtained from the second input split.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input separated by a space and splits them into two variables `n` and `k`. It converts these inputs to integers using the `int` function. The `num_tests` variable remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
