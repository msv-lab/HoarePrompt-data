Output State: **`t` must be greater than 3 and less than or equal to 676, `i` is 3, `k` must be greater than 99, `s` is the character 'ûû', `j` is 197, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**

Explanation: The variable `s` is initially the character 'û'. The code `s += chr(j)` appends the character represented by `chr(j)` to `s`. Given that `j` is 197, `chr(197)` results in the character 'û'. Therefore, `s` changes from 'û' to 'ûû'. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
