You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two positive integers n and k .

Your task is to find a string s such that all possible strings of length n
that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a
subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, print the one with the smallest length. If
there are still multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 676 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line of input containing two integers n
(1\leq n\leq 26 ) and k (1\leq k\leq 26 ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single string s which
satisfies the above property. If there are multiple answers, print the one
with the smallest length. If there are still multiple answers, you may print
any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 2
    
    2 1
    
    2 2
    
    2 3

Output

    ab
    aa
    baab
    abcbac
    
Note

For the first test case, there are two strings of length 1 which can be formed
using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{a}: {\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{b} 
  * \texttt{b}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}} 

For the second test case, there is only one string of length 2 which can be
formed using the first lowercase English alphabet, and it is present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{aa}: {\color{red}{\texttt{aa}}} 

For the third test case, there are 4 strings of length 2 which can be formed
using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{aa}: \texttt{b}{\color{red}{\texttt{aa}}}\texttt{b} 
  * \texttt{ab}: \texttt{ba}{\color{red}{\texttt{ab}}} 
  * \texttt{ba}: {\color{red}{\texttt{ba}}}\texttt{ab} 
  * \texttt{bb}: {\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{aa}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}} 

For the fourth test case, there are 9 strings of length 2 which can be formed
using the first 3 lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{aa}: {\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{bcb}{\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{c} 
  * \texttt{ab}: {\color{red}{\texttt{ab}}}\texttt{cbac} 
  * \texttt{ac}: \texttt{abcb}{\color{red}{\texttt{ac}}} 
  * \texttt{ba}: \texttt{abc}{\color{red}{\texttt{ba}}}\texttt{c} 
  * \texttt{bb}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{c}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{ac} 
  * \texttt{bc}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{bc}}}\texttt{bac} 
  * \texttt{ca}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}\texttt{b}{\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{c} 
  * \texttt{cb}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{cb}}}\texttt{ac} 
  * \texttt{cc}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}\texttt{ba}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        s = ''
        for j in range(97, k + 97):
            s += chr(j)
        if k == 1:
            print(n * s)
        else:
            print((2 - (n == 1)) * s)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases defined by the integer `t`. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`. It then constructs a string `s` containing 95 characters, each being the character corresponding to ASCII values from 97 to `k + 97`. If `k` equals 1, it prints `n` multiplied by the string `s`. Otherwise, it prints `(2 - (n == 1))` multiplied by the string `s`. The function returns nothing but prints the results for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to generate a string `s` such that all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets appear as subsequences of `s`.
   - The goal is to minimize the length of `s`.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The function `func()` takes an integer `t` as input, indicating the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.
   - It constructs a string `s` by concatenating the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - If `k == 1`, it prints `n` copies of `s`. Otherwise, it prints `(2 - (n == 1)) * s`.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - **Case 1: `k == 1`**
     - When `k == 1`, the string `s` will be a single character repeated `n` times.
     - This is correct because the only possible string of length `n` using one character is that character repeated `n` times.
   - **Case 2: `k > 1`**
     - The string `s` constructed by concatenating the first `k` lowercase English alphabets ensures that all possible strings of length `n` using these `k` characters can be found as subsequences.
     - However, the logic `(2 - (n == 1)) * s` is problematic:
       - If `n == 1`, it should print `s` once, but the code prints `s` twice.
       - If `n > 1`, it prints `s` twice, which is unnecessary and does not minimize the length of `s`.

4. **Correct Implementation:**
   - For `k == 1`, the correct output should be `s` repeated `n` times.
   - For `k > 1`, the correct output should be `s` repeated enough times to ensure all possible strings of length `n` are covered.

### Conclusion:
The given code does not correctly handle the case when `n == 1` for `k > 1`. It prints `s` twice instead of just once.

### Correctness:
**False**
