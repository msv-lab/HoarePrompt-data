Output State: `t` must be greater than 3 and less than or equal to 676, `i` is 3, `k` must be greater than 99 and less than or equal to 676 (since `j` starts from 97 and goes up to `k + 97`, and it runs 97 times), `s` will contain the characters from 'ù' to 'ÿ' (which is 97 characters long, corresponding to ASCII values from 128 to 224), `j` is 292 (as it starts from 195 and increases by 1 each iteration, so after 97 iterations, it will be 195 + 97 - 1 = 292), `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.

In natural language: The output state after the loop executes all its iterations is such that `t` remains between 3 and 676, `i` stays as 3, `k` must be within the range of 100 to 676, `s` will be a string containing all characters from 'ù' to 'ÿ' inclusive, `j` will be 292, `n` is still an input integer, and `k` is also an input integer.
