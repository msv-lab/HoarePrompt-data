Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for j in range(97, k + 97)`. The variables involved in this loop are `j` and `k`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 3 and less than or equal to 676.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `k` must be at least 98.
   - `s` is the character 'ù'.
   - `j` is 195.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `k` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `j` is within the range `[97, k + 97)`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 195.

4. **Calculate the new value of `j`**: Since `j` starts from 97 and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `j` would be `195 + 1 = 196`.

5. **Check if the loop can continue**: For the loop to continue, `j` (which is now 196) must still be within the range `[97, k + 97)`. This means `196 < k + 97`.

6. **Determine the required state for the next iteration**:
   - `t` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `i` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `k` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `s` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `j` changes to 196.
   - `n` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `k` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`t` must be greater than 3 and less than or equal to 676, `i` is 3, `k` must be at least 98, `s` is the character 'ù', `j` is 196, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**
