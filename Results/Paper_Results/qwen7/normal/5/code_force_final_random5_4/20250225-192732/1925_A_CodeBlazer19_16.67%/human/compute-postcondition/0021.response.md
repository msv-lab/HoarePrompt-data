Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 676, `i` is 2, `k` must be at least 98, `s` is 'ù', `j` is 195, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The variable `s` is updated by concatenating the character represented by the ASCII value of `j` (which is 195) to the existing string `s`. In ASCII, the character at position 195 is 'ù'. The other variables remain unchanged.
