Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 676, `i` is 2, `k` is 1 or greater than or equal to 195 (since the loop runs from 97 to k + 97, and it executes 98 times if k is 194 but not 1), `s` is a string containing characters from 'ù' to 'ý' (which are the characters corresponding to ASCII values from 128 to 255), `j` is 195 at the start of each iteration but changes within the loop, and `n` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the loop.**
