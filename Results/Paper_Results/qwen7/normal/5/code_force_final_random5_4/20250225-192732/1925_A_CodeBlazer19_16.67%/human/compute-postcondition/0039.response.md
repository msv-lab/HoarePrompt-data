Output State: **`t` must be greater than 3 and less than or equal to 676, `i` is 3, `k` must be at least 98, `s` is the character '청', `j` is 196, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `s += chr(j)` updates the string `s` by appending the character represented by the ASCII value of `j`. Given that `j` is 196, `chr(196)` returns the character `청`. Therefore, `s` changes from `'첫'` to `'청'`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
