Output State: `t` must be greater than 3 and less than or equal to 676, `i` is 3, `k` must be greater than 99, `s` is a string consisting of 95 'รป' characters, `j` is 291, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.

Explanation: The loop runs from `j = 97` to `j = k + 96`. Given that the loop has executed 3 times, it will continue to execute until `j` reaches `k + 97`. Since each iteration increments `j` by 1, the loop will run exactly 95 times (from 97 to 291 inclusive). Therefore, the final value of `j` will be 291, and `s` will be a string of 95 'รป' characters.
