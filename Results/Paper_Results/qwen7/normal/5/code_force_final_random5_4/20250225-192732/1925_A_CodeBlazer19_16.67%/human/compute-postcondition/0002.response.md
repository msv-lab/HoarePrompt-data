Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 676, `i` must be 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**

The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and converts them into integers, assigning `n` to the first integer and `k` to the second integer. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state.
