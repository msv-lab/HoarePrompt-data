#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, s1 and s2 are strings of length n consisting of '0' and '1', where s1[i] = '1' indicates that there is a cat in the i-th box initially, and s2[i] = '1' indicates that there should be a cat in the i-th box eventually.
def func_1(n, s1, s2):
    cats_to_add = sum(1 for i in range(n) if s1[i] == '0' and s2[i] == '1')
    cats_to_remove = sum(1 for i in range(n) if s1[i] == '1' and s2[i] == '0')
    return max(cats_to_add, cats_to_remove)
    #The program returns the maximum value between the number of boxes where s1[i] is '0' and s2[i] is '1' (cats_to_add) and the number of boxes where s1[i] is '1' and s2[i] is '0' (cats_to_remove)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` and two strings `s1` and `s2` of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1'. It calculates the maximum value between the number of boxes where `s1[i]` is '0' and `s2[i]` is '1' (indicating cats need to be added) and the number of boxes where `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0' (indicating cats need to be removed). The function then returns this maximum value.
