### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires transforming the initial state of the boxes (represented by `s1`) to the desired state (represented by `s2`).
   - Operations include adding a cat to an empty box, removing a cat from a non-empty box, and moving a cat from one box to another.
   - The goal is to determine the minimum number of operations needed to achieve the desired state.

2. **Key Points from the Annotated Code**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the number of cats that need to be added (`cats_to_add`) and the number of cats that need to be removed (`cats_to_remove`).
   - `cats_to_add` is the count of positions where `s1[i] == '0'` and `s2[i] == '1'`.
   - `cats_to_remove` is the count of positions where `s1[i] == '1'` and `s2[i] == '0'`.
   - The function returns the maximum of these two values, which represents the minimum number of operations required.

3. **Analysis of the Given Code**:
   - The code correctly identifies the positions where cats need to be added and removed.
   - The logic for calculating `cats_to_add` and `cats_to_remove` is accurate.
   - The function returns the maximum of these two values, which is the correct approach since each operation (adding, removing, or moving) can be done in one day.

4. **Verification Using Annotated Code**:
   - The annotated code provides a clear state of the program before the function call and explains the function's behavior accurately.
   - The function indeed calculates the required operations correctly and returns the appropriate result.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that the given code logic is correct.
   - The function `func_1` accurately computes the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state to the desired state.
