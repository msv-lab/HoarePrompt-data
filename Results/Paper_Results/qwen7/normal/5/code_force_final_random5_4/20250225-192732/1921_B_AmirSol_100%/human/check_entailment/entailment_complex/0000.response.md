Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the minimum number of operations needed to transform the initial state of cats in boxes (`s1`) to the desired state (`s2`).
2. The provided code correctly identifies two types of operations:
   - Adding cats to empty boxes (`s1[i] == '0'` and `s2[i] == '1'`).
   - Removing cats from occupied boxes (`s1[i] == '1'` and `s2[i] == '0'`).
3. The logic in `func_1` calculates:
   - `cats_to_add`: the count of boxes that need cats added.
   - `cats_to_remove`: the count of boxes that need cats removed.
4. The function then returns the maximum of these two counts. This is because:
   - Each addition or removal operation can only change the state of one box at a time.
   - Therefore, the total number of operations required is the maximum of the number of additions and removals needed.
5. The implementation matches the problem requirements and correctly computes the minimum number of operations.

Correctness: **True**
