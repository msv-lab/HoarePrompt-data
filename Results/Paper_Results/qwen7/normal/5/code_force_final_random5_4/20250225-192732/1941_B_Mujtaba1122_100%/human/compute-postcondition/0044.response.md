Output State: **`i` is 3; `list[3]` is decreased by 2 times `list[2]` minus 1; `list[3]` is greater than 1; `list[2]` is greater than 0; `list[4]` must be greater than 0; `list[4]` is unchanged; `list[i + 1]` (which is `list[4]`) is decreased by `list[2] - 1`**

Explanation:
- The code `list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` means that the element at index `i + 1` in the list (`list[4]`) is decreased by the value of `list[2] - 1`.
- Given the initial conditions, `i` is 3, so `i + 1` is 4.
- Therefore, `list[4]` is decreased by `list[2] - 1`.
- All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
