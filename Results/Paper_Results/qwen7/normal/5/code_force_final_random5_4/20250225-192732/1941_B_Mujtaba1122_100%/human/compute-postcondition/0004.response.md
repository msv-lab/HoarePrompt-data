Output State: **`i` is 1; `list[0]` must be greater than 0; `list[1]` is decreased by `list[0]` and now equals `-1 * list[0]`; `list[2]` must be greater than 0; `list[i]` (which is `list[1]`) is equal to `list[1] - 2 * list[0]` and now equals `-3 * list[0]; `list[i-1]` (which is `list[0]`) is decreased by `1 * list[0]` and now equals `0`.**

Explanation:
- Initially, `list[i]` (which is `list[1]`) is equal to `list[1] - 2 * list[0]`.
- The code `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` means `list[0] -= 1 * list[0]`, which simplifies to `list[0] = 0`.
- Therefore, `list[1]` is now `-1 * list[0]` which is `0`.
- And `list[1]` (which is `list[i]`) is now `-3 * list[0]` which is `0`.

So, the updated values are as described above.
