Output State: **`i` is 2; `list[2]` is `list[2] - 2 * list[1] - 1` and must be greater than `2 * list[1] + 2`; `list[1]` is greater than 0; `list[3]` is greater than 0; `list[2]` is now `list[2] - 2 * list[1]`**

Explanation: The code `list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]` updates the value of `list[i]` by subtracting `2 * list[i - 1]` from it. Given that `i` is 2, `i - 1` is 1, so `list[2]` is updated to `list[2] - 2 * list[1]`. The other conditions and values remain unchanged.
