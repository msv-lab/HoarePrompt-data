Reasoning:
- The problem requires determining whether it's possible to make all elements of an array zero by performing a specific operation.
- The operation involves selecting an index \(i\) (where \(2 \leq i \leq n-1\)) and decrementing three elements: \(a_{i-1}\), \(a_i\), and \(a_{i+1}\).
- The solution uses two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
  - `func_1` checks if all elements in the list are zero.
  - `func_2` attempts to reduce the array elements to zero by repeatedly applying the operation defined in the problem statement.
- The logic in `func_2` ensures that the operation is applied as long as the conditions allow (i.e., \(a_{i} > 1\), \(a_{i-1} > 0\), and \(a_{i+1} > 0\)).
- After attempting to reduce the array, `func_2` calls `func_1` to check if all elements are zero. If so, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
- Given the execution summary, `func_2` correctly implements the required logic to solve the problem. It ensures that the array is reduced according to the specified operation and checks the final state using `func_1`.

Correctness: **True**
