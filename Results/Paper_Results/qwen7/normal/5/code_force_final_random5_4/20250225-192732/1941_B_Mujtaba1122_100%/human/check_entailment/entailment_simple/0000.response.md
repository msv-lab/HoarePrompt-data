Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining if it's possible to make all elements of an array zero by performing a specific operation any number of times. The operation involves selecting an index \(i\) (where \(2 \leq i \leq n-1\)) and decrementing \(a_{i-1}\), \(a_i\), and \(a_{i+1}\) by 1, 2, and 1 respectively.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code defines two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
   - `func_1` checks if all elements in the list are zero.
   - `func_2` attempts to reduce the array to all zeros using the specified operation and then calls `func_1` to verify if the array is all zeros.

3. **Key Points**:
   - `func_2` correctly implements the operation and ensures that after applying the operation, the array is reduced appropriately.
   - `func_2` uses a while loop to repeatedly apply the operation until no further reductions are possible or until an invalid state is reached (i.e., when `list[i-1]` becomes zero but `list[i]` is still greater than 1).
   - `func_1` correctly checks if all elements in the list are zero.

4. **Execution States**:
   - The annotated program correctly describes the states before and after the function calls.
   - The logic in `func_2` ensures that the array is processed according to the problem constraints.
   - The final check using `func_1` is accurate and correctly determines if the array can be made all zeros.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided code accurately implements the solution to the problem as described.
   - The logic and states described match the expected behavior and outcomes.

Correctness: **True**
