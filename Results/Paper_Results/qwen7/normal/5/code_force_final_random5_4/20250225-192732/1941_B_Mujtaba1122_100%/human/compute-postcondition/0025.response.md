Output State: **`i` is 2; `list[2]` is greater than 1; `list[1]` is greater than 0; `list[3]` is greater than 0; `list[3]` is decreased by `list[1]`.**

Explanation: The code updates `list[i + 1]` (which is `list[3]`) by subtracting `1 * list[i - 1]` (which is `1 * list[1]`). Since `list[1]` is greater than 0, `list[3]` is decreased by the value of `list[1]`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
