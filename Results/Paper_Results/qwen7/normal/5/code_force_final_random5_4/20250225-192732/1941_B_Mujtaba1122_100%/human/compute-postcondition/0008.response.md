Output State: **`i` is 1; `list[0]` must be greater than 0; `list[1]` is `-3 * list[0]`; `list[2]` must be greater than 0; `list[3]` is `-3 * list[0] - 1; list[1]` is updated to `-3 * list[0] - 1**.

Explanation: The code `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` subtracts `list[i - 1]` from itself, effectively setting `list[i - 1]` to 0. Since `i` is 1 initially, `i - 1` is 0, so `list[0]` is set to 0. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
