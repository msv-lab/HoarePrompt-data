Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is given by the expression `list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and (list[i + 1] > 0)`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2.
   - `list[2]` is `list[2] - 2 * list[1] - 1`.
   - `list[1]` is greater than 0.
   - `list[3]` is greater than 0.

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and (list[i + 1] > 0)` must be true.
   - Given `i = 2`, we need to check the values of `list[2]`, `list[1]`, and `list[3]`.

4. **Check each part of the condition**:
   - `list[2] > 1`: Since `list[2]` is `list[2] - 2 * list[1] - 1`, we need to ensure that this value is greater than 1.
   - `list[1] > 0`: This is already given as a condition.
   - `list[3] > 0`: This is also given as a condition.

5. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - We need to ensure that `list[2] - 2 * list[1] - 1 > 1`.
   - Simplifying, we get `list[2] - 2 * list[1] - 1 > 1` which simplifies to `list[2] > 2 * list[1] + 2`.

Given the current state:
- `list[1]` is greater than 0.
- `list[3]` is greater than 0.

We need to ensure that `list[2]` satisfies the condition `list[2] > 2 * list[1] + 2`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
- `list[2]` must be greater than `2 * list[1] + 2`.

So, the final answer is:
State: **`i` is 2; `list[2]` is `list[2] - 2 * list[1] - 1` and must be greater than `2 * list[1] + 2`; `list[1]` is greater than 0; `list[3]` is greater than 0**.
