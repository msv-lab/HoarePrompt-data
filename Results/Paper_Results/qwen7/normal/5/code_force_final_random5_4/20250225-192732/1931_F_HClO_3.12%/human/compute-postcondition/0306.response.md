Output State: **`m` must be greater than or equal to 3, input is taken but not stored or used.**

The code `input()` takes user input but does not store it in any variable, so the value of `m` remains unchanged. The precondition that `m` must be greater than or equal to 3 is still valid, and no new variables are introduced or modified.
