Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `idx1` is either -1 or 0, `idx2` is either -1 or 0, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `t` is 0, `a1` is the first integer from input, `l11` is a list of elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `a2` is the second integer from input, `l22` is a list of elements from `l2` excluding `a1`.**

Explanation: The code creates a new list `l22` which contains all elements from `l2` except for `a1`. The original lists `l11` and `a2` are not affected, and the values of `n`, `m`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `t`, `a1`, and `l2` remain unchanged.
