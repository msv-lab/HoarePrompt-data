Postcondition: **`n` must be at least 2, and either `(i + 1) + 1 + max(p1, p2) = n - 1` or `(i + 1) + 1 + max(p1, p2) = n - 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, then `idx1` is `i` and `p1` is 1, otherwise `idx2` is `i` and `p2` is 1.**
