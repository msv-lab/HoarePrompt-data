Output State: **After the loop executes all its iterations, `m` must be greater than or equal to 3, and the loop will have executed `m-2` times, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**

The `continue` statement causes the loop to skip the rest of its body and immediately re-evaluate the loop condition. Since no changes are made to the variables `m` or the loop count, the only impact is that the loop continues to the next iteration.
