Output State: **`idx1` is `i`, `idx2` is `i`, `p1` is an integer, `p2` is an integer, `i` is `k + 1` where `k` was the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration.**

Explanation: The code assigns the current value of `i` to both `idx1` and `idx2`. No changes are made to `p1`, `p2`, or the relationship between `i` and `k`. Therefore, `idx1` and `idx2` are both set to `i`, while `p1`, `p2`, and the condition involving `i` and `k` remain unchanged.
