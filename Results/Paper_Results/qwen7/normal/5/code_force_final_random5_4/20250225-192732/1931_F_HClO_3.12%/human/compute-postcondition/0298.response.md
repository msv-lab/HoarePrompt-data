Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `val` contains a list of tuples where each tuple consists of `a3` and `l3` from each iteration, and `t` must be greater than 1. Since the if condition `m == 1` is not specified to change any variables, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.**
