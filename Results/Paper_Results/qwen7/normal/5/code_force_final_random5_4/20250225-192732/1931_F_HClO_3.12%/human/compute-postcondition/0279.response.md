Output State: **`m` must be greater than 2, `a3` is the first integer from each input during the loop iterations, converted to int, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from each input during the loop iterations, converted to int, `val` is an empty list before the loop starts, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is used to exit the loop or if statement it is currently inside. Since no variables are modified by the `break` statement itself, the values of `m`, `a3`, `l3`, and `val` remain unchanged. The only change is that the loop or if statement is exited.
