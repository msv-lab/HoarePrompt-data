Output State: **`idx1` and `idx2` are integers, `p1` and `p2` are integers.**

If the loop completes all its iterations without breaking early due to specific conditions, the final values of `idx1` and `idx2` will depend on the comparison of elements in `l1` and `l2` from index `i + p1` and `i + p2` respectively, starting from `i = 0` up to `i = n-2`. The values of `p1` and `p2` will indicate whether there was a mismatch between `a1` and `a2` in the sequence, incrementing accordingly each time a mismatch is found where `l1[i + p1]` matches `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` matches `a1`, or vice versa. If no such specific condition is met throughout the loop, `idx1` and `idx2` will retain their latest assigned values, which could be any integer depending on the input lists `l1` and `l2`.
