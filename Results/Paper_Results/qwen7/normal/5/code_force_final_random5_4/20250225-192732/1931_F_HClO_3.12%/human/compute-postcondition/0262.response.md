Postcondition: `idx1` is greater than or equal to `idx2`, `val` is either an empty list or a list containing one tuple `(a3, l3)`, `p1`, `p2`, `t`, `a1`, `l11`, `a2`, `l22` are set based on the final state of the loop after all iterations, `m` is decreased by 1 if `idx1` is not strictly greater than `idx2`.
