Postcondition: `m` must be greater than 2, `a3` is the first integer from each input during the loop iterations, converted to int, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from each input during the loop iterations, converted to int, `val` is an empty list before the loop starts, the current list `l3` is not equal to a list comprehension that excludes all elements equal to `a3`.
