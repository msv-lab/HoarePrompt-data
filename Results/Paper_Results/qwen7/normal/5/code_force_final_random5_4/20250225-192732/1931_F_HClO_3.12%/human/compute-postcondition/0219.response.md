Output State: **We break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The conditions involving `i + 1`, `p1`, `p2`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `l1`, `l2`, `a1`, and `a2` remain unchanged.**

This means that the `break` statement causes us to exit the most internal loop or if statement, but the values of `n`, `i`, `p1`, `p2`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `l1`, `l2`, `a1`, and `a2` remain as they were before the `break` statement was executed.
