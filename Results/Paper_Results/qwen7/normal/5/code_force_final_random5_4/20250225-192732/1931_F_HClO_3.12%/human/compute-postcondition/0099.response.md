Output State: **`idx1` is either -1 or 0; `idx2` is either -1 or 0; `p1` is either 0 or 1; `p2` is either 0 or 1; `val` is an empty list; `a2` is inserted into `l2` at the position specified by `idx1`; `l` is now a reference to `l2`.**

Explanation: The line `l = l2` assigns the reference of `l2` to the variable `l`. This does not change the values of `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `val`, or the content of `l2` (where `a2` was inserted). It only changes the reference that `l` points to, making `l` point to the same list as `l2`.
