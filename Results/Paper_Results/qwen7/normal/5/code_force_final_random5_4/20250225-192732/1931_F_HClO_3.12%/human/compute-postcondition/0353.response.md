Output State: **`idx1` is either `i` with `p1` being 1 and `p2` being 0, or `idx1` is 0 with `p1` being 0 and `p2` being 1; `idx2` is either 0 with `p2` being 1, or `idx2` is `i` with `p1` being 0; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This output state indicates that the `break` statement has been executed, which would typically occur within a loop or conditional structure, causing the program to exit that structure. However, since no specific values or changes to `idx1` and `idx2` are directly affected by the `break` statement itself, the conditions for `idx1` and `idx2` remain unchanged from their initial postconditions.
