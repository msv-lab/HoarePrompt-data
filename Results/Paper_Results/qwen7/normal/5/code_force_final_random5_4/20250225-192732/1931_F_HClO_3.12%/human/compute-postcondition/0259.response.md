Output State: **`idx1` is greater than or equal to `idx2`, `val` is a list containing one tuple `(a3, l3)`, `p1`, `p2`, `t`, `a1`, `a2`, `l11`, `a3`, `l22` are set based on the final state of the loop after all iterations, and `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2` plus 1.**

Explanation: The code `val.append((a3, l3))` appends a tuple `(a3, l3)` to the list `val`. This operation does not affect the values of `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `t`, `a1`, `a2`, `l11`, `a3`, `l22`, or the condition `idx1` being less than or equal to `idx2` plus 1. Therefore, these conditions and variables remain unchanged. The only change is that `val` now contains the tuple `(a3, l3)`.
