Postcondition: `idx1` is an integer, `idx2` is an integer, `p1` is an integer, `p2` is an integer. If the condition `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1` is met, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `idx1` is greater than or equal to 0 and `idx2` is greater than or equal to 0, we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
