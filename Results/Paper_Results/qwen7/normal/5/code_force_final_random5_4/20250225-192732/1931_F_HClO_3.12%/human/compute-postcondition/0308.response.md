Output State: **`m` must be greater than or equal to 3, input accepted but not used in calculation**.

The `input()` function accepts user input but does not assign it to any variable, so the value of `m` remains unchanged. The precondition that `m` must be greater than or equal to 3 is still valid. The input provided by the user is accepted but not utilized in the calculation or assignment of any variable.
