Postcondition: **`idx1` and `idx2` are integers, `p1` and `p2` are integers. If the condition `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1` is true, then `idx1` is 0, `idx2` is 0, `p1` is 0, and `p2` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `idx1` is 0, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 1, and `p2` is 0 if `idx1 >= 0 and idx2 >= 0` is true. Otherwise, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is the current index `i`, `p1` is 0, and `p2` is 1, and `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` is not equal to `a1`.**
