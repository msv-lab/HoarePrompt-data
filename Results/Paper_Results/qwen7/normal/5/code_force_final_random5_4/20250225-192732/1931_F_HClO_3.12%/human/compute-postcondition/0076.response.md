Output State: **`idx1` is an integer, `idx2` is an integer, `p1` is an integer, `p2` is an integer, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block specified in the code snippet, the only effect is that the program will break out of the most internal loop or if statement it was inside. The values of `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged.
