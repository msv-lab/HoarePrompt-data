Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `_` (which is an underscore, often used as a throwaway variable), `m`, and the range expression `m - 2`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute for each value in the range from `0` to `m - 3` (since `range(m - 2)` generates values from `0` to `m - 3`). This means the loop will execute `m - 3` times.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `m` must be greater than 3.
   - `a3` is the first integer from input converted to int.
   - `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from input converted to int.
   - `val` is a list containing a tuple (`a3`, `l3`) appended to it.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is controlled by `m - 2`, after each iteration, `m` will decrease by 1. Therefore, if the loop was just completed, `m` would have been decremented by 1.
   - The loop will continue as long as `m > 2` (since `m - 2` should be non-negative).

Given that the loop just completed its previous iteration, `m` has been decremented by 1. Therefore, `m` must now be greater than 2.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `m` must be greater than 2.
   - `a3` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.
   - `l3` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.
   - `val` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.

So, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`m` must be greater than 2, `a3` is the first integer from input converted to int, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from input converted to int, `val` is a list containing a tuple (`a3`, `l3`) appended to it.**
