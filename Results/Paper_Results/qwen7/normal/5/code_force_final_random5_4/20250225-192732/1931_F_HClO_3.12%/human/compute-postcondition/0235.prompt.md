Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `t` is 0, `a1` is the first integer from input, `l11` is a list of elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `a2` is the second integer from input, `l22` is a list of elements from `l2` excluding `a1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1:
        break
    if l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]:
        if l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1:
            idx1 = idx2 = i
            break
        else:
            if l1[i + p1] == a2:
                idx1 = i
                p1 = 1
            else:
                idx2 = i
                p2 = 1
            if idx1 >= 0 and idx2 >= 0:
                break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `n` must be at least 2, and either `i` plus the maximum of `p1` and `p2` equals `n - 1` or `n - 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `idx1` is equal to `i` and `idx2` is equal to `i`, then `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` is equal to `a1`. Otherwise, `idx1` is greater than or equal to 0 and `idx2` is greater than or equal to 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` must be at least 2, and either `(i + 1) + max(p1, p2) = n - 1` or `(i + 1) + max(p1, p2) = n - 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `idx1` is equal to `i` and `idx2` is equal to `i`, then `l1[(i + 1) + p1]` is equal to `a2` and `l2[(i + 1) + p2]` is equal to `a1`. Otherwise, `idx1` and `idx2` are greater than or equal to 0, and the conditions involving `i`, `p1`, `p2`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `l1`, `l2`, `a1`, and `a2` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` must be at least 2, and either `(i + 1) + 1 + max(p1, p2) = n - 1` or `(i + 1) + 1 + max(p1, p2) = n - 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, then `idx1` is `i` and `p1` is 1, otherwise `idx2` is `i` and `p2` is 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
