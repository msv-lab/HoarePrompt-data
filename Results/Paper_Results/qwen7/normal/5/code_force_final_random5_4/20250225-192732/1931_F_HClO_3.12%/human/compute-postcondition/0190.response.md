Output State: **`idx1` is equal to `i`, `n` must be at least 2, `i` plus the maximum of `p1` and `p2` equals `n - 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The condition `l1[i + p1] == a2` is true, and `l2[i + p2]` is not equal to `a1`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `i` to `idx1`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
