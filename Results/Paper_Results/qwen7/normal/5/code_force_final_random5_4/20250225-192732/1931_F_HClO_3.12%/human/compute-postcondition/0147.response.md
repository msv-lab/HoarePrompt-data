Based on the initial state provided:

- `val` is a list containing at least 2 tuples, each of the form `(a3_next, l3_next)`.
- `m` is greater than 2.
- `idx1` is either -1 or 0.
- `idx2` is either -1 or 0.
- `p1` is either 0 or 1.
- `p2` is either 0 or 1.

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'no'`.

Since no specific values are provided for the variables other than their possible ranges, and the `print` statement does not reference any of these variables, the output will be the literal string `'no'`.

Output: **'no'**
