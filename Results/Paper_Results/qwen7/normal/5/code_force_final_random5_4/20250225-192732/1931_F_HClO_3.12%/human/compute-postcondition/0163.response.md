Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(m - 2):`. This means the loop will iterate `m - 2` times.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - An input is taken but not assigned to any variable.
   - The value of `m` is not specified, but it is used to determine the number of iterations of the loop.

3. **Understand the loop execution**:
   - The loop will execute `m - 2` times.
   - Since an input is taken but not assigned to any variable, the only state that changes with each iteration is the count of iterations remaining.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - After each iteration, the loop counter (which is represented by `_` in the loop) increases by 1.
   - Therefore, if the loop has just completed its previous iteration, the remaining number of iterations is reduced by 1.

5. **Calculate the new state**:
   - If the loop has just completed its previous iteration, the remaining number of iterations is `m - 3`.
   - No other variables or states are affected by this loop.

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that there are now `m - 3` iterations remaining.

**Final Answer**:
State: **An input is taken but not assigned to any variable, m must be greater than 3**
