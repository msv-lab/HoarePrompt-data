Output State: **`p1` is 1, `idx1` is equal to `i`, `n` must be at least 2, and either `(i + 1) + max(p1, p2) = n - 1` or `(i + 1) + max(p1, p2) = n - 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `idx1` is equal to `i + 1` and `idx2` is equal to `i + 1`, then `l1[(i + 1) + p1]` is equal to `a2` and `l2[(i + 1) + p2]` is equal to `a1`. Otherwise, `idx1` is greater than or equal to 0 and `idx2` is greater than or equal to 0.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value `1` to `p1`. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged from the initial state.
