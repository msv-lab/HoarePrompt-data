Output State: **`val` is a list containing at least 3 tuples, each of the form (a3, l3), `m` is greater than 2, `idx1` is either -1 or 0, `idx2` is either -1 or 0, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, the current value of `l3` is not equal to a list comprehension of all elements in `l` excluding elements equal to `a3`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not modify any variable values but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such block is specified, we assume it breaks out of the most internal one. All other variables retain their initial states.
