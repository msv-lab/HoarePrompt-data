Output State: **`idx1` is 0, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 0, `n` must be at least 2, `i` is 0, the value of `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2`, and either `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2` or `l2[i + p2]` is not equal to `a1`.**

Explanation: The variable `p1` is assigned the value 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The condition regarding the values of `l1[i + p1]` and `l2[i + p2]` remains the same as per the initial state.
