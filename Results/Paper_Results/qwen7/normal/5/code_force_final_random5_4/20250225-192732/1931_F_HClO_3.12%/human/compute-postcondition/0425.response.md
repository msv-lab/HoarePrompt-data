Based on the initial state provided:

- `idx1` is an integer.
- `idx2` is an integer.
- `p1` is an integer.
- `p2` is an integer.
- `val` is a list containing at least `m-1` tuples, and each tuple is of the form `(a3, l3)`, where `a3` is an integer and `l3` is a list of integers.
- The next tuple in `val` is being processed.

The `print('no')` statement simply prints the string `'no'`.

Output: **'no'**
