Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(m - 2):`. The only variable here is `_`, which is a placeholder and does not hold any specific value. However, the loop itself depends on the value of `m`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for the Loop to Execute**: The loop will execute if `m - 2` is greater than or equal to 1. This means `m` must be at least 3.

3. **Adjust the States**: Since the loop depends on the value of `m`, we need to ensure that `m` is at least 3. The other variables (`a1`, `a2`, `l11`, `l22`) do not affect the condition for the loop to execute and thus do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `m` being greater than or equal to 3.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`m` must be greater than or equal to 3**
