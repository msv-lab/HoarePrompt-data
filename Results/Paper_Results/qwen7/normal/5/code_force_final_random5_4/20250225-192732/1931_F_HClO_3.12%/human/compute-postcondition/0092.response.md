Postcondition: `idx1` and `idx2` are integers. If the condition `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]` is met, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `idx1` is greater than or equal to 0 and `idx2` is greater than or equal to 0, we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
