Output State: **`idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `t` is 0, `a1` is the first integer from input, `l11` is a list of elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `a2` is the second integer from input, `l22` is a list of elements from `l2` excluding `a1`.**

Explanation: The code sets both `p1` and `p2` to 0. The values of `idx1`, `idx2`, `t`, `a1`, `l11`, `a2`, `l22` remain unchanged from their initial states.
