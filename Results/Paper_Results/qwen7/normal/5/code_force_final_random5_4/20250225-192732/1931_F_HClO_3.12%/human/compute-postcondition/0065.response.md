Output State: **`idx1` is an integer, `idx2` is `i`, `p1` is an integer, `p2` is 1, `i` is `k + 1` where `k` was the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value `1` to `p2`. The values of `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `i`, and the relationship between `i` and `k` remain unchanged from the initial state.
