Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(n - 1):`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of the Variables**:
   - `idx1` is -1
   - `idx2` is -1
   - `p1` is 0
   - `p2` is 0

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`. 

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - For the loop to start, `i` must be initialized to 0 (the starting value for the `range` function).
   - `n` must be a positive integer greater than 1, because the loop runs from `0` to `n-2`, meaning `n-1` must be at least 1.

Given these points, we need to adjust the states of `i` and `n` to ensure the loop can execute.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1**
