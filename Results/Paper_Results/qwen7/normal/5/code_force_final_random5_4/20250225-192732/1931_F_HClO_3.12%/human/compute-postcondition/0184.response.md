Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `i` plus the maximum of `p1` and `p2` equals `n - 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; `idx1` is equal to `i`, `idx2` is equal to `i`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `i` to both `idx1` and `idx2`. Since `i` was previously defined and the conditions involving `n`, `i`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged, these conditions still hold true. Therefore, the output state includes the updated values of `idx1` and `idx2`, which are both set to `i`, while maintaining the original conditions.
