Postcondition: **`n` and `m` are input integers, `idx1` and `idx2` are either -1 or 0, `p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1, `t` is 0, `a1` is the first integer from input, `l11` is a list of elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `a2` is the second integer from input, `l22` is a list of elements from `l2` excluding `a1`. If `l11` is not equal to `l22`, the loop will execute `m-2` times in total, and after all iterations, an input is taken but not assigned to any variable, and `m` must be greater than 3. If `l11` equals `l22`, the program does nothing.**
