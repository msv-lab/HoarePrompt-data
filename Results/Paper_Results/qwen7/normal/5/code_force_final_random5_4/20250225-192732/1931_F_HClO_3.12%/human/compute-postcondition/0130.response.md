Output State: **`a3` is the first integer from the input split, `l3` is a list containing the remaining integers from the input split, `val` is a list containing two tuples `((a3, l3))`, `m` must be greater than 3**.

Explanation: The code `val.append((a3, l3))` adds a new tuple `(a3, l3)` to the list `val`. Initially, `val` contains one tuple `((a3, l3))`. After appending, `val` now contains two tuples, which are `((a3, l3))`. All other variables remain unchanged.
