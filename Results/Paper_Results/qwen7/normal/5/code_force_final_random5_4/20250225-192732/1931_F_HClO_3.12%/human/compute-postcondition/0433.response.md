Postcondition: `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2` are integers, `val` is a list containing at least `m-2` tuples, each tuple is of the form `(a3, l3)`. If `l3` is not equal to the list comprehension `[i for i in l if i != a3]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the postcondition remains as the precondition.
