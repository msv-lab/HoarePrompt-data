Postcondition: `idx1` is either -1 or 0; `idx2` is either -1 or 0; `p1` is either 0 or 1; `p2` is either 0 or 1; `val` is a list. If `idx1` is less than `idx2`, then `a2` is inserted into `l2` at the position specified by `idx1` and `l` is a reference to `l2`. Otherwise, if `idx1` is greater than `idx2`, then `a1` is inserted into `l1` at index `idx2` and `l` is a reference to `l1`. If neither condition is met, then `val` is a list containing one tuple `(a3, l3)`, where `a3` is an integer input from the user and `l3` is a list of integers obtained from the remaining inputs, and `m` is `-1`.
