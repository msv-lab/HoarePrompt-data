Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is defined by the tuple `(a3, l3)` from the list `val`. Therefore, the variables involved are `a3`, `l3`, and `val`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop will continue as long as there are more tuples in `val` to iterate over.
   - The loop will break if `l3` is not equal to a list of elements in `l` that are not equal to `a3`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `val` is a list containing at least 3 tuples, each of the form `(a3, l3)`.
   - `m` is greater than 2.
   - `idx1` is either -1 or 0.
   - `idx2` is either -1 or 0.
   - `p1` is either 0 or 1.
   - `p2` is either 0 or 1.
   - We break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `l3` is not equal to a list of elements in `l` that are not equal to `a3`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues based on the remaining tuples in `val`, the next tuple `(a3, l3)` will be the current tuple in the next iteration.
   - `val` will lose one tuple since one tuple has been processed.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the loss of one tuple from `val` and the update of `a3` and `l3` to the next tuple in the list.

**State:**
- `val` is a list containing at least 2 tuples, each of the form `(a3, l3)`.
- `m` is greater than 2.
- `idx1` is either -1 or 0.
- `idx2` is either -1 or 0.
- `p1` is either 0 or 1.
- `p2` is either 0 or 1.

Since we don't know the exact values of `a3` and `l3` for the next tuple, we can denote them generically as `a3_next` and `l3_next`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`val` is a list containing at least 2 tuples, each of the form (a3_next, l3_next), `m` is greater than 2, `idx1` is either -1 or 0, `idx2` is either -1 or 0, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1**
