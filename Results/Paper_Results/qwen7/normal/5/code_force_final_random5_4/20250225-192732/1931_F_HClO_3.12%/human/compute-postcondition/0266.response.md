Output State: **`m` must be greater than 2; `a3` is the first integer from input; `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from input; `val` is a list containing a tuple `(a3, l3)`**.

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(a3, l3)` to the list `val`. The values of `m` and `a3` remain unchanged, and `l3` remains the same list of integers. Therefore, the output state includes these updated details about `val`.
