Output State: `idx1` is an integer, `idx2` is an integer, `p1` is an integer, `p2` is an integer, `val` is a list containing exactly `m-2` tuples, each tuple is of the form `(a3, l3)`, where `a3` is an integer and `l3` is a list of integers. After all iterations of the loop, none of the tuples `(a3, l3)` in the `val` list satisfy the condition `l3 != [i for i in l if i != a3]`. Therefore, the loop does not break, and the final output printed is 'yes'.
