Output State: **`idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `val`, `a3`, `l3` are integers and lists; `val` contains a tuple with `a3` and `l3` as its elements.**

Explanation: The code `val.append((a3, l3))` appends a tuple containing `a3` and `l3` to the list `val`. The other variables (`idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `a3`, `l3`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
