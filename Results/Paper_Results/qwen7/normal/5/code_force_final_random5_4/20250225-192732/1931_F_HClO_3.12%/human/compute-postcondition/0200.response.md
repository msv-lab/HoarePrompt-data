Postcondition: `n` must be at least 2, `i` plus the maximum of `p1` and `p2` equals `n - 1` or `n - 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Additionally, if `idx1` is greater than or equal to 0, then `idx2` is also greater than or equal to 0. If the condition `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1` is true, then `idx1` is equal to `i` and `idx2` is equal to `i`.
