Output State: `m` must be greater than 2; `a3` is the first integer from each input during the loop iterations, converted to int; `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from each input during the loop iterations, converted to int; `val` is a list containing tuples `(a3, l3)` from each iteration, appended to it.

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `m` will still need to be greater than 2 (as it was initially). The variable `idx1` and `idx2` will be set based on the final state of the loop, and `val` will contain a list of tuples, where each tuple consists of `a3` and `l3` from each iteration of the loop.
