Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case involves k lines of n unique integers ranging from 1 to n. It determines the order of participants seen by each of the k users and checks if the orders can be made consistent by inserting specific elements in certain positions. If the orders can be made consistent without contradictions, it prints 'yes'; otherwise, it prints 'no'. The function does not return any explicit value but prints the result for each test case.**
