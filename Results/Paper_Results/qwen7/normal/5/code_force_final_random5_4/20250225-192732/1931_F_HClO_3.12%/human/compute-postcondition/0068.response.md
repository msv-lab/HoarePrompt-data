Output State: **`idx1` is an integer, `idx2` is an integer, `p1` is an integer, `p2` is an integer, `i` is `k + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it breaks out of the loop or conditional block where `idx1` and `idx2` are being updated based on the condition `l1[i + p1] == a2`. The values of `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, and `i` remain unchanged from their previous states, and the loop or conditional block is exited.
