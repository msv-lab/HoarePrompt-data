Postcondition: `idx1` is an integer, `idx2` is an integer, `p1` is an integer, `p2` is an integer, `i` is `k + 1` where `k` was the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration. If `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not met, no changes are made to the variables.
