Postcondition: `idx1` and `idx2` are integers, `p1` and `p2` are integers. If `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` equals `a1`, then `idx1` is 0, `idx2` is 0, `p1` is 0, and `p2` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is `i`, and `p1` is 0, `p2` is 1, and we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
