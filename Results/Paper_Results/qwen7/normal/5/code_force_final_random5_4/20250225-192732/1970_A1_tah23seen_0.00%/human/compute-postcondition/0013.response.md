Postcondition: `i` is 1, `d[1]` is 1 if `s[1]` is '(', otherwise `d[1]` is `d[0]` - 1, and `d[2]` is either 2 if `s[1]` is '(', or `d[1]` - 1 if `s[1]` is not '('.

This means that after the if-else block executes:
- If `s[1]` is '(', then `d[1]` remains 1 and `d[2]` is set to 2.
- If `s[1]` is not '(', then `d[1]` is set to `d[0] - 1` and `d[2]` is set to `d[1] - 1`.
