Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i`, `j`, and the iterable `d`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each tuple `(i, j)` in the list `d`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `d` is a sorted list containing at least one tuple.
   - The first tuple in `d` has `i` as `n-1`.
   - `j` is some value corresponding to the first element in `d`.
   - `ans` is increased by `s[i]`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop iterates over tuples in `d`, the next tuple in `d` will be used in the next iteration.
   - The first tuple in `d` had `i` as `n-1`. After processing this tuple, the next tuple will have `i` as the next value in the sorted list `d`.
   - Therefore, `i` will be updated to the next value in the sorted list `d`.
   - `j` will correspond to the next element in the tuple.
   - `ans` will be increased by `s[i]` again, but now `i` will be the next value.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `d` remains a sorted list containing at least one tuple.
   - The next tuple in `d` will have `i` as the next value in the sorted list, which is `n-1 + 1 = n`.
   - `j` will correspond to the next element in the tuple.
   - `ans` will be increased by `s[n-1 + 1]`.

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`d` is a sorted list containing at least one tuple, the first tuple in `d` has `i` as `n`, and `j` is some value corresponding to the first element in `d`, `ans` is increased by `s[n]`**.
