Postcondition: `i` is 2, `d[1]` is 1 if `s[1]` is '(', otherwise `d[1]` is `d[0]` - 1, and `d[2]` is either 2 if `s[1]` is '(', or `d[1]` - 1 if `s[1]` is not '(', and in both cases, `d[3]` is adjusted by either increasing or decreasing by 1 based on whether `s[i]` is '('. If `s[i]` is '(', `d[3]` is incremented by 1; if `s[i]` is not '(', `d[3]` is decremented by 1.
