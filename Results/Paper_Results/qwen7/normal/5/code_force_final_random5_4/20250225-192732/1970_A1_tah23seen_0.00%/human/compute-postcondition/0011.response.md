Output State: **`i` is 1, `d[1]` is 1, `d[2]` is 2**

Explanation: The code `d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1` updates the dictionary `d` by setting the key `i + 1` (which is 2 since `i` is 1) to the value of `d[i] + 1`. Given that `d[1]` is initially 1, `d[2]` is set to `d[1] + 1`, which is 2. The values of `i` and `d[1]` remain unchanged.
