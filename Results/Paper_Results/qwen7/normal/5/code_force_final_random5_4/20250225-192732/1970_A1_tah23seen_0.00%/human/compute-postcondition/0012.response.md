Output State: **`i` is 1, `d[1]` is 1 if `s[1]` is '(', otherwise `d[1]` is `d[0]` - 1, `d[2]` is `d[1]` - 1**

Explanation: The code updates the dictionary `d` such that `d[i + 1]` is set to `d[i] - 1`. Given that `i` is initially 1, `d[i + 1]` corresponds to `d[2]`. Since `d[1]` is defined as 1 if `s[1]` is '(', otherwise `d[1]` is `d[0]` - 1, and assuming `d[0]` is not explicitly defined but we know `d[1]` is already set, `d[2]` is calculated as `d[1] - 1`. Therefore, `d[2]` is one less than the value of `d[1]`.
