Output State: **`i` is 1; `d`[1] is `d`[0] - 1; the first character of `s` is not an open parenthesis ('(')**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `d[i + 1]` to `d[i] - 1`. Given that `i` is initially 0, `d[i + 1]` becomes `d[1]` and its value is set to `d[0] - 1`. The value of `i` is incremented to 1. The initial condition that the first character of `s` is not an open parenthesis remains unchanged.
