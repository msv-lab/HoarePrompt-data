Output State: **`i` is 2, `d[1]` is 1 if `s[1]` is '(', otherwise `d[1]` is `d[0]` - 1, and `d[2]` is either 2 if `s[1]` is '(', or `d[1]` - 1 if `s[1]` is not '(', and `d[3]` is `d[2] - 1`**.

Explanation: The code updates `d[i + 1]` (which is `d[3]`) to be `d[i] - 1` (which is `d[2] - 1`). The value of `d[2]` depends on the value of `s[1]`. If `s[1]` is '(', then `d[2]` is 2; otherwise, `d[2]` is `d[1] - 1`. Since `d[1]` is 1 if `s[1]` is '(', otherwise `d[1]` is `d[0] - 1`, we substitute these values accordingly to get `d[3]` as `d[2] - 1`.
