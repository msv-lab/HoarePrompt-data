Output State: **`a` is a list of integers created from input split and converted to integers, `x` is the element at index `f-1` in list `a`, `n` is the integer from the first split, `f` is `f` decreased by 1, `k` is the integer from the first split decreased by 3.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes user input, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns this list to `a`. The values of `x`, `n`, `f`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state.
