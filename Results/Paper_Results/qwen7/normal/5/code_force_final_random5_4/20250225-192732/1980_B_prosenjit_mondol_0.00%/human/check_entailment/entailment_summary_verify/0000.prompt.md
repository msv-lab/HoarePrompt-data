You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Dmitry has n cubes, numbered from left to right from 1 to n . The cube with
index f is his favorite.

Dmitry threw all the cubes on the table, and the i -th cube showed the value
a_i (1 \le a_i \le 100 ). After that, he arranged the cubes in non-increasing
order of their values, from largest to smallest. If two cubes show the same
value, they can go in any order.

After sorting, Dmitry removed the first k cubes. Then he became interested in
whether he removed his favorite cube (note that its position could have
changed after sorting).

For example, if n=5 , f=2 , a = [4, \color{green}3, 3, 2, 3] (the favorite
cube is highlighted in green), and k = 2 , the following could have happened:

  * After sorting a=[4, \color{green}3, 3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the second position, it will be removed. 
  * After sorting a=[4, 3, \color{green}3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the third position, it will not be removed. 

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case description contains three integers n , f ,
and k (1 \le f, k \le n \le 100 ) — the number of cubes, the index of Dmitry's
favorite cube, and the number of removed cubes, respectively.

The second line of each test case description contains n integers a_i (1 \le
a_i \le 100 ) — the values shown on the cubes.

Output

For each test case, output one line — "YES" if the cube will be removed in all
cases, "NO" if it will not be removed in any case, "MAYBE" if it may be either
removed or left.

You can output the answer in any case. For example, the strings "YES", "nO",
"mAyBe" will be accepted as answers.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, f, k) = map(int, input().split())
        f -= 1
        k -= 1
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        x = a[f]
        a.sort(reverse=True)
        if a[k] > x:
            print('NO')
        elif a[k] < x:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('YES' if k == n - 1 or a[k - 1] < x else 'MAYBE')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a list of integers `a` of length `n` and checks a condition involving indices `f` and `k`. After processing, the list `a` is sorted in descending order. The function then compares the element at index `f` with the element at index `k` in the sorted list. Based on the comparison, it prints either 'YES', 'NO', or 'MAYBE'. The function does not return any value but modifies the list `a` and prints the result for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where the favorite cube is exactly at the `k`-th position after sorting but the next cube (at position `k-1`) has the same value as the favorite cube. This can lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the following input:
```
5 5 2
5 2 4 1 3
```
- The original array is `[5, 2, 4, 1, 3]`.
- After sorting in non-increasing order, it becomes `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`.
- The favorite cube is the last one (`5`), and `k = 2`.
- The first two cubes after sorting are `[5, 4]`.
- Since `5` is greater than `4`, the program prints `NO`, which is incorrect because the favorite cube should be removed.

The program should check if the value of the `k`-th cube is less than the value of the favorite cube (`x`). If equal, it should further check if the `(k-1)`-th cube is less than `x` to decide whether the favorite cube is removed or not.
