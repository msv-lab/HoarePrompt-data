Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `x` is the element at index `f-1` in list `a`, `n` is the integer from the first split, `f` is `f` decreased by 1, `k` is the integer from the first split decreased by 3.** 

This postcondition remains the same for both the if and else parts since neither part modifies the values of `a`, `x`, `n`, `f`, or `k`. Therefore, the overall postcondition after the if-else block executes is the same as the precondition.
