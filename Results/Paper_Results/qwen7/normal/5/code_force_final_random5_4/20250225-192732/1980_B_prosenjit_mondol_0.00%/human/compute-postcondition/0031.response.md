Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `x` is the element at index `f-1` in list `a`, `n` is the integer from the first split, `f` is the integer from the first split, `k` is the integer from the first split decreased by 2.**

Explanation: The code `n, f, k = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `f`, and `k` respectively. The initial state of `a`, `x`, and `k` (which was derived from `f`) remains unchanged except that now `f` and `k` have specific integer values.
