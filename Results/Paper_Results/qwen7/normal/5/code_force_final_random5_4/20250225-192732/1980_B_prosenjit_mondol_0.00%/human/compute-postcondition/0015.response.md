Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer decreased by 1, `x` is the element at index `f` in list `a`. If `a[k]` is less than `x`, then `a[k]` remains unchanged. If `a[k]` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `a[k]` remains unchanged.**
