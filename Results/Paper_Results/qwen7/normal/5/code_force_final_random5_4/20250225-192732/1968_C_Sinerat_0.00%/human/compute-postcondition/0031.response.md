Output State: **`_` is `int(input()) - 1`, `n` is `int(input())`, `a` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros, `x` is a list of integers split from the input string.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `a` of length `n` filled with zeros. The values of `_` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states, and `x` remains as a list of integers split from the input string.
