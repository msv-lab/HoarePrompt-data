Output State: The list `a` will contain `n` elements, starting with `a[0] = 500`, and each subsequent element `a[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n-1`) will be the sum of `500` and the first `i` elements of the list `x`. The variable `i` will be equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `n` will remain unchanged, and the list `x` will also remain unchanged.

In simpler terms, after the loop has completed all its iterations, the list `a` will have `n` elements. The first element `a[0]` will be `500`, and each following element `a[i]` (where `i` ranges from `1` to `n-1`) will be the sum of `500` and the first `i` elements of the list `x`. The variable `i` will be set to `n`, showing that the loop has run `n-1` times. The values of `n` and the list `x` will stay the same as they were before the loop started.
