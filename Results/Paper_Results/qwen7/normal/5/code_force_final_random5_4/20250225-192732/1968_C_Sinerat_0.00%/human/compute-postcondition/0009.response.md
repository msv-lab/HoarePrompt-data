Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `a[i]` (which is `a[1]`) is `a[1] + x[1]`
   - `n` must be greater than 2

3. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since the loop is iterating from `1` to `n-1`, if `i` is currently 2, the next value of `i` will be 3.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than 3 because `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is 3
- `n` must be greater than 3

The final answer is:
State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3**
