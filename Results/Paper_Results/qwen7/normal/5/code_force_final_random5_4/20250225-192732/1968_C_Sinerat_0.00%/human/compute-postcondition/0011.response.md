Output State: `i` is equal to `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 1, and `a[i]` is the sum of `a[0]` and the sum of all elements in the list `x` up to the `(n-1)`th index.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be one less than `n`, meaning it has gone through all the iterations from 1 to `n-1`. The list `a` will have been updated such that `a[n-1]` contains the cumulative sum of the first `n-1` elements of the list `x`, starting from `a[0] = 500`.
