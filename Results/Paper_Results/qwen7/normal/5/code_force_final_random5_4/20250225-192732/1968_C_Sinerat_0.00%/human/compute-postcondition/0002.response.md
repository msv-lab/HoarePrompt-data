Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `x = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `x`. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
