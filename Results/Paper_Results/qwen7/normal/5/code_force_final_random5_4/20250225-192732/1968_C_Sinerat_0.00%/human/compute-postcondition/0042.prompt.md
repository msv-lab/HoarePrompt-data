Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, and x is a list of n-1 integers where 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500 for all 2 ≤ i ≤ n.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    x = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = [0] * n
    a[0] = 500
    for i in range(1, n):
        a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]
    print(*a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `i` is equal to `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 1, and `a[i]` is the sum of `a[0]` and all elements in the list `x` up to index `n-2`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be one less than `n` (since the loop runs from `1` to `n-1`), `n` must still be greater than 1, and the value of `a[i]` will be the initial value of `a[0]` (which is 500) plus the sum of all elements in the list `x` from index `0` to `n-2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `i` is equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `n` (which is the final value it reaches after all iterations), `a[1]` is `a[0] + x[0]`, `a[2]` is `a[1] + x[1]`, ..., `a[n-1]` is `a[n-2] + x[n-2]`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`, meaning the loop has completed all its iterations. The list `a` will have been updated such that each element `a[i]` (from index 1 to `n-1`) is the cumulative sum of `a[0]` and all elements in the list `x` up to index `i-1`. The initial value of `a[0]` remains 500, and the rest of the variables' states remain as described in the initial and intermediate states.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: The list `a` will be transformed such that each element `a[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n-1`) will hold the cumulative sum of the first `i+1` elements of the list `x`. The variable `i` will be equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `n` will remain unchanged, and `a[0]` will still be 500. The variable `x` will also remain unchanged.

In more detail, after the loop completes all its iterations, the list `a` will start with `a[0] = 500` and then each subsequent element `a[i]` will be the sum of `500` and the first `i` elements of `x`. The variable `i` will be set to `n`, showing that the loop has run `n-1` times.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
