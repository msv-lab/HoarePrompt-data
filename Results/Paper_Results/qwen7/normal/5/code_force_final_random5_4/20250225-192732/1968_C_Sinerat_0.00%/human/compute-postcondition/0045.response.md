Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `x` of `n-1` integers. It then calculates a new list `a` where each element `a[i]` (for `i` from 0 to `n-1`) is the cumulative sum of the first `i+1` elements of `x`, starting with `a[0] = 500`. Finally, it prints the list `a` for each test case. The function does not return any value but modifies and prints the cumulative sums based on the input lists.**
