Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `a[1]` is `a[0] + x[0]`, `a[2]` is `a[1] + x[1]`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `a[2]` to be the sum of `a[1]` and `x[1]`. Given the initial state, `a[1]` is already defined as `a[0] + x[0]`. Therefore, `a[2]` becomes `(a[0] + x[0]) + x[1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
