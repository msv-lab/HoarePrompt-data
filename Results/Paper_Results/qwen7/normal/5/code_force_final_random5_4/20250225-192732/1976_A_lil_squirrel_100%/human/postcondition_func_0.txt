The function accepts two parameters: `n`, an integer between 1 and 20 (inclusive), and `password`, a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits. It checks if the `password` string meets certain conditions. If any of the following conditions are true, it returns 'NO':
1. The list of letters in the password is not sorted alphabetically.
2. The list of digits in the password is not sorted numerically.
3. There is at least one occurrence where an alphabetic character is immediately followed by a digit.
If none of these conditions are met, it returns 'YES'.
