Output State: **`password` is a non-empty string of length \(n\), `letters` is a list containing the characters from `password` that are not digits, `digits` is a list containing one additional character (the latest character processed) that is a digit, and `ch` is the latest digit character added to `digits`.**

This means that the `digits` list has been updated by appending the latest character (`ch`) which is a digit from the `password`. The `letters` list remains unchanged as it only contains non-digit characters. The `password` and its length `n` remain the same.
