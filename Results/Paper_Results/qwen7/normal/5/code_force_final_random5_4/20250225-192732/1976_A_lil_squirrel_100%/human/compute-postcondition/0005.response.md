Output State: **`password` is a non-empty string of length n, `letters` is an empty list, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `digits` is a list containing at least one digit, and `digits` now contains the character `ch`.**

Explanation: The code `digits.append(ch)` appends the character `ch` to the list `digits`. Since `ch` is a character, it is added to the existing list `digits`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
