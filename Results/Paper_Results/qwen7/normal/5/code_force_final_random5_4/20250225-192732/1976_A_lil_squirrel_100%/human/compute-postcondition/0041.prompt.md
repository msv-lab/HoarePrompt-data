Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The `letters` list contains all characters from the `password` string that are not digits, and the `digits` list contains all characters from the `password` string that are digits. The `letters` list is not sorted, and the `digits` list is sorted.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(password) - 1):
    if password[i].isalpha() and password[i + 1].isdigit():
        return 'NO'


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 0, `len(password)` is at least 1, and either `password[i]` is not an alphabetic character or `password[i + 1]` is not a digit.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 1, and `password` is a string with at least one character. If `password[1]` is an alphabetic character and `password[2]` is a digit, the function returns 'NO'. Otherwise, the conditions of the precondition are retained.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, and `password` is a string with at least one character. If the character at index `i` in `password` is alphabetic and the character at index `i + 1` is numeric, the function returns 'NO'. Otherwise, the function does not return anything.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
