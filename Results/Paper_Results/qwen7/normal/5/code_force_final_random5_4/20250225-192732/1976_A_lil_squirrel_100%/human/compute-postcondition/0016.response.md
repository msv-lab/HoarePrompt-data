Output State: **`password` is a non-empty string of length \(n\), `letters` is a list containing all characters from `password` that are not digits, `digits` is a list containing all characters from `password` that are digits plus the character `ch`, and `ch` is the next character in the `password` string.**

Explanation: The code appends the character `ch` to the `digits` list. The length of the `password` string and the content of the `letters` list remain unchanged. The `digits` list now includes all the original digits from `password` plus the new digit `ch`. The variable `ch` remains as the next character in the `password` string.
