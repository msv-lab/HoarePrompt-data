Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly verifies whether a password meets the specified conditions. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Letters Sorted in Non-Decreasing Order**: The program collects all letters into `letters` and checks if they are sorted using `sorted(letters)`. This ensures that all letters are in the correct order.

2. **Digits Sorted in Non-Decreasing Order**: Similarly, the program collects all digits into `digits` and checks if they are sorted using `sorted(digits)`. This ensures that all digits are in the correct order.

3. **No Digit After Letter**: The program iterates through the password and checks if a digit follows a letter. If such a sequence is found, it immediately returns "NO".

4. **Only Lowercase Latin Letters and Digits**: The program inherently handles this condition by segregating letters and digits and not performing additional checks for this requirement.

Given these checks, the program correctly identifies whether a password is strong according to the problem description. There are no apparent edge cases or scenarios where the program would fail to meet the requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.
