Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the conditions for a strong password as specified in the problem statement. Let's break down why:

1. **Password Composition**: The program checks if the password consists only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, which is handled implicitly by the way the `letters` and `digits` lists are populated.

2. **Non-Decreasing Order of Digits and Letters**: 
   - It checks if the list of letters is sorted in non-decreasing order using `sorted(letters)`.
   - It checks if the list of digits is sorted in non-decreasing order using `sorted(digits)`.

3. **No Digit After Letter**: 
   - It iterates through the password and ensures that there is no digit immediately following a letter. If such a sequence is found, it returns "NO".

4. **Edge Cases**: The program handles all edge cases where the password might only contain letters or only contain digits.

Given these points, the provided solution is correct and will produce the expected output for the given test cases.
