Postcondition: `password` is a non-empty string of length \(n\), `letters` is a list containing all characters from `password` that are not digits, and `digits` is a list containing all characters from `password` that are digits. If the latest character `ch` is a digit, it is added to the `digits` list; otherwise, `ch` is added to the `letters` list.
