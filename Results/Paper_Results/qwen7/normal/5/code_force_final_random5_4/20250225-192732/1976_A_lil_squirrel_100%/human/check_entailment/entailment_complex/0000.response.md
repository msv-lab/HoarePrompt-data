Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to check if a password meets the specified conditions. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.
2. **Character Classification**: For each password, the program separates the characters into two lists: `letters` and `digits`.
3. **Sorting Check**: It checks if the `letters` list is sorted alphabetically and the `digits` list is sorted numerically.
4. **Adjacency Check**: It ensures that no digit follows a letter in the password.
5. **Return Statement**: Based on the above checks, it returns `'YES'` if the password meets all conditions, otherwise, it returns `'NO'`.

Given the annotated program and the problem description, the logic appears to be correct. The program handles all the specified conditions accurately.

Correctness: **True**
