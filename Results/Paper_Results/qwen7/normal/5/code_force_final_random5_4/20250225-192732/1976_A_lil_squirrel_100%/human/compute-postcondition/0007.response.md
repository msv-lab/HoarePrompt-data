Output State: **`password` is a non-empty string of length n, `letters` is a list containing the character `ch`, `digits` is an empty list, and `ch` does not represent a digit.**

Explanation: The code `letters.append(ch)` appends the character `ch` to the list `letters`. Since `ch` does not represent a digit, the list `digits` remains unchanged. All other variables retain their initial states.
