Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `coord` is a list containing two tuples: (1, input integer), (x, y)**

Explanation: The code appends a new tuple `(x, y)` to the list `coord`. Initially, `coord` contains one tuple `(input(), int(input()))`. After appending `(x, y)`, `coord` now contains two tuples: the first tuple remains as `(input(), int(input()))` and the second tuple is `(x, y)`. The values of `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
