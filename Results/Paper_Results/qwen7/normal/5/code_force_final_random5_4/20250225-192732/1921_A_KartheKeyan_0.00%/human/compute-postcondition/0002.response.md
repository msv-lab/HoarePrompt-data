The only variable in the loop head is `n`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is non-zero, the loop can execute.

Right before the loop, `n` is decreased by the number of iterations in the while loop. This means that `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute the first time.

Therefore, the state of `n` needs to be adjusted to ensure that `n` is at least 1.

State: **`n` must be at least 1, s is the sum calculated from the loop, there are three lines of input left, each containing two integers \(x_i, y_i\) such that \(-1000 \le x_i, y_i \le 1000\)**
