Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the value `4` in the `range()` function. This means the loop will iterate from `i = 0` to `i = 3`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: The initial value of `i` is given as `4`. However, since the loop starts with `i = 0`, `i` needs to be adjusted to `0` to begin the loop.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `4`. Since `i` starts at `0`, the loop will execute for `i = 0, 1, 2, 3`.

4. **Identify other variables in the loop head**: There are no other variables directly involved in the loop head itself. The variables `x`, `y`, `coord`, `p2`, and `res` are not part of the loop head and their values do not affect the loop execution directly.

5. **Adjust the state**: The only state that needs to be adjusted is the initial value of `i` to ensure the loop starts correctly.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `i` to `0`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `coord` is an empty list, `p2` is (input integer - y), `res` is 0, `n` must be non-zero**
