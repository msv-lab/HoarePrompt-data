Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is an input integer from the second split, `y` is an input integer from the second split, `coord` is a list containing two tuples: (1, an input integer), (`x`, `y`).**

Explanation: The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input, splits it into two parts, and converts each part into integers. These integers are then assigned to `x` and `y`. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 2. The `coord` list contains two tuples, one with the first element as 1 and the second element as an input integer, and the other tuple with the first element as `x` and the second element as `y`.
