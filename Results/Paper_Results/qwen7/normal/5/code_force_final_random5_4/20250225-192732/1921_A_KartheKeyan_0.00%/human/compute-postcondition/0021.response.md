`n` is decremented by 1. Initially, `n` is not specified, but it is derived from the context of the splits. Since no specific value for `n` was given initially, the only change is that `n` is now one less than its original value. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `x` is an input integer from the third split, `y` is an input integer from the third split, `coord` is a list containing four tuples: (1, an input integer), (an input integer, an input integer), (an input integer, an input integer), and (3, 3) sorted by their tuple values, `p2` is (coord[3][0] - coord[2][0]), `res` is abs(math.sqrt(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0]) * math.sqrt(p1)), `n` is one less than its original value.**
