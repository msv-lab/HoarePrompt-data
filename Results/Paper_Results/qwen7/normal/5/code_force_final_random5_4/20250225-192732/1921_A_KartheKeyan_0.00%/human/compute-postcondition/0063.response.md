`n` is decremented by 1. Initially, `n` was not defined, so it could be any value. After decrementing, `n` is now one less than its original value. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 3, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `coord` is a list containing tuples of 4 input integers sorted in ascending order, `p2` is the square of the difference between the x-coordinates of the third and second points in `coord`, `res` is the absolute value of the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`, `p1` is the difference between the x-coordinates of the second and first points in `coord`, `n` is one less than its original value.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `coord` is a list containing tuples of 4 input integers sorted in ascending order, `p2` is the square of the difference between the x-coordinates of the third and second points in `coord`, `res` is the absolute value of the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`, `p1` is the difference between the x-coordinates of the second and first points in `coord`, `n` is one less than its original value.**
