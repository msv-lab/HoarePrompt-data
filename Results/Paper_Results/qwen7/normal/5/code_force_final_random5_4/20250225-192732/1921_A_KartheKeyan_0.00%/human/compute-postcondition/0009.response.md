Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `coord` is a list containing one tuple `(input(), int(input()))`**

Explanation: The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input separated by a space, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `x` and `y` respectively. The original values of `i` and `coord` remain unchanged. The `coord` list now contains a single tuple with the values of `x` and `y` as integers.
