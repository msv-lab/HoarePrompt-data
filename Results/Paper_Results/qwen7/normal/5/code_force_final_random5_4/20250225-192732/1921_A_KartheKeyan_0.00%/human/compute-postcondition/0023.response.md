Output State: **`i` is 3, `x` is an input integer from the third split, `y` is an input integer from the third split, `coord` is an empty list, `p2` is 0, `res` is 0, `n` is 1**

Explanation: The line `coord = []` assigns an empty list to the variable `coord`. This clears the previous list containing four tuples. Since the list is now empty, `p2` and `res` are recalculated based on the new value of `coord`, which results in `p2` being 0 and `res` being 0. The values of `i`, `x`, `y`, and `n` remain unchanged.
