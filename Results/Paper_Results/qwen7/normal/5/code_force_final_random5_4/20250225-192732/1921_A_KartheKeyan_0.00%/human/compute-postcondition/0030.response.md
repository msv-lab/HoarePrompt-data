Output State: **`i` is 4, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `coord` is a list containing two tuples `[(4, input integer), (input integer, input integer)]`, `p2` is 0, `res` is 0, `n` is 1**

Explanation: The code appends a new tuple `(x, y)` to the list `coord`. Initially, `coord` contains one tuple `(4, input integer)`. After appending `(x, y)`, `coord` now contains two tuples: `[(4, input integer), (x, y)]`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.
