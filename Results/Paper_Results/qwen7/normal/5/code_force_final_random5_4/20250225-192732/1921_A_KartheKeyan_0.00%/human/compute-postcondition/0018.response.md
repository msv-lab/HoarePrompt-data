Output State: **`i` is 3, `x` is an input integer from the third split, `y` is an input integer from the third split, `coord` is a list containing four tuples: (1, an input integer), (an input integer, an input integer), (an input integer, an input integer), and (3, 3) sorted by their tuple values, `p2` is (coord[3][0] - coord[2][0]) ** 2 + (coord[3][1] - coord[2][1]) ** 2.**

Explanation: The code calculates the squared distance between the last two points in the `coord` list, which are `(3, 3)` and the second last point in the sorted list. Since the list is sorted by their tuple values, the second last point is the third point in the original list before sorting. The value of `p2` is the sum of the squares of the differences in the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of these two points. The other variables remain unchanged.
