Output State: **`i` is 2, `t` is 1, `x` is 0, `max` is either 99999998 or 99999999, `min` is either -100000000 or -99999999, `ans` is a list containing either 100000000 or -100000000 and 100000000 or 100000000.**

Explanation: The value of `max` is decremented by 1. Since `max` could initially be either 99999999 or 100000000, after decrementing, it becomes 99999998 or 99999999, respectively. The values of `i`, `t`, `x`, `min`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
