Output State: `i` is 2, `t` is the total number of iterations, `x` is 1, `max` is 99999997, `min` is -99999999, `ans` is a list containing the sequence of integers from 100000000 down to 99999997 and then up to -99999999.

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `x` is not equal to 1. In each iteration, if `x` is even, `max` is decremented by 1 and `x` is halved. If `x` is odd, `min` is incremented by 1 and `x` is decremented by 1. The loop will continue until `x` becomes 1. Given the initial conditions and the operations within the loop, `x` will eventually reach 1 after a series of operations that modify `max`, `min`, and `ans`. The final value of `t` will be the total number of iterations it took to reach this state.
