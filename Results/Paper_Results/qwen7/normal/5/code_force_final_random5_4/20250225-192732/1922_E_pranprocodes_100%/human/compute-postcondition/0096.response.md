Output State: **`i` is 2, `t` is 0, `x` is 0, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is a list containing the value 100000000.**

Explanation: The code `x = x // 2` divides `x` by 2 using integer division. Given that `x` must not be equal to 1 and its initial value is not specified explicitly in the initial state (but it's implied to be a value that when halved does not violate the condition), the most straightforward interpretation is that `x` was initially 2 (since it must not be 1 and the simplest non-1 value that fits the condition). After the operation, `x` becomes `2 // 2` which equals `1`. However, since `x` must not be equal to 1, the only logical value for `x` before the operation that fits all conditions is `2`, making `x` become `1` after the operation, but given the constraint, `x` should remain `0` as the closest value fitting the condition without being `1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
