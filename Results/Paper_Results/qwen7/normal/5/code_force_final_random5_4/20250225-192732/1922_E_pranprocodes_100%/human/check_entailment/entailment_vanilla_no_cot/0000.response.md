Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the while loop is flawed and does not guarantee that the resulting array will have exactly `X` increasing subsequences. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Incorrect Handling of `X`**: The code attempts to reduce `X` to 1 by repeatedly dividing it by 2 when it is even and decrementing it by 1 when it is odd. This approach does not ensure that the final array will have exactly `X` increasing subsequences.

2. **Array Construction**: The array construction part (`ans.append(max)` and `ans.append(min)`) does not align with the requirement of having exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The values appended to `ans` do not necessarily lead to the desired count of increasing subsequences.

3. **Edge Cases**: The solution does not handle edge cases properly, such as when `X` is a prime number or a highly composite number, which would require a more sophisticated approach to construct the array.

To correctly solve this problem, one would need to use combinatorial methods or dynamic programming to construct an array that meets the exact requirement of having `X` increasing subsequences. The current implementation does not achieve this goal.
