Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` is 2, `x` is either 50000000 or 99999999, `max` is either 99999998 or 99999999, `min` is -99999998, `ans` is a list containing the values 100000000, -99999999 or 99999999**

Explanation: The code `min += 1` increments the value of `min` by 1. Given the initial state where `min` is either -99999999 or -99999998, incrementing it by 1 results in `min` becoming -99999998. All other variables remain unchanged.
