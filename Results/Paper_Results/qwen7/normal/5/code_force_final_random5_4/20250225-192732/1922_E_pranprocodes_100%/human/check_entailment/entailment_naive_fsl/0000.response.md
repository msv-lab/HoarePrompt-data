Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not generate an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences. Instead, it attempts to construct an array using a sequence of maximum and minimum values based on the binary representation of `X`. However, this approach does not guarantee that the resulting array will have exactly `X` increasing subsequences.

For example, consider the input `X = 37`. The program constructs the array `[100000000, -100000000, 100000000, -100000000, ...]`, which does not meet the requirement of having exactly 37 increasing subsequences. The program does not handle the construction of arrays that would satisfy the increasing subsequence count requirement, especially for larger values of `X`.

A correct solution would involve a more sophisticated approach, possibly involving combinatorial methods or dynamic programming, to ensure that the generated array has exactly `X` increasing subsequences.
