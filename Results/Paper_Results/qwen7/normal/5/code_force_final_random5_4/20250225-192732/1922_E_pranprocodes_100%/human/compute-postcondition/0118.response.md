Output State: **`i` is 2, `t` is 2, `x` is 0, `max` is either 99999998 or 99999999, `min` is either -100000000 or -99999999, `ans` is a list containing either -100000000, 100000000 or -99999999, 100000000**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `min` to the list `ans`. Since `min` can be either -100000000 or -99999999, the list `ans` will contain one of the following combinations: either -100000000 and 100000000 or -99999999 and 100000000. The values of `i`, `t`, `x`, `max`, and the other elements of `ans` remain unchanged.
