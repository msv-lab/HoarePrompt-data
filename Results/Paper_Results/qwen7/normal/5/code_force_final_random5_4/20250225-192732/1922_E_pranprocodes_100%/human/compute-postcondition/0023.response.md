Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` is 1, `x` must not be 1 and must not be a value that would make it 1 in the next step, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -99999998, `ans` is a list containing the values 100000000 and -99999999**

Explanation: The code `min += 1` increments the value of `min` by 1. Initially, `min` is `-99999999`. After incrementing, `min` becomes `-99999998`. All other variables remain unchanged.
