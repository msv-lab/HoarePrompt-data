Output State: **`i` is 1, `t` is 0, `x` is not equal to 1, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is a list containing the value 100000000.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `max` (which is 100000000) to the list `ans`. Since `ans` was initially an empty list, after appending `max`, `ans` becomes a list containing the single element 100000000. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
