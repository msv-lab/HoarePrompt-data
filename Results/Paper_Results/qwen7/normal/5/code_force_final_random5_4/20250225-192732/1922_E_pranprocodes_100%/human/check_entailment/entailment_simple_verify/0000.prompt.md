You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

        x = int(input())
        max = 100000000
        min = -100000000
        ans = []
        t = 0
        while x != 1:
            if x % 2 == 0:
                ans.append(max)
                max -= 1
                x = x // 2
            else:
                ans.append(min)
                min += 1
                x -= 1
            t += 1
        ans.reverse()
        print(t)
        print(*ans)

    #State: Output State: `i` is 999999, `t` is 100000000, `x` is 1, `max` is -100000000, `min` is 100000000, `ans` is a list containing -100000000 repeated 50000000 times and 100000000 repeated 50000000 times.
    #
    #Explanation: Given the constraints, the maximum value of `x` can be \(10^{18}\). In the worst-case scenario, which is when `x` is always odd, the loop will run until `x` reaches 1. This requires \(100000000\) iterations because the loop increments `min` and decrements `x` by 1 in each iteration, effectively halving the range of values between `max` and `min` each time. Since `t` is incremented in each iteration, it will reach `100000000` after `999999` inputs (as the loop starts from `i=0`). At the end of the loop, `x` will be 1, `max` will be -100000000, `min` will be 100000000, and `ans` will contain `-100000000` repeated 50000000 times followed by 100000000 repeated 50000000 times, as the list `ans` is reversed at the end.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not generate an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences. Instead, it attempts to construct an array using a sequence of maximum and minimum values based on the binary representation of `X`. However, this approach does not guarantee that the resulting array will have exactly `X` increasing subsequences.

For example, consider the input `X = 37`. The program constructs the array `[100000000, -100000000, 100000000, -100000000, ...]`, which does not meet the requirement of having exactly 37 increasing subsequences. The program does not handle the construction of arrays that would satisfy the increasing subsequence count requirement, especially for larger values of `X`.

A correct solution would involve a more sophisticated approach, possibly involving combinatorial methods or dynamic programming, to ensure that the generated array has exactly `X` increasing subsequences.
