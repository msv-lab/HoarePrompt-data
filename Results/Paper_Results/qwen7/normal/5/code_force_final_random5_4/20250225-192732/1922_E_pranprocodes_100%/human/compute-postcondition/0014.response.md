Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` is 0, `x` is an input integer minus 1 but not equal to 0, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -99999999, `ans` is a list containing the value `-100000000`.**

Explanation: The value of `x` is decremented by 1, making it an integer input minus 1 and ensuring it is not equal to 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
