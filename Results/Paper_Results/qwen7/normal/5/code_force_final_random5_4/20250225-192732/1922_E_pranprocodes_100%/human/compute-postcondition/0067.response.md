Output State: **`i` is 1, `t` is 1, `x` is 0, `max` is either 99999999 or 100000000, `min` is -99999998, `ans` is a list containing -100000000 and -99999998.**

Explanation: The value of `x` is decremented by 1, changing its value from the initial state where it was not equal to 1 (but now it is 0). All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
