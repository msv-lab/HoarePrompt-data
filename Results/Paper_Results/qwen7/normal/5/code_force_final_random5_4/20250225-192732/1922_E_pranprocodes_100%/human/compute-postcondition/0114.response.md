Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `x != 1`.
2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `t` is 2
   - `x` is 0 (as mentioned, `x` is 0 divided by 2, which results in 0)
   - `max` is either 99999998 or 99999999
   - `min` is either -100000000 or -99999999
   - `ans` is a list containing either 100000000 or -100000000 and 100000000 or 100000000

3. **Determine which states need adjustment**:
   - The loop condition depends on the variable `x`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be different from 1.

Given that `x` is currently 0, the loop can execute one more time because `0 != 1`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `x` is already 0, no adjustment is needed for `x` to satisfy the loop condition.
   - The other variables (`i`, `t`, `max`, `min`, `ans`) are not part of the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state remains the same as given.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 2, `t` is 2, `x` is 0, `max` is either 99999998 or 99999999, `min` is either -100000000 or -99999999, `ans` is a list containing either 100000000 or -100000000 and 100000000 or 100000000**
