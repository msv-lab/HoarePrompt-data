Output State: `i` is 0, `t` is the total number of iterations until `x` becomes 1, `x` is 1, `max` is 100000000 - `t`, `min` is -100000000 + `t`, `ans` is a list containing integers starting from 100000000 down to `100000000 - t`.

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `x` is not equal to 1. Each iteration either halves `x` when it's even or decrements `x` by 1 when it's odd. The variable `t` keeps track of the number of iterations, while `max` and `min` are adjusted in each iteration. `max` decreases by 1 each time `x` is halved, and `min` increases by 1 each time `x` is decremented. The list `ans` accumulates the current values of `max` and `min` in each iteration. Once `x` reaches 1, the loop terminates, and the final state of the variables is as described above.
