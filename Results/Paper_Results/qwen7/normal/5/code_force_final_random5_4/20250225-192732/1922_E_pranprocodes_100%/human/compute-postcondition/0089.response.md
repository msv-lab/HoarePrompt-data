Output State: **`i` is 2, `t` is the total number of iterations until `x` becomes 1, `x` is an input integer, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is a list containing alternating values of 99999997 and -100000000 and is reversed, `min` is updated to -100000000.**

Explanation: The code simply updates the value of `min` to -100000000, which was already its value in the initial state. All other variables remain unchanged.
