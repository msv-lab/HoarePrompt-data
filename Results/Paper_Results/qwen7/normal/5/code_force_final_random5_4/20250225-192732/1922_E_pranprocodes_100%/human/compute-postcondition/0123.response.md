Output State: **`i` is 2, `t` is 3, `x` is either 1 or -1, `max` is either 99999997, 99999998, or 99999999, `min` is either -100000000, -99999998, or -99999999, `ans` is a list containing either 100000000, 99999998, 99999999 or -100000000, 100000000, -99999999, 100000000.**

Explanation: The code `t += 1` increments the value of `t` by 1. Given the initial state, `t` was initially 2, so after executing the code, `t` becomes 3. All other variables (`i`, `x`, `max`, `min`, `ans`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.
