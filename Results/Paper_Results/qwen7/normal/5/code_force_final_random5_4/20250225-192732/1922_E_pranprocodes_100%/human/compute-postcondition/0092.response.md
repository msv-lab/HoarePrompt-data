The only variable in the loop head is the variable `x`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. For the loop to execute the first time, `x` must be different from 1.

Right before the loop, `x` is an input integer. To ensure the loop can execute the first time, `x` must not be equal to 1.

State: **`i` is 2, `t` is 0, `x` must not be equal to 1, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is an empty list**
