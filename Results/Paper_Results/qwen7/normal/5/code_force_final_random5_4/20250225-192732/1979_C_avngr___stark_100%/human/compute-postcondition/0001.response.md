Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for num in numbers[1:]`. The variables involved here are `num` and `numbers`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop iterates over the elements of `numbers` starting from the second element (index 1). This means the loop will execute if there is at least one element after the first element.

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - **`numbers`**: Since the loop starts from `numbers[1:]`, `numbers` must contain at least two elements. Therefore, `numbers` must have a length of at least 2.
   - **`num`**: In the first iteration of the loop, `num` will be set to the second element of `numbers`. Hence, `num` will be the second element of `numbers`.

4. **Consider the given initial state**:
   - `numbers` is a list of integers where each integer \( k_i \) satisfies 2 ≤ \( k_i \) ≤ 20 and the length of the list \( n \) satisfies 1 ≤ \( n \) ≤ 50.
   - `result` is the first element of the `numbers` list.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `numbers` has at least two elements, and `num` is the second element of `numbers`.

**Final State Adjustment**:
- `numbers` must have at least two elements.
- `num` must be the second element of `numbers`.

Therefore, the state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`numbers` must have at least two elements, `num` is the second element of `numbers`**.
