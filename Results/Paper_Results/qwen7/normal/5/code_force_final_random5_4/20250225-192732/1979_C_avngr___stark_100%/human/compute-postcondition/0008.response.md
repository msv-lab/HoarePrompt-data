Output State: The final value of `result` will be the return value of `func_1` when it is called with the last two elements of the `numbers` list as arguments.

In more detail, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `result` will hold the cumulative result of applying the function `func_1` successively to pairs of consecutive elements from the `numbers` list, starting with the first element. Specifically, if the `numbers` list has \( n \) elements, then `result` will be equivalent to:

\[ \text{result} = \text{func\_1}(\ldots(\text{func\_1}(\text{func\_1}(\text{result}, \text{numbers}[1]), \text{numbers}[2]), \ldots, \text{numbers}[n-1]), \text{numbers}[n]) \]

This means `result` will be the outcome of applying `func_1` to the first element of `numbers` and then successively to each subsequent element in the list.
