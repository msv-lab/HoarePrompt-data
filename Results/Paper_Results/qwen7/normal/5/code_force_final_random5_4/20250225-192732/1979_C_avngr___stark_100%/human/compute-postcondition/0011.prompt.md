You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of integers where each integer k_i satisfies 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20 and the length of the list n satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 50.
def func_2(numbers):
    result = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        result = func_1(result, num)
        
    #State: Output State: The final value of `result` will be the return value of `func_1` when it is called with the last two elements of the `numbers` list as arguments.
    #
    #In more detail, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `result` will hold the cumulative result of applying the function `func_1` successively to pairs of consecutive elements from the `numbers` list, starting with the first element. Specifically, if the `numbers` list has \( n \) elements, then `result` will be equivalent to:
    #
    #\[ \text{result} = \text{func\_1}(\ldots(\text{func\_1}(\text{func\_1}(\text{result}, \text{numbers}[1]), \text{numbers}[2]), \ldots, \text{numbers}[n-1]), \text{numbers}[n]) \]
    #
    #This means `result` will be the outcome of applying `func_1` to the first element of `numbers` and then successively to each subsequent element in the list.
    return result
    #The program returns the cumulative result of applying the function `func_1` successively to pairs of consecutive elements from the `numbers` list, starting with the first element.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list of integers `numbers`. It applies the function `func_1` successively to pairs of consecutive elements from the `numbers` list, starting with the first element, and returns the cumulative result.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the cumulative result of applying the function `func_1` successively to pairs of consecutive elements from the `numbers` list, starting with the first element.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
