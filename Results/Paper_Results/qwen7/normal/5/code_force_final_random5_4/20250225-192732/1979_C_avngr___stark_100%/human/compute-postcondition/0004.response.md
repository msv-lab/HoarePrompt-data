Output State: **`numbers` must have at least two elements, `num` is the third element of `numbers`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(result, num)`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `result` by calling the function `func_1(result, num)`. Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `result` after the function call. However, we know that `result` now holds the return value of `func_1(result, num)`. The precondition that `numbers` must have at least two elements and `num` is the third element of `numbers` remains unchanged.
