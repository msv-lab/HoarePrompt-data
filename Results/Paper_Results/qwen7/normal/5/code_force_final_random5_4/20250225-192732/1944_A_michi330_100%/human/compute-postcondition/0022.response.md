Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing multiple test cases where each test case includes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3), and for each test case, integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n * (n - 1) / 2). For each test case, it processes these values and returns information based on the given conditions.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing values for `t`, `n`, and `k`. It processes these values according to specified constraints and returns appropriate information for each test case.
