Postcondition: **`t` must be at least 1, `i` is `t`, `n` is an integer obtained from the first input split, `k` is an integer obtained from the second input split. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, no changes are made to `i`, `n`, or `k`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `i`, `n`, or `k`.**
