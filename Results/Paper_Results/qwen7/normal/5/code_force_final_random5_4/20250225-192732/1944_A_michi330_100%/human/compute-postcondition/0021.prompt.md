Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, t, 1):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    if k >= n - 1:
        print(1)
    else:
        print(n)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` must be at least 1, `n` is an integer obtained from the first input split, `k` is an integer obtained from the second input split, and if `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, then no changes are made to `k`. Otherwise, `k` is less than `n - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` must be at least 1, `i` is `t`, `n` is an integer obtained from the first input split, `k` is an integer obtained from the second input split. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, no changes are made to `i`, `n`, or `k`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `i`, `n`, or `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` must be at least 1, `i` is `t + 1`, `n` is an integer obtained from the first input split, `k` is an integer obtained from the second input split, `n` is assigned the value of the first integer from the input, and `k` is assigned the value of the second integer from the input. Since the if condition `k >= n - 1` does not change the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k`, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
