You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n islands, numbered 1, 2, \ldots, n . Initially, every pair of
islands is connected by a bridge. Hence, there are a total of \frac{n (n -
1)}{2} bridges.

Everule lives on island 1 and enjoys visiting the other islands using bridges.
Dominater has the power to destroy at most k bridges to minimize the number of
islands that Everule can reach using (possibly multiple) bridges.

Find the minimum number of islands (including island 1 ) that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le
n \le 100 , 0 \le k \le \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2} ).

Output

For each test case, output the minimum number of islands that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Example

Input

    6
    
    2 0
    
    2 1
    
    4 1
    
    5 10
    
    5 3
    
    4 4

Output

    2
    1
    4
    1
    5
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, since no bridges can be destroyed, all the islands
will be reachable.

In the second test case, you can destroy the bridge between islands 1 and 2 .
Everule will not be able to visit island 2 but can still visit island 1 .
Therefore, the total number of islands that Everule can visit is 1 .

In the third test case, Everule always has a way of reaching all islands
despite what Dominater does. For example, if Dominater destroyed the bridge
between islands 1 and 2 , Everule can still visit island 2 by traveling by 1
\to 3 \to 2 as the bridges between 1 and 3 , and between 3 and 2 are not
destroyed.

In the fourth test case, you can destroy all bridges since k = \frac{n \cdot
(n - 1)}{2} . Everule will be only able to visit 1 island (island 1 ).

- Program:
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(0, t, 1):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k >= n - 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            print(n)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers \( t \), \( n \), and \( k \). For each test case, it reads \( t \) and then iterates \( t \) times, reading \( n \) and \( k \) in each iteration. Based on the value of \( k \) relative to \( n-1 \), it prints either 1 or \( n \). After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading `n` and `k` for each case.

2. **Bridge Destruction Logic:**
   - The program checks if `k` (the number of bridges that can be destroyed) is greater than or equal to `n - 1`.
     - If `k >= n - 1`, it prints `1`. This means that if Dominater can destroy at least `n - 1` bridges, Everule can only visit island 1.
     - Otherwise, it prints `n`, meaning all islands are still reachable.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `k >= n - 1` correctly.
   - However, it does not handle the case where `k < n - 1` optimally. Specifically, it assumes that destroying fewer than `n - 1` bridges will allow Everule to visit all islands, which is not necessarily true.

### Example Test Cases:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `2 0`
   - Expected Output: `2`
   - Explanation: No bridges can be destroyed, so both islands are reachable.

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `2 1`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - Explanation: One bridge can be destroyed, preventing Everule from visiting the second island.

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `4 1`
   - Expected Output: `4`
   - Explanation: One bridge can be destroyed, but it won't prevent Everule from visiting all four islands because he can find an alternative path.

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - Input: `5 10`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - Explanation: Since `k = 10` and `n - 1 = 4`, Dominater can destroy all bridges, leaving Everule on island 1.

5. **Test Case 5:**
   - Input: `5 3`
   - Expected Output: `5`
   - Explanation: Three bridges can be destroyed, but not enough to isolate any island completely, so all five islands are reachable.

6. **Test Case 6:**
   - Input: `4 4`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - Explanation: Four bridges can be destroyed, isolating Everule on island 1.

### Conclusion:

The program fails to handle the case where `k < n - 1` optimally. Specifically, it incorrectly assumes that if `k < n - 1`, Everule can still visit all islands, which is not always true. For example, in Test Case 3, the program outputs `4` when the correct answer should be `2` if Dominater destroys one bridge between two specific islands.
