Output State: **The loop has completed all its iterations, with `t` remaining as the initial value since it is not modified within the loop. The variable `i` will be equal to `t` (the initial value of `t`) plus the number of iterations minus one, which is `t`. Therefore, `i` will be `2 * t - 1`. The variables `n` and `k` will each hold the values of the last `n` and `k` entered by the user during any of the iterations, as they are re-assigned in each iteration.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` stays the same, `i` is `2 * t - 1`, and `n` and `k` will be the values of the last `n` and `k` entered by the user.
