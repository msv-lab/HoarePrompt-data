Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` must be at least 1.
   - `i` is `t`.
   - `n` is an integer obtained from the first input split.
   - `k` is an integer obtained from the second input split.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs as long as `i < t`.

3. **Loop Behavior:**
   - If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, no changes are made to `i`, `n`, or `k`.
   - Otherwise, no changes are made to `i`, `n`, or `k`.

4. **Determine the Next State:**
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration (as per the `range(0, t, 1)`), at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `t + 1`.
   - The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged based on the given conditions.

5. **Final Adjusted States:**
   - `t` remains at least 1.
   - `i` becomes `t + 1`.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `k` remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`t` must be at least 1, `i` is `t + 1`, `n` is an integer obtained from the first input split, `k` is an integer obtained from the second input split**.
