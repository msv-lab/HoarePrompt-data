Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be at least 1.
- `i` is defined as `t + 1`.
- `n` is an integer obtained from the first input split.
- `k` is an integer obtained from the second input split.
- `n` is assigned the value of the first integer from the input.
- `k` is assigned the value of the second integer from the input.

The `print(n)` statement will print the value of `n`, which is the first integer from the input.

Output: **n (where n is the first integer from the input)**
