Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be at least 1.
- `i` is assigned the value of `t`.
- `n` is an integer obtained from the first input split.
- `k` is an integer obtained from the second input split.

The `print(n)` statement will print the value of `n`.

Since `n` is described as being obtained from the first input split, we cannot determine its exact value without knowing the input. However, we know it is an integer.

Output: **n (where n is an integer obtained from the first input split)**
