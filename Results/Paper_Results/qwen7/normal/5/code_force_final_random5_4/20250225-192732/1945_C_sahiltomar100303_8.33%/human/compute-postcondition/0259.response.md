Output State: **`left` is 0 or 1, `leftZero` is either 0 or 1, `rightZero` is the total number of zeros in the string from index `left` to `n-1` minus 1, `rightOne` is the total number of ones in the string from index `left` to `n-1`, `right` is `mid` plus 2, `trightOne` must be less than half of the segment length `(n - right + 1) // 2`, `tleftZero` must be less than half of the segment length `(right + 1) // 2`, `tleftZero` is increased by 1.**

The value of `tleftZero` is incremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
