Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `mid` to `n-1` (inclusive). The loop continues as long as `i < n`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is `mid + 1`.
   - `i` is less than `n`.
   - If `s[i]` equals '0', then `rightZero` is increased by 2.
   - Otherwise, `rightOne` is increased by 2.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 at each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `mid + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Therefore, `i` will be incremented to `mid + 2` in the next iteration.

5. **Update the conditions**:
   - `n` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `i` is updated to `mid + 2`.
   - The condition `i < n` must still hold true.

6. **Consider the postconditions**:
   - The values of `rightZero` and `rightOne` are updated based on the value of `s[i]` during the loop execution, but these values are not directly affected by the loop head variables.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final State**:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `mid + 2`, `i` is less than `n`**.
