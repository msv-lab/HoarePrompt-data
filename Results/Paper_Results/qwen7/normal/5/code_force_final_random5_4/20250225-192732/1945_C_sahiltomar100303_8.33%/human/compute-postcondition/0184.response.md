Output State: **Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 0, `leftZero` is increased by 2 for each '0' in the first half of `s`, and `leftOne` is increased by 1 for each '1' in the first half of `s`, `mid` remains as `n // 2`, `tleftZero` is equal to the count of '0's in the first half of `s`, and `tleftOne` is equal to the count of '1's in the first half of `s`.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations (from `i = 0` to `i = mid - 1`), `leftZero` will be incremented by 2 for each '0' encountered in the first half of the string `s`, and `leftOne` will be incremented by 1 for each '1' encountered in the first half of the string `s`. The variable `mid` remains unchanged as it is only used to determine the range of the loop. `tleftZero` will hold the total count of '0's in the first half of the string `s`, and `tleftOne` will hold the total count of '1's in the first half of the string `s`.
