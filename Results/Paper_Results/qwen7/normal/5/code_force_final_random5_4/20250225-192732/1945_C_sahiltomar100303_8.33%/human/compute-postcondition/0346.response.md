Output State: **The character at index `i` of string `s` is not '0'; `rightOne` is increased by 1, resulting in `rightOne` being `rightOne + 1`.**

This means that the character at index `i` of string `s` remains unchanged (it is still not '0'), and the value of `rightOne` has been incremented by 1.
