Output State: **i is n // 2, rightZero is twice the number of '0's encountered from index n // 2 to n-1, rightOne is twice the number of '1's encountered from index n // 2 to n-1, right is n, left is n // 2 plus the total number of iterations, leftZero and tleftZero are unchanged, leftOne and tleftOne are unchanged, trightZero and trightOne are unchanged, t is decreased by the total number of iterations, and the conditions for trightZero and trightOne remain as described in the initial state.**

Explanation:
- After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be equal to `n // 2` because the loop runs from `mid` (which is `n // 2`) to `n-1`.
- `rightZero` and `rightOne` will be updated based on the characters from `n // 2` to `n-1`.
- `right` will be set to `n` indicating the end of the string.
- `left` will be `n // 2` plus the total number of iterations, which is `n - n // 2` or `n // 2`.
- `leftZero`, `leftOne`, `tleftZero`, and `tleftOne` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
- `trightZero` and `trightOne` also remain unchanged as they are not modified in the loop.
- `t` is decreased by the total number of iterations, which is `n - n // 2` or `n // 2`.
- The conditions for `trightZero` and `trightOne` remain as described in the initial state.
