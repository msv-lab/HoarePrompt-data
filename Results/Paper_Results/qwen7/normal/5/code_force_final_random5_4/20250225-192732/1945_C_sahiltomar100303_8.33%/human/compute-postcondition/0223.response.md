Output State: **`left` must be greater than 0, `leftZero` is now `leftZero - 1`, `rightZero` is increased by 1, and either `leftZero` must be less than half of `left + 1` or `rightOne` must be less than half of `n - left + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `rightZero += 1` increases the value of `rightZero` by 1. The conditions involving `leftZero` and `rightOne` remain unchanged as no operations affecting them were performed. The precondition that `left` must be greater than 0 also remains valid.
