Output State: **`leftZero` is decreased by 1, `rightZero` is increased by 1 to become `rightZero + 1`, and either `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2` or `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2` must still hold true.**

Explanation: The code `rightZero += 1` increases the value of `rightZero` by 1. The other conditions and relationships between variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `leftZero` is decreased by 1, `rightZero` is increased by 1 to become `rightZero + 1`, and the condition involving `leftZero` and `rightOne` must still hold true.
