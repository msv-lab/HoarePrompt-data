Output State: **`left` must be greater than 0 and either `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2` or `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2` must still hold true; `leftOne` is `leftOne - 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `leftOne` is decremented by 1. The conditions involving `left`, `leftZero`, `rightOne`, and `n` remain unchanged as they were not directly affected by the code.
