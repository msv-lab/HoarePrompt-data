Output State: **`left` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `leftZero` must be less than half of `left + 1`, or `rightOne` must be less than half of `n - left + 1`, the character at position `left - 1` in the string `s` is not '0'**.

Explanation: The value of `leftOne` is decremented by 1. Since `leftOne` was originally greater than 0 (as per the initial state), it is now `leftOne - 1`. The conditions involving `leftZero` and `rightOne` remain unchanged, and the character at position `left - 1` in the string `s` is still not '0'.
