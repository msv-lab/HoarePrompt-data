Output State: `left` is 0, `leftZero` is less than or equal to 1, `rightZero` is the total number of zeros in the string from index `left` to `n-1`, `rightOne` is the total number of ones in the string from index `left` to `n-1`.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `left` will be 0 because it decreases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0. The conditions inside the loop ensure that either `leftZero` is less than half of `left + 1` (which becomes 1 when `left` is 0) or `rightOne` is less than half of `n - left + 1` (which becomes `n` when `left` is 0). Since `left` eventually reaches 0, the condition simplifies to checking if `leftZero` is less than or equal to 1. `rightZero` and `rightOne` will count the number of zeros and ones respectively from the current `left` (which is 0) to the end of the string (`n-1`).
