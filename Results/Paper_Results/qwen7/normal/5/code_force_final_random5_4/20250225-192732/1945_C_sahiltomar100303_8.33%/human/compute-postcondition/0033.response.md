Output State: **`i` is 2, `mid` must still be greater than 1, `leftOne` is increased by 2**.

Explanation: The variable `tleftOne` is assigned the value of `leftOne + 1`. Since `leftOne` was initially increased by 1 before this line of code, `tleftOne` now equals `leftOne + 1`. Therefore, `leftOne` is effectively increased by 2. The values of `i` and `mid` remain unchanged.
