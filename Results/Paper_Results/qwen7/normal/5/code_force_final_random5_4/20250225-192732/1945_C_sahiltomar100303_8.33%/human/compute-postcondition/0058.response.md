Output State: **`i` is `mid + 1`, `rightOne` is increased by 2**

Explanation: The variable `rightOne` was already increased by 1 in the initial state. The code `trightOne += 1` increases `rightOne` by 1 again, making it increased by 2 in total. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it was initially set to `mid + 1`.
