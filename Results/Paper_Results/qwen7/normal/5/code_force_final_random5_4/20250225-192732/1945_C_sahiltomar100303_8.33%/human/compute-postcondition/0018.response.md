Output State: **`i` is 0, `mid` is a positive integer (n // 2), and `s[i]` is not '0'; `leftOne` is 1.**

The code `leftOne += 1` increments the value of `leftOne` by 1. Since `leftOne` was initially not specified, we assume it was 0 before this line of code. After executing this line, `leftOne` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
