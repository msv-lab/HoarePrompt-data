Postcondition: **`leftMove` is 6, `i` is equal to `n`, `mid` remains as `n // 2`, `s` is the input string, `leftZero` is the count of '0's from index 0 to `mid - 1` (decreased multiple times or unchanged), `leftOne` is the count of '1's from index 0 to `mid - 1` (decreased multiple times or unchanged), `rightZero` is the count of '0's or '1's from index `mid` to the end of the string (increased multiple times or unchanged), `rightOne` is the count of '0's or '1's from index `mid` to the end of the string (increased multiple times or unchanged), `left` is `mid - 3`, `right` is `n - 1`, `tleftZero` is less than `(n // 2 + 1) // 2`, `trightOne` is less than `(n // 2 + 1) // 2`, and `left` is not equal to 0, and `right` is not equal to `n`. Additionally, the absolute difference between `n + 1` divided by 2 and `left` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `n + 1` divided by 2 and `right`, or the absolute difference between `n + 1` divided by 2 and `left` is greater than the absolute difference between `n + 1` divided by 2 and `right`.**
