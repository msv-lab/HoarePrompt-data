Output State: **`i` is `mid`, `mid` is `n // 2`, `s` is the input string, `leftZero` is the count of '0's from index 0 to `mid - 1`, `leftOne` is the count of '1's from index 0 to `mid - 1`, `rightZero` is incremented by 1**.

The code `rightZero += 1` increments the value of `rightZero` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
