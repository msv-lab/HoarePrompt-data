Postcondition: `left` must be greater than 0, `leftZero` is adjusted such that if `s[left - 1] == '0'`, then `leftZero` is decreased by 1 and `rightZero` is increased by 1, ensuring either `leftZero` is less than half of `left + 1` or `rightOne` is less than half of `n - left + 1`. If `s[left - 1] != '0'`, then `leftZero` remains less than half of `left + 1`, `rightOne` is increased by 1, and `leftOne` is decreased by 1.
