Output State: **`leftZero` is less than half of `left + 1` - 1 or `rightOne` is less than half of `n - left + 1`.**

Explanation: The variable `leftZero` is decremented by 1. Since `leftZero` was initially less than half of `left + 1`, after decrementing by 1, it remains less than half of `left + 1`. The condition involving `rightOne` remains unchanged because no operation affects `rightOne` or `n`. Therefore, the updated condition for `leftZero` is `leftZero` is less than half of `left + 1 - 1`, which simplifies to `leftZero` is less than half of `left + 1`. The condition involving `rightOne` stays as is.
