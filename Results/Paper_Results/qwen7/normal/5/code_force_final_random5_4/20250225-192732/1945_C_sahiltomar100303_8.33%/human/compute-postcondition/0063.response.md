Output State: **`leftMove` is 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `mid` remains as `n // 2`, `s` is the input string, `leftZero` is the count of '0's from index 0 to `mid - 1`, and `leftOne` is the count of '1's from index 0 to `mid - 1`, `rightZero` is the count of '0's from index `mid` to the end of the string, and `rightOne` is the count of '1's from index `mid` to the end of the string, `left` is assigned the value of `mid`.**

Explanation: The code `leftMove = 0` simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `leftMove`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain as they were in the initial state.
