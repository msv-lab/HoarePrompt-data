Output State: **`left` is `n // 2` plus the total number of iterations minus 1 and must be greater than 0, and the current value of `s[left - 1]` is '0'; `rightZero` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `rightZero` is incremented by 1, while the values of `left` and `s[left - 1]` remain unchanged from their initial states.
