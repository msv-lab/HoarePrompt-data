Output State: **`i` is 1; `mid` must be greater than 1; `leftZero` is 1**

Explanation: The variable `leftZero` is incremented by 1. Initially, `leftZero` was 0 (implied from the condition that `i` is 1 and `mid` must be greater than 1), so after executing `leftZero += 1`, `leftZero` becomes 1. The values of `i` and `mid` remain unchanged.
