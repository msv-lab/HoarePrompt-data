Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `leftZero` is increased by 3, `leftOne` is increased by 2 if `s[mid]` is not '0', `i` is `mid`**.

Explanation: The code `leftZero += 1` increases the value of `leftZero` by 1. Since `leftZero` was previously increased by 2 if `s[mid]` is '0', now it is increased by 3 if `s[mid]` is '0'. The value of `leftOne` remains unchanged if `s[mid]` is not '0', and `i` remains equal to `mid`.
