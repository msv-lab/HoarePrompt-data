Output State: **`s` is a string, `right` is an index within the string `s` plus 2 and must be less than `n`, `tleftZero` is incremented by 1, `tleftOne` remains unchanged.**

The code `tleftZero += 1` increments the value of `tleftZero` by 1. Since `right` is an index within the string `s` plus 2 and must be less than `n`, this information remains unchanged. The value of `tleftOne` is not affected by this operation.
