Output State: **`i` is 0, `mid` is a positive integer (n // 2), `leftZero` is 1, and the current value of `s[i]` is '0'.**

Explanation: The variable `leftZero` is incremented by 1, starting from an unspecified initial value (which is not relevant since it is incremented by 1). The values of `i`, `mid`, and the current value of `s[i]` remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` is still 0, `mid` remains a positive integer (n // 2), `leftZero` is now 1, and the current value of `s[i]` is still '0'.
