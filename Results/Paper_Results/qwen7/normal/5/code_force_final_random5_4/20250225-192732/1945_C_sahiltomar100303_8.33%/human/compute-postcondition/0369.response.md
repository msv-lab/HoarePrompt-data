Output State: **`left` is `n // 2` plus the total number of iterations minus 1 and must be greater than 0, and the current value of `s[left - 1]` is '0'.**

Explanation: The variable `leftZero` is decremented by 1. Given the initial postcondition, `left` is `n // 2` plus the total number of iterations and must be greater than 0. After decrementing `leftZero` by 1, `left` becomes `n // 2` plus the total number of iterations minus 1. The value of `s[left - 1]` remains '0' as it was not affected by the code.
