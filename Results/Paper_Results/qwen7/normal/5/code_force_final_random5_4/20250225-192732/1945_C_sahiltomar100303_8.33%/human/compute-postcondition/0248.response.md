Output State: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is less than or equal to 1, `rightZero` is the total number of zeros in the string from index `left` to `n-1`, `rightOne` is the total number of ones in the string from index `left` to `n-1`, `right` is `mid`, `tleftOne` is 1, `trightOne` is `rightOne - 1`, `rightOne` is greater than or equal to half of the remaining length of the string.**

Explanation: The code `trightOne -= 1` decreases the value of `trightOne` by 1. Since `trightOne` was initially equal to `rightOne`, after executing this line, `trightOne` becomes `rightOne - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
