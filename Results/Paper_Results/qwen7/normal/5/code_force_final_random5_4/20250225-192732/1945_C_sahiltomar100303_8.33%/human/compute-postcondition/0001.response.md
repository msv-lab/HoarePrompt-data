Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable involved here is `t`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `t`**: According to the problem statement, `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and \(2 \times 10^4\) inclusive.

3. **Check the condition for loop execution**: The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is an integer input, it can be any integer from 1 to \(2 \times 10^4\), but it must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

4. **Adjust the state**: The only variable that needs adjustment is `t`, and it must be greater than 0.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
