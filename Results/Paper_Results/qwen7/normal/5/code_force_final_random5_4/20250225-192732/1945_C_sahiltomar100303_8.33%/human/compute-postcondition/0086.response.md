Output State: **`left` must be at least 1, and (`leftZero` is less than half of `left + 1` or `rightOne` is less than half of `n - left + 1`); `rightOne` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `rightOne` is incremented by 1. The conditions involving `leftZero`, `leftOne`, and `rightOne` remain unchanged, except for the fact that `rightOne` has now increased by 1. The precondition that `left` must be at least 1 and the logical condition involving `leftZero` and `rightOne` remains valid.
