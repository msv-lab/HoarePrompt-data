Postcondition: `left` is 0 or 1, `leftZero` is either 0 or 1, `rightZero` is the total number of zeros in the string from index `left` to `n-1` minus 1, `rightOne` is the total number of ones in the string from index `left` to `n-1`, `right` is `mid` plus 2, `trightOne` is adjusted by subtracting 1, `tleftZero` is either increased by 1 or remains unchanged, and `tleftOne` is increased by 1 if `s[right]` is '0', otherwise `trightZero` is decreased by 1.
