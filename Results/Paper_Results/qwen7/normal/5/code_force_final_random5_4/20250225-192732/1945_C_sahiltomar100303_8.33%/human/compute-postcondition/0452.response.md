Postcondition: **`s` is a string, `right` is an index within the string `s` and is equal to `n`, `tleftZero`, `trightZero`, `trightOne`, and `tleftOne` are updated based on the number of '0's and '1's encountered from the start of the string up to but not including the initial `right` and from the initial `right` to the end of the string. If `right` is equal to `n`, the updates to `tleftZero`, `trightZero`, `trightOne`, and `tleftOne` are based on the number of '0's and '1's from the start of the string up to but not including the initial `right` and from the initial `right` to the end of the string. If the number of '1's from the start of the string up to but not including the initial `right` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, the values of `tleftZero`, `trightZero`, `trightOne`, and `tleftOne` remain unchanged. If `right` is not equal to `n`, the updates to `tleftZero`, `trightZero`, `trightOne`, and `tleftOne` are based on the number of '0's and '1's from the initial `right` to the end of the string and from the start of the string up to but not including the initial `right`. The absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `left` is compared to the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `right`.**
