Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case where the optimal position for the road is exactly at the middle of the village. Specifically, the program does not properly account for the scenario where `left` and `right` are equal in terms of minimizing `|n/2 - i|`.

Consider the following test case:

```
Input:
1
3
110
```

Expected Output:
```
1
```

However, the program outputs:
```
0
```

This is because the program checks if `left` is zero or `right` is equal to `n` before comparing the distances, which does not correctly handle the case where the optimal position is exactly at the middle. The program should check both `left` and `right` positions to ensure the minimum distance to the middle is found, even if they are equal.

A correct approach would involve checking both `left` and `right` positions after the main loop to ensure the minimum distance to the middle is found, considering the case where both positions have the same minimum distance.
