Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `mid + 1`, `i` must be less than `n`, `rightZero` is increased by 2**

Explanation: The line `trightZero += 1` increments the value of `trightZero` by 1. Since `trightZero` was previously increased by 1, it is now increased by 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
