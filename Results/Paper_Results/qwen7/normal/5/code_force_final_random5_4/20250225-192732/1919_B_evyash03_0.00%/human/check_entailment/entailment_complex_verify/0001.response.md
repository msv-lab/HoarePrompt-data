### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies several issues with the provided program. Let's break down the analysis further:

1. **Input Reading and Splitting:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading the length of the string `n` and the string `expression`.
   - The string `expression` is split into parts using `'-'` as the delimiter, which creates substrings of consecutive `+` characters. This step is correct.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is called with the string `expression` and `result_length` as arguments.
   - However, the function `func_1` does not use `result_length` at all, which is indeed a potential issue. The function should focus on minimizing the penalty rather than using an unused variable.

3. **Logic in `func_1`:**
   - The logic in `func_1` counts the number of times the balance (difference between the number of `+` and `-`) goes negative. This is not directly related to minimizing the penalty.
   - The logic does not account for the actual values of `+1` and `-1` in the array `a`. Instead, it simply counts the number of times the balance goes negative, which is not optimal.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - To minimize the penalty, we need to split the array `a` into subarrays such that the sum of each subarray is as close to zero as possible.
   - A more appropriate approach would involve dynamic programming or a greedy strategy to minimize the penalty.

Given the issues identified, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The function `func_1` does not account for the actual values of `+1` and `-1` in the array `a`, and it does not implement the correct logic to minimize the penalty.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment correctly identifies the issues with the provided program. Therefore, the correctness of the provided program is:

**Final: False**
