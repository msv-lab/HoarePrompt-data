Output State: **`expression` must have at least one character remaining; balance is decreased by 1.**

The code `balance -= 1` decreases the value of `balance` by 1. Since `expression` must have at least one character remaining, its state remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `balance` and the unchanged state of `expression`.
