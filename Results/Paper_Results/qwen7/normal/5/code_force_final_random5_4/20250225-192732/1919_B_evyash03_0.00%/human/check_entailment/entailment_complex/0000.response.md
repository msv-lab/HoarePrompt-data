Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to minimize the penalty by optimally splitting the array `a` derived from the string `s`. The penalty is calculated based on the absolute value of the sum of each segment multiplied by its length.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `s` and the string itself.
   - The `split('-')` method is used to divide the string `s` into segments based on the '-' character. However, this approach is incorrect because it only splits on '-' and ignores '+' characters, which is not the intended behavior.
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the minimum penalty. It iterates through the string `expression` and counts the number of times the balance (difference between the number of '+' and '-') becomes negative. If the final balance is positive, it adds one to the count.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in `func_1` is correct for calculating the minimum penalty. It correctly counts the number of times the balance goes negative and ensures that the final balance is considered.
   - However, the way the string is split in the main program is incorrect. The `split('-')` method should be replaced with a method that properly handles the entire string and counts the segments correctly.

Given the above analysis, the logic in `func_1` is correct, but the way the string is processed in the main program is incorrect. Therefore, the overall program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
