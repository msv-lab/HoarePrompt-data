Functionality: **The function accepts a string `expression` consisting of "+" and "-" characters and an integer `length` (though `length` is not used in the function). It counts the number of times the balance (difference between the number of "+" and "-") becomes negative while iterating through the string. The function returns this count plus one if the final balance is positive, otherwise just the count.**
