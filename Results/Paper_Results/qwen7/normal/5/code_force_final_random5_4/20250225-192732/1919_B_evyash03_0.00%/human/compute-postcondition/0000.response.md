Output State: **`count` is 0, `expression` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters "+" and "-", and `n` is an integer representing the length of the string `expression`.**

The code initializes the variable `count` to 0. No changes are made to the `expression` or the value of `n`. Therefore, the length of the string `expression` remains `n`, and the string itself retains its original characters of "+" and "-".
