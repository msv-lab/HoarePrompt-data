Output State: **Postcondition: `expression` must have at least one character remaining, `balance` can be either 1 or -1, and `count` is 2, and `char` will be the first character of the current `expression`.**

Explanation: The code `count += 1` increments the value of `count` by 1. Since `count` was previously increased by 1 when the `balance` was less than 0, now `count` is 2. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
