Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for char in expression`. The variables involved in the loop head are `char` and `expression`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute again, the condition `expression` must have at least one character remaining.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `expression` must have at least one character remaining.
   - `balance` is 0.
   - `count` is increased by 1 if `balance` was already less than 0.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `char` is the variable being iterated over, it will take the first character from `expression` in the next iteration.
   - After the next iteration, `expression` will have one less character than it did at the end of the previous iteration.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `expression` now has one less character remaining, and `char` will be the first character of the current `expression`.

**State: **`expression` must have at least one character remaining, `balance` is 0, and `count` is increased by 1 if `balance` was already less than 0, and `char` will be the first character of the current `expression`**.
