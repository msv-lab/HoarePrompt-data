Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Use of `length` Parameter**: The `length` parameter passed to `func_1` is not utilized in the function. This suggests that the function might be intended to handle the entire string without relying on an external `length` value, which is misleading and unnecessary.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Penalty**: The function `func_1` counts the number of times the balance (difference between the number of "+" and "-") becomes negative while iterating through the string. However, this does not directly translate to the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement. The goal is to minimize the sum of penalties of the subarrays formed by splitting the array optimally.

3. **Balance Calculation and Splitting Logic**: The function calculates the balance but does not actually perform the optimal splitting of the array to minimize the penalty. Instead, it simply counts the transitions where the balance goes from non-negative to negative, which is not relevant to the problem's requirements.

Given these points, the provided function does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
