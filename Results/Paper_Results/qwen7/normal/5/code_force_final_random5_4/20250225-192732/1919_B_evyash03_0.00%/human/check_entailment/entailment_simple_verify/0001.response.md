### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `expression`.

2. **Splitting the String:**
   - The string `expression` is split into parts using `'-'` as the delimiter. This means `parts` will contain substrings of consecutive `+` characters.
   - The variable `result_length` is set to the sum of the lengths of these parts, which is equivalent to the number of `+` characters in the original string.

3. **Calling `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is called with the string `expression` and `result_length` as arguments.
   - However, the function `func_1` does not use `result_length` at all, which suggests a potential issue.

4. **Function `func_1`:**
   - `func_1` iterates through each character in the string `expression`.
   - It keeps track of the balance, which is incremented for `+` and decremented for `-`.
   - If the balance goes negative, it increments the `count` and resets the balance to zero.
   - Finally, it returns the count plus one if the balance is positive after the loop.

### Correctness Check:

- **Objective:** The goal is to minimize the total penalty by optimally splitting the array `a` into subarrays.
- **Penalty Calculation:** The penalty of a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.
- **Optimal Strategy:** To minimize the penalty, we should try to balance the number of `+` and `-` in each subarray as much as possible.

### Issues in the Given Program:

1. **Incorrect Use of `result_length`:**
   - The variable `result_length` is calculated but not used in the function `func_1`, which is supposed to compute the minimum penalty.

2. **Logic in `func_1`:**
   - The logic in `func_1` seems to be counting the number of segments where the balance goes negative, which is not directly related to minimizing the penalty.
   - The logic does not account for the actual values of `+1` and `-1` in the array `a`.

### Correct Approach:

To solve this problem correctly, we need to:
- Split the array into subarrays such that the sum of each subarray is as close to zero as possible.
- Calculate the penalty for each subarray and sum them up.

Given the complexity of the problem, a more appropriate approach would involve dynamic programming or a greedy strategy to minimize the penalty.

### Conclusion:

The given program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the provided program is:

Correctness: **False**

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
