Postcondition: `a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `x1` is an input integer, `y1` is an input integer, `x2` is the first integer from the input split, `y2` is the second integer from the input split, `x3` is the first integer from the input split, `y3` is the second integer from the input split, `x4` is the third integer from the input split, `y4` is the fourth integer from the input split. If `x1 == x4` and `x3 == x2`, then `res` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1` if `y1 < y2`, otherwise `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2`. If the condition `x1 == x4 and x3 == x2` is not met, then `res` remains unchanged.
