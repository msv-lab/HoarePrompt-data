Output State: The loop will execute `a` times, where `a` is the initial integer input. After all iterations, the variable `res` will hold the result of the last calculation performed within the loop. Specifically, `res` will be the absolute difference between two specific `y` values based on the conditions provided, corresponding to the last set of inputs processed in the loop. The variable `i` will be equal to `a-1` after all iterations, indicating the completion of the loop. All other variables (`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4`) will retain their values from the last iteration of the loop.

In natural language: After the loop completes all its iterations, `res` will contain the final calculated value based on the conditions given for the last set of inputs processed. The variable `i` will be equal to `a-1`, signifying the end of the loop. The values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, and `y4` will reflect the last inputs provided to the loop.
