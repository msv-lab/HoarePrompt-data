Output State: **`a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `x1` is an input integer, `y1` is an input integer, `x2` is the first integer from the input split, `y2` is the second integer from the input split, `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2`, `x3` is the first integer from the input split, `y3` is the second integer from the input split, `x4` is the third integer from the input split, `y4` is the fourth integer from the input split.**

The code calculates the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2` and assigns it to `res`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
