Output State: **`a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `x1` is an input integer, `y1` is an input integer, `x2` is the first integer from the input split, `y2` is the second integer from the input split.**

Explanation: The code `x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())` takes a line of input, splits it into two parts, and converts each part into integers. These integers are then assigned to `x2` and `y2`. The initial values of `a`, `i`, `x1`, and `y1` remain unchanged.
