Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the area of the square for all potential cases. Specifically, the program assumes that the sides of the square are aligned with the x-axis or y-axis and only checks three out of the six possible pairings of points. This means it will fail to correctly identify the side length of the square if the points are not in one of these three configurations.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
-1 1
1 -1
1 1
-1 -1
```
The correct area of the square is 4, but the program will incorrectly calculate the side length as 2 (the distance between -1 and 1 on either axis), leading to an incorrect area of 4. However, since the program does not handle all possible configurations of the square's corners, it is not correct according to the problem description.
