Postcondition: `a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `x1` is an input integer, `y1` is an input integer, `x2` is an input integer, `y2` is an input integer, `x3` is an integer from input, `y3` is an integer from input, `x4` is an integer from input, `y4` is an integer from input, `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2` if `y1` is less than `y2`, otherwise `res` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`.
