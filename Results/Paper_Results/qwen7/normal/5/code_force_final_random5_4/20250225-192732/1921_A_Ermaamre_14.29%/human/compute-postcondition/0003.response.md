Output State: **`a` must be greater than 0; `i` is 0; `x1` is an input integer; `y1` is an input integer; `x2` is the first integer from the input split by space; `y2` is the second integer from the input split by space.**

Explanation: The code `x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input, splits it into two parts by spaces, and converts each part into integers. These integers are then assigned to `x2` and `y2`. The initial values of `a`, `i`, `x1`, and `y1` remain unchanged.
