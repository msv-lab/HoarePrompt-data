Output State: **`a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `x1` is an input integer, `y1` is an input integer, `x2` is the first integer from the input split, `y2` is the second integer from the input split, `x3` is the first integer from the input split, `y3` is the second integer from the input split, `y4` is the fourth integer from the input split; `res` is the absolute difference between `y3` and `y1`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the absolute difference between `y3` and `y1` and assigns it to the variable `res`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
