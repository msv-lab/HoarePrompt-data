Output State: **`a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `x1` is an input integer, `y1` is an input integer, `x2` is an input integer, `y2` is an input integer, `x3`, `y3` are integers entered by the user, `x4`, `y4` are as per the input, `res` is the value calculated based on the conditions given, `x3` is an integer from input, `y3` is an integer from input**.

Explanation: The code `x3, y3 = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the user input and assigns them to `x3` and `y3`. The other variables (`a`, `i`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x4`, `y4`, and `res`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
