Output State: **`a` must be greater than 0; `i` is 0; `x1` is an input integer; `y1` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())` takes a line of input from the user, splits it into two parts, and converts each part into an integer. These integers are then assigned to `x1` and `y1`. The initial conditions for `a` and `i` remain unchanged.
