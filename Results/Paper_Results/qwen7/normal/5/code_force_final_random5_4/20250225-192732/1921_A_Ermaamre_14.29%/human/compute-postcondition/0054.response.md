Output State: **`a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `x1` is an input integer, `y1` is an input integer, `x2` is an input integer, `y2` is an input integer, `x3` is an integer from input, `y3` is an integer from input, `x4` is an integer from input, `y4` is an integer from input, `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2` and assigns it to `res`. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `res` is specifically the absolute value of the difference between `y1` and `y2`.
