You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A square of positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area is located on the
coordinate plane, with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. You are given
the coordinates of its corners, in random order. Your task is to find the area
of the square.

Input

Each test consists of several testcases. The first line contains one integer t
(1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of testcases. The following is a description
of the testcases.

Each testcase contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i
(-1000\le x_i, y_i\le 1000 ), coordinates of the corners of the square.

It is guaranteed that there is a square with sides parallel to the coordinate
axes, with positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area, with corners in given
points.

Output

For each test case, print a single integer, the area of the square.

    #State: Output State: The loop will execute `a` times, where `a` is the initial integer input. After all iterations, the variable `res` will hold the result of the last calculation performed within the loop. Specifically, `res` will be the absolute difference between two specific `y` values based on the conditions provided, corresponding to the last set of inputs processed in the loop. The variable `i` will be equal to `a-1` after all iterations, indicating the completion of the loop. All other variables (`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4`) will retain their values from the last iteration of the loop.
    #
    #In natural language: After the loop completes all its iterations, `res` will contain the final calculated value based on the conditions given for the last set of inputs processed. The variable `i` will be equal to `a-1`, signifying the end of the loop. The values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, and `y4` will reflect the last inputs provided to the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the area of the square for all potential cases. Specifically, the program assumes that the sides of the square are aligned with the x-axis or y-axis and only checks three out of the six possible pairings of points. This means it will fail to correctly identify the side length of the square if the points are not in one of these three configurations.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
-1 1
1 -1
1 1
-1 -1
```
The correct area of the square is 4, but the program will incorrectly calculate the side length as 2 (the distance between -1 and 1 on either axis), leading to an incorrect area of 4. However, since the program does not handle all possible configurations of the square's corners, it is not correct according to the problem description.
