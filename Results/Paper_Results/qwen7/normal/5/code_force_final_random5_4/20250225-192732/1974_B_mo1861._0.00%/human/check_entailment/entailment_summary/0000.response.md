Reasoning:
1. The provided program correctly implements the decoding logic as described in the problem statement.
2. The function `func_1` creates a dictionary `char_map` that maps each unique character in the encoded string `b` to its corresponding character in the original string `s`.
3. The mapping is done by sorting the unique characters of `b` and assigning them positions from the end of the alphabet ('z' to 'a').
4. The function then iterates through each character in `b`, looks up the corresponding character in `char_map`, and constructs the decoded string `s`.

Given the execution summary and the provided function, the program appears to correctly decode the encoded strings. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
