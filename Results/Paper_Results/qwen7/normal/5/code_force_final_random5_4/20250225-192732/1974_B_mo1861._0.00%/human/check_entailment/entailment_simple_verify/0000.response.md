### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the annotated code step-by-step to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- The auxiliary string \( r \) is constructed from the unique characters of the original string \( s \) in alphabetical order.
- Each character in the encoded string \( b \) is replaced by its symmetric counterpart in \( r \).

#### Given Program:
```python
num_test_cases = int(input())
for _ in range(num_test_cases):
    num_chars = int(input())
    b = input()
    print(func_1(b))

def func_1(b):
    char_map = {}
    for (i, c) in enumerate(sorted(set(b))):
        char_map[c] = chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))
    s = ''
    for c in b:
        s += char_map[c]
    return s
```

#### Annotated Code Explanation:
- The function `func_1` constructs a mapping (`char_map`) where each unique character in the encoded string `b` is mapped to a character in reverse alphabetical order.
- The mapping is done by sorting the unique characters of `b` and then assigning the characters from 'a' to 'z' in reverse order.
- The decoding process uses this mapping to replace each character in `b` with its corresponding character from the reverse alphabetical order.

#### Analysis:
1. **Character Mapping**:
   - The program sorts the unique characters of `b` and assigns them to characters from 'a' to 'z' in reverse order. This is incorrect because it does not take into account the order of unique characters in the original string \( s \).
   - For example, if the unique characters in `b` are `['c', 'e', 'f', 'o', 'r', 's']`, the program will map these to `['s', 'r', 'q', 'p', 'o', 'n']` respectively, which is not the correct mapping.

2. **Correct Approach**:
   - To correctly decode, we need to construct the auxiliary string \( r \) from the original string \( s \) in alphabetical order.
   - Then, we need to create a mapping from each character in the encoded string \( b \) to its symmetric counterpart in \( r \).

#### Correct Implementation:
Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(b):
    # Step 1: Construct the auxiliary string r from the original string s
    r = ''.join(sorted(set(b)))
    
    # Step 2: Create a mapping from each character in r to its symmetric counterpart
    char_map = {c: r[len(r) - i - 1] for i, c in enumerate(r)}
    
    # Step 3: Decode the string b using the mapping
    s = ''.join(char_map[c] for c in b)
    return s
```

This implementation correctly constructs the auxiliary string \( r \) and creates the appropriate mapping to decode the string \( b \).

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The given program does not correctly decode the encoded string because it incorrectly sorts the unique characters of the encoded string \( b \) instead of constructing the auxiliary string \( r \) from the original string \( s \).

**Final: False**
