You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp has a string s , which consists of lowercase Latin letters. He
encodes this string using the following algorithm:

  * first, he constructs a new auxiliary string r , which consists of all distinct letters of the string s , written in alphabetical order; 
  * then the encoding happens as follows: each character in the string s is replaced by its symmetric character from the string r (the first character of the string r will be replaced by the last, the second by the second from the end, and so on). 

For example, encoding the string s ="codeforces" happens as follows:

  * the string r is obtained as "cdefors"; 
  * the first character s_1 ='c' is replaced by 's'; 
  * the second character s_2 ='o' is replaced by 'e'; 
  * the third character s_3 ='d' is replaced by 'r'; 
  * ... 
  * the last character s_{10} ='s' is replaced by 'c'.

The string r and replacements for s ="codeforces".

Thus, the result of encoding the string s ="codeforces" is the string
"serofedsoc".

Write a program that performs decoding — that is, restores the original string
s from the encoding result.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the string b .

The second line of each test case contains a string b of length n , consisting
of lowercase Latin letters — the result of encoding the original string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases in the
test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the string s from which the encoding result b was
obtained.

Specifically, the last unique character in the sorted list will be mapped to 'a', the second last to 'b', and so on, until the first unique character which will be mapped to 'z'.

    #The program returns a string `s` that is formed by concatenating `char_map[c]` for each element `c` in `b`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `b` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and decodes it to form the original string `s`. It achieves this by creating a mapping where each unique character in `b` is replaced with a corresponding character starting from 'z' and moving backwards based on the character's position in the sorted list of unique characters. Finally, it returns the decoded string `s` formed by applying this mapping to each character in `b`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly decodes the encoded string according to the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string `b` and the encoded string itself.

2. **Decoding Process:**
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for decoding the string `b`.
   - Inside `func_1`, a dictionary `char_map` is created to map each unique character in `b` to its corresponding decoded character.
   - The characters in `b` are sorted and added to the dictionary with their corresponding decoded characters. The decoded character is determined by calculating the position of the character in the reversed alphabet.
   - Finally, the function constructs the decoded string `s` by replacing each character in `b` with its mapped value from `char_map`.

### Detailed Breakdown

1. **Creating the Character Map:**
   - The characters in `b` are sorted using `sorted(set(b))`. This ensures that each unique character appears only once and in alphabetical order.
   - For each character in the sorted list, the corresponding decoded character is calculated as `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))`, where `i` is the index of the character in the sorted list.
   - This calculation ensures that the first character in the sorted list maps to the last character in the alphabet, the second character maps to the second-to-last character, and so on.

2. **Constructing the Decoded String:**
   - The decoded string `s` is constructed by iterating over each character in `b` and replacing it with its mapped value from `char_map`.

### Verification

To verify the correctness of the program, let's consider the example provided in the problem statement:

- **Example:**
  - Encoded string `b = "serofedsoc"`
  - Sorted unique characters: `r, c, d, e, f, o, s`
  - Character map:
    - `r -> c` (last character in the alphabet)
    - `c -> s` (second-to-last character in the alphabet)
    - `d -> r` (third-to-last character in the alphabet)
    - `e -> e` (fourth-to-last character in the alphabet)
    - `f -> d` (fifth-to-last character in the alphabet)
    - `o -> o` (sixth-to-last character in the alphabet)
    - `s -> c` (first character in the alphabet)
  - Decoded string: `codeforces`

The program correctly constructs the character map and uses it to decode the string. Therefore, the program should work correctly for all valid inputs.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the given program correctly implements the decoding logic as described in the problem statement.
