Reasoning:
The annotated program correctly describes the logic for decoding the string `b` back to the original string `s`. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of the correctness:

1. **Initialization and Mapping Construction**:
   - The function `func_1` initializes an empty dictionary `char_map` to store the mapping of characters.
   - It iterates through the sorted set of unique characters in `b` and maps each character to a corresponding character starting from 'z' and moving backwards based on the character's position in the sorted list. This ensures that the first unique character in the sorted list is mapped to 'z', the second to 'y', and so on, with the last unique character being mapped to 'a'.

2. **Decoding Process**:
   - After constructing the `char_map`, the function iterates through each character `c` in `b` and appends the corresponding mapped character from `char_map` to the string `s`.
   - This process correctly reverses the encoding mechanism described in the problem statement.

3. **Output**:
   - The function returns the decoded string `s`.

Given the problem constraints and the provided example, the function correctly decodes the string `b` to the original string `s`.

Correctness: **True**
