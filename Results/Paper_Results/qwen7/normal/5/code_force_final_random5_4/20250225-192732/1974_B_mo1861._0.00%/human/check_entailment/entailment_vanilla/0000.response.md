Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly decodes the encoded string `b` back to the original string `s`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string `b` and then reads the encoded string `b` itself.

2. **Decoding Logic:**
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for decoding the string `b`.
   - Inside `func_1`, a dictionary `char_map` is created to map each unique character in `b` to its corresponding character in the original string `s`.
   - The characters in `b` are sorted and added to the dictionary with their corresponding positions. Specifically, the character `c` in `b` is mapped to the character at position `len(b) - i - 1` in the alphabetically sorted list of unique characters.
   - This mapping ensures that the first character in the sorted unique characters list is mapped to the last character in the alphabetically sorted list, and so on.
   - Finally, the function constructs the original string `s` by replacing each character in `b` with its corresponding character from the `char_map`.

### Verification

To verify the correctness, let's consider the example provided in the problem statement:

- **Example:**
  - Encoded string `b = "serofedsoc"`
  - The unique characters in `b` are `s, e, r, o, f, d, c`, sorted alphabetically give `cdefors`.
  - The mapping would be:
    - `c -> s`
    - `e -> e`
    - `f -> r`
    - `o -> d`
    - `r -> f`
    - `s -> c`
    - `d -> o`
    - `o -> d`
    - `s -> c`
    - `c -> s`
  - Decoding `b` using these mappings results in `s -> c, e -> e, r -> d, o -> o, f -> r, d -> o, s -> c, o -> d, c -> s`, which gives the original string `s = "codeforces"`.

Given the logic and the example, the program should work correctly for all valid inputs.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the program correctly implements the decoding logic as described in the problem statement.

**Correctness: True**
