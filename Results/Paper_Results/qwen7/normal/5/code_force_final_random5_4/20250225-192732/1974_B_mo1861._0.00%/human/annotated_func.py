    #State: The output state after the loop executes all iterations is as follows: `b` contains a list of unique characters sorted in ascending order, `char_map` is a dictionary where each unique character from `b` is mapped to a unique lowercase letter starting from 'z' and going backwards based on the position of the character in the sorted unique character list. Specifically, the last unique character in the sorted list will be mapped to 'a', the second last to 'b', and so on, until the first unique character which will be mapped to 'z'.

    #The program returns a string `s` that is formed by concatenating `char_map[c]` for each element `c` in `b`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `b` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and decodes it to form the original string `s`. It achieves this by creating a mapping where each unique character in `b` is replaced with a corresponding character starting from 'z' and moving backwards based on the character's position in the sorted list of unique characters. Finally, it returns the decoded string `s` formed by applying this mapping to each character in `b`.
