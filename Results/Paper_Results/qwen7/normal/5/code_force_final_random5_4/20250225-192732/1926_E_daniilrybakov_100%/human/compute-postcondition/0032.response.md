Output State: `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50000, `n` will eventually become 0, `k` is an input integer, `s` is the sum of all `x` values calculated during each iteration until `n` becomes 0, `m` will be \(2^{\text{number of iterations}}\), and `x` is `(n + 1) // 2` at the last iteration. If `s < k` and `k <= s + x` at any point, the loop breaks early.
