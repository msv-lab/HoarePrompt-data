Output State: **`s` is 0 + (n + 1) // 2, `n` is n // 2, `k` is an input integer, `m` is 2, `x` is (n + 1) // 2**

Explanation: The code `n //= 2` divides the value of `n` by 2 and assigns the result back to `n`. The other variables (`s`, `k`, `m`, and `x`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the updated state includes the new value of `n` after the division, while the other variables retain their original values.
