Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understanding the Precondition:**
   - `s` is the sum of \((n + 1) // 2\) for each iteration until the condition `s >= k` or `k > s + x` is met.
   - `n` starts at 0 and is halved in each iteration until it reaches 0.
   - `k` is an input integer.
   - `m` is \(2^i\), where \(i\) is the number of iterations.
   - `x` is \((n + 1) // 2\), which becomes 1 when `n` is 0.
   - The loop exits if `s` becomes greater than or equal to `k`.

2. **Determining the Values:**
   - Since `n` starts at 0 and is halved in each iteration, it will remain 0 after the first iteration because \(0 // 2 = 0\).
   - Therefore, `x` will be \((0 + 1) // 2 = 1\) after the first iteration.
   - The loop will exit immediately because `n` is 0, and thus `s` will be 0 (since no other iterations occur).

3. **Calculating the Expression:**
   - The expression to be evaluated is \((2 * (k - s) - 1) * m\).
   - Given `s = 0`, the expression simplifies to \((2 * (k - 0) - 1) * m = (2 * k - 1) * m\).
   - Since `m` is \(2^i\) and `i` is the number of iterations, and the loop only runs once (because `n` is 0 after the first iteration), `i = 1` and thus `m = 2^1 = 2`.

4. **Final Calculation:**
   - Substituting the values, we get \((2 * k - 1) * 2 = 2 * k - 2\).

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:
Output: **2 * k - 2**
