Output State: **`s` is `x + (n + 1) // 2 + (n + 1) // 2`, `n` is `n // 2`, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`, and `m` is twice its original value.**

Explanation: The code `s += x` increments `s` by the value of `x`. Given the initial state, `s` was `x + (n + 1) // 2`, `n` was `n // 2`, `x` was `(n + 1) // 2`, and `m` was twice its original value. After executing `s += x`, `s` becomes `x + (n + 1) // 2 + (n + 1) // 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.
