Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50000, `n` is now `n // 2`, `k` is an input integer, `s` is `s + (n + 1) // 2 + x`, `m` is 4, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but indicates that the program exits the innermost loop or conditional block. All the initial conditions and variable values remain the same as they were before the `break` statement was executed.
