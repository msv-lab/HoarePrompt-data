Output State: **`s` is `x + (n + 1) // 2`, `n` is `n // 2`, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`, `m` is twice its original value**

Explanation: The code `n //= 2` divides `n` by 2 and assigns the result back to `n`. Since `n` was originally `(n + 1) // 2`, after the operation, `n` becomes `n // 2`. All other variables (`s`, `x`, and `m`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
