Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50000, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `s` is `s + (n + 1) // 2 + x`, `m` is 4, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`**

Explanation: The code `x = (n + 1) // 2` assigns the value of `(n + 1) // 2` to `x`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `s`, or `m`. The initial conditions for `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and the expressions for `s` and `x` are updated accordingly.
