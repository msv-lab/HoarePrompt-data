Output State: **`s` is `x`, `n` is `n // 2 // 2`, and `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`**

Explanation: The code `n //= 2` divides the value of `n` by 2 and assigns the result back to `n`. Since `n` was initially `n // 2`, after this operation, `n` becomes `n // 2 // 2`. The values of `s` and `x` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.
