Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it receives test cases where each test case includes integers t, n, and k. For each test case, if 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4, and given integers n and k such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, the function processes these values and returns a result based on the specified conditions.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing three integers: `t`, `n`, and `k`. It checks if `t` falls within the range 1 to 50000 inclusive. If so, it further processes `n` and `k` to determine and return a specific outcome based on their values, ensuring `n` and `k` also meet the specified constraints.
