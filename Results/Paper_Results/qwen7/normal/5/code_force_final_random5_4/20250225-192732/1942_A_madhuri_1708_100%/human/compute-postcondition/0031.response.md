Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases where each test case includes integers t, n, and k. For each test case, t is an integer between 1 and 10^3 inclusive, and n and k are integers between 1 and 10^3 inclusive with the condition that 1 ≤ k ≤ n. The function returns a result based on the values of n and k for each test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle a series of test cases, each containing three integers (t, n, k), and for each test case, it processes n and k to produce a result, although the specific result is not detailed in the given information.
