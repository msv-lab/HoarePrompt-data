Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is the integer value of the first split element from the input string `s`, `k` is the integer value of the second split element from the input string `s`.**

The code splits the string `s` by spaces and maps each element to an integer, assigning the first element to `n` and the second element to `k`. The value of `t` remains unchanged.
