Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is the first integer from the input split by spaces, `k` is the second integer from the input split by spaces, and the loop will continue to execute as long as there are lines left in the input file (or standard input) beyond the first line.**

This postcondition remains the same for both the if and else parts since the program fragment does not change the values of `t`, `n`, or `k`, nor does it alter the loop condition. Therefore, the postcondition is identical to the precondition.
