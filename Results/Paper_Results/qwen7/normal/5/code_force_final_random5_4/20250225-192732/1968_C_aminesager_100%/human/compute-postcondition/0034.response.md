Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `while t:`. This means the loop will continue as long as the variable `t` is truthy (i.e., non-zero).

2. **Determine the Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variable mentioned in the loop head is `t`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is `n-1`
   - `n` must be greater than 1
   - `a` is a list with `n` elements where each element `a[j]` (for `j` from 0 to `n-1`) is equal to the sum of the first `j+1` elements of `T` plus `a[0] + T[0]`
   - `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since the loop condition depends solely on `t`, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be truthy (non-zero).

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list with `n` elements where each element `a[j]` (for `j` from 0 to `n-1`) is equal to the sum of the first `j+1` elements of `T` plus `a[0] + T[0]`, and `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces, and `t` must be truthy (non-zero)**
