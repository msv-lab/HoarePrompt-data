Output State: **`i` is 1; `n` must be greater than 1; `a` contains an element equal to `a[0] + T[0]`**.

Explanation: The code `a.append(a[i - 1] + T[i - 1])` appends to list `a` the value of `a[i - 1] + T[i - 1]`. Given that `i` is 1, this translates to appending `a[0] + T[0]` to `a`. The conditions and values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
