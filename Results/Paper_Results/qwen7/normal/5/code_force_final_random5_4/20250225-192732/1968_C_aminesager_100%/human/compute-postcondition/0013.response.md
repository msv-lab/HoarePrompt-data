Output State: **`a` now contains the new element `a[i - 1] + T[i - 1]`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than 1**

Explanation: The code appends to list `a` the value of `a[i - 1] + T[i - 1]`. This means the latest element added to `a` is the sum of the previous element in `a` (at index `i - 1`) and the corresponding element in list `T` (also at index `i - 1`). The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and the condition that `n` must be greater than 1 remains unchanged.
