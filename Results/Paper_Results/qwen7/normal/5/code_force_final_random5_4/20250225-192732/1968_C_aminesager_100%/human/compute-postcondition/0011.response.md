Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1`. This means the loop continues as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` now contains the new element `a[i - 1] + T[i - 1]`.
   - `i` is `i + 1`.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.

4. **Determine the changes needed for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than `i + 1`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - The value of `a` does not change within the loop itself; it only gets updated based on the current `i` and `T[i - 1]`. Therefore, the state of `a` remains the same.
   - The value of `i` increases by 1.
   - `n` must remain greater than `i + 1` for the loop to continue.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `a` now contains the new element `a[i - 1] + T[i - 1]`, `i` is `i + 2`, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`**
