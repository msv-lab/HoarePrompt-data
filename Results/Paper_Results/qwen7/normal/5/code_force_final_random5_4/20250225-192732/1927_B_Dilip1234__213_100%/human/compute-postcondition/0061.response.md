Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `a` is a list of integers, `char_count[j]` is incremented by 1, `s` is a string that now includes the character corresponding to `j` in the alphabet.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or a block of code prematurely. In this case, since it is the only line of code, it simply exits the current loop or block without changing the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, `j`, `a`, `char_count[j]`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial states.
