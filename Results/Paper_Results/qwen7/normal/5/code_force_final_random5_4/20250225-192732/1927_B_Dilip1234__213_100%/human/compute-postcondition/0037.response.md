Output State: **`j` is 2; `s` is 'c'**

Explanation: The variable `j` is initially set to 2. The code `s += chr(j + ord('a'))` appends to `s` the character whose ASCII value is `j + ord('a')`. Since `ord('a')` is 97, `j + ord('a')` equals 99, which corresponds to the character 'c'. Therefore, `s` is updated to 'c'. The value of `j` remains unchanged.
