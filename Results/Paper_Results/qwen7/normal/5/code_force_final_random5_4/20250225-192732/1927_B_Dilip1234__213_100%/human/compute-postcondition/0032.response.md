Output State: **`j` is 2; `s` is 'b'; `char_count`['b'] is 1**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `char_count['b']` by 1. Initially, `char_count['b']` is assumed to be 0 (since it's not specified otherwise). After executing `char_count[j] += 1`, `char_count['b']` becomes 1. The values of `j` and `s` remain unchanged.
