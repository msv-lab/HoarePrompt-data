Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than `n`
Code of the loop:
for j in range(26):
    if char_count[j] == a[i]:
        s += chr(j + ord('a'))
        char_count[j] += 1
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `j` is an index, `a` is a list of integers, `char_count[j]` is equal to `a[i] + 1`, `s` is a string that now includes the character corresponding to `j` in the alphabet. This is because either `char_count[j]` equals `a[i] + 1` and the character corresponding to `j` is added to `s`, or the condition is not met and `s` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `a` is a list of integers, `char_count[j]` is equal to `a[i] + 2` if the condition `char_count[j] == a[i]` is met, `s` is a string that now includes the character corresponding to `j` in the alphabet, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not met, the values of `i`, `n`, `j`, `a`, `char_count`, and `s` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `a` is a list of integers, `char_count[j]` is either incremented by 1 or remains equal to `a[i] + 2` if the condition `char_count[j] == a[i]` is met, `s` is a string that now includes the character corresponding to `j` in the alphabet.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
