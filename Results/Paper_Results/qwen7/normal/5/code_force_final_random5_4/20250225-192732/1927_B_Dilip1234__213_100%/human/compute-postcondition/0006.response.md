Output State: **`char_count[j]` equals `a[i] + 1`; `s` is a string containing the character corresponding to the index `j` in the alphabet.**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `char_count[j]` by 1. Since `char_count[j]` was initially equal to `a[i]`, after the increment, its new value is `a[i] + 1`. The value of `s` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
