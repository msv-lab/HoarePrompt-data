Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `j` which is used in the `range(26)` function.

2. **Determine the initial state of `j`**: The loop starts with `j` being 0 because `range(26)` generates numbers from 0 to 25.

3. **Check if the loop can execute**: The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than 26. Since `j` starts at 0, the loop will definitely execute at least once.

4. **Adjust the states**: We need to ensure that the loop can start and execute. Given that `j` starts at 0 and the loop will continue as long as `j` is less than 26, we don't need to adjust any other variables or lists.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `j`, which should be set to 0 to start the loop.

**Final State:**
State: **`j` is 0**
