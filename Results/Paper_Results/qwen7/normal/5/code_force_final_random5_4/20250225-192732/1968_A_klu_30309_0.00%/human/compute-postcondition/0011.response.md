Output State: **The program returns the value of y which is one less than the initial value of x**

This is because the initial state defines `y` as `y - 1`. So if the initial value of `y` was derived from `x`, then `y` would be `x - 1`. The code simply returns the current value of `y`, which is one less than the initial value of `x`.
