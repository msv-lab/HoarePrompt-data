Output State: **`x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, and the value of `x` is divisible by `y`, and 2 * `y` is less than `x`; `max_val` is `y`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `y` to `max_val`. Since `x` is divisible by `y` and 2 * `y` is less than `x`, these conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, `max_val` is set to `y`, and the other conditions about `x` and `y` are still valid.
