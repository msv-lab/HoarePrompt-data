Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, we need to verify if the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Let's break down the logic and check if it aligns with the requirements:

1. **Objective**: The goal is to find an integer \( y \) such that \( 1 \le y < x \) and \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized.

2. **Function Logic**:
   - The function iterates over all possible values of \( y \) from \( x - 1 \) down to 2.
   - It checks if \( x \) is divisible by \( y \) using the condition `x % y == 0`.
   - If \( x \) is divisible by \( y \) and \( 2 * y \ge x \), it immediately returns \( y \).
   - If no such \( y \) is found, it returns \( x - 1 \).

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If \( x \) is prime, the only \( y \) that divides \( x \) is 1, and \( 2 * 1 = 2 < x \), so the function will return \( x - 1 \).
   - If \( x \) is not prime, the function will find the largest divisor \( y \) such that \( 2 * y \ge x \), and return that \( y \).

4. **Output Validation**:
   - The provided examples in the execution summary match the expected behavior of the function. For instance:
     - For \( x = 10 \), the largest divisor \( y \) such that \( 2 * y \ge 10 \) is \( 5 \), and \( \gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 10 \).
     - For \( x = 21 \), the largest divisor \( y \) such that \( 2 * y \ge 21 \) is \( 18 \), and \( \gcd(21, 18) + 18 = 27 \).

Given this analysis, the function correctly implements the logic to find the value of \( y \) that maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
