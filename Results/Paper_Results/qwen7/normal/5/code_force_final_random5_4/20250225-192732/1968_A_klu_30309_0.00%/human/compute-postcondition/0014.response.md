Output State: **`max_val` is `y - 1`, `x` is an integer, and `y` is `y - 1`**.

Explanation: The code `max_val = y` assigns the current value of `y` to `max_val`. Since `y` is already `y - 1`, `max_val` now holds this value. The other variables (`x` and `y`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
