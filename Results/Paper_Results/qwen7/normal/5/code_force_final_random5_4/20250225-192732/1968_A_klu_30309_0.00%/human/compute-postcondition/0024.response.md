Output State: **x is an integer, y is 1, and max_val remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The loop iterates from `x-1` down to 2. After the loop completes all iterations, `y` will be 1 because the loop decrements `y` each time and stops when `y` reaches 1. Since the loop does not modify `x` or `max_val` unless it finds a divisor of `x` that satisfies certain conditions (which do not change the final values of `x` and `max_val`), these variables retain their initial values. Therefore, after all iterations of the loop, `x` remains the same integer within the range [2, 1000], `y` is 1, and `max_val` remains unchanged.
