Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable here is `t`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `t`**: According to the problem statement, `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

3. **Check the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is a positive integer, it will always be greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the State**: We need to ensure that `t` is within its valid range for the loop to execute. Given that `t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\), we need to confirm that `t` is indeed a positive integer within this range.

5. **Final State Adjustment**: The initial state of `t` being a positive integer within the specified range ensures that the loop can execute. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect this condition.

**State:**
**`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**

This ensures that the loop can execute as required.
