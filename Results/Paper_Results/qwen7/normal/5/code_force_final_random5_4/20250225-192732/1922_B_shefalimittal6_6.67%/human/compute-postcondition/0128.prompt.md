Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `nums` is a non-empty list of integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where the key is an integer from `nums` and the value is the count of occurrences of that integer, with each integer's count being incremented by 1 for every occurrence in the list `nums`, `res` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for cnt in num_of_lens.values():
    if cnt >= 3:
        res += math.comb(cnt, 3)
    if cnt >= 2:
        total_sum = sum(i for i in num_of_lens.values() if i != cnt)
        res += math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `nums` is a non-empty list of integers, `num_of_lens` remains unchanged, and `res` is updated as follows: if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, then `res` is the original value of `res` plus the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt` multiplied by `math.comb(cnt, 2)`. If `cnt` is less than 2, then `res` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `nums` remains a non-empty list of integers, `num_of_lens` remains unchanged, and `res` is updated as follows: if `cnt >= 2`, then `res` is updated to its original value plus `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`; otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `nums` remains a non-empty list of integers, `num_of_lens` remains unchanged, `cnt` is set to the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`, and `res` is increased by either `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, or `math.comb(cnt, 3)` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
