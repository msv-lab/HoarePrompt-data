Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary, res is the sum of the combinatorial sums based on the counts of integers in nums, t is decremented by 1, n is an input integer, nums is a list of integers entered by the user.
Code of the loop:
for x in nums:
    num_of_lens[x] = num_of_lens.get(x, 0) + 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `nums` is a non-empty list of integers; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where the key is an integer from `nums` and the value is the count of occurrences of that integer, updated by incrementing the count of the integer `x` by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `nums` is a non-empty list of integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where the key is an integer from `nums` and the value is the count of occurrences of that integer, and `x` is the next element in the list `nums`; the count of `x` in `num_of_lens` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `nums` is a non-empty list of integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where the key is an integer from `nums` and the value is the count of occurrences of that integer, and `x` is the next element in the list `nums`; the count of `x` in `num_of_lens` is incremented by 1




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
