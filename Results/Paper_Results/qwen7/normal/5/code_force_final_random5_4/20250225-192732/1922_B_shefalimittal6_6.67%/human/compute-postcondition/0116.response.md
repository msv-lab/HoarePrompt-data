Output State: **`nums` remains a non-empty list of integers, `num_of_lens` remains unchanged, `res` is unchanged, and `total_sum` is the sum of values in `num_of_lens` where each value is not equal to `cnt`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `total_sum` as the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except those that are equal to `cnt`. However, none of the variables `nums`, `num_of_lens`, or `res` are affected by this calculation. Therefore, they remain in their initial states.
