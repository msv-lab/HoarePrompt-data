Postcondition: `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`, `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` except the current `cnt`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is increased by `math.comb(cnt, 3)`. Otherwise, the values of `cnt` and `total_sum` remain unchanged.
