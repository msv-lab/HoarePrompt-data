Output State: The final value of `res` will be the sum of all `math.comb(cnt, 3)` for each `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()` that is greater than or equal to 3, plus the sum of all `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` for each `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()` that is greater than or equal to 2 but less than 3, where `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` except the current `cnt`.

In simpler terms, `res` will accumulate the combinations of counts of each number in the dictionary `num_of_lens` based on the conditions specified in the loop. Specifically, it will add the combination of choosing 3 items from each count that has 3 or more occurrences, and the combination of choosing 2 items from each count that has 2 or 3 occurrences multiplied by the sum of all other counts.
