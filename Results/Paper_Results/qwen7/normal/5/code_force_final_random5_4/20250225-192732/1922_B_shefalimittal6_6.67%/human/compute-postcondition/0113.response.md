Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over `cnt` using `for cnt in num_of_lens.values()`.
   - The variables in the loop head are `cnt`.

2. **Understand the Postcondition:**
   - `nums` is a non-empty list of integers (this does not change within the loop).
   - `num_of_lens` remains unchanged (this does not change within the loop).
   - `res` is updated based on the value of `cnt`:
     - If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is updated to include the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt` multiplied by `math.comb(cnt, 2)`.
     - If `cnt` is less than 2, `res` remains unchanged.

3. **Determine the State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `cnt` is the only variable changing within the loop, we need to consider how it changes from one iteration to the next.
   - The loop will iterate through each value in `num_of_lens.values()` sequentially.
   - After each iteration, `cnt` will take on the next value in the sequence of `num_of_lens.values()`.

4. **Adjust the State:**
   - At the start of the next iteration, `cnt` will be the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`.
   - `nums` and `num_of_lens` remain unchanged.
   - `res` will be updated based on the current value of `cnt`.

Given the postcondition, let's assume the current value of `cnt` is `cnt_current`. For the next iteration, `cnt` will be the next value, say `cnt_next`.

- If `cnt_current >= 2`, `res` is updated.
- If `cnt_current < 2`, `res` remains unchanged.

For the next iteration, `cnt` will be `cnt_next`, and we need to determine if `cnt_next` is greater than or equal to 2 or less than 2.

Since we don't know the exact value of `cnt_next`, we can generalize the state as follows:

- `nums` remains a non-empty list of integers.
- `num_of_lens` remains unchanged.
- `res` will be updated based on the new value of `cnt_next`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`nums` is a non-empty list of integers, `num_of_lens` remains unchanged, and `res` is updated as follows: if `cnt_next` is greater than or equal to 2, then `res` is the original value of `res` plus the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt_next` multiplied by `math.comb(cnt_next, 2)`. If `cnt_next` is less than 2, then `res` remains unchanged.**
