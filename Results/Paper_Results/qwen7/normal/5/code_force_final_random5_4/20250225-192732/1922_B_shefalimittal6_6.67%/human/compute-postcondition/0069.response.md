Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `num_of_lens` contains at least one key-value pair.
- `res` is increased by either `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` (if `cnt` >= 2) or `math.com_of(cnt, 3)` (if `cnt` < 2).
- `total_sum` remains the sum of values in `num_of_lens.values()` excluding those equal to `cnt`.

### Loop Head
The loop iterates over `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()`.

### Analysis
- The loop variable `cnt` is taken from `num_of_lens.values()`.
- The loop body is omitted, but it affects the values of `res` and `total_sum` based on the value of `cnt`.

### Adjusting States for the Next Iteration
- Since the loop is iterating over `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()`, the only variables that can be adjusted are `cnt`, `res`, and `total_sum`.
- The condition for the loop to continue is that there must be at least one key-value pair left in `num_of_lens`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment
1. **Remove the current `cnt` from `num_of_lens`:**
   - After processing the current `cnt`, it is removed from `num_of_lens`.
2. **Update `res`:**
   - Depending on the value of `cnt`, `res` is updated accordingly.
3. **Update `total_sum`:**
   - `total_sum` remains the sum of values in `num_of_lens.values()` excluding those equal to `cnt`.

### New State
- `num_of_lens` now contains at least one key-value pair (since at least one key-value pair was removed).
- `res` is updated based on the current `cnt`.
- `total_sum` is updated to exclude the current `cnt`.

### Final Answer
State: **`num_of_lens` contains at least one key-value pair, `res` is increased by either `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` (if `cnt` >= 2) or `math.comb(cnt, 3)` (if `cnt` < 2), and `total_sum` remains the sum of values in `num_of_lens.values()` excluding those equal to `cnt`, and `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`**.

To clearly present this:

State: **`num_of_lens` contains at least one key-value pair, `res` is increased by either `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` (if `cnt` >= 2) or `math.comb(cnt, 3)` (if `cnt` < 2), and `total_sum` remains the sum of values in `num_of_lens.values()` excluding those equal to `cnt`, and `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`**.
