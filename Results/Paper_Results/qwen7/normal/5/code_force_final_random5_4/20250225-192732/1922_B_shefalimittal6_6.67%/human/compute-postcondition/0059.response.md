Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `cnt`, which iterates over the values of `num_of_lens`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `cnt`**: Since `cnt` is iterating over the values of `num_of_lens`, it means that `num_of_lens` must have at least one value for the loop to start executing.

3. **Adjust the state of `num_of_lens`**: For the loop to execute, `num_of_lens` must contain at least one key-value pair. This ensures that there is at least one value (`cnt`) to iterate over.

4. **Consider other variables**: The variables `res` and `x` are not part of the loop head and do not affect whether the loop can execute. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted.

Based on this reasoning, the state that needs to be adjusted is `num_of_lens` must contain at least one key-value pair.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`num_of_lens` must contain at least one key-value pair**
