Output State: `nums` is a non-empty list of integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where the key is each unique integer from `nums` and the value is the total count of occurrences of that integer across the entire list `nums`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `num_of_lens` will contain the frequency count of each integer present in the list `nums`. The loop iterates over every element in `nums`, updating the count of each integer in the `num_of_lens` dictionary. By the end of the loop, `num_of_lens` will reflect the final counts of all integers in `nums`.
