Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variable `cnt`, which iterates over the values of the dictionary `num_of_lens`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as there are values in `num_of_lens.values()`. This means that the loop will run for each unique integer in `nums` and its corresponding count.

3. **Adjust the states**: We need to ensure that the loop can execute by adjusting the states of the objects involved in the loop head. Specifically, we need to ensure that `num_of_lens` has at least one value.

Given the initial state:
- `nums` is a non-empty list of integers.
- `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where the key is an integer from `nums` and the value is the count of occurrences of that integer.
- `res` is 0.

Since the loop depends on `num_of_lens.values()`, we need to ensure that `num_of_lens` is not empty. Given that `nums` is a non-empty list, `num_of_lens` will always contain at least one entry because each integer in `nums` will contribute to the dictionary.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is ensuring that `num_of_lens` is not empty, which is guaranteed by the non-empty `nums` list.

State: **`nums` is a non-empty list of integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one entry, `res` is 0**
