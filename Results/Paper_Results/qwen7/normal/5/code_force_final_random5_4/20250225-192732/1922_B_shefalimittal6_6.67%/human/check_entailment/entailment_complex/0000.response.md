Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires calculating the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks out of given \( n \) sticks such that they can form a non-degenerate triangle. A non-degenerate triangle must satisfy the triangle inequality theorem, which means for any three sides \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) (where \( a \leq b \leq c \)), the condition \( a + b > c \) must hold.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and the list of integers \( a \).
   - It uses a dictionary `num_of_lens` to count the frequency of each integer in the list.
   - The logic to calculate the number of valid triangles is flawed. Specifically, the code does not check the triangle inequality theorem. Instead, it simply counts combinations based on the frequency of each integer.

3. **Flaws in the Code**:
   - The code does not verify if the chosen three sticks can form a triangle. It only checks the frequency of each integer and calculates combinations without ensuring the triangle inequality holds.
   - The formula used (`math.comb(cnt, 3)` and `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`) does not account for the necessary condition that the sum of the two smaller sides must be greater than the largest side.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Given the above analysis, the provided code is incorrect because it does not implement the necessary logic to ensure the triangle inequality theorem is satisfied.

Correctness: **False**
