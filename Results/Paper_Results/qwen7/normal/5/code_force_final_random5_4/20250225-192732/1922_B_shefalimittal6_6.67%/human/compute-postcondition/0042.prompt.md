Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the original `nums` list and its corresponding value is the count of how many times that integer appears in the list `nums`, `res` is 0
Code of the loop:
for cnt in num_of_lens.values():
    if cnt >= 3:
        res += math.comb(cnt, 3)
    if cnt >= 2:
        total_sum = sum(i for i in num_of_lens.values() if i != cnt)
        res += math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `cnt` is an integer, if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, then `res` is updated to `res + math.comb(cnt, 3) + math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2 but less than 3, `res` remains unchanged. Here, `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` except `cnt`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`, `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` except the current `cnt`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is increased by either `math.comb(cnt, 3)` or `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`, depending on whether `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`, `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` except the current `cnt`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is increased by either `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` or `math.comb(cnt, 3)`, depending on whether `cnt` is at least 3. Otherwise, the values of `cnt` and `total_sum` remain unchanged, and `res` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
