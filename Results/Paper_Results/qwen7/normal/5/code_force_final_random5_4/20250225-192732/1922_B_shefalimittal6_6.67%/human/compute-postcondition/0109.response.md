Output State: **`nums` is a non-empty list of integers, `num_of_lens` remains unchanged, `res` is the original value of `res` plus the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`, and `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the sum of all values in the dictionary `num_of_lens` except for the value associated with the key `cnt`. This sum is stored in the variable `total_sum`. The other variables (`nums`, `num_of_lens`, and `res`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
