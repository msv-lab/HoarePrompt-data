Output State: **`cnt` is an integer greater than or equal to 3; `res` is `res + math.comb(cnt, 3)`**

Explanation: The variable `res` is updated by adding the value of `math.comb(cnt, 3)` to its current value. Since `cnt` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `math.comb(cnt, 3)` calculates the number of ways to choose 3 items from `cnt` items. However, the exact numerical value of `res` cannot be determined without knowing the initial value of `res`. Therefore, the output state is that `cnt` remains unchanged and `res` is updated to include the combinatorial value.
