Based on the initial state provided, the variable `res` is calculated as follows:

1. For each `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()` that is greater than or equal to 3, add `math.comb(cnt, 3)` to `res`.
2. For each `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()` that is greater than or equal to 2 but less than 3, add `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` to `res`, where `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` except the current `cnt`.

The `print(res)` statement will print the final value of `res` after performing these calculations.

Output: **res (where res is the sum of all math.comb(cnt, 3) for each cnt in num_of_lens.values() that is greater than or equal to 3, plus the sum of all math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum for each cnt in num_of_lens.values() that is greater than or equal to 2 but less than 3, with total_sum being the sum of all values in num_of_lens.values() except the current cnt)**
