Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and their lengths.
   
2. **Counting Stick Lengths**:
   - It uses a dictionary `num_of_lens` to count the occurrences of each stick length.
   - This is done by iterating through the list of stick lengths and updating the counts.

3. **Calculating Combinations**:
   - The program iterates through the values in `num_of_lens` to calculate the number of ways to form triangles.
   - If there are at least 3 sticks of the same length, it calculates the number of ways to choose 3 out of these sticks using `math.comb(cnt, 3)`.
   - If there are at least 2 sticks of the same length, it calculates the number of ways to choose 2 out of these sticks and multiplies by the total number of other sticks (`total_sum`) using `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`.

4. **Combination Function**:
   - The `math.comb` function is used to compute combinations, which is correct for calculating the number of ways to choose sticks.

### Issues Identified

1. **Triangle Inequality Check Missing**:
   - The program does not check if the chosen sticks satisfy the triangle inequality (i.e., the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side).
   - For example, if we have sticks of lengths \(2^1, 2^1, 2^2\), the program would incorrectly count this as a valid triangle because it only checks the combination counts without verifying the triangle inequality.

2. **Incorrect Calculation for Different Lengths**:
   - The program assumes that any combination of sticks of different lengths can form a triangle, which is not true. For instance, if we have sticks of lengths \(2^1, 2^2, 2^3\), no combination of these sticks can form a triangle.

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly solve the problem as stated. It fails to account for the triangle inequality condition, which is essential for determining whether a set of sticks can form a non-degenerate triangle.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
