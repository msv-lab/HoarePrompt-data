Output State: **`nums` remains a non-empty list of integers, `num_of_lens` remains unchanged, `cnt` is set to the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`, and `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` except `cnt` if `cnt` is not equal to the current value being iterated over.**

This means that `total_sum` is calculated as the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` excluding the current value of `cnt` if they are not equal. All other variables remain in their initial state or as described in the precondition.
