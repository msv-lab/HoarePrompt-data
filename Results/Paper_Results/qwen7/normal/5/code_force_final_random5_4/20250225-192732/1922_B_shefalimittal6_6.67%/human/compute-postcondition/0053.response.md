Output State: **`num_of_lens[x]` is 2, `nums` is a list of integers entered by the user, `x` is the first element of `nums`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `num_of_lens[x]` by adding 1 to its current value (which is initially 1). Therefore, `num_of_lens[x]` becomes 2. The other variables (`nums` and `x`) remain unchanged.
