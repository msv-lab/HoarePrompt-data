Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the conversion of times starting with '12'. Specifically, it fails to distinguish between '12:00 AM' and '12:00 PM'. According to the problem description:

- '12:00' should be converted to '12:00 AM'.
- Any other '12' followed by a colon and minutes should be converted to '12:XX PM'.

However, the program treats all '12' as '12:XX PM', which is incorrect. For example, the input '12:00' should output '12:00 AM', but the program outputs '12:00 PM'. This is a clear case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description.
