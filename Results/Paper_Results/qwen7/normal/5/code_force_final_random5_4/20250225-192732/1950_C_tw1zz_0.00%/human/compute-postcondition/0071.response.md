Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `h` is a string representing the hour part of the time and is equal to '12', `m` is a string representing the minute part of the time, `h1` is equal to '12', `m1` is equal to `m`, and `time` is an empty string.**

The code `h1 = '12'` updates the value of `h1` to be exactly '12'. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
