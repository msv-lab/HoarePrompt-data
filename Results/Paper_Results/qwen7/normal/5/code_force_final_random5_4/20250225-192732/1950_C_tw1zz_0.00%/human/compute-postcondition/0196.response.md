Output State: **`user_input` is `user_input - 1`, `h` is a string from the input split by ':', `m` is a string from the input split by ':', `h1` is an empty string, `m1` is equal to `m`**.

This means that the variable `h1` has been initialized to an empty string (`''`), and `m1` has been assigned the value of `m`. The values of `user_input`, `h`, and `m` remain unchanged from their initial state.
