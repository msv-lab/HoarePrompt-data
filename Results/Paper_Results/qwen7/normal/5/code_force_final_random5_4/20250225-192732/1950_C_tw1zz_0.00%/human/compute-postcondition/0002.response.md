Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `h` is a string representing the hour part of the time, `m` is a string representing the minute part of the time, `h1` is an empty string, `m1` is equal to `m`.**

Explanation: The code assigns an empty string to `h1` and assigns the value of `m` to `m1`. The values of `t` and `h` remain unchanged.
