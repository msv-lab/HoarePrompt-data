Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `h` is '11', `m` is a string representing the minute part of the time, `h1` is '11', `m1` is equal to `m`, `time` is 'AM', and `h` is not equal to '10'.**

The code assigns the string `'AM'` to the variable `time`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
