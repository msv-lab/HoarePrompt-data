Output State: **`user_input` is `user_input - 1`, `h` is a string from the input split by ':', `m` is a string from the input split by ':'**

Explanation: The variable `user_input` is decremented by 1. The code then takes user input, splits it by the colon `:`, and assigns the resulting strings to `h` and `m`. The original value of `user_input` is updated to `user_input - 1`, and `h` and `m` are set to the respective parts of the input string.
