Output State: **`user_input` is `user_input - 1`, `h` is a string from the input split by ':', `m` is a string from the input split by ':', `h1` is '11', `m1` is equal to `m`, `time` is 'AM'**.

Explanation: The code simply assigns the string `'AM'` to the variable `time`. No other variables are affected. The initial values of `user_input`, `h`, `m`, `h1`, and `m1` remain unchanged.
