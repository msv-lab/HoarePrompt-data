Output State: **`h` is a string representing the hour part of the input, `m` is a string representing the minute part of the input**.

The code splits the input string at the colon (`:`) and assigns the parts to `h` and `m`. Since the input is split, `h` and `m` now hold the hour and minute parts as strings. The initial state of other variables remains unchanged.
