Output State: **`user_input` is `user_input - 1`, `h1` is '03', `m1` is equal to `m`, `time` is 'AM', `h` is a string from the input split by ':'**

The code simply assigns the string `'AM'` to the variable `time`. No other variables are affected, so their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
