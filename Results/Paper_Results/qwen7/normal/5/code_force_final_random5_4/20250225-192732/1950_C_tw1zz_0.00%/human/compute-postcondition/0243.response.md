Output State: **`user_input` is `user_input - 1`, `h` is a string from the input split by ':', `m` is a string from the input split by ':', `h1` is '11', `m1` is equal to `m`, `time` is 'PM'**.

Explanation: The line `time = 'PM'` assigns the string `'PM'` to the variable `time`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `user_input`, `h`, `m`, `h1`, and `m1` remain unchanged from their initial states.
