Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `h` is a string representing the hour part of the time, `m` is a string representing the minute part of the time.**

Explanation: The code splits the input string (which is expected to be in the format "hh:mm") into two parts using the colon as a delimiter. These parts are then assigned to the variables `h` and `m`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
