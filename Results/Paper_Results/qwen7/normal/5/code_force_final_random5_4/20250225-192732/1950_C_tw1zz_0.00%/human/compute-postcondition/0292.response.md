Based on the initial state provided:

- `user_input` is decremented by 1, but its specific value is not given.
- `h1` is either '01', '02', or a string from '03' to '13'.
- `m1` is equal to `m`, where `m` is not explicitly defined but is assumed to be a valid minute value (00-59).
- `time` is either 'AM' or 'PM'.

The `print` statement formats and prints these variables with a colon between `h1` and `m1`, and a space between `m1` and `time`.

Since the exact value of `m` and `user_input` is not specified, we can only describe the format and the range of possible values for `h1`.

Output: **h1 (either '01', '02', ..., '13'), ':', m (a valid minute value from '00' to '59'), ' ', time (either 'AM' or 'PM')**
