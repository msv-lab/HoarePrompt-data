You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

    #State: Output State: All inputs to the loop have been processed, and for each input, the output is a string in the format "h1:mm AM/PM". Here, `h1` is the adjusted hour part of the input time, `mm` is the original minute part of the time, and `AM/PM` is determined based on the value of `h1`. Specifically:
    #
    #- If `h1` is '01', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', or '09', the time is in the AM period.
    #- If `h1` is '10', '11', or '12', the time is in the PM period.
    #
    #The variable `t` has been decremented to zero after all iterations of the loop have completed. The variables `h`, `m`, `h1`, `m1`, and `time` reflect the final processed input from the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1440) and a string `s` in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format. It returns "Morning" if the time is between 06:00 and 11:59, "Afternoon" if the time is between 12:00 and 17:59, "Evening" if the time is between 18:00 and 21:59, and "Night" if the time is between 22:00 and 05:59.
