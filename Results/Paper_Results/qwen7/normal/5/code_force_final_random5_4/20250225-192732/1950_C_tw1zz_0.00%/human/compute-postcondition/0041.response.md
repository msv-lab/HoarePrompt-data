Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `h` is a string representing the hour part of the time and is equal to '07', `m` is a string representing the minute part of the time, `h1` is equal to '07', `m1` is equal to `m`, `time` is an empty string.**

The code `h1 = '07'` assigns the string `'07'` to the variable `h1`. Since `h` was initially set to `'07'`, this assignment does not change its value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
