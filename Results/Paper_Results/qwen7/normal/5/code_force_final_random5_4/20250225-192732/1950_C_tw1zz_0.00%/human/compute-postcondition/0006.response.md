Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `h` is '01', `m` is a string representing the minute part of the time, `h1` is '01', `m1` is equal to `m`, `time` is 'AM', the current value of `h` is '01'**.

Explanation: The code assigns the string `'AM'` to the variable `time`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes the new value of `time` as `'AM'`, while the other variables retain their original values.
