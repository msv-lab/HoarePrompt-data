Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `h` is '14', `m` is a string representing the minute part of the time, `h1` is '02', `m1` is equal to `m`, `time` is 'PM'.**

Explanation: The code assigns the string `'PM'` to the variable `time`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `h`, `m`, `h1`, `m1`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
