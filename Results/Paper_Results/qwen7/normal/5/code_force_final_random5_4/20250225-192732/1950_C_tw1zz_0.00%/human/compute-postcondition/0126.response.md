Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `h` is '21', `m` is a string representing the minute part of the time, `h1` is '09', `m1` is equal to `m`, `time` is 'PM'.**

Explanation: The code assigns the string `'PM'` to the variable `time`. The values of `t`, `h`, `m`, `h1`, and `m1` remain unchanged from their initial states.
