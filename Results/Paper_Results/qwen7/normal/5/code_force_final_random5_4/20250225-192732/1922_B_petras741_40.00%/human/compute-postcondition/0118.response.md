Output State: **`n` is 1 or 2, `j` is `n + 2`, `res` is the original value of `res` plus `q[eta[n]] * (q[eta[n]] - 1) * (q[eta[n]] - 2) // 6` plus `2 * q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6` plus `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho`, `rho` is increased by `6 * q[eta[j]]`, `eta_ln` is unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The variable `res` is updated by adding `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6` to its current value. Since `j` is `n + 2`, this term is added twice.
- The variable `rho` is increased by `3 * q[eta[j]]`, and since `j` is `n + 2`, `rho` is increased by `6 * q[eta[j]]`.
- All other variables (`n`, `j`, `eta_ln`) remain unchanged.
