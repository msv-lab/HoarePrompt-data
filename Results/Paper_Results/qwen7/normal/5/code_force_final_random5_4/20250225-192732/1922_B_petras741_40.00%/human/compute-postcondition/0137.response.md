Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for j in range(n)`. The variables involved in this loop head are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `j < n`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was some value (let's call it `j_prev`), and `n` must be greater than `j_prev`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes `j_prev + 1`.
   - Since the loop condition is `j < n`, `n` must remain the same or be greater than `j_prev + 1`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect:
- `j` being incremented by 1.
- `n` remaining the same or being greater than `j_prev + 1`.

Since we don't know the exact value of `j` from the previous iteration, we'll use the general form where `j` is incremented and `n` remains unchanged or is greater than the new value of `j`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1, `j` is incremented by 1, `n` must be greater than `j`**
