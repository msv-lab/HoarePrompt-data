Output State: **`q[j]` is greater than 0; `q` is a list of integers; `eta` is a list containing the integer `j`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `j` to the list `eta`. Since `q[j]` was initially greater than 0 and `q` is a list of integers, these conditions remain unchanged. The only new information is that `eta` now contains the integer `j`.
