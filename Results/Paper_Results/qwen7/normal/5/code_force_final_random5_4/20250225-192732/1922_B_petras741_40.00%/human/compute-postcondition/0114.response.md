Output State: **`n` is 1 or 2, `j` is `n + 1`, `res` is the original value of `res` plus `q[eta[n]] * (q[eta[n]] - 1) * (q[eta[n]] - 2) // 6` plus `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6` plus `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho`, `rho` is increased by `2 * q[eta[j]] + q[eta[j]]`.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables. It simply exits the loop or block it is inside. Therefore, the values of `n`, `j`, `res`, `rho`, and the expressions involving `q[eta[n]]`, `q[eta[j]]` remain unchanged from their initial states. The only change is that the code execution is terminated prematurely due to the `break` statement.
