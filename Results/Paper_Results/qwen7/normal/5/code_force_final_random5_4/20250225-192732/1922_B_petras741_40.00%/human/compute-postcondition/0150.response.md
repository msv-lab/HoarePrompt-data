Output State: **`eta` is [n + 1], `j` is `n + 1`, `n` is a non-negative integer**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `j` (which is `n + 1`) to the list `eta`. Since `eta` was initially an empty list, after appending `j`, `eta` becomes `[n + 1]`. The values of `j` and `n` remain unchanged, with `j` being specifically `n + 1`.
