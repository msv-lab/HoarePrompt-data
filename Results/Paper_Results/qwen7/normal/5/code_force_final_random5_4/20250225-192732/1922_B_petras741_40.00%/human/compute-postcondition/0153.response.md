Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head defines the variables that change within the loop. In this case, the loop head includes `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `j = 0` to `j = n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j < n + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `eta` is an empty list.
   - `j` is `n + 1`.
   - `n` is a non-negative integer.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `j` starts at `0` and increases by `1` with each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `n + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than `n + 1`. Therefore, `j` should be set to `n + 2`.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `eta` remains an empty list because the condition `q[j] > 0` does not affect the list if `j` is `n + 1` or `n + 2`.
   - `j` is incremented to `n + 2`.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is a constant for the loop.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`eta` is an empty list, `j` is `n + 2`, and `n` is a non-negative integer**.
