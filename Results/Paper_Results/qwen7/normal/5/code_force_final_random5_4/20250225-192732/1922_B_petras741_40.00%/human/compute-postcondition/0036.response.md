Postcondition: **`rho` is equal to `q[eta[0]]`, `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`, which contains all integers `j` from `0` to `n` for which `q[j]` was initially greater than `0`, and `q[j]` has been decremented by `1` for each such `j` encountered during the loop execution, and `eta_ln` is not equal to 1**
