Output State: **`n` is 1 or 2, `j` is `n + 2`, `res` is the original value of `res` plus `q[eta[n]] * (q[eta[n]] - 1) * (q[eta[n]] - 2) // 6` plus `2 * q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6` plus `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho` plus `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho`, `rho` is increased by `12 * q[eta[j]]`, `eta_ln` is unchanged, `rho` is increased by `12 * q[eta[j]]`.**

Explanation: The code `rho += q[eta[j]]` increases the value of `rho` by `q[eta[j]]`. Since `j` is defined as `n + 2`, `q[eta[j]]` refers to `q[eta[n+2]]`. The value of `n` is either 1 or 2, so `j` will be either 3 or 4. However, the exact value of `q[eta[j]]` is not specified, so we keep it as `q[eta[j]]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
