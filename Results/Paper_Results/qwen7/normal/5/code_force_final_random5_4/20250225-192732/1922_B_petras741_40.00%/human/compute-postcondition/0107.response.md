Output State: **`n` is 1 or 2, `j` is greater than 1000, `res` is the original value of `res` plus `q[eta[n]] * (q[eta[n]] - 1) * (q[eta[n]] - 2) // 6` plus `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho`, `rho` is increased by `q[eta[j]]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the loop or the most internal if statement. It does not change the values of the variables `n`, `j`, `res`, `rho`, or `eta`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain as they were before the `break` statement was executed.
