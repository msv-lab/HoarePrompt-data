Output State: **`t` is an input integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `buffer` is a list of integers from the input split by spaces, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `n` is assigned the value `int(input())**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `n`. The values of `t`, `buffer`, and `i` remain unchanged. The new value of `n` is the integer input obtained from the user.
