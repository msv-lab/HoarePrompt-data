Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(m)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `m`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `u` is an input integer.
   - `v` is an input integer.
   - `f` is an input integer.
   - `a` is updated as `a + f`.
   - `i` is updated as `i_prev + 1`.
   - `m` must be greater than or equal to `i_prev + 1`.
   - `u` is updated with the first input integer.
   - `v` is updated with the second input integer.
   - `f` is updated with the third input integer.

3. **Understand the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < m`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `i_prev + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 again, so `i` becomes `i_prev + 2`.
   - `m` must still be greater than or equal to `i_prev + 2` for the loop to continue.

5. **Update the states accordingly**:
   - `u` remains the same (updated with the first input integer).
   - `v` remains the same (updated with the second input integer).
   - `f` remains the same (updated with the third input integer).
   - `a` remains the same (updated as `a + f`).
   - `i` is now `i_prev + 2`.
   - `m` must be greater than or equal to `i_prev + 2`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `a` is `a + f`, `i` is `i_prev + 2`, `m` must be greater than or equal to `i_prev + 2`, `u` is updated with the first input integer, `v` is updated with the second input integer, `f` is updated with the third input integer.**
