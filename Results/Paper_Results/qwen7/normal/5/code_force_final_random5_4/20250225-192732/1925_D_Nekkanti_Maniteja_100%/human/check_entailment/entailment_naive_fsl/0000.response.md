Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. Specifically, the program does not account for the fact that the friendship value of a chosen pair increases by 1 for each subsequent excursion if the same pair is selected again. 

The program calculates `c` as the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs, which is incorrect. Additionally, the way the program sums up the friendship values and applies the modular inverse is not aligned with the problem's requirements. 

A correct approach would involve calculating the expected increase in friendship value for each pair over k excursions and then summing these expected values. The program should handle the case where the same pair is chosen multiple times and update the friendship value accordingly.
