Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\), `i` is 3, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of \(n \cdot (n - 1) // 2\) modulo `M`, `s` is 0, `a` is the sum of all `f` values provided as input over the iterations, `m` must be greater than 2, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer.

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` remains within the given bounds, `i` will be equal to the total number of iterations minus one, `M` stays constant at 1000000007, `c` remains the modular multiplicative inverse of \(n \cdot (n - 1) // 2\) modulo `M`, `s` remains 0, `a` is the cumulative sum of all `f` values read from the input, `m` must have been greater than the number of iterations minus one, and `u`, `v`, and `f` are the last set of input integers provided.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\), `i` is 3, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of \(n \cdot (n - 1) // 2\) modulo `M`, `s` is `c * i * c * m + c * a`, `a` is the sum of all `f` values provided as input over the iterations, `m` must be greater than 2, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `k` must be greater than 3

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\), `i` is 4, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of \(n \cdot (n - 1) // 2\) modulo `M`, `s` is `s + c * i * c * m + c * a`, `a` is the sum of all `f` values provided as input over the iterations, `m` must be greater than 2, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `k` must be greater than 3

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\), `i` is 5, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of \(n \cdot (n - 1) // 2\) modulo `M`, `s` is `s + c * i * c * m + c * a`, `a` is the sum of all `f` values provided as input over the iterations, `m` must be greater than 2, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `k` must be greater than 3, `s` is updated to `s + c * i * c * m + c * a`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
