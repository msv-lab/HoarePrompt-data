Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4, `i` is 0, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`, `s` is 0**.

Explanation: The line `s = 0` initializes the variable `s` to 0. The values of `t`, `i`, `M`, and `c` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the updated state includes `s` being set to 0 while the other variables retain their original values.
