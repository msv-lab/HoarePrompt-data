### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the problem statement to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Statement Analysis:
- We need to find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all \( k \) pairs chosen for the excursions.
- Each pair of friends has a friendship value that increases by 1 for each subsequent excursion if chosen again.
- The result should be expressed as \( \frac{p}{q} \) where \( p \) and \( q \) are coprime integers, and we need to compute \( p \cdot q^{-1} \mod (10^9 + 7) \).

#### Given Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   ```python
   M = 10 ** 9 + 7
   c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)
   ```
   Here, `c` is the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs, which is incorrect. The correct approach should consider the probability of choosing each pair.

2. **Summing Friendship Values**:
   ```python
   a = 0
   for i in range(m):
       (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
       a += f
   ```
   This part correctly sums the friendship values of all given pairs.

3. **Calculating Expected Value**:
   ```python
   for i in range(k):
       s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a
   ```
   The calculation here is incorrect. The term `c * i * c * m` does not reflect the expected increase in friendship values. The term `c * a` also seems misplaced.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Calculate the probability of choosing each pair in each excursion.
2. Compute the expected increase in friendship values for each pair over \( k \) excursions.
3. Sum these expected values and apply the required modulo operation.

Given the function summary, the program does not correctly implement the solution. The current implementation does not account for the increasing friendship values and the combinatorial nature of the problem.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all \( k \) pairs chosen for the excursions.

**Final: False**
