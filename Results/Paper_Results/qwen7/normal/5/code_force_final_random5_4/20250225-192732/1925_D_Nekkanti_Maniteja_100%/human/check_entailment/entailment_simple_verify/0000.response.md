### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine if it correctly calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all \( k \) pairs chosen for the excursions.

1. **Initialization**:
   - `M` is set to \( 10^9 + 7 \), which is used for modulo operations.
   - `c` is calculated as the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs, \( \binom{n}{2} \). This is done using `pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)`. This calculation is correct but irrelevant to the problem since the modular inverse is not needed for the expected value calculation.

2. **Sum of Friendship Values**:
   - `a` is initialized to 0 and incremented by the friendship value \( f \) of each pair of friends. This part is correct in terms of collecting the sum of friendship values.

3. **Main Calculation**:
   - The loop `for i in range(k):` iterates \( k \) times.
   - Inside this loop, `s` is updated as `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a`.
     - `c * i * c * m` is added, which is incorrect because it does not reflect the expected value calculation.
     - `c * a` is added, which also seems incorrect as it does not account for the increasing friendship value.

The key issue is that the program does not correctly account for the expected increase in friendship value for each pair over \( k \) excursions. The formula used in the loop is not aligned with the problem's requirements.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for each pair over \( k \) excursions. The expected value for each pair is the probability of choosing the pair multiplied by the increase in friendship value over \( k \) excursions.

Given that the probability of choosing a specific pair in one excursion is \( \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \), the expected increase in friendship value for a pair over \( k \) excursions is \( \frac{k}{\binom{n}{2}} \).

Thus, the correct formula for the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all pairs is:
\[ \text{Expected Value} = \sum_{i=1}^{m} \left( \frac{k}{\binom{n}{2}} \times f_i \right) \]

The provided program does not implement this formula correctly.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all \( k \) pairs chosen for the excursions.
