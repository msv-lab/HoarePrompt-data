Output State: **`i` is `i_prev + 8`, `m` must be greater than or equal to `i_prev + 8`, `u` is the first integer input, `v` is the second integer input, `f` is the third integer input, `a` is increased by `f`, `u`, `v`, and `f` are assigned the values of three integers separated by spaces from the input.**

Explanation: The code takes three integers as input and assigns them to the variables `u`, `v`, and `f`. The values of `i`, `m`, `a`, and the initial conditions for `u`, `v`, and `f` remain unchanged except that `u`, `v`, and `f` now hold the specific integer values entered by the user.
