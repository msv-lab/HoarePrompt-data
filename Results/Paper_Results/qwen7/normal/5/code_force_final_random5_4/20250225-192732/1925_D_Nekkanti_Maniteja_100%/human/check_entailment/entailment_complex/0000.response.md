Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**: 
   - The function correctly initializes `M` as \(10^9 + 7\).
   - It correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` which are the number of children, pairs of friends, and the number of excursions respectively.

2. **Combinatorial Factor Calculation**:
   - The combinatorial factor `c` is calculated as the modular inverse of \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\). This is correct because \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\) represents the total number of unique pairs of children, and `c` is used to normalize probabilities.

3. **Summation of Friendship Values**:
   - The variable `a` accumulates the sum of all friendship values from the input. This is done correctly.

4. **Calculation of Expected Value**:
   - The expected value calculation seems to be incorrect. The formula used in the loop is:
     \[
     s = s + c \times i \times c \times m + c \times a
     \]
     This formula does not correctly represent the expected value of the sum of friendship values. The expected value should consider the probability of choosing a friend pair and the increase in friendship value due to repeated selections.

5. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The final result is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\) which is correct.

Given the above points, the core logic for calculating the expected value is flawed. The provided solution does not correctly implement the expected value calculation as per the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
