Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. Additionally, for each of the m lines describing pairs of friends, a_i, b_i, and f_i are integers such that a_i ≠ b_i, 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, and 1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^9. It is guaranteed that all pairs of friends are distinct, and the sum of n and m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    M = 10 ** 9 + 7
    c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)
    s = 0
    a = 0
    for i in range(m):
        u, v, f = map(int, input().split())
        a += f
    for i in range(k):
        s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a
    print(s % M)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\), `i` is `k`, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of \(n \cdot (n - 1) // 2\) modulo `M`, `s` is `s + c * i * c * m + c * a`, `a` is the sum of all `f` values provided as input over the iterations, `m` must be greater than 2, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `k` must be greater than or equal to the total number of iterations.

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` remains within the given bounds, `i` is equal to the total number of iterations (`k`), `M` stays constant at 1000000007, `c` remains the modular multiplicative inverse of \(n \cdot (n - 1) // 2\) modulo `M`, `s` is updated to include the final addition of `c * i * c * m + c * a` where `i` is the total number of iterations, `a` is the cumulative sum of all `f` values read from the input, `m` must be greater than 2, `u`, `v`, and `f` are the last set of input integers provided, and `k` must be greater than or equal to the total number of iterations.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `u` is the first input integer, `v` is the second input integer, `f` is the third input integer, `a` is the sum of all input integers `f` provided during the loop executions, `i` is `i_prev + 6`, `m` must be greater than or equal to `i_prev + 6`, `s` is updated to `s + c * (i_prev + 2) * c * m + c * a + c * (i_prev + 3) * c * m + c * a + c * (i_prev + 7) * c * m + c * a`, and `c` and `M` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: i is `i_prev + 18`, k must be greater than or equal to `i_prev + 19`, u, v, and f are integers obtained from the input split, a is the sum of all f values provided by the input over all iterations, s is updated to `s + c * (i_prev + 1) * c * m + c * a + c * (i_prev + 1) * c * m + c * a + ... + c * (i_prev + 17) * c * m + c * a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
