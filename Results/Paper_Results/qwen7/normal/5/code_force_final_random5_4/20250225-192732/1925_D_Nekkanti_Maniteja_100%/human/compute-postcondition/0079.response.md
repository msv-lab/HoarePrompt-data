Output State: **t** is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\), **i** is equal to the total number of iterations (`k`), **M** stays constant at 1000000007, **c** remains the modular multiplicative inverse of \(n \cdot (n - 1) // 2\) modulo `M`, **s** is updated to include the final addition of `c * i * c * m + c * a` where `i` is the total number of iterations and `a` is the cumulative sum of all `f` values read from the input, **m** must be greater than 2, **u**, **v**, and **f** are the last set of input integers provided, and **k** must be equal to the total number of iterations.

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` remains within the given bounds, `i` is equal to the total number of iterations (`k`), `M` stays constant at 1000000007, `c` remains the modular multiplicative inverse of \(n \cdot (n - 1) // 2\) modulo `M`, `s` is updated to include the final addition of `c * i * c * m + c * a` where `i` is the total number of iterations and `a` is the cumulative sum of all `f` values read from the input, `m` must be greater than 2, `u`, `v`, and `f` are the last set of input integers provided, and `k` is equal to the total number of iterations.
