Output State: **`i` is `i_prev + 6`, `m` must be greater than or equal to `i_prev + 6`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. The initial state of `i` and `m` remains unchanged, and the new values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are dependent on the input provided.
