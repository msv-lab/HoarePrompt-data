Output State: `u` is the first input integer, `v` is the second input integer, `f` is the third input integer, `a` is the sum of `f` added for each iteration from 1 to `m-1`, `i` is `m - 1`, `m` must be greater than or equal to `m - 1`, and all other variables (`s`, `c`, `M`) remain unchanged.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `u` and `v` will still hold their respective values from the first and second inputs, `f` will hold its value from the third input, `a` will be the cumulative sum of `f` for each iteration from 1 to `m-1`, and `i` will be `m - 1`. The variable `m` must still be greater than or equal to `m - 1`. All other variables (`s`, `c`, `M`) will retain their initial values as they were not affected by the loop.
