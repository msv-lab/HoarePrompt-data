Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `s`.
2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are more characters in the list `s`.
3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `s` is a list of characters with at least one character.
   - `i` is the next character in the list `s`.
   - `thorn` is incremented by 1 if `i` equals '*', and remains 0 if `i` does not equal '*'.
   - `ret` is 1.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is the next character in the list `s`, after processing `i`, `i` will be the next character in the list `s`.
   - `thorn` will be incremented by 1 if `i` equals '*', otherwise it remains the same.
   - `ret` remains 1 unless the loop exits due to an external condition (which is not specified here).

Given these points, we need to update the state for the next iteration of the loop. 

**State at the start of the next iteration**:
- `s` is a list of characters with at least one character (since we are continuing the loop).
- `i` is the next character in the list `s` (the current value of `i` will be the next character in `s`).
- `thorn` is incremented by 1 if `i` equals '*', otherwise it remains the same.
- `ret` remains 1.

Therefore, the updated state is:

State: **`s` is a list of characters with at least one character, `i` is the next character in the list `s`, `thorn` is incremented by 1 if `i` equals '*', and remains 0 if `i` does not equal '*', `ret` is 1**.
