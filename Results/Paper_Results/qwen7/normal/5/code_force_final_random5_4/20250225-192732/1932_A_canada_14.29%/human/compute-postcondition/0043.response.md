Postcondition: **`thorn` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3; `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\); `n` is an input integer determined by the length of the input; `s` is a list of characters with at least one character remaining; `ret` is 0; `i` is the second character in the list `s`. If `i` equals '*', `thorn` remains unchanged and does not become 2. If `i` does not equal '*', `thorn` becomes 2 if it was previously 0.**
