Output State: **`s` is a list of characters with at least one character, `i` is the next character in the list `s`, and `thorn` is incremented by 1 based on the previous value of `thorn` (2 if `i` equals '*', and 0 if `i` does not equal '*', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement).**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `s`, `i`, or `thorn`. It only indicates that the execution will exit the current loop or conditional block. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
