Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a string of characters representing a row in a grid. For each test case, it counts the number of cells containing a coin ('@'), stopping the count if two consecutive thorn ('*') cells are encountered. It prints the count of coins for each test case and returns nothing.**
