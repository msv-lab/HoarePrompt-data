Based on the initial state provided:

- `thorn` is either 0 or 2 depending on whether any '*' characters were encountered.
- `ret` is the count of '@' characters found in the list `s`.

The `print(ret)` statement will print the value of `ret`, which is the count of '@' characters in the list `s`.

Output: **ret (where ret is the count of '@' characters in the list s)**
