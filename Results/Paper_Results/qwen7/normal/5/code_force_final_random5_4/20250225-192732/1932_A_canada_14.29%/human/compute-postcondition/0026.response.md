Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in s:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `s`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are more characters in the list `s` to iterate over.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `thorn` is either 0, 1, or 2.
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `n` is an input integer determined by the length of the input.
   - `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least one character.
   - `ret` is 0.
   - `i` is not equal to '@'.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues as long as there are more characters in `s`, the only variable that needs to be adjusted is `i`. After each iteration, `i` takes the next character from the list `s`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `s` must still contain at least one character, meaning `s` should have at least one more character left.

5. **New State**:
   - `thorn` remains unchanged (it can still be 0, 1, or 2).
   - `t` remains unchanged (it is a positive integer between 1 and 1000).
   - `n` remains unchanged (it is determined by the length of the input).
   - `s` must now be a list of characters with at least two characters remaining (since one character was used in the previous iteration).
   - `ret` remains 0.
   - `i` will now be the next character in the list `s`.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`thorn` is either 0, 1, or 2, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is an input integer determined by the length of the input, `s` is a list of characters with at least two characters remaining, `ret` is 0, and `i` is the next character in the list `s`.**
