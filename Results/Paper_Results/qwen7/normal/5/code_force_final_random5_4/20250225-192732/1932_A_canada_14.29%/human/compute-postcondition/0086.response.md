Output State: **`s` is a list of characters with at least one character, `i` is the next character in the list `s`, `thorn` is 0, `ret` is 2**

Explanation: The variable `ret` was initially set to 1. The code snippet `ret += 1` increments the value of `ret` by 1, making its new value 2. The other variables (`s`, `i`, and `thorn`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
