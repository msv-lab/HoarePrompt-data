Postcondition: **`thorn` is either 1, 2, or 3; `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\); `n` is an input integer determined by the length of the input; `s` is a list of characters with at least one character remaining; `ret` is 0; `i` is the second character in the list `s`; if `thorn` equals 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
