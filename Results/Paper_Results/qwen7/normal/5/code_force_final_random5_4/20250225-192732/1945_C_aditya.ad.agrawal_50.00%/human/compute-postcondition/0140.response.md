Output State: **`i` is 0, which is the first element of `arr`; `pos` is 1; `z_l` is 1.**

The code `z_l += 1` increments the value of `z_l` by 1. Since `z_l` was not previously defined with a specific value, it is assumed to be 0 initially. After executing the code, `z_l` becomes 1. The values of `i` and `pos` remain unchanged.
