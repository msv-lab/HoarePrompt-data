Output State: **`i` is the second element of `arr`, `pos` is 3, `z_r` is decreased by 1 if the second element of `arr` is 0, otherwise `o_r` is 0, `o_r` is greater than or equal to `(z_r + o_r) / 2`, `z_l` is 1 greater than its previous value, `b_d` is equal to the absolute value of `n / 2 - 2`, `ans` is 1**.

Explanation: The code `z_l += 1` increments the value of `z_l` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
