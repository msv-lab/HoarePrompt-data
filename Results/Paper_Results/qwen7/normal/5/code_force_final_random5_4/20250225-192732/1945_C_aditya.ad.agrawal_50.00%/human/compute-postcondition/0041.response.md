Output State: **`i` is the next element in `arr`, `pos` is increased by 2, `z_l` is decreased by 1 if `i` equals 0, otherwise `o_l` is increased by 2 and `o_r` is decreased by 1, `ans` is `pos`, the condition `o_r` is greater than or equal to half of `(z_r + o_r)`, and `z_l` is greater than or equal to half of `(z_l + o_l)`, and `b_d` is equal to the absolute value of `n / 2 - pos`**.

Explanation: The code `o_l += 1` increases the value of `o_l` by 1. Since `o_l` was previously increased by 1 due to the condition when `i` does not equal 0, now it is increased by 2. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
