Output State: **`i` is the next element in `arr`, `pos` is increased by 3, `z_l` is either increased by 1 or unchanged, `o_l` is increased by 1, `o_r`, `o_r`, and `z_r` remain unchanged, `ans` is equal to `pos`, and the conditions `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2`, `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2`, and `b_d == abs(n / 2 - pos)` are still true.**

Explanation:
- The code `o_l += 1` increments the value of `o_l` by 1.
- All other variables (`i`, `pos`, `z_l`, `o_r`, `z_r`, `ans`, and the conditions involving `o_r`, `z_l`, `z_r`, and `b_d`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
