Output State: **`i` is the next element in `arr`, `pos` is increased by 2, `z_l` is decreased by 1 if `i` equals 0, otherwise `o_l` is increased by 1 and `o_r` is decreased by 1, `ans` is `pos`, the condition `o_r` is greater than or equal to half of `(z_r + o_r)`, and `z_l` is greater than or equal to half of `(z_l + o_l)`, and `b_d` is equal to the absolute value of `n / 2 - pos`**.

Explanation: The code `pos += 1` increments the value of `pos` by 1. Since `pos` was initially increased by 1, it is now increased by 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
