Output State: **`i` is the first element of `arr`; `pos` is 1; `z_r` is decreased by 1 if `i` is 0, otherwise `o_r` is 0; `o_r` is greater than or equal to `(z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l` is greater than or equal to `(z_l + o_l) / 2` and `b_d` is greater than the absolute value of `n / 2 - pos`; `ans` is 1.**

Explanation: The line `ans = pos` assigns the value of `pos` (which is 1) to the variable `ans`. No other changes are made to the variables, so their previous states remain valid.
