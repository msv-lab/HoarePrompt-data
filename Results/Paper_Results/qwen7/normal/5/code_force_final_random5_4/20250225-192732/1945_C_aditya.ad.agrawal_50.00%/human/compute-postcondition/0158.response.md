Output State: **`i` is the second element of `arr`, `pos` is 3, `z_r` is decreased by 1 if the second element of `arr` is 0, otherwise `o_r` is 0, `o_l` is increased by 1, `o_r` is greater than or equal to `(z_r + o_r) / 2`, `z_l` is greater than or equal to `(z_l + o_l) / 2`, `b_d` is equal to the absolute value of `n / 2 - 2`, `ans` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `o_r -= 1` decreases the value of `o_r` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Since the initial state of `ans` was 1, and `o_r` is now decreased by 1, `ans` becomes 0.
