Output State: **`o_r` is equal to `o`, all other variables retain their original values.**

Explanation: The code assigns the current value of `o` to `o_r`. This means that `o_r` now holds the same value as `o`, while `t`, `n`, `input_string`, `arr`, `z`, `o`, and `z_r` remain unchanged from their initial states.
