Output State: **`i` is the next element in `arr`, `pos` is increased by 2, `z_l` is either increased by 1 or unchanged, `o_l` is unchanged, `o_r` is unchanged, `ans` is equal to `pos`, the condition `o_r` is greater than or equal to half of `(z_r + o_r)` is still true, and `z_l` is greater than or equal to half of `(z_l + o_l)` is still true, `b_d` is equal to the absolute value of `n / 2 - pos`.**

Explanation: The code updates `b_d` to be the absolute value of `n / 2 - pos`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the updated state includes the new value of `b_d` based on the current value of `pos`.
