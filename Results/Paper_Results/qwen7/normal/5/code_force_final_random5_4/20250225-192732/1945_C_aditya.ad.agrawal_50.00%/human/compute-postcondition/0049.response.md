Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is the variable `i`, which iterates over the elements in `arr`. There are no other variables directly involved in the loop head.

2. **Understand the Postcondition**: The postcondition given describes the state of various variables after an iteration of the loop. However, for the purpose of determining the state at the start of the next iteration, we only need to focus on the changes made within the loop body and the conditions that must be met for the loop to continue.

3. **Determine the Changes in the Loop Body**: Since the loop body is omitted, we need to infer the changes based on the postcondition. The key points are:
   - `i` becomes the next element in `arr`.
   - `pos` is increased by 2.
   - `z_l` either increases by 1 or stays the same.
   - `o_l`, `o_r`, and `z_r` remain unchanged.
   - `ans` is set to `pos`.
   - The conditions involving `o_r`, `z_l`, and `b_d` are preserved.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, the following must be true:
   - `i` should be the next element in `arr`.
   - `pos` should be increased by 2 from its current value.
   - `z_l` should either increase by 1 or stay the same.
   - `o_l`, `o_r`, and `z_r` should remain unchanged.
   - `ans` should be set to the new value of `pos`.
   - The conditions involving `o_r`, `z_l`, and `b_d` should still be true.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

- `i` is the next element in `arr`.
- `pos` is increased by 2 from its previous value.
- `z_l` is either increased by 1 or unchanged.
- `o_l`, `o_r`, and `z_r` remain unchanged.
- `ans` is equal to the new value of `pos`.
- The conditions `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` and `b_d == abs(n / 2 - pos)` are still true.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is the next element in `arr`, `pos` is increased by 2, `z_l` is either increased by 1 or unchanged, `o_l`, `o_r`, and `z_r` remain unchanged, `ans` is equal to `pos`, and the conditions `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2`, `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2`, and `b_d == abs(n / 2 - pos)` are still true.**
