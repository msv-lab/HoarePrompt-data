Output State: **`t` is a positive value, `n` is an input integer, `input_string` is a string input by the user, `arr` is a list of integers converted from each character in `input_string`, `z` is the count of 0s in the list `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in the list `arr`.**

The code `o = arr.count(1)` counts the number of 1s in the list `arr` and assigns the result to the variable `o`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `input_string`, and `arr`) remain unchanged. The variable `z` (the count of 0s in the list `arr`) also remains unchanged.
