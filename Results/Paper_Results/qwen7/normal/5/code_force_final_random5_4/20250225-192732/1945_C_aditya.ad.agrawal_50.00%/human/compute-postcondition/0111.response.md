Output State: **`pos` is increased by 2, `o_l` is 1**

Explanation: The initial state indicates that `pos` is increased by 1. After executing the line `o_l += 1`, the variable `o_l` is assigned the value 1. The variable `pos` remains increased by 1 from its initial state, making it increased by 2 in total.
