Postcondition: `o_r` is equal to `o`, `z_l` is 0, `o_l` is 0, `dist` is either `abs(n / 2) - b_d` or `abs(n / 2)`, depending on whether `o_r` is greater than or equal to `(z_r + o_r) / 2`, `ans` is 0, and `pos` is 0. If `o_r` is greater than or equal to `(z_r + o_r) / 2`, then `b_d` is set to `dist`. Otherwise, `b_d` is set to 30001.
