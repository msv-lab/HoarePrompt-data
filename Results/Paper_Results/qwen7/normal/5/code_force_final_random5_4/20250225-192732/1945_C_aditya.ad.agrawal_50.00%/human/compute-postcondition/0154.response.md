Output State: **`i` is the second element of `arr`, `pos` is 3, `z_r` is decreased by 1 if the second element of `arr` is 0, otherwise `o_r` is 0, `o_r` is greater than or equal to `(z_r + o_r) / 2`, `z_l` is greater than or equal to `(z_l + o_l) / 2`, `b_d` is equal to the absolute value of `n / 2 - 2`, `ans` is 1**

Explanation: 
- The line `pos += 1` increments the value of `pos` by 1. Since `pos` was initially 2, after executing this line, `pos` becomes 3.
- No other variables are affected by this line of code, so their states remain unchanged.
