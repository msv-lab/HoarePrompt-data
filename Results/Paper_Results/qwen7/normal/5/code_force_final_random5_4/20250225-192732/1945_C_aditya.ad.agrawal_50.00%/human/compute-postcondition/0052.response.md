Output State: **`i` is the next element in `arr`, `pos` is increased by 3, `z_l` is increased by 1, `o_l`, `o_r`, and `z_r` remain unchanged, `ans` is equal to `pos`, and `z_r` is decreased by 1; the conditions `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2`, `z_l >= (z_l + 1 + o_l) / 2`, and `b_d == abs(n / 2 - pos)` are still true.**

Explanation: The variable `z_r` is decremented by 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from their initial states.
