Output State: **`b_d` is equal to `abs(n / 2 - pos)`, `i` is the next element in `arr`, `pos` is increased by 3, `z_l` is either increased by 1 or remains unchanged, `o_l` and `o_r` may change by Â±1, `z_r` may decrease by 1, `ans` is equal to `pos`, and the conditions `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2`, `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2`, and `b_d == abs(n / 2 - pos)` are still true.**

Explanation: The code calculates `b_d` as the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `pos`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The conditions involving `o_r`, `z_l`, `o_l`, `z_r`, and `b_d` are still true as per the initial state.
