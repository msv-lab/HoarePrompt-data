Output State: **`b_freq` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each element in list `b`, `a` is a list of integers with length n, `b` is a list of integers with length m such that m <= n, `k` is an integer satisfying 1 <= k <= m, and `good_subarrays` is 0.**

The code `b_freq = Counter(b)` creates a `Counter` object named `b_freq` which contains the frequency of each element in the list `b`. The lengths of lists `a` and `b`, and the value of `k` remain unchanged, and `good_subarrays` is still 0.
