Output State: **`good_subarrays` is 1, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than `m`, and the number of matches is greater than or equal to `k`.**

Explanation: The line `good_subarrays += 1` increments the value of `good_subarrays` by 1. Initially, `good_subarrays` is assumed to be 0 (since no specific value is given). After executing this line, `good_subarrays` becomes 1. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `m`, and `k`) remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code snippet.
