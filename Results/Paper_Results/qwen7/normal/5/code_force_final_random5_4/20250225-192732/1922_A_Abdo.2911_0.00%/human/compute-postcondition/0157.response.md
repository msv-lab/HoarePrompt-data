Output State: **`i` is `2 * n`, `n` must be greater than 1, and `match_a_b` is `False`.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or a nested structure. In this case, since there is no loop or nested structure mentioned in the initial state, the `break` statement does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, `match_a_b`, and `template[i]` remain unchanged.
