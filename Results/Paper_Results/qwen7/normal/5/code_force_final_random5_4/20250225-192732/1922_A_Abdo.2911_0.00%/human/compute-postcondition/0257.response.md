Output State: **`match_a_b` is `False`, `i` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of `match_a_b` or `i`. It only breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement it is within. Since no such loop or conditional statement is specified in the code snippet, we assume it breaks out of the most internal one. The conditions about `n`, the character at index `i` in `template`, and the comparison between `a[i]`, `b[i]`, and the character at index `i` in `template` remain unchanged.
