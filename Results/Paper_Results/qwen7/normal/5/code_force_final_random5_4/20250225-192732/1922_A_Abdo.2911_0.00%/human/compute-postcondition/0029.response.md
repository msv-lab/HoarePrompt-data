Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is the length of string `a`, `match_a_b` is `False`, and the character at index `i` of `template` is a lowercase letter, and either the character at index `i` of `a` is not equal to the character at index `i` of `template` or the character at index `i` of `b` is not equal to the character at index `i` of `template`.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns `False` to the variable `match_a_b`. This does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, or the conditions involving `template`, `a`, and `b`. Therefore, these conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
