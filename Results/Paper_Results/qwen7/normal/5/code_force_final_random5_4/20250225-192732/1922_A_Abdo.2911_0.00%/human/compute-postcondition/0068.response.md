Output State: **`match_a_b` is False, `match_c` is False, `n` must be greater than 0, the current value of `template[i]` is a lowercase character, and the current value of `c[i]` is not equal to the current value of `template[i]`**.

Explanation: The line `match_c = False` changes the value of `match_c` from `True` to `False`. All other conditions and variable states remain unchanged according to the initial state.
