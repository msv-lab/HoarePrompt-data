Output State: **`match_a_b` is False, `match_c` is False, `n` is greater than 0, `template[i]` is not a lowercase character, and the lowercase version of `c[i]` is equal to the lowercase version of `template[i]`. and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no variables are updated or assigned new values by the `break` statement, the values of `match_a_b`, `match_c`, `n`, `template[i]`, and the relationship between `c[i]` and `template[i]` remain unchanged.
