Output State: **`match_c` is `False`, `i` is `2 * n + (n - 1)`, `n` must be greater than 0, and `template[i]` is not a lowercase letter, and the current value of `c[i].lower()` is equal to the current value of `template[i].lower()` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block specified, the `break` statement simply indicates that we are breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables `match_c`, `i`, `n`, `template[i]`, and `c[i].lower()` remain unchanged.
