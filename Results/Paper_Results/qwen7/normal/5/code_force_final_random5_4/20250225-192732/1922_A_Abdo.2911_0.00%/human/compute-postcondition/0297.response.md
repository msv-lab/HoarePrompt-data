Output State: **`match_c` is False, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 3, and the current value of `template[i]` is a lowercase character, the current value of `c[i]` is not equal to the current value of `template[i]`**

Explanation: The line `match_c = False` simply reassigns the value of `match_c` to `False`. None of the other variables (`i`, `n`, `template[i]`, or `c[i]`) are affected by this line of code. Therefore, their previous states remain unchanged.
