Output State: **`i` is `4 * n`, `match_c` remains `False`, `match_a_b` is `False`, `t` is reduced by 1, `a` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `c` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `template` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list named `template`. None of the existing variables (`i`, `match_c`, `match_a_b`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`) are modified by this line of code. Therefore, their states remain unchanged.
