Postcondition: `match_c` is True, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 3, and if the lowercase version of `c[i]` is equal to the lowercase version of `template[i]`, we break out of the loop. If the lowercase versions are not equal, no change is made to `match_c`, `i`, `n`, and `template[i]` remains unchanged.
