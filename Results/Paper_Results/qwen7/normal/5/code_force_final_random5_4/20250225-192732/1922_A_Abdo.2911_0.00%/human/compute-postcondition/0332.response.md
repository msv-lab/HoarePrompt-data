Output State: **match_c is either False or True, i is 3, n is greater than 3.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n-1`, which is 3 in this case. The value of `match_c` will depend on whether any condition within the loop caused it to be set to `False`. Specifically, if at any point during the loop execution, `template[i].islower()` is `True` and `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, or if `c[i].lower()` equals `template[i].lower()`, then `match_c` will be set to `False`. If none of these conditions were met for all iterations, `match_c` will remain `True`. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
