Postcondition: `match_c` is True, `i` is 0, and `n` is greater than 3. The current value of `template[i]` is a lowercase character, and either the current value of `c[i]` matches the lowercase version of `template[i]` (in which case the most internal loop or if statement is broken), or if they do not match, `template[i]` remains unchanged along with `match_c`, `i`, and `n`.
