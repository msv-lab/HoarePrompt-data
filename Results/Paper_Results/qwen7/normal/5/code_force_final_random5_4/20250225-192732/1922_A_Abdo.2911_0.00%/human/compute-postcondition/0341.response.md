Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing multiple test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20), and three strings a, b, and c, each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters. For each test case, the function processes these inputs and returns different outputs based on specific conditions.**

Note: The actual processing logic and return values are not described here as per the given instruction to focus only on parameters and return values.
