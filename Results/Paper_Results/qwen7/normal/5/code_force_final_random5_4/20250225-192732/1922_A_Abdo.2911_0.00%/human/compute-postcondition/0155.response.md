Postcondition: `i` is `2 * n`, `n` must be greater than 1. If `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition `a[i] != template[i] or b[i] != template[i]` is true, `match_a_b` is set to `False`.
