Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `match_a_b` is False**

The code `match_a_b = False` simply assigns the boolean value `False` to the variable `match_a_b`. This does not affect the values of `i` or `n`. Therefore, the initial conditions for `i` and `n` remain unchanged, and `match_a_b` is now explicitly set to `False`.
