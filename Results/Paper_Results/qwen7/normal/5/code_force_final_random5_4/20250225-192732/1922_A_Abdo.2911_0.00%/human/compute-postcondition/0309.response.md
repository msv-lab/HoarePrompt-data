Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `match_c` is True
   - `i` is 0
   - `n` is greater than 3
   - The current value of `template[i]` is a lowercase character

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `i` in the range from 0 to `n-1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop body is omitted, but based on the postcondition, if the lowercase versions of `c[i]` and `template[i]` are not equal, the program breaks out of the loop.
   - If they are equal, the loop continues to the next iteration.
   - If they are not equal, no change is made to `match_c`, `i`, `n`, and `template[i]` remains unchanged.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Since `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it will become 1 in the next iteration.
   - `n` must still be greater than 3.
   - `match_c` remains unchanged unless the condition inside the loop changes it.
   - `template[i]` (which is now `template[1]`) must be a lowercase character.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `i` will be 1.
   - `n` must remain greater than 3.
   - `match_c` remains True unless the condition inside the loop changes it.
   - `template[i]` (now `template[1]`) must be a lowercase character.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `i`, `n`, and `template[i]`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`match_c` is True, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 3, and the current value of `template[i]` is a lowercase character**
