Output State: **`i` is `4 * n`, `match_c` remains `False`, `match_a_b` is `True` if the if condition is met, otherwise `match_a_b` is `False`, `t` is reduced by 1, `a` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.**

Explanation: The code `b = input().strip()` takes an input from the user, strips any leading and trailing whitespace from the input, and assigns it to the variable `b`. The other variables (`i`, `match_c`, `match_a_b`, `t`, and `a`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
