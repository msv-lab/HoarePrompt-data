Output State: **`i` is `2 * n - 1`, `n` must be greater than 1, and the character at index `i` in `template` is a lowercase letter, and either the character at index `i` in `a` is not equal to the character at index `i` in `template` or the character at index `i` in `b` is not equal to the character at index `i` in `template`; `match_a_b` is `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, the characters in `template`, `a`, and `b`, and the value of `match_a_b` remain unchanged.
