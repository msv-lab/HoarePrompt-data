Output State: **`match_a_b` is False, `match_c` is False, `c` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `template` is a list containing the uppercase value of `a[2]` followed by `a[4]`, `i` is 5**.

Explanation: The code `template.append(a[i])` appends the value of `a[i]` (which is `a[4]` since `i` is 4) to the list `template`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1 after the append operation, making it 5. All other variables remain unchanged.
