Output State: **`match_c` is False, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 3, and the lowercase version of `c[i]` is equal to the lowercase version of `template[i]`. We break out of the loop.**

The `break` statement is executed, which means we exit the loop we are currently in. The values of `match_c`, `i`, `n`, and the condition involving `c[i]` and `template[i]` remain unchanged.
