Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000.**

The code `t = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, the new state of `t` remains within this range after the input is taken. All other variables (`a`, `b`, `c`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
