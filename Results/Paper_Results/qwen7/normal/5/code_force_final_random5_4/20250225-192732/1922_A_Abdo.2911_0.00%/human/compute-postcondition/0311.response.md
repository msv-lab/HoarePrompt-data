Output State: **`match_c` is False, `i` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block specified in the code snippet, the `break` statement does not change the values of the variables. It only indicates that the execution would break out of the most internal loop or conditional block if one were present. The values of `match_c`, `i`, and the condition about `n` and `template[i]` remain unchanged.
