Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `match_a_b` is True, `match_c` is False, `c` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `template` is a list containing the uppercase value of `a[2]` followed by `a[4]` and so on until all elements in `a` up to index `n-1` are processed, `i` is `2*n - 1`, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if template[i].islower():
        if a[i] != template[i] or b[i] != template[i]:
            match_a_b = False
            break
    elif a[i].lower() == template[i].lower() or b[i].lower() == template[i
        ].lower():
        match_a_b = False
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is `2 * n - 1`, `n` must be greater than 1, and `template[i]` is the character at index `i` in `template`. If `template[i]` is a lowercase letter, then:
- If the character at index `i` in `a` is not equal to `template[i]` or the character at index `i` in `b` is not equal to `template[i]`, `match_a_b` is `False` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken.
- Otherwise, no change occurs.

If `template[i]` is not a lowercase letter, then:
- If `a[i].lower()` equals `template[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower()` equals `template[i].lower()`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
- Otherwise, the program continues execution without changing the values of `i`, `n`, and `template[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is `2 * n`, `n` must be greater than 1. If `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, then `match_a_b` is set to `False`. If `a[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()`, `match_a_b` remains `False`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is `2 * n + 1`, `n` must be greater than 1, and `match_a_b` is `False`. If `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, then `match_a_b` is set to `False` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `a[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
