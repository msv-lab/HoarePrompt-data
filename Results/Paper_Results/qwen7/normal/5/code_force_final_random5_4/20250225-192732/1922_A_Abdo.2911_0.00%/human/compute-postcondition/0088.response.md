Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `match_a_b` is False
   - `match_c` is True
   - `n` is greater than 0
   - `template[i+1]` is not a lowercase character
   - If `template[i].islower()` is True, then `match_a_b` remains False. Otherwise, `match_a_b` remains False.

4. **Determine the changes needed for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 at the start of each new iteration.
   - `n` remains unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body (which is not provided).

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1, `i` becomes `i + 1`.
   - `match_a_b` remains False because the condition `if template[i].islower(): match_a_b = False` does not change it based on the given postcondition.
   - `match_c` remains True unless modified within the loop body.
   - `n` remains greater than 0 unless modified within the loop body.
   - `template[i+1]` must not be a lowercase character for the loop to continue.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `match_a_b` is False
- `match_c` is True
- `n` is greater than 0
- `template[i+1]` is not a lowercase character (since `i` is incremented, `i+1` becomes `i+2`)

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`match_a_b` is False, `match_c` is True, `n` is greater than 0, and `template[i+2]` is not a lowercase character**
