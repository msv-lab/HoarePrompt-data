Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 4 * `n`
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `i` must be less than `n`

4. **Check the loop condition**: Given the current state, `i` (which is 4 * `n`) is not less than `n`. Therefore, the loop condition `i < n` is false, and the loop will not execute again.

5. **Adjust the state**: Since the loop will not execute again, there is no need to change the value of `i` or `n` based on the loop execution. However, we should ensure that the conditions remain valid for future iterations if the loop were to continue.

Given the above analysis, the state does not need to be adjusted because the loop will not execute again under the given conditions.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 4 * `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` must be less than `n`** (Note: This state remains unchanged as the loop will not execute again).
