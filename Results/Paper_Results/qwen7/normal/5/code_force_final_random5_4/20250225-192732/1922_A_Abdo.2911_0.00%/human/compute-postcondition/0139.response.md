Postcondition: `i` is `2 * n - 1`, `n` must be greater than 1, and the character at index `i` in `template` is a lowercase letter. If the character at index `i` in `a` is not equal to the character at index `i` in `template` or the character at index `i` in `b` is not equal to the character at index `i` in `template`, then `match_a_b` is `False` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, no change occurs to the variables.
