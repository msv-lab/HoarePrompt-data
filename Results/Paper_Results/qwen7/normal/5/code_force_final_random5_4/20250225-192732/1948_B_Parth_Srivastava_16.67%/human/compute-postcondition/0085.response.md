Postcondition: `i` is 5, `x` is an integer value which is the remainder of `a[5]` divided by 10, `y` is `a[5]` divided by 10 as an integer, `c` contains either `[y, x]` or the element `a[5]` depending on whether `y` is less than or equal to `x`, and `n` is either `n + 2` or `n + 1` depending on the same condition.
