State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `k` is an input integer, `a` is converted to a list of integers where each integer is from the split string representation of `a`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `n` is 0, `c` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `len(a)` is greater than 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop variable `i` is initialized to 0 at the beginning of the loop.
2. The loop condition `range(len(a))` implies that the loop will iterate as long as `i` is less than `len(a)`.
3. For the loop to execute at least once, `len(a)` must be greater than 0. If `len(a)` is 0, the loop will not execute even once.
4. All other variables (`t`, `k`, `a`, `x`, `y`, `n`, `c`) do not affect the loop's execution and are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are `i` being 0 and `len(a)` being greater than 0.
