Output State: **`i` is 5; `x` is an integer value which is the remainder of `a[5]` divided by 10; `y` is `a[5]` divided by 10 as an integer; `c` contains the element `a[5]`; `n` is `n + 1`.**

The code `n = n + 1` increments the value of `n` by 1. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `n`, it is simply stated that `n` is incremented by 1. All other variables (`i`, `x`, `y`, `c`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
