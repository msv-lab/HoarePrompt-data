Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `x` is the last digit of `a[i]`, `y` is 0, `n` is 0, `c` is a list containing one additional element which is `a[i]`, `i` is greater than 0, `y` is 0, and the current value of `y` is less than the last element of `c`.**

The code `c.append(a[i])` appends the element `a[i]` to the list `c`. Since `c` was initially an empty list, after appending `a[i]`, `c` now contains one element, which is `a[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
