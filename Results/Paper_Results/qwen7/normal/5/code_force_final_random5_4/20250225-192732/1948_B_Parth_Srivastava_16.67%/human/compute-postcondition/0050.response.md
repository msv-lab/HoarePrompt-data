Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `x` is the last digit of `a[i]` if `a[i]` is greater than 10 and `i` is greater than 0, otherwise `x` is 0, `y` is 1 if `a[i]` is greater than 10 and `i` is greater than 0, otherwise `y` is 0, `n` is 2 if `a[i]` is greater than 10 and `i` is greater than 0, otherwise `n` is 1, `c` is a list containing either the value `x` or one additional element which is `a[i]` if `y` is greater than or equal to the last element of `c`, or `c` is a list containing either the values 0 and `x` or the element `a[0]` if `a[0]` is greater than 10, otherwise `c` is a list containing the element `a[0]`, `i` is 0 if `a[i]` is not greater than 10 or `i` is not greater than 0, and `len(a)` is greater than 0.
