#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains a single integer n such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 99.

    #State: All elements in the list `a` have been processed, `x` is the last digit of `a[len(a)-1]` if `a[len(a)-1]` is greater than 10 and `len(a) > 0`, otherwise `x` is 0, `y` is the integer division of `a[len(a)-1]` by 10, `n` is the total number of elements added to the list `c` during the loop, `c` contains the processed elements according to the rules defined in the loop, and `i` is equal to `len(a)`.
    d = sorted(c)
    if (c == d) :

    #State: `d` is a sorted version of `c`, `c` contains the processed elements according to the rules defined in the loop, `n` is the total number of elements added to the list `c` during the loop, `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `x` is the last digit of `a[len(a)-1]` if `a[len(a)-1]` is greater than 10 and `len(a) > 0`, otherwise `x` is 0, `y` is the integer division of `a[len(a)-1]` by 10, and `b` contains the element 0 if `c` is not equal to `d`, otherwise `b` contains the element 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each containing an integer n followed by n integers. It constructs a list `c` based on specific rules involving the last digits and integer divisions of these integers. After processing, it sorts the list `c` and checks if the original list `c` is equal to its sorted version. If they are equal, it appends 1 to the list `b`; otherwise, it appends 0. The function ultimately returns the list `b` which contains 1s and 0s indicating whether each test case resulted in a sorted list `c`.
