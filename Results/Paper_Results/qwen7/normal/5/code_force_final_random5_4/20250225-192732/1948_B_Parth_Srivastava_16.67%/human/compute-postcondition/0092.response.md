Output State: **`i` is 5, `x` is an integer value equal to `a[5] % 10`, `y` is `a[5] // 10`, `c` is a list containing the values `[y, x]`.**

Explanation: The code `c.append(x)` appends the value of `x` to the list `c`. Since `x` is already defined as `a[5] % 10` and `y` is defined as `a[5] // 10`, the list `c` now contains both `y` and `x`. Therefore, `c` becomes a list with the values `[y, x]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
