Output State: **`b` contains the element 1, `c` is equal to `d`, `n` is the total number of elements added to the list `c` during the loop, `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `x` is the last digit of `a[len(a)-1]` if `a[len(a)-1]` is greater than 10 and `len(a) > 0`, otherwise `x` is 0, `y` is the integer division of `a[len(a)-1]` by 10.**

Explanation: The code `b.append(1)` adds the integer 1 to the list `b`. The other variables (`c`, `n`, `i`, `x`, and `y`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
