Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `k` is an input integer, `a` is converted to a list of integers where each integer is from the split string representation of `a`, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `n` is 0, `c` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `len(a)` is greater than 0, and either `a[i]` is less than or equal to 10 or `i` is 0.
