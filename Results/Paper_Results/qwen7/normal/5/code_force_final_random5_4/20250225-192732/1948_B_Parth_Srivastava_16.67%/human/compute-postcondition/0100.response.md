Postcondition: `i` is 5, `x` is an integer value equal to `a[5] % 10`, `y` is `a[5] // 10`, `c` is a list containing either `[y, x]` if `y <= x`, or `a[5]`, and `n` is either `n + 2` or `n + 1` if `i == 0 and a[i] > 10`. If `i == 0 and a[i] <= 10`, then `c` contains `a[5]`, and `n` is 1 more than its initial value.
