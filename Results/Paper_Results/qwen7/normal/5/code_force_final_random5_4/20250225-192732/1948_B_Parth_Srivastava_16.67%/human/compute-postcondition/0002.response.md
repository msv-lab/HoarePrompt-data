Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `k` is an input integer, `a` is converted to a list of integers where each integer is from the split string representation of `a`.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, a.split()))` converts the string `a` into a list of integers. Each element in the original string `a` is split by spaces (or other specified delimiters) and then converted to an integer using the `map(int, ...)` function. The variable `t` and `k` remain unchanged.
