Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each containing an integer n followed by n integers. It constructs a list `c` based on specific rules involving the last digits and integer divisions of these integers. After processing, it sorts the list `c` and checks if the original list `c` is equal to its sorted version. If they are equal, it appends 1 to the list `b`; otherwise, it appends 0. The function ultimately returns the list `b` which contains 1s and 0s indicating whether each test case resulted in a sorted list `c`.**
