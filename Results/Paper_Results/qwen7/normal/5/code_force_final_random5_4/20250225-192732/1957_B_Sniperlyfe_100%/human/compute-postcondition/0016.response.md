Output State: **`i` is 3, `k` is `k - (min(nums[0] + 1, k) + nums[i])`, `nums[i]` is `min(nums[0] + 1, k)`**

Explanation: Initially, `i` is 3, `k` is updated to `k - min(nums[0] + 1, k)`, and `nums[i]` is `min(nums[0] + 1, k)`. After executing `k -= nums[i]`, `k` is further updated to `k - nums[i]`, which is equivalent to `k - (min(nums[0] + 1, k) + nums[i])`. The value of `nums[i]` remains unchanged as it is directly assigned and not altered by the subsequent operation.
