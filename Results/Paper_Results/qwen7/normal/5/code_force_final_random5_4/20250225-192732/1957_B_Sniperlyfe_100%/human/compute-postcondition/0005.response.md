Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0, `nums[i]` is `min(nums[0] + 1, k)`**

Explanation: The code updates `nums[i]` to be the minimum value between `nums[0] + 1` and `k`. Since `i` is initially 1, `nums[i]` becomes `min(nums[0] + 1, k)`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, and `k`) remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
