Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, `k` will be less than or equal to 0, and `nums` will contain `n` elements where the first element `nums[0]` is `(1 << (`k`.bit_length() - 1)) - 1`, and each subsequent element `nums[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n-1`) will be `min(nums[0] + 1, k)` if `k` was still positive after the previous iterations, otherwise `nums[i]` will be 0.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes, the index `i` will be equal to the length of the `nums` list (`n`), meaning the loop has processed all elements. The variable `k` will either be fully consumed (less than or equal to 0) or reduced to 0 during the last iteration if it couldn't be further decremented due to its value being smaller than `min(nums[0] + 1, k)`. The `nums` list will start with a specific value based on `k` and then each following element will be the minimum possible value `k` could take in each iteration, ensuring no further decrements are possible.
