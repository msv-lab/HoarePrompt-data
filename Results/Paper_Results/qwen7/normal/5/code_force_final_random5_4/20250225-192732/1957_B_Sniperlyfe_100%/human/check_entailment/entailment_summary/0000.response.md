Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and initializes an empty list `results` to store the results for each test case.
2. For each test case, it calls the function `func_1(n, k)` to generate the sequence of numbers and appends the result to `results`.
3. The function `func_1(n, k)` aims to create a sequence of `n` numbers that sum up to `k` while maximizing the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR.
4. The function starts by setting the first element `nums[0]` to `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1`, which is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`. This ensures that the first element contributes significantly to the bitwise OR result.
5. It then iterates through the rest of the list, setting each element to the minimum possible value that keeps `k` positive, ensuring that the total sum remains `k`.
6. Finally, any remaining value of `k` is added to `nums[0]` to ensure the sum constraint is met.

Given the execution summary, the function `func_1` seems to follow the logic described in the problem statement and should produce the correct output for the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
