Output State: **The program returns a list `nums` containing `n` elements. The first element `nums[0]` is `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1`, and each subsequent element `nums[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n-1`) is `0` since `k` is non-positive.**

This means the list `nums` will start with a specific value based on `k` and will be followed by `n-1` zeros.
