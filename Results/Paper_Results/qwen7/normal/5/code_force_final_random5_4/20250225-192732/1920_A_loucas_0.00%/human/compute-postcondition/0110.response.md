Output State: **`i` is `min(less)`, `max(big)` remains less than `min(less)`, and `num` is `i`.**

In this final output state, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be set to the value of `min(less)`. This is because the loop continues to increment `i` until it finds a value that is not in the list `no`. Since the condition `max(big) < min(less)` holds true, `i` will eventually reach `min(less)`. At this point, the loop breaks, setting `num` to the current value of `i`, which is `min(less)`.
