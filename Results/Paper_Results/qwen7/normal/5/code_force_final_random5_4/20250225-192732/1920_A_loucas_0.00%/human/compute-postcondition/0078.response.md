Output State: **`iterable2` is 1, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `big` is a list containing `[a]`**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `a` to the list `big`. Since `a` is an input integer, `big` becomes a list containing `[a]`. The values of `iterable2` and `x` remain unchanged.
