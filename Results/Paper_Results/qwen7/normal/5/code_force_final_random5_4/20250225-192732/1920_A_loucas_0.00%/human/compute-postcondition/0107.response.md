Output State: **`i` is `min(less)`, `max(big)` remains less than `min(less)`, `num` is `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it does not change the values of the variables `i`, `max(big)`, or `num`. It only indicates that the program will exit the current loop or conditional structure. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged, and the condition that `max(big)` remains less than `min(less)` is still valid.
