Output State: **`iterable2` is 0, `x` is an input integer and not equal to 2, `a` is an input integer, `no` is a list containing the value of `a`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `a` to the list `no`. Since `no` was initially not mentioned to exist, it is implied to be a new list created here. The values of `iterable2`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged, and now `no` contains the value of `a`.
