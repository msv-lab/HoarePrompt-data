Output State: **`less` contains at least one element, `big` contains at least one element, `max(big)` is greater than or equal to `min(less)`, and `num` is `max(big)`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `i` (which is `max(big)`) to the variable `num`. The other variables (`less`, `big`, and `min(less)`) remain unchanged. Therefore, `num` is now equal to `max(big)`, while the rest of the conditions and values remain the same as the initial state.
