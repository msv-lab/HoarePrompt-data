Output State: **`less` is an empty list, `big` contains exactly two elements, `no` contains up to one element, `iterable` is 2**

Explanation: The code `less = []` assigns an empty list to the variable `less`. This operation does not affect the values of `big`, `no`, or `iterable`. Therefore, the values of `big` and `no` remain unchanged, and `iterable` stays as 2.
