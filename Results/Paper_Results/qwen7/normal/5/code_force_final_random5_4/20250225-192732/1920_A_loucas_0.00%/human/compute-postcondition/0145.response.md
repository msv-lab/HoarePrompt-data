Postcondition: `i` is `min(less) + 1`, `max(big)` remains less than `min(less)`, `num` is either 0 or 1, `big` is a list containing `[a]`, `no` is a list containing `[a, a]`, `x` is the integer value of the first input split by space, `a` is the integer value of the second input split by space, `iterable2` is `min(less) + 2`, `innerLoop` remains unchanged, and if `x` equals 1, `less` is a list containing `[a]`; otherwise, `less` is a list containing `a` if `x` equals 2, or `no` is a list containing `[a]`.
