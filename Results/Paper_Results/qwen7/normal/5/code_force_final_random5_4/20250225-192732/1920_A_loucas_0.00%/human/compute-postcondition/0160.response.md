Output State: **`max(big)` must be less than `min(less)`, `i` is `max(big) + 2`, `num` is `max(big) + 2`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables but instead exits the innermost loop or conditional block. Since no variables are modified by the `break` statement, their previous values remain unchanged. Therefore, the conditions and values of `max(big)`, `i`, and `num` stay the same, and we simply note that we have broken out of the loop or conditional block.
