Output State: **`loop` is an input integer between 1 and 500, inclusive.**

Explanation: The code `loop = int(input())` takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable `loop`. The initial conditions for `t` and the constraints for `n` and the lines describing constraints remain unchanged. Therefore, `t` is still an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), and for each test case, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), with the constraints described as specified. The only change is that `loop` now holds the value of the input integer.
