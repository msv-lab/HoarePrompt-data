Output State: **`loop` must be an integer between 1 and 500, inclusive, `iterable` is 0, `less` is an empty list, `big` is a list containing `a`, `no` is an empty list, `num` is 0, `x` is 1, `a` is an input integer.**

The code appends the value of `a` (which is an input integer) to the list `big`. All other variables remain unchanged.
