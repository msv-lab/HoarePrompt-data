Output State: **`i` is `min(less) + 1`, `max(big)` remains less than `min(less)`, `num` is either 0 or 1, `big` is a list containing `[a]`, `no` is either an empty list or a list containing `[a]`, `x` is now an integer from the input split by space, `a` is now an integer from the input split by space, `iterable2` is `min(less) + 2`, `innerLoop` remains unchanged, and `x` is either equal to 1 or not equal to 1.**

Explanation: The code `big.append(a)` appends the value of `a` to the list `big`. Since `big` was either an empty list or a list containing `[a]` before the code execution, after appending `a`, `big` will contain `[a]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
