Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `big` will contain all unique integers `a` for which `x == 1` was true across all iterations, `no` will contain all unique integers `a` for which `x == 3` was true across all iterations, and `less` will contain all unique integers `a` for which `x == 2` was true across all iterations. The variable `iterable` will be equal to `loop - 1`, and `num` will be set to the smallest integer `i` such that `i > max(big)` and `i` is not in `no`. If no such integer exists, `num` will be `max(big) + 1` if `max(big) + 1` is not in `no`. The variable `innerLoop` will remain unchanged from its initial value across all iterations, and `x` and `a` will hold the last input values provided by the user during the final iteration of the loop.
