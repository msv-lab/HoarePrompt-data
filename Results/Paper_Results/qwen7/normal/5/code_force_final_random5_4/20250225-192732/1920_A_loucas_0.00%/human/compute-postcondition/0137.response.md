Postcondition: **`i` is `min(less) + 1`, `max(big)` remains less than `min(less)`, `num` is either 0 or 1, `big` is either an empty list or a list containing `[a]`, `no` is either an empty list or a list containing `[a]`, `x` is an integer from the input split by space, `a` is an integer from the input split by space, `iterable2` is `min(less) + 2`, `innerLoop` remains unchanged, and `less` is a list containing `a` if `x` equals 2, otherwise `no` is a list containing `[a]`.**
