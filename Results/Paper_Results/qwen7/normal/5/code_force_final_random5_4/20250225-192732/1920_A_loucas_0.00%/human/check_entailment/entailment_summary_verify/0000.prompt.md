You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

                break
        print(num)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of constraints defined by the user. For each test case, it categorizes integers into three lists based on their type (1, 2, or 3). After processing all constraints, it finds and prints the smallest integer greater than all integers in the 'big' list and less than all integers in the 'less' list, excluding integers in the 'no' list. If no such integer exists, it prints the maximum integer in the 'big' list.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the number of integers \( k \) that satisfy all the given constraints. Specifically, the program attempts to find a single integer \( k \) within the range defined by the maximum value from the "greater than or equal to" constraints and the minimum value from the "less than or equal to" constraints, excluding the values specified in the "not equal to" constraints. However, this approach fails to account for all possible valid ranges and combinations of constraints.

For example, consider the following test case:
- Constraints: 
  1. \( k \geq 3 \)
  2. \( k \leq 10 \)
  3. \( k \neq 1 \)
  4. \( k \neq 5 \)

The program will find the first integer \( k \) in the range [3, 10] that is not in the list of excluded values [1, 5]. In this case, the program will incorrectly return 3 as the answer because it finds the smallest integer in the range that is not excluded, rather than counting all valid integers in the range.

To correctly solve this problem, the program needs to handle all constraints and calculate the total number of valid integers \( k \) that satisfy all conditions, not just find a single valid integer.
