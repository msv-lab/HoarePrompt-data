Output State: **`less` contains at least one element, `big` contains at least one element, `max(big)` is greater than or equal to `min(less)`, and `i` is `max(big) + 1`, `num` is `max(big) + 1`**.

Explanation: The code `num = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is `max(big) + 1`) to the variable `num`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
