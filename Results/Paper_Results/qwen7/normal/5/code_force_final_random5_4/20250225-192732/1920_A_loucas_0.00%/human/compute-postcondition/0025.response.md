Output State: **`loop` is an integer between 1 and 500, inclusive, `iterable` is 1, `less` is either a list containing the input integer `a` or an empty list, `big` is a list containing the input integer `a`, `no` is either an empty list or a list containing `[a]`, `num` is 0, `x` is the first input integer, and `a` is the second input integer.**

Explanation: The code `big.append(a)` appends the value of `a` to the list `big`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `big` now contains the input integer `a`.
