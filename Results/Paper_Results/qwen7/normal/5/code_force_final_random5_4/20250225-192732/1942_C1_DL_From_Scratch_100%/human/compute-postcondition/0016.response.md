Postcondition: **`count` is 2, `T` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `x` is greater than 1, `y` is an input integer, `list0` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `i` is `i_end_prev + 1`, `num` is `list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1** if `num` equals 1. Otherwise, the values of `count`, `T`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `list0`, `i`, and `num` remain as they were before the if statement executes.
