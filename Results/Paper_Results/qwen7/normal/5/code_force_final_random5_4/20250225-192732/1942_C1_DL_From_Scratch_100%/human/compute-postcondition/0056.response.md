Postcondition: **The loop has executed \(x-1\) times, \(i\) starts from \(x-2\) and increments by 1 with each pass, \(num\) is calculated as \(list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1\), and \(count\) is the total number of times \(num\) was equal to 1 during the loop's execution. If \(num\) equals 1, \(count\) is incremented by 1.**
