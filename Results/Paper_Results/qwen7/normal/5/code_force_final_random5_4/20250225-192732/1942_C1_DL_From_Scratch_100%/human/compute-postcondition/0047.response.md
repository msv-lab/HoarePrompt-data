Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `x`.

2. **Understand the Postcondition**: 
   - After the previous iteration, `i` is `i_end_prev + 1`.
   - `num` is calculated as `list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1`.
   - If `num` equals 1, then `count` is increased by 1.

3. **Determine the New State for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `x - 1`.
   - From the postcondition, we know that `i` is now `i_end_prev + 1`.
   - Therefore, for the next iteration, `i` should be `i_end_prev + 2`.
   - Since `x` remains unchanged, the condition `i < x - 1` must still hold true.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` should be `i_end_prev + 2`.
   - `x` remains the same.
   - `num` and `count` are not directly adjusted by the loop head but are affected by the loop body, so they remain as they are unless explicitly mentioned to change.

5. **Final State**:
   - The state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated value of `i` and maintain the values of `x`, `num`, and `count` as they were at the end of the previous iteration (since they are not directly modified by the loop head).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is `i_end_prev + 2`, `x` is the same, `num` is `list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1`, if `num` equals 1, then `count` is increased by 1**.
