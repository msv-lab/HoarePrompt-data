Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers \( n \), \( x \), and \( y \). For each test case, it reads \( x \) distinct integers representing vertices and calculates the number of gaps of length 1 between consecutive vertices. Additionally, it checks the gap between the first and last vertex. The function returns the total count of such gaps for all test cases.**
