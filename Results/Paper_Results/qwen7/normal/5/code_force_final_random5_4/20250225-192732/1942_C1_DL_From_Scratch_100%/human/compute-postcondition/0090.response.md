Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes a series of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each test case, it receives integers n, x, and y (4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2⋅10^5), y = 0). The function then determines if the given x distinct integers (representing vertices) are valid based on the constraints and returns a boolean value indicating whether the conditions are met for each test case.**

Note: The actual processing logic is not described here, only the parameters and expected return value based on the given constraints.
