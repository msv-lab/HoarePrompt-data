Output State: `size` is 5, `overlap` is 2, `value` is 30, `i` is 3, `sequence` contains [2, 4, 6].

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = size - overlap - 1`, which means it will run from `i = 0` to `i = 3` (since `size - overlap` equals 3). After each iteration, `i` increases by 1, and `sequence` appends `i + overlap`. Therefore, after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be 3, and `sequence` will contain the values [2, 4, 6]. The other variables (`size`, `overlap`, and `value`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
