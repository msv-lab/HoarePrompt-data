Output State: **`i` must be set such that (1 << (i + 3)) - (1 << i) <= number and `size` is `i + 3`**

Explanation: The variable `size` was originally defined as `i + 2`. After executing `size += 1`, the value of `size` is incremented by 1, making it `i + 3`. The condition for `i` remains unchanged.
