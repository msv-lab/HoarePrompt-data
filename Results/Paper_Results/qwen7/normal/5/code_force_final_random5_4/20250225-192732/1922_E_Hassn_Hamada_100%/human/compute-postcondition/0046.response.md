Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is given by the expression `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) <= number`.

2. **Understand the variables involved in the loop condition**:
   - `size`: The value of `size` is `i + 2`.
   - `i`: The value of `i` is the maximum value in the sequence - 1.
   - `number`: The value of `number` must be at least \((1 << i) \cdot 7\).

3. **Analyze the loop condition**:
   - The loop will continue as long as \((1 << (size + 1)) - (1 << i) \leq number\).
   - Substituting `size = i + 2` into the condition, we get \((1 << (i + 3)) - (1 << i) \leq number\).
   - Simplifying the left side, we get \(8 \cdot (1 << i) - (1 << i) = 7 \cdot (1 << i)\).
   - Therefore, the condition becomes \(7 \cdot (1 << i) \leq number\).

4. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - The loop will continue as long as the above condition holds true.
   - Since `i` is fixed and `number` must be at least \((1 << i) \cdot 7\), the only way to ensure the loop continues is to ensure that `number` remains at least \(7 \cdot (1 << i)\).

5. **State the final modified state**:
   - The only state that needs to be adjusted is `number`, which must remain at least \(7 \cdot (1 << i)\).

Therefore, the modified state for the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is the maximum value in the sequence - 1; `size` is `i + 2`; `value` is \((1 << (i + 2)) - (1 << i)\); `number` must be at least \(7 \cdot (1 << i)\); `size_overlap` is a tuple containing `i + 1` and `i`**
