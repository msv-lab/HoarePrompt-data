Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is given by the expression `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) <= number`.

2. **Determine the variables in the loop head**: The variables involved in the loop condition are `size` and `i`.

3. **Analyze the current state**:
   - `i` is `max(sequence, default=0)`.
   - `size` is `i + 2`.
   - `value` is `(1 << (i + 2)) - (1 << max(sequence, default=0))`.

4. **Understand the loop condition**:
   - The expression `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i)` simplifies to `(1 << (i + 2 + 1)) - (1 << i) = (1 << (i + 3)) - (1 << i)`.
   - This means the loop continues as long as `(1 << (i + 3)) - (1 << i) <= number`.

5. **Determine what needs to change**:
   - For the loop to continue, the expression `(1 << (i + 3)) - (1 << i)` must still be less than or equal to `number`.
   - Since `i` and `size` are directly related (`size = i + 2`), changing `i` will directly affect `size`.

6. **Adjust the states**:
   - To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `i` must be such that the loop condition remains true.
   - Given the current values, `i` must be set to a value that keeps the expression valid.

Since `i` is `max(sequence, default=0)` and `size` is `i + 2`, we need to ensure that `i` is set in a way that the loop condition holds true for the next iteration.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `i` is set in a way that the loop condition remains true.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` must be set such that (1 << (i + 3)) - (1 << i) <= number and `size` is `i + 2`**.
