Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the `for i in range(size - overlap):` statement. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and the expression `size - overlap`.

2. **Determine the current values**:
   - `size` is 5
   - `overlap` is 2
   - `value` is 30 (this variable is not part of the loop head)
   - `i` is 1
   - `sequence` contains [2] (this variable is not part of the loop head)

3. **Calculate the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < size - overlap`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `size - overlap` is `5 - 2 = 3`. Therefore, the loop condition `i < 3` is true.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than 3, so `i` must be less than 3 for the loop to execute again.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`size` is 5, `overlap` is 2, `value` is 30, `i` is 2, `sequence` contains [2]**
