Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Identify Variables in the Loop Head
The loop head is:
```python
while (1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) <= number:
```
The variables involved in the loop head are `size` and `i`.

### Step 2: Analyze the Condition
The condition for the loop to execute is:
\[
(1 << (size + 1)) - (1 << i) \leq number
\]

### Step 3: Determine Initial Values
- `i` is set to `max(sequence, default=0)`.
- `size` is set to `i + 1`.
- `value` is set to `(1 << (i + 1)) - (1 << i)`.

### Step 4: Evaluate the Condition with Initial Values
Given the initial values:
- `i = max(sequence, default=0)`
- `size = i + 1`
- `value = (1 << (i + 1)) - (1 << i)`

We need to check if the condition \((1 << (size + 1)) - (1 << i) \leq number\) holds true with these initial values.

Substitute `size = i + 1` into the condition:
\[
(1 << ((i + 1) + 1)) - (1 << i) \leq number
\]
Simplify:
\[
(1 << (i + 2)) - (1 << i) \leq number
\]

### Step 5: Simplify the Expression
Using properties of bitwise shift operators:
\[
(1 << (i + 2)) = 4 \times (1 << i)
\]
So the condition becomes:
\[
4 \times (1 << i) - (1 << i) \leq number
\]
Simplify further:
\[
3 \times (1 << i) \leq number
\]

### Step 6: Ensure the Condition Holds
For the loop to execute at least once, the condition \(3 \times (1 << i) \leq number\) must hold true with the initial values of `i` and `size`.

### Step 7: Adjust the State
Since the only variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `size`, and we need to ensure the condition holds, we need to make sure that \(3 \times (1 << i) \leq number\) is true.

Given the initial value of `i` is `max(sequence, default=0)`, we need to ensure that:
\[
3 \times (1 << i) \leq number
\]

### Final Answer
The state right before the loop should be adjusted to ensure the condition holds. Therefore, the final answer is:

State: **`i` is `max(sequence, default=0)`, `size` is `i + 1`, and \(3 \times (1 << i) \leq number\)**
