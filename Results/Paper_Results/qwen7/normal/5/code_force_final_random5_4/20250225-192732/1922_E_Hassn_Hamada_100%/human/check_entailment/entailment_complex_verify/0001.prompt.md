You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

    #Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = size - overlap - 1`, which means it will run from `i = 0` to `i = 3` (since `size` is 5 and `overlap` is 2). After the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be 3. The `sequence` list will contain the values `[2, 4, 6]`, as each iteration appends `i + overlap` to the list, starting from `2` (when `i = 0`) and ending with `6` (when `i = 3`).
    func_1(number - (1 << size) + (1 << overlap), sequence)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `number`, an integer between 1 and 1000, and `sequence`, a list of integers. It generates a new sequence based on the input `number` and modifies the `sequence` list by appending specific values to it. Finally, it recursively calls itself with updated parameters until `number` becomes 0, at which point it returns the tuple (0, 0).


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer \( X \).

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is supposed to generate a sequence based on the input number.
   - It uses bitwise operations to construct the sequence.
   - The goal is to ensure the generated sequence has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.

3. **Bitwise Operations**:
   - The function iterates over possible values and uses bitwise shifts to calculate the size and value of the sequence.
   - It ensures that the constructed sequence meets the criteria for having exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.

4. **Sequence Construction**:
   - The sequence is built by appending values based on the calculated size and overlap.
   - The sequence is recursively constructed until the required number of increasing subsequences is met.

5. **Output**:
   - The length of the sequence is printed.
   - The sequence itself is printed, space-separated.

### Testing the Functionality:

To verify the correctness, we need to check if the function correctly generates sequences with the specified number of increasing subsequences.

#### Example Test Cases:

1. **Test Case 1: \( X = 2 \)**
   - Expected Output: `1 0`
   - Explanation: An array `[0]` has exactly 2 increasing subsequences: `[]` and `[0]`.

2. **Test Case 2: \( X = 5 \)**
   - Expected Output: `3 0 1 0`
   - Explanation: An array `[0, 1, 0]` has exactly 5 increasing subsequences: `[]`, `[0]`, `[1]`, `[0, 1]`, and `[0, 1, 0]`.

3. **Test Case 3: \( X = 13 \)**
   - Expected Output: `5 2 2 3 4 2`
   - Explanation: An array `[2, 2, 3, 4, 2]` has exactly 13 increasing subsequences.

4. **Test Case 4: \( X = 37 \)**
   - Expected Output: `7 -1 -1 0 0 2 3 -1`
   - Explanation: An array `[-1, -1, 0, 0, 2, 3, -1]` has exactly 37 increasing subsequences.

### Verification:

By running the provided test cases through the program, we can see that the function correctly generates sequences with the specified number of increasing subsequences.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis and testing, the program appears to be correct in generating arrays with the specified number of increasing subsequences.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
