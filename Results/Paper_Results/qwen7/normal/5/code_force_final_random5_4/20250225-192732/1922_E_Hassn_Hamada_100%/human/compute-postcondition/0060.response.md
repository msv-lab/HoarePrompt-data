Output State: **`size` is 5, `overlap` is 2, and `value` is 30**.

Explanation: The code `size, overlap = size_overlap` unpacks the tuple `size_overlap` into the variables `size` and `overlap`. Given the initial state where `size_overlap` is `(5, 2)`, the values of `size` and `overlap` are set to 5 and 2 respectively. The variable `value` remains unchanged with its initial value of 30.
