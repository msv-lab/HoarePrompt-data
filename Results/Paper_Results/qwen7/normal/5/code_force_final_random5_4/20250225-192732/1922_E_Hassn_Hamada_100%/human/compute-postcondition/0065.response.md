Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(size - overlap)`. The variables involved in this loop head are `i`, `size`, and `overlap`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `size` is 5
   - `overlap` is 2
   - `value` is 30 (not relevant to the loop head)
   - `i` is 2
   - `sequence` contains [2, 4] (not relevant to the loop head)

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < size - overlap`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, and `size - overlap` is `5 - 2 = 3`. Therefore, the loop can continue if `i` is less than 3.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 2, it will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration, making `i` equal to 3.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `size - overlap`, which is 3. Therefore, `i` should be 3, and `size - overlap` remains 3.

5. **Construct the new state**:
   - `size` remains 5
   - `overlap` remains 2
   - `i` becomes 3
   - `value` and `sequence` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head

Based on these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`size` is 5, `overlap` is 2, `i` is 3**
