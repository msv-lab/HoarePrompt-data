Output State: **`i` is the maximum value in the sequence - 1; `size` is `i + 3`; `value` is \((1 << (i + 2)) - (1 << i)\); `number` must be at least \(7 \cdot (1 << i)\); `size_overlap` is a tuple containing `i + 1` and `i`.**

Explanation: The code `size += 1` increments the value of `size` by 1. Initially, `size` was `i + 2`, so after the increment, `size` becomes `i + 3`. All other variables (`i`, `value`, `number`, and `size_overlap`) remain unchanged.
