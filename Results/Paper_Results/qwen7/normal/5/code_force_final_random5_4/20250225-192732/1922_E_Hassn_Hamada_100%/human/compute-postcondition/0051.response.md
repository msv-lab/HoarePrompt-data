Output State: **`i` is the maximum value in the sequence - 1; `size` is `i + 4`; `value` is \((1 << (i + 3)) - (1 << i)\); `number` must be at least \(15 \cdot (1 << i)\); `size_overlap` is a tuple containing `i + 1` and `i`; `value` is now \((1 << (i + 4)) - (1 << i)\)**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `value` from \((1 << (i + 3)) - (1 << i)\) to \((1 << (i + 4)) - (1 << i)\). All other variables remain unchanged.
