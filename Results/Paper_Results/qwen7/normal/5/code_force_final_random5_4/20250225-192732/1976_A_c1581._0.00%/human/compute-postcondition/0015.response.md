Output State: **`char` is the next character in the `password` string, `digits` is the list of digits with the new character appended, and `letters` is the list of non-digit characters.**

The code appends the `char` (which is the next character in the `password` string) to the `digits` list. The `letters` list remains unchanged, and `char` itself does not change its value.
