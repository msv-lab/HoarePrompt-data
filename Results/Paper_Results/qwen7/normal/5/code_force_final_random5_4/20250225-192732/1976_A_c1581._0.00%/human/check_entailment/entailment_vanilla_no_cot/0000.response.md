Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to check if a password meets the specified conditions. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and then splits it into a list of strings. This approach handles multiple test cases efficiently.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**: For each test case, it extracts the necessary information (length of the password and the password itself) and passes it to the function `func_1`.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It separates the password into digits and letters.
   - It checks if any digit appears after a letter by tracking the last digit index.
   - It sorts the digits and letters separately and compares them with their sorted versions to ensure they are in non-decreasing order.
   - If any condition fails, it returns 'NO'.
   - If all conditions pass, it returns 'YES'.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program correctly determines whether a password is strong according to the specified rules. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.
