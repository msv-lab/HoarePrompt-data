Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop is iterating over each character in the `password` string. The loop variable `char` is used to access each character one by one.

2. **Determine the initial state of the loop**: 
   - `password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.
   - `digits` is an empty list.
   - `letters` is an empty list.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are characters left in the `password` string. Once all characters have been processed, the loop will terminate.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop iterates over each character in `password`, the first character of `password` will be assigned to `char` in the first iteration.
   - The `digits` and `letters` lists remain unchanged within the loop head, so their initial states are correct.

5. **Final state before the loop execution**:
   - `password` is a string with `n` characters.
   - `digits` is an empty list.
   - `letters` is an empty list.
   - The first character of `password` will be assigned to `char` in the first iteration.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the first character of the `password` string being assigned to `char`.

**State:**
**`total` is irrelevant here, `password` is a string with `n` characters, `digits` is an empty list, `letters` is an empty list, and `char` is the first character of `password`.**

However, since `total` is not relevant to the loop execution, we can simplify the answer to focus on the necessary adjustments:

**State:**
**`password` is a string with `n` characters, `digits` is an empty list, `letters` is an empty list, and `char` is the first character of `password`.**
