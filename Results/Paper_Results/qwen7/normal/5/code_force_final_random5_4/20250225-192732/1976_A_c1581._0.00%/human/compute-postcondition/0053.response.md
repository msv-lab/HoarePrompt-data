The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `password`. `password` is a string consisting of exactly n characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit. The function does not provide any specific condition to differentiate between the cases mentioned, other than returning 'YES' in one of the cases and 'NO' in all other cases. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `password` and return 'YES' under unspecified conditions, and 'NO' otherwise.

Functionality: **The function accepts a password string and returns 'YES' under unspecified conditions, and 'NO' otherwise.**
