Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for char in password:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `char`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are characters left in the `password` string.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `char` is a character.
   - If `char` is a digit, it is added to the list `digits`.
   - If `char` is a non-digit character, it is added to the list `letters`.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over each character in `password`, at the end of the previous iteration, `char` has been processed.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another character in `password` to process.

5. **Adjust the State**:
   - `char` will be the next character in the `password` string.
   - `digits` and `letters` lists will remain the same unless the current `char` was a digit or a non-digit, respectively.

Given the above steps, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `char` will be the next character in the `password` string.
- `digits` and `letters` lists will remain unchanged from the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`char` is the next character in the `password` string, `digits` is the list of digits, `letters` is the list of non-digit characters**.
