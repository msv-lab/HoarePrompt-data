Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits the data into a list. It then processes the test cases one by one.
2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function correctly separates the characters into `digits` and `letters`.
   - It checks if there is a digit followed by a letter after the last digit. If such a sequence is found, it returns 'NO'.
   - It then checks if the digits are sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns 'NO'.
   - Finally, it checks if the letters are sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns 'NO'.
   - If all checks pass, it returns 'YES'.

The logic in the function `func_1` aligns with the problem statement requirements. There are no logical errors or missing conditions in the implementation.

Correctness: **True**
