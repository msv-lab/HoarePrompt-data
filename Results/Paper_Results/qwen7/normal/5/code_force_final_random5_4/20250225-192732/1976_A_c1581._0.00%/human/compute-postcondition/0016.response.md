Output State: **`char` is appended to the `letters` list, `digits` remains the same list of digits, and `letters` now contains all its previous non-digit characters plus the new `char`.**

This means that the `char` which was the next character in the `password` string has been added to the `letters` list, while the `digits` list remains unchanged.
