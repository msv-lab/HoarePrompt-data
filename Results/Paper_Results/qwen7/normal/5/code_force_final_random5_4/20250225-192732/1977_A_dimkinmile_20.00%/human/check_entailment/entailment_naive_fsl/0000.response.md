Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the cases where the number of moves `n` is odd and the desired number of cubes `m` is less than `n`. According to the problem description, Nikita can either add or remove one cube per move. Therefore, after an odd number of moves, the parity (odd/even nature) of the number of cubes will be different from the initial state (which starts with 0 cubes, an even number).

For example, consider the test case where `n = 5` and `m = 2`. Since `n` is odd, the final number of cubes should be odd (starting from 0, adding or removing one cube 5 times results in an odd number of cubes), but the program incorrectly outputs "Yes" because it only checks if `n >= m`.

To fix this, the program should check the parity of `n` and ensure that `m` has the same parity as `n` (both odd or both even). Here's a corrected version:

```python
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if n >= m and (n % 2 == m % 2):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

This version ensures that the final number of cubes matches the parity required by the number of moves.
