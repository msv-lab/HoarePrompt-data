Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.
3. It checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`. If true, it prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".
4. The logic implemented in `func_1()` matches the problem statement perfectly.
5. There are no logical errors or missing steps in the implementation.

Given this analysis, the program is correct according to the problem description and the provided execution states.

Correctness: **True**
