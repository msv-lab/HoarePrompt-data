### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program implements the logic required to solve the problem. Let's break down the key points:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`kreker`) and then processes each test case by calling `func_1()` for `kreker` iterations.
   - This ensures that all test cases are handled as specified in the problem description.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes two integers `n` and `m` as input.
   - It checks if `n` (the number of moves) is greater than or equal to `m` (the desired number of cubes).
   - Based on this condition, it prints 'Yes' or 'No' accordingly.
   - The function summary provided accurately describes the behavior of `func_1`.

3. **Logic Correctness:**
   - The logic inside `func_1` is correct. Since each move can either add or remove exactly one cube, having `n` moves guarantees that it is possible to end up with `m` cubes if and only if `n >= m`.

4. **Output Format:**
   - The output format matches the problem statement requirements, printing 'Yes' or 'No' without quotes and allowing case-insensitive responses.

Given these points, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic and handles the input and output as specified.
