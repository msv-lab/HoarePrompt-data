### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies the logic and flow of the program. Let's break down the key points to ensure the assessment is accurate:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`kreker`) and then iterates over each test case, calling `func_1()` for each one.
   - This ensures that all test cases are processed, matching the problem statement.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input.
   - It checks if `n` (number of moves) is greater than or equal to `m` (desired number of cubes).
   - If the condition is met, it prints 'Yes', indicating it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
   - If the condition is not met, it prints 'No', indicating it is not possible.

3. **Logic Correctness:**
   - The logic in `func_1` is sound. If `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, it is indeed possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves by simply adding `m` cubes and then possibly removing the excess.
   - If `n` is less than `m`, it is impossible to have exactly `m` cubes because there are not enough moves to add `m` cubes.

4. **Annotations:**
   - The annotations provided correctly describe the state of the program before and after the function call.
   - They confirm that the function processes the input correctly and prints the appropriate output without modifying the input values.

Given these points, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.
