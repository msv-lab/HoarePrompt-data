Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop condition is `i < n`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `total` is the sum of all elements in `nums`.
   - `n` is the length of `nums`.
   - `total % n == 0`.
   - `mean` is `total // n`.
   - `curr` is `nums[0] - mean`.
   - `i` is `1`.
   - `curr` is greater than or equal to 0.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently `1`, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `2`.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is the length of `nums`.

5. **Other Variables**:
   - `total`, `mean`, `curr`, and `nums` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted based on the loop condition alone.

Therefore, the only adjustments needed are to the variable `i`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`total` is the sum of all elements in `nums`, `n` is the length of `nums`, `total % n == 0`, `mean` is `total // n`, `curr` is `nums[0] - mean`, `i` is `2`, and `curr` is greater than or equal to 0**
