### Reasoning

Let's analyze the program step-by-step to ensure its correctness based on the problem description and the annotated code.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - This part is handled correctly by the outer loop.

2. **Sum Check**:
   - The program calculates the total amount of water and checks if it is divisible by `n`.
   - If the total is not divisible by `n`, it immediately returns 'NO'.
   - This is correctly implemented as `if total % n != 0: return 'NO'`.

3. **Mean Calculation**:
   - The program computes the mean amount of water per container as `mean = total // n`.
   - This calculation is correct and necessary for determining the target amount of water each container should have.

4. **Balance Check**:
   - The program iterates through the list of water amounts and ensures that the cumulative difference between the current sum and the mean remains non-negative.
   - This is done by maintaining a running sum `curr` initialized to 0.
   - During each iteration, `curr` is updated by adding `nums[i] - mean`.
   - If at any point `curr` becomes negative, the program returns 'NO'.
   - If the loop completes without finding a negative `curr`, the program returns 'YES'.

### Detailed Analysis

- **Initial State**: Before entering the function `func_1`, `nums` is a list of integers representing the amounts of water in each container, where the length of `nums` is `n` and the sum of the integers in `nums` is divisible by `n`.
- **Function Logic**:
  - The function first checks if the total sum of water is divisible by `n`. If not, it returns 'NO'.
  - If the sum is divisible, it calculates the mean amount of water per container.
  - It then iterates through the list `nums` and maintains a running sum `curr` of the differences between each element and the mean.
  - If at any point `curr` becomes negative, it means that it is impossible to balance the water amounts to the mean value, and the function returns 'NO'.
  - If the loop completes without finding a negative `curr`, it means that it is possible to balance the water amounts to the mean value, and the function returns 'YES'.

### Conclusion

Based on the detailed analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required to determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same. The program checks the divisibility condition, calculates the mean, and ensures that the cumulative difference remains non-negative throughout the process.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
