Output State: **`total` is the sum of all elements in `nums`, `n` is the length of `nums`, `total % n == 0`, `mean` is `total // n`, `curr` is `nums[2] - mean`, `i` is `3`, and `curr` is greater than or equal to 0.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `curr` by adding the difference between `nums[2]` and `mean`. Initially, `curr` was `nums[0] - mean`. After the code executes, `curr` becomes `nums[0] - mean + (nums[2] - mean)`, which simplifies to `nums[2] - mean`. The value of `i` is updated to `i + 1`, which is `3`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
