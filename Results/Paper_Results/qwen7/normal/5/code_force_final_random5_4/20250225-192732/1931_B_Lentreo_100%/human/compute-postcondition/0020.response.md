Output State: **`total` is the sum of all elements in `nums`, `n` is the length of `nums`, `total % n == 0`, `mean` is `total // n`, `curr` is `nums[2] + (nums[4] - mean) - mean`, `i` is 4**.

Explanation: The value of `curr` is updated by adding `nums[i] - mean` to its current value. Given that `i` is 4, `curr` becomes `nums[2] - mean + nums[4] - mean`. The other variables remain unchanged.
