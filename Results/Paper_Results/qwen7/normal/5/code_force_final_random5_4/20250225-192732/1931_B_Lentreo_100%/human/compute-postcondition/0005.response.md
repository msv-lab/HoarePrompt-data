Output State: **`n` is the length of `nums`, `total` is the sum of all elements in `nums`, `total % n == 0`, and `mean` is `total // n`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the mean (average) of the list `nums` by dividing the total sum of all elements in `nums` by the length of `nums`. Since `total` is the sum of all elements in `nums` and `total % n == 0`, the division `total // n` results in an integer value, which is assigned to the variable `mean`. All other variables retain their initial conditions.
