Output State: **`total` is the sum of all elements in `nums`, `n` is the length of `nums`, `total % n == 0`, `mean` is `total // n`, `curr` is `nums[0] - mean`, `i` is `1`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `curr` by adding `nums[i] - mean` to `curr`. Initially, `i` is 0, so `curr` is updated to `nums[0] - mean`. After this update, `i` is incremented to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
