Output State: **`n` is the length of `nums`, `total` is the sum of all elements in `nums`, `total % n == 0`, `mean` is `total // n`, and `curr` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `curr` to 0. The values of `n`, `total`, `total % n == 0`, and `mean` remain unchanged from their initial states.
