### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies the key insight that if the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers, it is always possible to distribute the water evenly among all containers. However, there are a few points to verify and ensure the correctness of the provided solution:

1. **Initial Check**: The function starts by checking if the total amount of water (`total`) is divisible by the number of containers (`n`). If not, it immediately returns 'NO'. This is correct because if the total is not divisible by `n`, it is impossible to distribute the water evenly.

2. **Mean Calculation**: The mean amount of water per container is calculated as `mean = total // n`. This is correct because it represents the target amount of water each container should have if the water is distributed evenly.

3. **Running Difference**: The variable `curr` keeps track of the difference between the current total amount of water and the target total amount of water (`n * mean`). If at any point `curr` becomes negative, it indicates that the distribution is not possible, and the function returns 'NO'. This is correct because a negative `curr` would imply that the total amount of water in some containers exceeds the target, making it impossible to balance the water evenly.

4. **Loop Completion**: If the loop completes without finding a negative `curr`, the function returns 'YES'. This is correct because it means the water can be distributed evenly.

Given the above points, the provided solution correctly implements the logic to determine if the water can be distributed evenly among the containers.
