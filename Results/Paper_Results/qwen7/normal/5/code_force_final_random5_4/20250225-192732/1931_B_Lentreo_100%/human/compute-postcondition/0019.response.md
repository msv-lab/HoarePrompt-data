Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `total` is the sum of all elements in `nums`.
   - `n` is the length of `nums`.
   - `total % n == 0`.
   - `mean` is `total // n`.
   - `curr` is `nums[2] - mean`.
   - `i` is `3`.

3. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop iterates over `range(n)`, meaning it will continue as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 from its current value (3) to 4.
   - `n` remains unchanged.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `total` remains unchanged.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `total % n == 0` remains unchanged.
   - `mean` remains unchanged.
   - `curr` remains unchanged.
   - `i` becomes 4.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`total` is the sum of all elements in `nums`, `n` is the length of `nums`, `total % n == 0`, `mean` is `total // n`, `curr` is `nums[2] - mean`, `i` is 4**.
