Output State: `total` is the sum of all elements in `nums`, `n` is the length of `nums`, `total % n == 0`, `mean` is `total // n`, `curr` is the sum of `nums[i] - mean` for all `i` from `0` to `n-1`, `i` is `n`, and if `curr < 0`, the function returns 'NO'. Otherwise, the function continues without returning anything.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `curr` will hold the cumulative sum of each element in `nums` minus the mean, for all elements in the list. The variable `i` will be equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. If at any point during these iterations `curr` becomes less than 0, the function will return 'NO' immediately. If the loop completes without `curr` becoming negative, the function will continue without returning anything, meaning it will return `None` by default.
