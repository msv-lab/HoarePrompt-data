Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, representing the length of the array `a`. The following `n` integers represent the elements of array `a`, where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6 for all valid `i`. The function `input = sys.stdin.read` is assigned to read all input from stdin at once.**

This line of code changes how the input is read, setting `input` to a function that reads all standard input at once instead of reading line by line. However, the values of `t`, `n`, and the elements of array `a` remain unchanged.
