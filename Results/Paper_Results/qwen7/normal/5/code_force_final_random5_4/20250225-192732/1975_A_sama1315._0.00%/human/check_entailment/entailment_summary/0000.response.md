Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by splitting it into two parts and swapping them.
2. The provided code consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
3. `func_1` checks if the array is already sorted or if there's at least one element that is greater than the next element. However, this function does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It simply checks if the array is sorted or has at least one pair of elements where the first is greater than the second, which is not sufficient for the problem's requirements.
4. `func_2` reads input, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case. However, since `func_1` does not correctly implement the required logic, `func_2` will not produce the correct results.
5. Based on the examples provided in the problem statement, the correct approach would involve checking if the array can be split into two parts such that the first part is non-decreasing and the second part is non-increasing, or vice versa.
6. The given `func_1` does not check for this specific condition and thus will not provide the correct results for the problem.

Given the above reasoning, the provided functions do not correctly solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
