Output State: **`index` is 9 + n + n, `t` is greater than 0, `results` is a list with two additional elements which are `result`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained by converting elements from `data` using `map(int, data[index:index + n])`, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(arr)`**

Explanation: The value of `index` is incremented by 1, changing its value from `8 + n + n` to `9 + n + n`. The other variables (`t`, `results`, `arr`, `n`, and `result`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
