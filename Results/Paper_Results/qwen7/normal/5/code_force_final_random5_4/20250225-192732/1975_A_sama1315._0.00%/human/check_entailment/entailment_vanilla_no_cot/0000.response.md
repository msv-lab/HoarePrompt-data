Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The `func_1` function checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order but does not account for the possibility of sorting the array through the specified operation (splitting and swapping parts). The `func_2` function reads input and processes multiple test cases, but it relies on `func_1`, which is insufficient for solving the problem as described.

To correctly solve the problem, you need to check if the array can be split and swapped in such a way that it becomes non-decreasing. This involves checking if there exists a point in the array where the subarray from that point to the end is non-decreasing when placed before the subarray up to that point.
