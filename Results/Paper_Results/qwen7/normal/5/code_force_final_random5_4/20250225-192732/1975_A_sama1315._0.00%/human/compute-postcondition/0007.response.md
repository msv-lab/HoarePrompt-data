Output State: **`index` is 3, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer value from `data[2]`**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(data[index])` assigns the value of `data[index]` (which is `data[2]` given the initial state) to `n` after converting it to an integer. The value of `index` is updated to `index + 1` because the next element in the list `data` is accessed. The values of `t` and `results` remain unchanged.
