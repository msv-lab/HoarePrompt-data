Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the required functionality. Specifically, `func_1` checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order but does not account for the possibility of rearranging the array through the described operation. 

Consider the following test case:
- Input: `[1, 3, 2]`
- Expected Output: `Yes` (We can split the array into `[1]` and `[3, 2]`, then swap them to get `[3, 2, 1]`, and further split `[3, 2]` into `[3]` and `[2]`, then swap them to get `[2, 3, 1]`, and finally split `[2, 3]` into `[2]` and `[3]`, then swap them to get `[2, 3, 1]`, which is not sorted but we can continue until it is sorted.)

However, the function `func_1` will return `No` because it only checks if the array is already sorted without considering the possibility of rearranging through the described operation.

Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly and hence is incorrect.
