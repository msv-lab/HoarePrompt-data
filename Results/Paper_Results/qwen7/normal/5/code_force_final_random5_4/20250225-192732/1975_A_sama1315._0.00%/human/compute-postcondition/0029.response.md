Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, followed by `t` sets of data. Each set includes an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the length of an array `a`, and `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) representing the elements of the array `a`. The function returns different outputs based on the conditions specified for each test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple scenarios (test cases) where it first takes an integer `t` indicating how many test cases to process. Then, for each test case, it takes an integer `n` and an array `a` of length `n`, and based on some unspecified conditions, it provides a specific output for each test case.
