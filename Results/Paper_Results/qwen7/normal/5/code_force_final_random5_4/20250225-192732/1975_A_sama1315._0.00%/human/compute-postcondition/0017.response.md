Output State: **`index` is 8 + `n` + `n`, `t` is greater than 0, `results` is a list with one additional element which is `result`, `n` is an integer value from `data[index-1]`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained by converting elements from `data` using `map(int, data[index:index + n])**.

Explanation: The value of `index` is updated by adding `n` to its current value, making it `8 + n + n`. The other variables remain unchanged as the code only modifies `index`.
