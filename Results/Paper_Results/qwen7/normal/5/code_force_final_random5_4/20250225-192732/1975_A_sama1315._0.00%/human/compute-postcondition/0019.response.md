Output State: **`index` is 8 + `n` + `n`, `t` is greater than 0, `results` is a list with two additional elements which are `result`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained by converting elements from `data` using `map(int, data[index:index + n])`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(arr)`**

Explanation: The code snippet appends the `result` to the `results` list. Since `results` was initially a list with one additional element, after appending `result`, it now contains two additional elements. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
