Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string received from stdin.**

Explanation: The code `data = input().split()` reads all input from stdin at once using `input()`, which is equivalent to `sys.stdin.read()`, and then splits the input string into a list of strings using the `split()` method. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and the variable `data` now holds the split input as a list of strings.
