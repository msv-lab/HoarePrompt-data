Output State: **`index` is 2, `t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, `results` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list named `results`. The values of `index` and `t` remain unchanged from their initial states. The variable `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting an input string, but its contents are not altered by this line of code.
