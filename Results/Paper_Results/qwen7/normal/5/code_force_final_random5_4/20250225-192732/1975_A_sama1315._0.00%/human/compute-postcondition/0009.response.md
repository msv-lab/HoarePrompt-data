Output State: **`index` is 7, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from `data[4:7]`.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `arr` by converting the elements from `data` starting at index `index` (which is 4) and ending at `index + n` (where `n` is the integer value from `data[2]`). Since `index` was 4, and `n` is the integer from `data[2]`, `arr` contains the elements from `data[4]` to `data[6]` (inclusive). The values of `index`, `t`, and `results` remain unchanged, but `arr` is now a list of integers derived from the specified slice of `data`.
