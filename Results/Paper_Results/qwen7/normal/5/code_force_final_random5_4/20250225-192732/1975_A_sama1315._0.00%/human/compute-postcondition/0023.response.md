Output State: **`index` is 9 + n + n, `t` is greater than 0, `results` is a list with two additional elements which are `result`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained by converting elements from `data` using `map(int, data[index:index + n])`, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(arr)`, `arr` is updated to be a list of integers obtained by converting elements from `data` using `map(int, data[index:index + n])`**.

Explanation: The code updates the variable `arr` to be a list of integers obtained by converting elements from `data` using `map(int, data[index:index + n])`. The values of `index`, `t`, `results`, `n`, and `result` remain unchanged from their initial states.
