Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each test case, x is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8 and n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ x.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    x, n = map(int, input().split())
    k = x // n
    if k == 1:
        print(1)
        continue
    ans = 1
    for i in range(1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0), int(x ** 0.5) + 1, 2):
        if x % i == 0:
            l = [ans]
            if i <= k:
                l.append(i)
            if x // i <= k:
                l.append(x // i)
            ans = max(l)
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After all iterations of the loop, `ans` will hold the maximum value among all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to `k`, and possibly their corresponding quotient when divided into `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `x` is an input integer, `i` is the largest odd integer less than or equal to the square root of `x`, `l` is a list containing the elements `ans` (which is the maximum divisor found during the loop's execution), `i`, and if `x % i == 0`, then `x // i` is appended to the list `l`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be the largest odd integer less than or equal to the square root of `x`. The variable `ans` will hold the maximum divisor found during the loop's execution, which is either one of the divisors of `x` or `x` itself if it is a prime number. The list `l` will contain `ans` and all other divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to `k` (where `k` is initially set as `x // n` but is not directly used in the loop logic).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The final value of `ans` is the maximum value found during all iterations, `i` is the largest odd integer less than or equal to the square root of `x` after all iterations, and `l` is a list containing `[ans, i, x // i]` if `x // i` is less than or equal to `k` and `x % i == 0`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
