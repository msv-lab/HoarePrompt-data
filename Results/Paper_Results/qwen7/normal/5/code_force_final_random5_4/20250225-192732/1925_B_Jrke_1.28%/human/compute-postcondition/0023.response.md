Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and the expression used to determine the range of `i`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for values of `i` starting from `1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0)` and increments by 2 until `i` is less than or equal to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `x` is an integer.
   - `i` is a divisor of `x`.
   - `l` is a list.
   - If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, then `l` contains three elements `['ans', i, x // i]`, where `ans` is the maximum value among the elements in `l`.
   - If `i` is greater than `k`, then `l` remains as `['ans']`, where `ans` is the maximum value among the elements in `l`.

4. **Check the loop condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will continue if `i` is less than or equal to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.
   - Since `i` is a divisor of `x` and it is incremented by 2, the next value of `i` will be `i + 2`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 2.
   - `l` will remain as `['ans']` if `i` is greater than `k`, or it will update to `['ans', i, x // i]` if `i` is less than or equal to `k`.

Given that `i` is a divisor of `x` and it is incremented by 2, let's assume the previous value of `i` was `i_prev`. The next value of `i` will be `i_prev + 2`.

Since the loop continues based on the value of `i` and the condition `i <= int(x ** 0.5) + 1`, we need to ensure that the new value of `i` is still within this range.

**State at the start of the next iteration**:
- `i` will be `i_prev + 2`.
- `l` will remain as `['ans']` if `i_prev + 2 > k`, or it will update to `['ans', i_prev + 2, x // (i_prev + 2)]` if `i_prev + 2 <= k`.

However, since we don't know the exact value of `i_prev` or `k`, we can generalize the state as follows:

State: **`x` is an integer, `i` is a divisor of `x`, `l` is a list, and `i` must be less than or equal to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.**

To provide a concrete example, let's assume the previous value of `i` was 2 (a divisor of `x`), and `k` is 5. Then the next value of `i` would be 4, and `l` would remain as `['ans']` if `4 > 5`, or it would update to `['ans', 4, x // 4]` if `4 <= 5`.

State: **`x` is an integer, `i` is a divisor of `x`, and `l` is a list. If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, then `l` contains three elements `['ans', i, x // i]`, where `ans` is the maximum value among the elements in `l`. If `i` is greater than `k`, then `l` remains as `['ans']`, where `ans` is the maximum value among the elements in `l`.**

Thus, the final state is:

State: **`x` is an integer, `i` is a divisor of `x`, and `l` is a list. If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, then `l` contains three elements `['ans', i, x // i]`, where `ans` is the maximum value among the elements in `l`. If `i` is greater than `k`, then `l` remains as `['ans']`, where `ans` is the maximum value among the elements in `l`.**
