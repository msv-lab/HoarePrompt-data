Postcondition: `x` is an integer, `i` is a divisor of `x`, and `l` is a list. If `i + 2` is less than or equal to `k`, then `l` contains three elements `['ans', i + 2, x // (i + 2)]`, where `ans` is the maximum value among the elements in `l`. If `i + 2` is greater than `k`, then `l` remains as `['ans']`, where `ans` is the maximum value among the elements in `l`.
