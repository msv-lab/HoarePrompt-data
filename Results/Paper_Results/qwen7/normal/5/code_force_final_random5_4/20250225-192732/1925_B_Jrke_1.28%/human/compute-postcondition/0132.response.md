Output State: **`ans` is the maximum value among `ans`, 5, and `x // 5`, `i` is 8, `x` is an integer, `l` is a list containing `[ans, 7, 1]`, and `l.append(x // i)` has been executed.**

Explanation: The code `l.append(x // i)` appends the value of `x // i` to the list `l`. Given that `i` is 8, `x // i` is `x // 8`. Since `x` is an integer, `x // 8` is also an integer. The initial state of `l` is `[ans, 7]` if `x % 5 == 0`. After appending `x // 8` to `l`, the list `l` becomes `[ans, 7, x // 8]`. The value of `ans` remains unchanged as it is determined by the maximum value among `ans`, 5, and `x // 5`. The value of `i` remains 8, and `x` remains an integer.
