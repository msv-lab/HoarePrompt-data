Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `curr` will be the sum of all non-zero elements in `nums` minus the sum of all elements in `nums` except the last one.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `curr` will hold the total of all non-zero elements in the list `nums`, but each element will be adjusted by subtracting the corresponding element that came before it in the list. Essentially, `curr` accumulates the net positive difference between each non-zero element and its predecessor in the list, with the last element of `nums` not affecting the calculation since there is no subsequent element to compare it with.
