Output State: **`nums` is a list with at least one element (excluding the current `i`), `i` is the next element in `nums`, `curr` is updated to its previous value plus `i` minus `last`.**

Explanation: The code `curr += i - last` updates the value of `curr` by adding the difference between `i` and `last` to the current value of `curr`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `curr` as described.
