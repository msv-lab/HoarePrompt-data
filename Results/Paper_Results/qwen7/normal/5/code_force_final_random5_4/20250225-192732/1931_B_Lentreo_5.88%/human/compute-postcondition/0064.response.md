Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `nums` is a list with at least one element.
   - `i` is the first element of `nums`.
   - If `i` is not 0, then `curr` is updated to its previous value plus `i` minus `last`.
   - If `i` is 0, no change is made to `curr`.

2. **Loop Head Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over each element in `nums`.
   - The variable `i` takes the value of the current element from `nums` in each iteration.

3. **State Adjustments Needed:**
   - Since `i` is the first element of `nums` at the start of the current iteration, after the iteration, `i` will be the second element of `nums`.
   - `nums` will lose its first element (the original `i`).
   - `curr` will be updated based on the value of `i` (if `i` is not 0).

Given these points, let's adjust the states accordingly:

- `nums` will now be the list without its first element.
- `i` will be the second element of the original `nums`.
- `curr` will be updated based on the value of the new `i` (if it is not 0).

Since we don't know the exact value of `i` or `last`, we'll keep the general form of the postconditions.

**Final State:**
- `nums` is a list with at least one element (excluding the first element of the previous iteration).
- `i` is the second element of the original `nums`.
- If `i` is not 0, then `curr` is updated to its previous value plus `i` minus `last`.
- If `i` is 0, no change is made to `curr`.

State: **`nums` is a list with at least one element (excluding the first element of the previous iteration), `i` is the second element of the original `nums`, and if `i` is not 0, then `curr` is updated to its previous value plus `i` minus `last`. If `i` is 0, no change is made to `curr`.**
