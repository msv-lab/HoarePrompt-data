Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `nums`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element in `nums`.

3. **Analyze the given postcondition**:
   - `curr` is updated to its previous value plus the difference between the current value of `i` and the last value of `i`.
   - `i` is now the second element of `nums` and is not equal to 0.
   - `nums` is the list without the first element.

4. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is now the second element of `nums`, the loop will continue if there are more elements in `nums` after the first element.
   - The `nums` list has been modified to exclude the first element, so it must have at least two elements for the loop to continue.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be the second element of `nums`.
   - `nums` must have at least two elements to ensure the loop continues.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `curr` is updated to its previous value plus the difference between the current value of `i` and the last value of `i`, `i` is the second element of `nums` and is not equal to 0, `nums` is a list with at least two elements.**
