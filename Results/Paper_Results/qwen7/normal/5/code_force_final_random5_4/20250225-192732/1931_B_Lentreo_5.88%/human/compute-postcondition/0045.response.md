Postcondition: **`i` is the third element of `nums`, `nums` is the list without the first two elements, `last` is the second element of the original `nums`, and `curr` is updated to its previous value plus the difference between the third element of `nums` and the second element of the original `nums`.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block. If the condition `i != 0` is true, then `i` becomes the third element of `nums`, `nums` becomes the list without the first two elements, `last` remains the second element of the original `nums`, and `curr` is updated to its previous value plus the difference between the third element of `nums` and the second element of the original `nums`. Since there is no else part, the postcondition does not change if the condition is false.
