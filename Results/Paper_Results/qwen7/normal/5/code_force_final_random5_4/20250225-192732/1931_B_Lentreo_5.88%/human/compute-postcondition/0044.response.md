Output State: **`i` is the third element of `nums`, `nums` is the list without the first two elements, `last` is the second element of the original `nums`, and `curr` is updated to its previous value plus the difference between the third element of `nums` and the second element of the original `nums`.**

This output state reflects the changes made by the line of code `curr += i - last` within the loop. Here, `i` is now the third element of `nums`, `nums` is the list without the first two elements, `last` retains the value of the second element of the original `nums`, and `curr` is updated to include the difference between the third element of `nums` and the second element of the original `nums`.
