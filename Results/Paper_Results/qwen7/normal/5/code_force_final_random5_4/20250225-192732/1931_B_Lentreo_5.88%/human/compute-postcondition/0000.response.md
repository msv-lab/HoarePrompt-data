Output State: **t is an input integer, 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input for `t` and assigns it to the variable `t`. The precondition that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) remains valid. The other parts of the initial state, such as the conditions for `n` and the array `a`, are not affected by this line of code and thus remain unchanged.
