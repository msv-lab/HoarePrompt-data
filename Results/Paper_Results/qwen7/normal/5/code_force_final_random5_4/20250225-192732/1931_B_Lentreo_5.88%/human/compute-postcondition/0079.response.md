Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and a list of n non-negative integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5) such that the sum of a_i is divisible by n. The function returns a result for each test case based on the given conditions.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing a value t and a list of integers. It checks if the sum of the integers in the list is divisible by the length of the list (n), and processes each test case accordingly, though the specific processing details are not provided in the problem statement.
