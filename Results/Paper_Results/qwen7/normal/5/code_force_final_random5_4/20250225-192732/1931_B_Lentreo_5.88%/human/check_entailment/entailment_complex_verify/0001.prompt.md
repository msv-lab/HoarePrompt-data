You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n containers of water lined up, numbered from left to right from 1
to n . Each container can hold any amount of water; initially, the i -th
container contains a_i units of water. The sum of a_i is divisible by n .

You can apply the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times:
pour any amount of water from the i -th container to the j -th container,
where i must be less than j (i.e. i<j ). Any index can be chosen as i or j any
number of times.

Determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers
the same using this operation.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of containers with water.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the amounts of water in the containers. It is guaranteed
that the sum of a_i in each test case does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^9 . Also, the
sum of a_i is divisible by n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases in the input does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to make the amount of water in all
containers the same using the described operation. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the third test case of the example (a=[4, 5, 2, 1, 3] ), you can proceed as
follows:

  * pour 1 unit of water from the first vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 5, 2, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the third, then a=[3, 4, 3, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 3, 3, 3, 3] .

    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):

        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and the second line contains n non-negative integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that the sum of a_i is divisible by n. Additionally, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        
        last = nums[-1]
        
        curr = 0
        
        for i in nums:
            if i != 0:
                curr += i - last
        
        if curr == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: After all iterations, `curr` is the sum of all non-zero elements in the concatenated list of `nums` from all iterations, each subtracted by its respective `last` value from the end of the corresponding `nums` list. If `curr` equals 0, the function prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads a positive integer \( t \) and then \( t \) lists of \( n \) non-negative integers. It calculates the sum of all non-zero elements in these lists, each subtracted by its respective last element from the end of the list. If this sum equals zero, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from one container to another, where the source container index must be less than the destination container index.

2. **Key Insight**: Given that the sum of water in all containers is divisible by \( n \), the target amount of water in each container would be the total sum divided by \( n \). If we can achieve this target amount for all containers, the answer is "YES". Otherwise, it's "NO".

3. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of containers `n` and the amounts of water in each container.
   - It then calculates the difference between the last element (`last`) and each element in the list (`nums`).
   - It sums these differences into `curr`.
   - If `curr` is zero, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

4. **Issue Identification**:
   - The logic in the given program is flawed. The program does not correctly check if the water distribution can be made uniform. Instead, it checks if the difference between the last element and other elements sums to zero, which is not relevant to the problem.
   - The program should check if the average water amount (total sum divided by \( n \)) can be achieved in all containers, but the current implementation does not do this.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - Calculate the average water amount per container.
   - Check if the total water amount is divisible by \( n \) (which is already guaranteed).
   - Verify if the water distribution can be adjusted to match this average without violating the pouring rule (i.e., pouring from a lower index to a higher index).

### Conclusion:

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the provided program is:

**Correctness: **False**
