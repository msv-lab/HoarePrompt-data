Output State: **`curr` is updated to the value of `curr + (i - last)`, `i` is not 0, and `nums` must have at least one element.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `curr` by adding the difference between the current index `i` and the last index `last` to `curr`. The initial conditions that `i` is not 0 and `nums` must have at least one element remain unchanged. Therefore, `curr` is updated accordingly, while `i` and the condition on `nums` are preserved.
