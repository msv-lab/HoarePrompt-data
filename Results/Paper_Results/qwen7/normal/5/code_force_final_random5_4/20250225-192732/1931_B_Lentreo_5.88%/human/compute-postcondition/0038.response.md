Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is the first element of `nums` and is not equal to 0.
   - `curr` is updated to the value of `curr + (i - last)`.
   - `nums` must still have at least one element.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in nums:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Adjusting the States:**
   - The loop variable `i` is taken from the `nums` list.
   - For the loop to execute again, `nums` must still have at least one element.
   - The variable `last` is not mentioned in the loop head, so it remains unchanged.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - After the current iteration, `i` will be the next element in `nums`.
   - `nums` will be the remaining elements of `nums` after removing the current `i`.

5. **New State:**
   - `i` will be the second element of `nums` and is not equal to 0.
   - `curr` remains unchanged as it was updated outside the loop.
   - `nums` will have at least one element left, but now it is the list without the first element.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`i` is the second element of `nums` and is not equal to 0, `curr` is updated to the value of `curr + (i - last)`, and `nums` must still have at least one element.**
