Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in nums`. This means the loop iterates over each element in the list `nums`.

2. **Determine the initial state of the loop head variables**:
   - `i`: This variable will take the value of each element in the list `nums` during each iteration.
   - `nums`: This is the list over which the loop iterates.

3. **Check the initial state before the loop starts**:
   - `t` is `t - 1`: This is not directly related to the loop head variables.
   - `_` is 0: This is not directly related to the loop head variables.
   - `n` is an input integer: This is not directly related to the loop head variables.
   - `last` is the last element of the list `nums`: This is not directly related to the loop head variables.
   - `curr` is 0: This is not directly related to the loop head variables.

4. **Adjust the states of the loop head variables**:
   - Since `i` will take the value of each element in `nums`, we need to ensure that `nums` is not empty for the loop to execute at least once.
   - `i` will start as the first element of `nums` in the first iteration.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `nums` must have at least one element for the loop to execute.
- `i` will be set to the first element of `nums` in the first iteration.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`nums` must have at least one element, `i` is the first element of `nums`**
