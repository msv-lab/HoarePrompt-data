Output State: **`num` is equal to `cur`, `cur` is equal to the third element of `N`, `M[cur]` is set to 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The code sets `M[cur]` to 1. Since `num` is initially set to the value of `cur`, and `cur` is equal to the third element of `N`, these relationships remain unchanged. After executing the line `M[cur] = 1`, `M[cur]` is now 1. The other conditions about `num` and `cur` staying the same and the break statement continuing to apply are also maintained.
