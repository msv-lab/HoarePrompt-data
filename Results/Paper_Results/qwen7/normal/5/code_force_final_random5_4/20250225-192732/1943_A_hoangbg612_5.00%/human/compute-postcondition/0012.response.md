Output State: **`cur` is 2, `T` is an integer between 1 and 20000 inclusive, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `M` is an empty dictionary, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `cur`, `T`, `S`, `N`, `M`, or the condition involving `num`. It only indicates that the execution exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is within, which in this case is implied to be a loop or conditional structure that was previously active. Since no such structure is defined in the given code snippet, the variables remain unchanged, and the only effect is that the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was in.
