Output State: **`cur` is equal to `num`, `i` is 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The code `cur = num` assigns the value of `num` to `cur`. The initial state tells us that `cur` is either 3 or 0, but after executing the code, `cur` will take the exact value of `num`. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 2, and the condition about breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement also remains valid.
