Postcondition: **`cur` is set to the largest number in `N` that is greater than `cur-1` plus 1, or it is -1 if no such number exists. `i` is 3, and `M` is a dictionary where the key is the maximum value in `N` that is greater than `cur-1` and the value is 1, or it contains keys `-1` and `N[0]` with their respective counts if no such element was found. The sum of all values in the dictionary `M` is equal to `S`.**
