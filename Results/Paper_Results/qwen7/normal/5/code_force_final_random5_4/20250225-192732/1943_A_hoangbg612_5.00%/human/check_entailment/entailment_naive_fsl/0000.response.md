Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the game described. Specifically, the program does not handle the alternating turns between Alice and Bob properly. Instead, it sorts the array and then tries to find the MEX based on the frequency of numbers in the sorted array. This approach does not account for the strategic choices made by Alice and Bob during their turns.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
4
0 0 1 1
4
0 1 2 3
2
1 1
```

The output of the program is:
```
2
1
0
```

However, let's analyze the first test case:
- Alice can pick `0` first, making `c = [0]` and `a = [0, 1, 1]`.
- Bob will then pick `0`, making `c = [0]` and `a = [1, 1]`.
- Alice can pick `1` next, making `c = [0, 1]` and `a = [1]`.
- Bob will then pick `1`, making `c = [0, 1]` and `a = []`.

At the end, `c = [0, 1]`, and the MEX of `[0, 1]` is `2`. However, the program incorrectly calculates the MEX without considering the optimal moves of both players.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the game rules and does not handle the optimal strategies for both players, leading to incorrect results.
