Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case involves the variable `num` which is taken from the list `N`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**:
   - If `num > cur`, then `cur` is updated to `num`, and `M` is updated to contain the key `cur` with value 1.
   - If `num <= cur` or `num > cur + 1`, then `cur` remains -1 and `M` contains the key -1 with value 1.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `cur` is either -1 or equal to `num`.
   - `T` is an integer between 1 and 20000 inclusive.
   - `S` is an input integer.
   - `N` is a non-empty sorted list of integers.
   - `M` is a dictionary.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop takes `num` from the list `N`, the next `num` will be the next element in the list `N`.
   - `cur` will either remain -1 or be updated to the current `num` based on the condition.
   - `M` will be updated accordingly if `cur` is updated.

Given the conditions, let's assume the following at the end of the previous iteration:
- `cur` is either -1 or equal to the current `num`.
- `N` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, and the next `num` will be the next element in the list.
- `M` will be updated based on the new value of `cur`.

Since `N` is a non-empty sorted list, the next `num` will be the next element in the list. Let's denote the next `num` as `next_num`.

If `cur` was -1, it could now be updated to `next_num` if `next_num > cur`. Otherwise, it will remain -1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `cur` will be updated to `next_num` if `next_num > cur`, otherwise it will remain -1.
- `M` will be updated to contain the key `cur` with value 1 if `cur` is updated, or it will contain the key -1 with value 1 if `cur` remains -1.

State: **`cur` is either -1 or equal to `next_num` (if `next_num > cur`), `T` is an integer between 1 and 20000 inclusive, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a non-empty sorted list of integers where the next element is `next_num`, `M` is a dictionary containing the key `cur` with value 1 if `cur` is updated, or the key -1 with value 1 if `cur` remains -1.**
