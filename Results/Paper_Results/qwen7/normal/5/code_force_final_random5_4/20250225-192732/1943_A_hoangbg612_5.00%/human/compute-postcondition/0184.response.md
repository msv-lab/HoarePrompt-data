Based on the initial state provided:

- `cur` is greater than 3.
- `i` is 0.

The `print(cur)` statement will print the value of `cur`. Since `cur` is explicitly stated to be greater than 3 but no specific value is given, we can only describe it in terms of its condition.

Output: **cur (where cur is a value greater than 3)**
