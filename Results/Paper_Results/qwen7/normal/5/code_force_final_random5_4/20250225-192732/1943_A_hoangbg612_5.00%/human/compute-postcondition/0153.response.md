Output State: **`num` is the next element in `N`, `cur` is either the next `num` in `N` plus 1 and `i` is 2, or `cur` is -1 plus 1 and `i` is 0, and `M` is a dictionary with key `-1` and value `2`.**

This means that if `cur` was the next `num` in `N` and `i` was 2, then `cur` is now one more than the next `num` in `N`. If `cur` was -1 and `i` was 0, then `cur` is now 0. The value of `i` remains unchanged in both cases, and the dictionary `M` remains the same.
