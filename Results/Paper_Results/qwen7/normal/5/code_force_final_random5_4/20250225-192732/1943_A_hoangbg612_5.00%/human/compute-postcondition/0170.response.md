Output State: **`cur` is 3, `i` is 3, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not modify the values of `cur` or `i`. It simply exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such block is specified in the given code, we assume it breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The initial conditions of `cur` and `i` remain unchanged.
