Output State: **cur is set to the last element of N plus 1.**

Explanation: The variable `cur` was initially set to the last element of `N`. After executing `cur += 1`, `cur` is incremented by 1. Therefore, `cur` is now set to the last element of `N` plus 1. The precondition that all elements in `N` have been processed and `M` contains the frequency of each unique element in `N` remains unchanged. The sum of all frequencies in `M` (denoted as `S`) also remains the same.
