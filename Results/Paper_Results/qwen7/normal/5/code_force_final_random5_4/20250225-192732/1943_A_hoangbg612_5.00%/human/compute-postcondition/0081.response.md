Output State: **`cur` is equal to the fourth element of `N`, `M[cur]` is updated based on the condition, and the first element of `N` is less than or equal to `num`.**

Explanation: The variable `cur` is incremented by 1, so it now points to the next element in the list `N`, which is the fourth element. The conditions for updating `M[cur]` and the relationship between the first element of `N` and `num` remain unchanged.
