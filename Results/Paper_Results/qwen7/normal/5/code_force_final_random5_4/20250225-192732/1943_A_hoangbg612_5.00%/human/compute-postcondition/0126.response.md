Output State: **`cur` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `T` is 3, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `N.sort()` sorts the list `N` in ascending order. The values of `cur`, `i`, `T`, and `S` remain unchanged. The list `N` is updated to its sorted version.
