Output State: **`M` is a dictionary with key `-1` and value `2`, key `cur` and value `1`, `i` is 2, `num` is the next element in `N`.**

Explanation: The code `M[cur] += 1` increments the value associated with the key `cur` in the dictionary `M` by 1. Initially, if `cur` is the next `num` in `N` and `i` is 2, then `M[cur]` was not defined (or was 0), so it becomes 1. If `cur` is -1 and `i` is 0, then `M[-1]` is initially 2, and it remains 2. The other variables `i`, `num`, and `cur` remain unchanged according to the initial state.
