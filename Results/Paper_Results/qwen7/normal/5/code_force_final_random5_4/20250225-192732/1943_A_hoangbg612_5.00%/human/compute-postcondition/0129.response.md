Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for num in N:`. The variables involved here are `num` and `N`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `num`: This variable will take on each value from the list `N` during each iteration of the loop.
   - `N`: This is a sorted list of integers entered by the user.

3. **Check the initial conditions**:
   - Since `num` is set to take values from `N`, the loop will execute as long as `N` is not empty.
   - The initial state of `num` is irrelevant because it will be assigned a value from `N` in each iteration.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - We need to ensure that `N` is not empty for the loop to execute. If `N` is empty, the loop will not run even once.

Given the above analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is `N` must not be empty.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`cur` is -1, `i` is 0, `T` is 3, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a non-empty list of sorted integers, `M` is an empty dictionary**
