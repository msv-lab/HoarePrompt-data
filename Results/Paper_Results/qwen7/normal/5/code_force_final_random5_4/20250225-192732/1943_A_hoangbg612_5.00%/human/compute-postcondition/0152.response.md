Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `cur` is either equal to the next `num` in `N` and `i` is 2, or `cur` is -1, `i` is 0, and `M` is a dictionary with key `-1` and value `2`.
- If `num` is greater than `cur`, then `cur` is equal to `num` and `M[cur]` is 1. Otherwise, `cur` remains as either the next `num` in `N` and `i` is 2, or `cur` is -1, `i` is 0, and `M` is a dictionary with key `-1` and value `2`.

### Loop Head
The loop head is:
```python
for num in N:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Variables in the Loop Head
- `num`: The variable being iterated over from the list `N`.

### Adjusting the States
At the start of the next iteration, the state of `num` will change to the next element in the list `N`. Therefore, we need to update the state of `num` to the next element in `N`.

### Conditions to Consider
- If `num` is greater than `cur`, then `cur` becomes `num` and `M[cur]` is set to 1.
- Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged, and `i` is set to 2 if it was 0 previously, or it remains 2 if it was already 2.

### Possible States
1. **If `cur` was -1 and `i` was 0:**
   - `num` becomes the next element in `N`.
   - `cur` becomes `num`.
   - `M[cur]` is set to 1.
   - `i` becomes 2.

2. **If `cur` was the next `num` in `N` and `i` was 2:**
   - `num` becomes the next element in `N`.
   - `cur` remains the same (the next `num` in `N`).
   - `M[cur]` remains unchanged.
   - `i` remains 2.

### Final State
Given the conditions, the final state at the start of the next iteration would be:
- `num` is the next element in `N`.
- `cur` is either the next `num` in `N` and `i` is 2, or `cur` is -1, `i` is 0, and `M` is a dictionary with key `-1` and value `2`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`num` is the next element in `N`, `cur` is either the next `num` in `N` and `i` is 2, or `cur` is -1, `i` is 0, and `M` is a dictionary with key `-1` and value `2`.**
