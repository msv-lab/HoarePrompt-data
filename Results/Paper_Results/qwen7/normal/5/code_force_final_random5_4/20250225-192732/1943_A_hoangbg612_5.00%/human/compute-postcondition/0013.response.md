Postcondition: `cur` is now equal to `num`, `T` is an integer between 1 and 20000 inclusive, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `M` is an empty dictionary, and if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `num` is not greater than `cur + 1`, the condition remains unchanged.
