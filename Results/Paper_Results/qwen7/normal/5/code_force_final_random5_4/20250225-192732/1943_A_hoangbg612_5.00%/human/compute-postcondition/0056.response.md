Output State: **`M` is a list of integers, `cur` is equal to `i`, the index `i` (now `cur`) is within the bounds of `M`.**

Explanation: The code `cur = i` simply assigns the current value of `i` to `cur`. Since `i` was previously `cur + 1`, `cur` is now also `cur + 1 - 1`, which simplifies to `cur`. The index `i` remains within the bounds of `M`, and the state of `M` and the original value of `i` remain unchanged.
