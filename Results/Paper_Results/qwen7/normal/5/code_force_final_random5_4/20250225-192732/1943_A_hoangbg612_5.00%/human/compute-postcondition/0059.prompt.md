Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cur` will hold the last valid update or remain -1, `T` and `S` will stay as initially provided, `N` will be empty, and `M` will map each relevant element to its frequency in `N`. The sum of the counts in the dictionary `M` will equal the initial value of `S` if the condition in the if statement is true. Otherwise, `cur` will remain as it is, `T` and `S` will stay as initially provided, `N` will be empty, and `M` will map each relevant element to its frequency in `N`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(cur):
    if M[i] <= i:
        cur = i
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `M` is a list of integers, `cur` is equal to `i`, the index `i` is within the bounds of `M`, and the value at index `i` of `M` is less than or equal to `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `M` is a list of integers, `cur` is equal to `i`, the index `i` is within the bounds of `M`. If the value at index `i` of `M` is less than or equal to `i`, we break out of the loop or if statement. There is no else part in the code, so no additional changes occur in other cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `M` is a list of integers, `cur` is equal to `i`, the index `cur` is within the bounds of `M`, and if `M[cur]` is less than or equal to `cur`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
