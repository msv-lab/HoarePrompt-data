Postcondition: `M` is a list of integers, `cur` is equal to `i`, the index `i` is within the bounds of `M`. If the value at index `i` of `M` is less than or equal to `i`, we break out of the loop or if statement we were inside. If the value at index `i` of `M` is greater than `i`, the condition is not met, and the loop or if statement continues as normal.
