Output State: **`cur` is -1, `T` is an integer between 1 and 20000 inclusive, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer.**

The code initializes the variable `cur` to -1. This does not affect the values of `T`, `S`, or `N`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
