Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `cur`.

2. **Determine the condition for loop execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < cur`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `cur` is greater than 3.
   - `i` is 4.

4. **Check the loop condition**: Since `i` is currently 4 and `cur` is greater than 3, the condition `i < cur` will be false because 4 is not less than `cur` (which is greater than 3).

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `cur`. Therefore, `i` needs to be set to a value less than `cur`.

Given that `cur` is greater than 3, the smallest possible value for `i` that would allow the loop to execute again is `i = 0` (assuming `i` starts from 0, as typical in Python's `range` function).

6. **Update the state**:
   - `i` should be set to 0.
   - `cur` remains unchanged since it is not modified within the loop head.

Therefore, the updated state is:
State: **`cur` is greater than 3, `i` is 0**
