Postcondition: `cur` is either -1 or equal to `num`, `T` is an integer between 1 and 20000 inclusive, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `M` is a dictionary. If `num > cur`, then `cur` is updated to `num`, and `M` is updated to contain the key `cur` with value 1. If `num <= cur` or `num > cur + 1`, then `cur` remains -1 and `M` contains the key -1 with value 1.
