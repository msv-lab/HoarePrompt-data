Output State: **`cur` is increased by 1, `T` and `S` will stay as initially provided, `N` will be empty, and `M` will map each relevant element to its frequency in `N`. The sum of the counts in the dictionary `M` will equal the initial value of `S`.**

This means that the current value of `cur` has been incremented by 1, while the values of `T`, `S`, `N`, and `M` remain unchanged from their initial states.
