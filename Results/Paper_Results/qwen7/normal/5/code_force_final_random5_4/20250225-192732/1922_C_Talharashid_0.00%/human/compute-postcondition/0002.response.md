Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory int.**

Explanation: The code initializes a `defaultdict` with an integer factory function, which means that `d1` will automatically assign the value `0` to any key that does not exist yet. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
