Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory int, `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory int, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `end` is the length of `lst` minus 1, `s` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while start != end:
    mini = 11111111
    if start + 1 < len(lst):
        mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1]), mini)
    if start - 1 > -1:
        mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1]), mini)
    if mini == abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc]):
        s += 1
    else:
        s += abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])
    start += inc
    d1[start] = s


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `start' is start plus inc, `i` is either 1 or 2, `d1[start]` is `s`, `d2` and `n` are unchanged, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `end` must be 0, `s` is either 1 or `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, `mini` is the minimum value between `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and `11111111`, and `start - 1 > -1` and `mini` is not updated to the minimum value between `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` and `mini` if `i` is 1, otherwise `mini` is equal to `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `start` is increased by `inc`, `mini` remains the minimum value between `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])`, `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])`, and 11111111, `s` is increased by either 1 or `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` depending on the condition of the if statement, `d1[start]` is assigned the value of `s`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `start` is increased by `inc`; `mini` is the minimum value between `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and `11111111`; if `mini` equals `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, then `s` is `start + 1`; otherwise, `s` is increased by the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`; `d1[start]` is assigned the value of `s`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
