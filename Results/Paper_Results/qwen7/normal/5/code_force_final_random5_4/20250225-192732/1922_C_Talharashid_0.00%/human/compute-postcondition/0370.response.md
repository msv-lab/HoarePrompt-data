The loop condition is `start != end`. To proceed with the first iteration of the loop, the values of `start` and `end` need to be adjusted such that they are not equal.

- The current state has `end` as 0 and `start` as `len(lst) - 1`.
- For the loop to execute the first time, `start` should not be equal to `end`.

Given that `start` is currently set to `len(lst) - 1`, and `end` is 0, the loop will not execute the first time because `start` and `end` are already not equal. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary for these variables.

No other variables in the loop head (`start` and `end`) need to be adjusted since they are already in a state where the loop condition is satisfied.

State: **`end` is 0, `start` is equal to `len(lst)` - 1**
