Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `start` is an integer entered by the user minus 3, `end` is now an integer entered by the user minus 2, `s` is 0, `s1` is the absolute difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[start]`, `s2` is the absolute difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `s2` to be the absolute difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The conditions and values of `m`, `i`, `start`, `end`, `s`, `s1`, and `d1` and `d2` remain as they were before the code was executed.
