Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `start` is `start - 2`, `end` is an integer entered by the user minus 1, `s` is 0, `s1` is the absolute difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[start]`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the absolute difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[start]` and assigns it to `s1`. The values of `m`, `i`, `start`, `end`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial states. The precondition that `start` is less than `end` is still valid.
