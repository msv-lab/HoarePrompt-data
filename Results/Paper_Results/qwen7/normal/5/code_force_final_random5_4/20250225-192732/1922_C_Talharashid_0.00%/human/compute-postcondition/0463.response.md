Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, the following conditions hold:

- The variable `i` is equal to `m-1`.
- The variable `start` is the initial value of `start` minus `2 * m`.
- The variable `end` is the last value of `end` entered by the user minus 1.
- The variable `s` is 0.
- The variable `s2` is the minimum absolute difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]` if `start < end`, or between `d1[start]` and `d1[end]` if `start >= end`.

All other variables (`t`, `n`, `lst`, `d1`, `d2`, `inc`, `mini`, `m`, and any input values) remain unchanged from their initial or last updated states.
