Output State: **`start` is the length of `lst` minus 2, `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, `s` is the absolute value of the difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`, and `mini` is 11111111.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `s` by adding the absolute value of the difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`. Given that `start` is the length of `lst` minus 2 and `inc` is -1, `start + inc` would be `length_of_lst - 3`. Since `start - 1` is greater than -1, `mini` remains unchanged at 11111111. The value of `s` is updated accordingly.
