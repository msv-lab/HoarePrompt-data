Postcondition: `start` is the length of `lst` minus 2, `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, and `s` is the absolute value of the difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`. `mini` is either the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` and 11111111, provided that `start + inc` is not less than -1, or 11111111 if `start + inc` is less than -1.
