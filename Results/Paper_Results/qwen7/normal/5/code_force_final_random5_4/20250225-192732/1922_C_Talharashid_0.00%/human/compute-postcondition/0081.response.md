Postcondition: `start` is the length of `lst` minus 2, `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, and `s` is either the absolute value of the difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]` or 1, depending on whether `mini` equals `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`. If `start + inc` is less than -1, `mini` remains 11111111. Otherwise, `mini` is 11111111.
