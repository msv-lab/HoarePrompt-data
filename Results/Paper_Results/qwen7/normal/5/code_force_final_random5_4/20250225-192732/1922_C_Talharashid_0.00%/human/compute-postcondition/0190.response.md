Postcondition: **`mini` is the minimum value between `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])` and 11111111, `start` must be less than `end`, `s` is either 1 more than its previous value (if `mini` equals `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])) or increased by `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])` (if `mini` does not equal `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1]))`, `d1[start]` is assigned the value of `s`, `s2`, `inc`, `d2[start]`, `t`, `n`, and `lst` retain their original values, and `end` remains unchanged.**
