Output State: `start` is -1, `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, `s` is the sum of all unique absolute differences between consecutive elements in the list `lst` from the last element to the first element, `mini` is the minimum absolute difference found during the loop's execution, and `d2[start]` (which is `d2[-1]`) is assigned the final value of `s`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `start` will be -1 because it has gone through all elements of the list and reached the end condition (`start != end`). The variable `end` remains 0 as it was initialized and never changed. The increment `inc` is -1, indicating the loop iterated backwards through the list. The variable `s` contains the cumulative sum of the smallest absolute differences found between each pair of consecutive elements as the loop progressed. The variable `mini` holds the smallest absolute difference encountered during the entire loop execution. Lastly, `d2[start]` (or `d2[-1]` since `start` is -1) is set to the final value of `s`.
