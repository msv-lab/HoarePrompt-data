Postcondition: `start` is increased by `inc` and must not be equal to `end`; `mini` remains the minimum value between `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and `11111111`; if `mini` equals `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, then `s` is `start + 1`; otherwise, `s` is increased by the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`.
