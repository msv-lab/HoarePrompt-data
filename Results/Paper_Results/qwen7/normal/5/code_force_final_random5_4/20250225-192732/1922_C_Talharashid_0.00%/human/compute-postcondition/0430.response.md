Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `start` is `start - 2`, `end` is an integer entered by the user minus 1, `s` is 0, `s2` is the absolute difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the absolute difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]` and assigns it to `s2`. The values of `m`, `i`, `start`, `end`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `s2` is now dependent on the values of `d2[start]` and `d2[end]`.
