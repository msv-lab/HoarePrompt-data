Postcondition: `start` is 8, `end` must be different from 8, `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[7] - lst[8])` and `11111111`, `s` is the original value of `s` plus `abs(lst[4] - lst[4 + inc])`, `d1[start]` is `s`.

This postcondition summarizes that regardless of whether the condition `start - 1 > -1` is true or false, the values of `start`, `end`, `mini`, `s`, and `d1[start]` remain as specified in the if part, since there is no else part to alter these values.
