Output State: **`t` is reduced to an input integer, and all other variables (`n`, `a`, `m`, `x_i`, `y_i`) remain in their initial state.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. This reduces the value of `t` to the input integer. The values of `n`, `a`, `m`, `x_i`, and `y_i` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code. The precondition that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) is now updated to reflect the input value.
