Postcondition: **`mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])` and `11111111`, `start` must be less than `end`, `s` is either increased by 1 or by `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])`, `d1[start]` is assigned the value of `s`, `s2`, `inc`, `d2[start]`, `t`, `n`, and `lst` retain their original values, and `end` remains unchanged.**
