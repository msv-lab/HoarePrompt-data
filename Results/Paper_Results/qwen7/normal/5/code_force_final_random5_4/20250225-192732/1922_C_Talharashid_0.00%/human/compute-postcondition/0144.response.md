Output State: **`i` is 2, `m` must be greater than 1, `start` is `start` - 1, `end` is `end` - 1, `s` is 0, `s2` is either `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])` if `start < end` is true, or `s2` is `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])` if `start < end` is false, and `s1` is `abs(d2[end] - d2[start])` if `start < end` is false.**

Explanation: The code `end -= 1` decrements the value of `end` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `end` is now one less than its original value, while `i`, `m`, `start`, `s`, `s2`, and `s1` retain their initial values.
