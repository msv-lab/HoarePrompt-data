Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `start` is an integer entered by the user minus 2, `end` is an integer entered by the user minus 1, `s` is 0, `s2` is either the absolute difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]` if `start < end`, or the absolute difference between `d1[start]` and `d1[end]` if `start >= end`.**

Explanation: The code `start, end = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input from the user, splits them by whitespace, and assigns them to `start` and `end` respectively. The initial values of `m`, `i`, `start`, `end`, `s`, and `s2` are updated as follows:
- `start` is updated to the value of the first integer entered by the user minus 2.
- `end` is updated to the value of the second integer entered by the user minus 1.
The other variables (`m`, `i`, `s`, and `s2`) remain unchanged.
