Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is either 1 or 2, `d1` and `d2` are defaultdicts with default factory int, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `end` must be 0, `s` is either 1 or `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, `mini` is the minimum value between `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and `11111111`, and `start - 1 > -1` only if `mini` is not updated to `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`.
