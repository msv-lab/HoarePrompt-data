Output State: **`i` is 2, `m` must be greater than 1, `start` is an input integer, `end` is an input integer, `s` is 0, `s2` is either `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])` if `start < end` is true, or `s2` is `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])` if `start < end` is false, and `s1` is `abs(d2[end] - d2[start])` if `start < end` is false.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `start` and `end`. This changes the values of `start` and `end` to the input values, but does not affect the other variables (`i`, `m`, `s`, `s2`, `s1`, `d1`, `d2`). The conditions for `s2` and `s1` remain as they were, dependent on the comparison between `start` and `end`.
