Output State: **`i` is 1, `m` must be greater than 0, `start` is `start` - 1, `end` is `end` - 1, `s` is 0, `s1` is `abs(d2[end] - d2[start])`, `s2` is `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`**.

The code updates the value of `s2` to `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`. Since `start` and `end` are decremented by 1 from their previous values, `s1` remains unchanged as it depends on the values of `d2[end]` and `d2[start]`, which are not affected by the code. The other variables (`i`, `m`, `start`, `end`, `s`) are not directly modified by the code, so they retain their previous values.
