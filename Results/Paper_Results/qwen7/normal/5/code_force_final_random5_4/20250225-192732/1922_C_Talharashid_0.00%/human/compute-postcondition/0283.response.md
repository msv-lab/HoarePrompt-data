Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `start` is the integer entered by the user - 2, `end` is the integer entered by the user - 2, `s` is 0, `s2` is either the absolute difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]` if `start < end`, or the absolute difference between `d1[start]` and `d1[end]` if `start >= end`.**

Explanation: The line `s = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `s`. All other variables (`m`, `i`, `start`, `end`, and `s2`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
