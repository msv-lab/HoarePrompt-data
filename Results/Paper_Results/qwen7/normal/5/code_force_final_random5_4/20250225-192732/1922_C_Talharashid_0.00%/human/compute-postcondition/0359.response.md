Output State: **`start` is 8, `end` is different from 8, `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[7] - lst[8])` and `11111111`, `s` is the original value of `s` plus `abs(lst[4] - lst[4 + inc])`, `d1[start]` is `s` + `abs(lst[8] - lst[8 + inc])**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `s` by adding `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, which translates to `abs(lst[8] - lst[8 + inc])`. Since `start` is 8, the value of `s` is increased by `abs(lst[8] - lst[8 + inc])`. The other variables (`end`, `mini`, and `d1[start]`) remain unchanged as per the initial postcondition.
