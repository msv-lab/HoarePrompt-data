Output State: **`start` is `lst` length minus 4 plus `inc`, `end` is 0, `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and 11111111, and `s` is increased by `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`**.

Explanation: The line `start += inc` increments the value of `start` by `inc`. The other variables (`end`, `mini`, and `s`) remain unchanged from their previous values. Therefore, `start` is updated to `lst` length minus 4 plus `inc`, while `end`, `mini`, and `s` retain their original values as described in the initial state.
