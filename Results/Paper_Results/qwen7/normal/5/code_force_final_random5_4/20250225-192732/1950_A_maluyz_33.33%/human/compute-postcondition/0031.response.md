Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers where `a`, `b`, and `c` are either in the order `a < b < c` or they are not all equal and the maximum value among them is either `b` or not equal to `b`, and the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged after the if-else block executes.**
