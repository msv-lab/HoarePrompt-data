Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
    if a < b < c:
        print('STAIR')
    elif a == b == c:
        print('NONE')
    elif max(a, b, c) == b:
        print('PEAK')
    else:
        print('NONE')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers. If `a < b < c`, then `a` is less than `b` and `b` is less than `c`. Otherwise, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that they are not all equal (i.e., `a != b != c`), and the maximum value among `a`, `b`, and `c` is either `b` or not equal to `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers where `a`, `b`, and `c` are either in the order `a < b < c` or they are not all equal and the maximum value among them is either `b` or not equal to `b`. If `a < b < c` is true, then `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. Otherwise, if `a`, `b`, and `c` are not in the order `a < b < c` and are not all equal, they are adjusted to be in the order `a < b < c`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers where their values are input from the user and satisfy `a < b < c` or they are not all equal and the maximum value among them is either `b` or not equal to `b`. In both cases of the if and else part, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
