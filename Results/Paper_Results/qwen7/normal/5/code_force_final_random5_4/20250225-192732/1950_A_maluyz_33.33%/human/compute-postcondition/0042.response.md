Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers where their values are input from the user and satisfy `a < b < c` or they are not all equal and the maximum value among them is either `b` or not equal to `b`. Regardless of whether `a == b == c` is true or false, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.**
