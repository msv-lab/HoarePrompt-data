Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers assigned the values from the input split into three parts.**

The code `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input, splits them, and assigns them to variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The initial value of `t` and `i` remains unchanged.
