Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers. If `a == b == c`, then the relationship `a == b == c` is true. Otherwise, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that `a` is not equal to `b` or `b` is not equal to `c` or `a` is not equal to `c`, and the maximum value among `a`, `b`, and `c` is either `b` or not equal to `b`.
