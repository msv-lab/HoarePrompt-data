Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
- `i` is 0.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers.
- `a` is not equal to `b` or `b` is not equal to `c` or `a` is not equal to `c`. This means that all three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` are distinct from each other.
- `max(a, b, c)` is not equal to `b`. This means that `b` is not the maximum of the three integers.

The print statement is simply printing the string `'NONE'`.

Output: **NONE**
