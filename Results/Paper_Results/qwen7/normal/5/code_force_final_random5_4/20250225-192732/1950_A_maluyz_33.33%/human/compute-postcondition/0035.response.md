Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers where `a < b < c` or they are not all equal and the maximum value among them is either `b` or not equal to `b`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = t-1`.
   - Since `i` is currently 1, the loop will run one more time when `i` becomes 2.

3. **Adjusting the States:**
   - The only variable in the loop head is `i`.
   - After the loop runs one more time, `i` will be incremented from 1 to 2.
   - The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` do not change within the loop itself based on the given information.

4. **Final States at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers where `a < b < c` or they are not all equal and the maximum value among them is either `b` or not equal to `b`.**
