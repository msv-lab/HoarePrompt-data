Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers. If `a == b == c` is true, then the relationship `a == b == c` holds. Otherwise, the relationship `a == b == c` is false, and at least two of the integers `a`, `b`, and `c` are not equal to each other, with the maximum value among `a`, `b`, and `c` being either `b` or not equal to `b`.
