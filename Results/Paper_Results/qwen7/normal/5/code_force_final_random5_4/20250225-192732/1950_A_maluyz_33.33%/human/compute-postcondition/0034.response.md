Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers where `a`, `b`, and `c` are either in the order `a < b < c` or they are not all equal and the maximum value among them is either `b` or not equal to `b`. If `a < b < c` is true, then `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. Otherwise, if `a`, `b`, and `c` are not in the order `a < b < c` and are not all equal, they are adjusted to be in the order `a < b < c`.
