You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program:
def func():
    n = input()
    final = []
    for num in range(int(n)):
        s = 0
        list2 = []
        a = input()
        list1 = []
        b = input()
        list1 = b.split()
        for str in list1:
            list2.append(int(str))
        list2.sort()
        for i in range(0, len(list2), 2):
            s = s + int(list2[i])
        final.append(s)
    for fin in final:
        print(fin)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where each case consists of an integer \( t \) (1 ≤ \( t \) ≤ 5000) and an integer \( n \) (1 ≤ \( n \) ≤ 50). For each test case, it reads \( 2n \) integers and sorts them. Then, it calculates the sum of the integers at even indices for each sorted list and stores these sums in a list. Finally, it prints each sum in the list.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads an integer `n` which is expected to be the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads another integer `n` (which is actually the number of pairs of numbers, so the total number of integers is `2n`).
   - It then reads a line containing `2n` space-separated integers.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - The program initializes a variable `s` to 0, which will store the score.
   - It initializes an empty list `list2` to store the sorted integers.
   - It splits the input string into individual integers and converts them to a list of integers (`list2`).
   - It sorts the list `list2`.
   - It iterates over the sorted list in steps of 2, summing up the elements at even indices (since the list is sorted, these represent the minimum of each pair).

3. **Output**:
   - The score `s` is appended to the list `final` for each test case.
   - Finally, it prints all the scores stored in `final`.

### Correctness Check

1. **Sorting and Pairing**:
   - Sorting the list ensures that we always pick the smallest available number in each pair, which is the optimal strategy to maximize the score.
   - Summing up every other element (after sorting) correctly implements the strategy of picking the minimum of each pair.

2. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**:
   - The program correctly processes each test case separately and stores the results in a list `final`.
   - It then prints the results for each test case.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the input format as specified in the problem statement.
   - It correctly processes the sorting and pairing logic for each test case.

4. **Output Format**:
   - The program outputs the results in the correct order, corresponding to each test case.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem. It sorts the numbers, pairs them optimally, and calculates the maximum score as required.
