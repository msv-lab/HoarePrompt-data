Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables in the given code are `str` and `list1`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each element in `list1`. Each element in `list1` is converted to an integer and assigned to `str`.

3. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `list2` contains an element which is the integer conversion of `str`.
   - The loop has just completed one iteration.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop has just completed one iteration, `str` now holds the value of the current element from `list1` that was processed in the previous iteration.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another element in `list1` to process.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `list2` will contain the integer conversion of the next element from `list1`.
   - `str` will hold the value of the next element from `list1`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `list2` will contain the integer conversion of the next element from `list1`.
- `str` will hold the value of the next element from `list1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`list2` contains the integer conversion of the next element from `list1`, `str` is the next element from `list1`**.
