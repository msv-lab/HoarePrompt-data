Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50.**

Explanation: The code `n = input()` reads an input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The variable `t` remains unchanged and still holds an integer value within the range 1 to 5000. The value of `n` is now an input integer within the range 1 to 50.
