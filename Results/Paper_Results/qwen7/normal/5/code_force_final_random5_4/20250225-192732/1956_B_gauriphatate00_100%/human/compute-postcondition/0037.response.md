Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies `num` as the variable being iterated over using `range(1, n + 1)`. Therefore, the only variables that can be adjusted are `num` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values**: At the end of the previous iteration, `max_score` is 2, `a` is an empty list, `count_a` is a dictionary with counts of integers from 1 to 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `num` will be incremented by 1.

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `num` starts at 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, if it was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be 2 at the start of the next iteration.
   - `n` remains unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body, but since no such modification is mentioned, `n` stays the same.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`max_score` is 2, `a` is an empty list, `count_a` is a dictionary containing the count of each unique integer from the original list `a`, ranging from 1 to 2, reflecting how many times each integer appeared in the list, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, and the current value of `num` is 2.**
