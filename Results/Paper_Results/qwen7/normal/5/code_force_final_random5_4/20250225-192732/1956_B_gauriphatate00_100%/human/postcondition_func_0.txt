The function accepts a list `a` of `n` integers (each between 1 and `n` inclusive, with each integer appearing at most twice) and an integer `n`. It processes each integer in the list, counting their occurrences, and updates a dictionary `count_a` with these counts. After processing, it checks how many integers in the range from 1 to `n` have a count of exactly 2 in `count_a`. If at least one such integer is found, `max_score` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence. Finally, it returns the value of `max_score`, which is guaranteed to be 3 based on the given conditions.
