You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and n inclusive, and each integer from 1 to n appears at most twice in the list.
def func_1(a, n):
    count_a = {}
    for num in a:
        if num in count_a:
            count_a[num] += 1
        else:
            count_a[num] = 1
        
    #State: Output State: The final state of `a` will be an empty list since each element in `a` is processed exactly once, incrementing its count in `count_a`. After all elements have been iterated over, `a` will be exhausted. The `count_a` dictionary will contain each unique integer from the original list `a` as keys, with their respective counts (either 1 or 2, as each integer appears at most twice in the list).
    #
    #In natural language: After the loop completes all its iterations, the list `a` will be empty because every element has been processed, and the dictionary `count_a` will hold the count of each unique integer from the original list `a`, ranging from 1 to 2, reflecting how many times each integer appeared in the list.
    max_score = 0
    for num in range(1, n + 1):
        if num in count_a:
            if count_a[num] == 2:
                max_score += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `max_score` is 3, `a` is an empty list, `count_a` is a dictionary containing the count of each unique integer from the original list `a`, ranging from 1 to 2, reflecting how many times each integer appeared in the list, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, and the current value of `num` is 3. If `num` is in `count_a` and its count is exactly 2, then `max_score` remains 3.
    #
    #This means that the loop has executed for all values of `num` from 1 to `n`, and since the loop increments `max_score` by 1 each time it finds a number in `count_a` with a count of exactly 2, and we know it executed 3 times with `max_score` being 3, it implies that `n` must be at least 3 and all numbers from 1 to 3 were processed, with their counts in `count_a` being checked. The final value of `max_score` is 3, indicating that there were three instances where a number's count was exactly 2 in the `count_a` dictionary.
    return max_score
    #The program returns 3
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list `a` of `n` integers (each between 1 and `n` inclusive, with each integer appearing at most twice) and an integer `n`, and returns 3.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns 3


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
