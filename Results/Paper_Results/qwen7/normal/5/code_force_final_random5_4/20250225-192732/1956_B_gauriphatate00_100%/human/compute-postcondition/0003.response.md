Postcondition: `a` is a non-empty list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and `n` inclusive, and each integer from 1 to `n` appears at most twice in the list. `count_a` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where the key is an integer from `a` and the value is the count of that integer in `a`. The first element of `a` exists, and the current value of `num` is in `count_a`.
