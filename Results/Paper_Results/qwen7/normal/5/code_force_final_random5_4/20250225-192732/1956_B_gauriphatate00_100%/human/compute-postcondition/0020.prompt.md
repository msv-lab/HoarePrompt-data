Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and n inclusive, and each integer from 1 to n appears at most twice in the list; `count_a` is an empty dictionary.
Code of the loop:
for num in a:
    if num in count_a:
        count_a[num] += 1
    else:
        count_a[num] = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `a` is a non-empty list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and `n` inclusive, and each integer from 1 to `n` appears at most twice in the list; `count_a` is a dictionary where the value of `count_a[num]` is either increased by 1 if `num` was already a key in `count_a`, or set to 1 if `num` was not a key in `count_a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `a` is a non-empty list of `n-1` integers where each integer is between 1 and `n` inclusive, and each integer from 1 to `n` appears at most twice in the list; `count_a[num]` is either increased by 1 or set to 1, and `num` is the first element in the updated list `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a non-empty list of `n-1` integers where each integer is between 1 and `n` inclusive, and the first element of `a` is `num`. In the dictionary `count_a`, the count of `num` is either increased by 1 or set to 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
