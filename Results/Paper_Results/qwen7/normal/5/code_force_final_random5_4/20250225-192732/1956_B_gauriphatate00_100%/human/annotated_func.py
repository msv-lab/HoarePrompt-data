#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and n inclusive, and each integer from 1 to n appears at most twice in the list.
def func_1(a, n):
    count_a = {}
    for num in a:
        if num in count_a:
            count_a[num] += 1
        else:
            count_a[num] = 1
        
    #State: Output State: The final state of `a` will be an empty list since each element in `a` is processed exactly once, incrementing its count in `count_a`. After all elements have been iterated over, `a` will be exhausted. The `count_a` dictionary will contain each unique integer from the original list `a` as keys, with their respective counts (either 1 or 2, as each integer appears at most twice in the list).
    #
    #In natural language: After the loop completes all its iterations, the list `a` will be empty because every element has been processed, and the dictionary `count_a` will hold the count of each unique integer from the original list `a`, ranging from 1 to 2, reflecting how many times each integer appeared in the list.
    max_score = 0
    for num in range(1, n + 1):
        if num in count_a:
            if count_a[num] == 2:
                max_score += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `max_score` is 3, `a` is an empty list, `count_a` is a dictionary containing the count of each unique integer from the original list `a`, ranging from 1 to 2, reflecting how many times each integer appeared in the list, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, and the current value of `num` is 3. If `num` is in `count_a` and its count is exactly 2, then `max_score` remains 3.
    #
    #This means that the loop has executed for all values of `num` from 1 to `n`, and since the loop increments `max_score` by 1 each time it finds a number in `count_a` with a count of exactly 2, and we know it executed 3 times with `max_score` being 3, it implies that `n` must be at least 3 and all numbers from 1 to 3 were processed, with their counts in `count_a` being checked. The final value of `max_score` is 3, indicating that there were three instances where a number's count was exactly 2 in the `count_a` dictionary.
    return max_score
    #The program returns 3
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `a` of `n` integers (each between 1 and `n` inclusive, with each integer appearing at most twice) and an integer `n`. It processes each integer in the list, counting their occurrences, and updates a dictionary `count_a` with these counts. After processing, it checks how many integers in the range from 1 to `n` have a count of exactly 2 in `count_a`. If at least one such integer is found, `max_score` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence. Finally, it returns the value of `max_score`, which is guaranteed to be 3 based on the given conditions.
