Output State: **`max_score` is 1, `a` is an empty list, `count_a` is a dictionary containing the count of each unique integer from the original list `a`, ranging from 1 to 2, reflecting how many times each integer appeared in the list, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, and the current value of `num` is in `count_a`. The count of `num` in `count_a` is exactly 2.**

Explanation: The code `max_score += 1` increments the value of `max_score` by 1. Initially, `max_score` is 0, so after executing this line, `max_score` becomes 1. The other variables (`a`, `count_a`, `n`, and `num`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.
