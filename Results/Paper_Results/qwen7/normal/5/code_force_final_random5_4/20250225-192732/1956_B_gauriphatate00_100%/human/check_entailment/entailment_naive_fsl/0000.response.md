Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the game as described. Specifically, the function `func_1` only calculates the maximum possible score you can achieve based on the initial distribution of cards, but it does not account for Nene's optimal strategy to minimize your score. According to the problem description, Nene will always choose cards to maximize her score and minimize yours. However, the current implementation does not reflect this behavior.

For example, consider the following scenario:

- Test case input:
  ```
  1
  4
  1 1 2 3
  ```

- According to the problem description, Nene would play optimally to minimize your score. Hereâ€™s how the game might proceed if Nene plays optimally:
  1. You play a card with 1, Nene plays a card with 1, you score 0.
  2. You play a card with 2, Nene plays a card with 2, you score 0.
  3. You play a card with 3, Nene plays a card with 3, you score 0.

- In this case, you would get 0 points, but the current implementation incorrectly returns 1.

Thus, the program does not correctly simulate the game according to the problem description.
