Output State: **`node_u` is `u`, `_min_edge` is `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]`, `w` is the weight from the next tuple in `edges`, `u` is the first element of the next tuple in `edges`, `v` is the second element of the next tuple in `edges`, `parent_u` is updated to be the root of `u` in the DSU structure, `parent_v` is updated to be the root of `v` in the DSU structure.**

In this case, the code simply assigns the value of `u` to `node_u`. All other variables remain unchanged.
