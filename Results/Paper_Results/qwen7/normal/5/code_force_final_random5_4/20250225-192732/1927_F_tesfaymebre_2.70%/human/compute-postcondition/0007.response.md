Output State: `test_cases` must be greater than 0.

Natural Language Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `test_cases` must still be greater than 0. This is because the loop continues as long as `test_cases` is greater than 0, and there is no code within the loop that changes or reduces the value of `test_cases`. Therefore, if the loop runs 1, 2, or 3 times, it implies that `test_cases` was initially greater than 0 and remained so throughout the iterations. Since the problem does not specify any reduction or modification of `test_cases` within the loop, we can conclude that `test_cases` must still be greater than 0 after all iterations.
