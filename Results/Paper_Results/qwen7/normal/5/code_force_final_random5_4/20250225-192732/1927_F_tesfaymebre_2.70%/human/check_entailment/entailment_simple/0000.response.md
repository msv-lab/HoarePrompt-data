### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding a simple cycle in an undirected weighted graph where the weight of the lightest edge in the cycle is minimal. The solution uses a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) data structure to manage connected components and a depth-first search (DFS) to identify cycles.

2. **Key Components**:
   - **DSU Initialization and Operations**: The DSU class is correctly initialized and used to manage connected components. It maintains the minimum edge weight for each component.
   - **Edge Processing**: Edges are processed in reverse sorted order of weights to ensure that the first cycle found is the one with the smallest lightest edge.
   - **Cycle Detection**: When a cycle is detected (i.e., two vertices belong to the same component), the algorithm checks if the current edge's weight is the smallest in the cycle.
   - **DFS Traversal**: DFS is used to trace the cycle and ensure it is simple (no repeated vertices).

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles multiple test cases correctly by iterating over each one.
   - The graph is processed correctly, and the minimum edge weight for cycles is tracked accurately.
   - The DFS ensures that the cycle is simple and correctly identified.

4. **Execution States**:
   - The provided comments describe the state of the program at key points, indicating that the logic flows as expected.
   - The use of `DSU` and `DFS` aligns with the problem requirements.
   - The output format matches the expected output, printing the minimum edge weight and the number of vertices in the cycle, followed by the vertices themselves.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided code correctly implements the logic to find a simple cycle with the minimal lightest edge for each test case.
   - The code handles all specified constraints and edge cases appropriately.
