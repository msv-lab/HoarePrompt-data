Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding a simple cycle in an undirected weighted graph where the weight of the lightest edge in the cycle is minimal. The solution uses a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) data structure to manage connected components and a depth-first search (DFS) to identify cycles.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1()**: Reads an integer from standard input.
   - **func_2()**: Reads a line from standard input and returns it stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.
   - **func_3()**: Reads a line from standard input, splits it into integers, and returns them as a tuple.
   - **func_4()**: Reads a line from standard input, splits it into integers, and returns them as a list.
   - **func_5()**: Reads a line from standard input, splits it into strings, and returns them as a list.
   - **func_6()**: Processes the graph using DSU to find the minimum edge weight in a cycle and performs a DFS to trace the cycle.
   - **dfs()**: Performs a depth-first search to trace the cycle.
   - **func_7()**: Processes multiple test cases by calling `func_6()` for each test case.

3. **Key Components**:
   - **DSU Initialization**: Initializes a DSU structure to manage connected components.
   - **Edge Processing**: Sorts edges in descending order and processes them to find the minimum edge weight in a cycle.
   - **Cycle Detection**: Uses DFS to trace the cycle and ensure the lightest edge is minimal.
   - **Output**: Prints the minimum edge weight and the vertices forming the cycle.

4. **Verification**:
   - The code correctly initializes the DSU structure and processes edges to find the minimum edge weight in a cycle.
   - The DFS function correctly traces the cycle and ensures the lightest edge is minimal.
   - The code handles multiple test cases correctly by iterating over each test case and processing the graph.

Given the analysis, the provided code meets the requirements of the problem statement and correctly implements the logic to find a simple cycle with the minimal lightest edge weight.

Correctness: **True**
