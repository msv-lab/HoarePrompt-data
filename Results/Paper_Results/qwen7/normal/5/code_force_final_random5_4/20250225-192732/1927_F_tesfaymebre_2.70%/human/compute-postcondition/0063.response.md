Based on the initial state provided:

- The `colors` list is initialized to `[0, 0, ..., 0]` (a list of length `n+1` filled with zeros).
- All nodes in the DSU structure are merged into connected components based on the edges processed.
- The `_min_edge` value remains the same.
- The `w`, `u`, and `v` variables reflect the last edge processed.
- The `dsu` object shows the fully connected graph with all nodes merged into their respective components.
- The `res` variable is the result of the DFS traversal starting from node `u` and excluding the parent node `-1`, and the traversal path is stored in the list passed as the third argument.

Let's break down the print statement:

1. `_min_edge`: This value remains unchanged throughout the process and is not affected by the traversal or any other operations mentioned. Therefore, `_min_edge` retains its original value.

2. `len(res)`: Since the `dsu` object shows a fully connected graph with all nodes merged into their respective components, performing a DFS traversal starting from node `u` would visit all nodes in the graph. The length of `res` would be the number of nodes in the graph, which is `n+1` (since the `colors` list has a length of `n+1`).

Therefore, the print statement will output the value of `_min_edge` and the length of the traversal result `res`.

Output: **_min_edge, n+1**
