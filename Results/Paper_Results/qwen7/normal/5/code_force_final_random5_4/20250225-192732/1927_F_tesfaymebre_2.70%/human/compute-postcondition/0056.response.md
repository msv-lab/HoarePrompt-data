Postcondition: ***`w` is the weight from the next tuple in `edges`, `u` is the first element of the next tuple in `edges`, `v` is the second element of the next tuple in `edges`, `_min_edge` remains unchanged, `parent_u` is the root of `u` in the DSU structure, `parent_v` is the root of `v` in the DSU structure, the DSU union operation unites `u` and `v` with weight `w`. If `dsu.min_edge[parent_u] < _min_edge`, the condition holds true as is; otherwise, the condition does not change.***
