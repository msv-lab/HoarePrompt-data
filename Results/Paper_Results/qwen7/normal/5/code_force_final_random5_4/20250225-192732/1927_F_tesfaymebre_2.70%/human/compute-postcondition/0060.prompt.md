Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `edges` will contain tuples `(w, u, v)` sorted from the highest weight to the lowest, `i` will be equal to `m - 1`, `_min_edge` is set to infinity, `node_u` is -1, `node_v` is -1, `u`, `v`, and `w` will be the values returned by `func_3()` in the last iteration, `dsu` is a new instance of `DSU` with size `n + 1`.
Code of the loop:
for w, u, v in edges:
    parent_u = dsu.find(u)
    parent_v = dsu.find(v)
    if parent_u == parent_v:
        dsu.union(u, v, w)
        if dsu.min_edge[parent_u] < _min_edge:
            _min_edge = dsu.min_edge[parent_u]
            node_u = u
            node_v = v
    else:
        dsu.union(u, v, w)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `parent_u` is the root of `u` in the DSU structure, `w` is the weight from the first tuple in `edges`, `u` is the first element of the first tuple in `edges`, `v` is the second element of the first tuple in `edges`, `parent_v` is the root of `v` in the DSU structure, and `_min_edge` is updated as follows: if `parent_u` equals `parent_v`, `_min_edge` is set to `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]` if the minimum edge weight for `parent_u` is less than `_min_edge`; otherwise, `_min_edge` remains unchanged. If `parent_u` does not equal `parent_v`, `_min_edge` remains unchanged and `parent_u` is now equal to `parent_v` after the union operation.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `w` is the weight from the next tuple in `edges`, `u` is the first element of the next tuple in `edges`, `v` is the second element of the next tuple in `edges`, `_min_edge` remains unchanged, `parent_u` is the root of `u` in the DSU structure, `parent_v` is the root of `v` in the DSU structure. If `parent_u` equals `parent_v`, the values of `parent_u` and `parent_v` remain unchanged. Otherwise, the union operation between `u` and `v` has been performed with weight `w`, and `parent_u` and `parent_v` are updated accordingly.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `w` is the weight from the next tuple in `edges`, `u` is the first element of the next tuple in `edges`, `v` is the second element of the next tuple in `edges`, `_min_edge` remains unchanged, `parent_u` is the root of `u` in the DSU structure, `parent_v` is the root of `v` in the DSU structure, either the DSU union operation unites `u` and `v` with weight `w` if they were not already in the same component, or the condition remains unchanged if they were already in the same component.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
