Output State: **`w` is the weight from the next tuple in `edges`, `u` is the first element of the next tuple in `edges`, `v` is the second element of the next tuple in `edges`, `_min_edge` remains unchanged, `parent_u` is the root of `u` in the DSU structure, `parent_v` is now the root of `v` in the DSU structure, `parent_u` is updated to the result of `dsu.find(u)`**.

In this output state, the `parent_v` variable is updated to the root of `v` in the DSU (Disjoint Set Union) structure, while other variables retain their previous values. The `parent_u` variable is also updated to the result of `dsu.find(u)`.
