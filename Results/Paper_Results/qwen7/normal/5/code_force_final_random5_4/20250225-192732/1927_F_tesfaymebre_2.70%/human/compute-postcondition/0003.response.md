Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(test_cases)`. The key variable here is `test_cases`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `test_cases` is greater than 0.

3. **Analyze the given state at the end of the previous iteration**: The state is that `test_cases` must be greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `test_cases` must still be greater than 0. Since no other variables are involved in the loop head, we only need to ensure that `test_cases` remains greater than 0.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should remain the same as the state at the end of the previous iteration, because the loop condition is only dependent on `test_cases`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0**
