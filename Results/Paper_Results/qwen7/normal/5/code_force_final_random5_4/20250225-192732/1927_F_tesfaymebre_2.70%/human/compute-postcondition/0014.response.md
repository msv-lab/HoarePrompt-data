Postcondition: `colors[curr]` is set to 1, `curr` is an integer representing the current vertex being visited, `parent` is an integer representing the previously visited vertex, `path` is a list representing the current path of vertices being explored with `curr` appended to it, `nei` is a neighbor of `curr` in the graph, `colors[nei]` is not 2, `nei` is not equal to `parent`, and `res` is the return value from the dfs function call, where `set_res` is a set containing the elements of `res`, and either `res` is empty or `nei` is not in `set_res`.
