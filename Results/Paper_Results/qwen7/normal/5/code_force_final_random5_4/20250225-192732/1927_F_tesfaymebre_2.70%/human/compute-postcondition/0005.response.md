The only object in the loop head is `test_cases`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `test_cases`. For the loop to execute again, `test_cases` must be greater than 0 at the end of the previous iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `test_cases` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `test_cases` must still be greater than 0.

State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0**
