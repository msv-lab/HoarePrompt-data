Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `colors[curr]` is set to 1, `curr` is an integer representing the current vertex being visited, `parent` is an integer representing the previously visited vertex, `path` is a list representing the current path of vertices being explored with `curr` appended to it.
Code of the loop:
for nei in graph[curr]:
    if colors[nei] != 2 and nei != parent:
        res = dfs(nei, curr, path)
        set_res = set(res)
        if res and node_v in set_res:
            return res


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `colors[curr]` is set to 1, `curr` is an integer representing the current vertex being visited, `parent` is an integer representing the previously visited vertex, `path` is a list representing the current path of vertices being explored with `curr` appended to it, `nei` is a neighbor of `curr` in the graph, `colors[nei]` is not 2, `nei` is not equal to `parent`, and `res` is the return value from the dfs function call, where `set_res` is a set containing the elements of `res`, and either `res` is empty or `nei` is not in `set_res`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `colors[curr]` is set to 1, `curr` is an integer representing the current vertex being visited, `parent` is an integer representing the previously visited vertex, `path` is a list representing the current path of vertices being explored with `curr` appended to it, `res` is updated to the return value from the dfs function call for the neighbor `nei` of the current vertex `curr`, where `nei` is not colored 2, not equal to `parent`, and either `res` is empty or `nei` is not in `set_res`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `colors[curr]` is set to 1, `curr` is an integer representing the current vertex being visited, `parent` is an integer representing the previously visited vertex, `path` is a list representing the current path of vertices being explored with `nei` appended to it, `res` is a set containing the elements of the original `res` list, and `set_res` is the set created from `res`. If `nei` is not colored 2, not equal to `parent`, and either `res` is empty or `nei` is not in `set_res`, the function does not return anything (None). If `nei` meets these conditions and `node_v` is in `set_res` and `res` is not empty, the function returns a set containing the elements of the original `res` list.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
