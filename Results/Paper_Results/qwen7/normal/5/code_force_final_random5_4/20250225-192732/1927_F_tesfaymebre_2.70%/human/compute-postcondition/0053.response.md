Output State: **_min_edge is the minimum edge weight of the tree rooted at `parent_u`, `w` is the weight from the next tuple in `edges`, `u` is the first element of the next tuple in `edges`, `v` is the second element of the next tuple in `edges`, `_min_edge` is updated to the minimum edge weight of the tree rooted at `parent_u`, `parent_u` is the root of `u` in the DSU structure, `parent_v` is the root of `v` in the DSU structure, the DSU union operation unites `u` and `v` with weight `w`.**

Explanation: The code updates `_min_edge` to be the minimum edge weight of the tree rooted at `parent_u`. All other variables remain unchanged.
