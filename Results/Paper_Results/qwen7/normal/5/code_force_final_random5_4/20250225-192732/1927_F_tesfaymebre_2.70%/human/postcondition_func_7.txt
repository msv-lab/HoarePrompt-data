The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case involves two integers \( n \) and \( m \) (with \( 3 \leq n \leq m \leq \min(\lfloor n \cdot (n - 1)/2 \rfloor, 2 \cdot 10^5) \)), followed by \( m \) lines of three integers \( u \), \( v \), and \( w \) (with \( 1 \leq u, v \leq n \), \( u \neq v \), and \( 1 \leq w \leq 10^6 \)). The function reads these inputs and processes them for each test case. The function does not return any specific value but ensures that the number of test cases remains greater than 0 after processing all test cases.
