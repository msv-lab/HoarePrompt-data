Output State: **`w` is the weight from the next tuple in `edges`, `u` is the first element of the next tuple in `edges`, `v` is the second element of the next tuple in `edges`, `_min_edge` remains unchanged, `parent_u` is the root of `u` in the DSU structure, `parent_v` is the root of `v` in the DSU structure, the union operation between `u` and `v` has been performed with weight `w`.**

Explanation: The `dsu.union(u, v, w)` function call performs a union operation between nodes `u` and `v` in the Disjoint Set Union (DSU) structure, using the weight `w` as the edge weight. This operation does not change the values of `w`, `u`, `v`, `_min_edge`, `parent_u`, and `parent_v` directly. Instead, it updates the DSU structure by merging the sets containing `u` and `v` and possibly updating the parent pointers (`parent_u` and `parent_v`) to reflect the new structure. The `_min_edge` variable remains unchanged as it was not affected by the union operation.
