Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Given an undirected weighted graph with n vertices and m edges. There is at
most one edge between each pair of vertices in the graph, and the graph does
not contain loops (edges from a vertex to itself). The graph is not
necessarily connected.

A cycle in the graph is called simple if it doesn't pass through the same
vertex twice and doesn't contain the same edge twice.

Find any simple cycle in this graph in which the weight of the lightest edge
is minimal.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (3 \le n \le m
\le \min(\frac{n\cdot(n - 1)}{2}, 2 \cdot 10^5) ) — the size of the graph and
the number of edges.

The next m lines of the test case contain three integers u , v , and w (1 \le
u, v \le n , u \ne v , 1 \le w \le 10^6 ) — vertices u and v are connected by
an edge of weight w .

It is guaranteed that there is at most one edge between each pair of vertices.
Note that under the given constraints, there is always at least one simple
cycle in the graph.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of m for all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a pair of numbers b and k , where:

  * b — the minimum weight of the edge in the found cycle, 
  * k — the number of vertices in the found cycle. 

On the next line, output k numbers from 1 to n — the vertices of the cycle in
traversal order.

Note that the answer always exists, as under the given constraints, there is
always at least one simple cycle in the graph.

The variable `parent_u` and `parent_v` represent the root of each node `u` and `v` respectively, after all union operations have been performed. The variable `_min_edge` retains its value from the last iteration since no further updates occurred during the remaining iterations. The variable `w`, `u`, and `v` hold the values from the last tuple processed in `edges`. The `dsu` object reflects the final disjoint set structure where all connected components are formed, and the `parent` array within `dsu` shows the ultimate parent of each node.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, all nodes that are connected through the edges in `edges` will be part of the same connected component in the DSU structure. The `_min_edge` value will stay the same as it was after the third iteration, indicating that no further updates to the minimum edge weight in any component were necessary. The `w`, `u`, and `v` variables will reflect the last edge processed, and the `dsu` object will show the fully connected graph with all nodes merged into their respective components.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a graph represented by vertices and weighted edges using a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) data structure to find the minimum edge weight among all connected components. It then performs a depth-first search (DFS) starting from a specified node to determine the size of the connected component containing that node. Finally, it prints the minimum edge weight found and the sequence of nodes visited during the DFS traversal.

If any neighbor `nei` of the current vertex `curr` was not colored 2, not equal to `parent`, and `node_v` was in `set_res` when `res` was not empty, the function would have returned a set containing the elements of the original `res` list. Since the loop has executed all its iterations without returning, the function will return None.
    colors[curr] = 2
    return []
    #The program returns an empty list
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `dfs` performs a depth-first search (DFS) on a graph starting from a given vertex `curr`. It accepts three parameters: `curr` (the current vertex being visited), `parent` (the previously visited vertex), and `path` (the current path of vertices being explored). The function returns one of the following:
- A list `path` representing the current path of vertices being explored.
- A non-empty list `res` containing elements found during the DFS traversal, if `node_v` is present in this list.
- The result of the DFS function call for a neighbor `nei` of the current vertex `curr`, if `nei` is not colored 2, not equal to `parent`, and either `res` is empty or `nei` is not in `set_res`.
- A set containing the elements of the original `res` list.
- An empty list, if no valid path or result is found.

#Function 8:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: test_cases is an integer such that 1 ≤ test_cases ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of n and m (3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ min(⌊n⋅(n - 1)/2⌋, 2⋅10^5)), followed by m lines of three integers u, v, and w (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v, 1 ≤ w ≤ 10^6), representing the vertices and the weight of the edge between them.
def func_7():
    test_cases = func_1()
    for _ in range(test_cases):
        func_6()
        
    #State: Output State: `test_cases` must be greater than 0.
    #
    #Natural Language Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `test_cases` must still be greater than 0. This is because the loop continues as long as `test_cases` is greater than 0, and there is no operation within the loop that changes the value of `test_cases`. Therefore, if the loop runs for all its iterations without `test_cases` becoming less than or equal to 0, it means `test_cases` remains greater than 0 at the end.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case involves two integers \( n \) and \( m \) (with \( 3 \leq n \leq m \leq \min(\lfloor n \cdot (n - 1)/2 \rfloor, 2 \cdot 10^5) \)), followed by \( m \) lines of three integers \( u \), \( v \), and \( w \) (with \( 1 \leq u, v \leq n \), \( u \neq v \), and \( 1 \leq w \leq 10^6 \)). The function reads these inputs and processes them for each test case. The function does not return any specific value but ensures that the number of test cases remains greater than 0 after processing all test cases.
