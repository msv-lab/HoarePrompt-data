Output State: **`w` is the weight from the next tuple in `edges`, `u` is the first element of the next tuple in `edges`, `v` is the second element of the next tuple in `edges`, `_min_edge` remains unchanged, `parent_u` is the root of `u` in the DSU structure, `parent_v` is the root of `v` in the DSU structure, `parent_u` is updated to the result of `dsu.find(u)`**.

This means that the `parent_u` variable now holds the result of the `find` operation on `u` within the DSU (Disjoint Set Union) structure, while all other variables remain in their initial states.
