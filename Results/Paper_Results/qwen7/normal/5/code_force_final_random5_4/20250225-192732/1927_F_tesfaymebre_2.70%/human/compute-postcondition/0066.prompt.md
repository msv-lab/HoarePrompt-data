You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: (n, m) is a tuple of integers where 3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ min(⌊n(n - 1)/2⌋, 2 ⋅ 10^5), edges is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (u, v, w) representing an edge between vertices u and v with weight w, and DSU is a Disjoint Set Union data structure initialized with n + 1 elements.
def func_6():
    n, m = func_3()
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    edges = []
    for i in range(m):
        u, v, w = func_3()
        
        graph[u].append(v)
        
        graph[v].append(u)
        
        edges.append((w, u, v))
        
    #State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `graph[u]` will include all vertices `v` connected to `u` through the edges added by the loop, `graph[v]` will include all vertices `u` connected to `v` through the edges added by the loop, `w` will be the weight of the last edge added, `edges` will contain tuples `(w, u, v)` for each edge added during the loop's iterations, `i` will be equal to `m - 1`, and `u`, `v`, and `w` will be the values returned by `func_3()` in the last iteration.
    edges.sort(reverse=True)
    dsu = DSU(n + 1)
    _min_edge = float('inf')
    node_u = -1
    node_v = -1
    for (w, u, v) in edges:
        parent_u = dsu.find(u)
        
        parent_v = dsu.find(v)
        
        if parent_u == parent_v:
            dsu.union(u, v, w)
            if dsu.min_edge[parent_u] < _min_edge:
                _min_edge = dsu.min_edge[parent_u]
                node_u = u
                node_v = v
        else:
            dsu.union(u, v, w)
        
    #State: Output State: All nodes in the DSU structure are merged into connected components based on the edges processed. The variable `parent_u` and `parent_v` represent the root of each node `u` and `v` respectively, after all union operations have been performed. The variable `_min_edge` retains its value from the last iteration since no further updates occurred during the remaining iterations. The variable `w`, `u`, and `v` hold the values from the last tuple processed in `edges`. The `dsu` object reflects the final disjoint set structure where all connected components are formed, and the `parent` array within `dsu` shows the ultimate parent of each node.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, all nodes that are connected through the edges in `edges` will be part of the same connected component in the DSU structure. The `_min_edge` value will stay the same as it was after the third iteration, indicating that no further updates to the minimum edge weight in any component were necessary. The `w`, `u`, and `v` variables will reflect the last edge processed, and the `dsu` object will show the fully connected graph with all nodes merged into their respective components.
    colors = [0] * (n + 1)
    res = dfs(node_u, -1, [])
    print(_min_edge, len(res))
    #This is printed: _min_edge, n+1
    print(*res)
    #This is printed: the sequence of nodes visited during the DFS traversal starting from node u and excluding the parent node -1
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but uses a pre-initialized Disjoint Set Union (DSU) data structure with n + 1 elements, a tuple (n, m) where 3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ min(⌊n(n - 1)/2⌋, 2 ⋅ 10^5), and a list of tuples `edges` where each tuple contains three integers (u, v, w) representing an edge between vertices u and v with weight w. The function processes these inputs to determine if a minimum spanning tree exists within the given constraints and returns either True or False based on the result.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
