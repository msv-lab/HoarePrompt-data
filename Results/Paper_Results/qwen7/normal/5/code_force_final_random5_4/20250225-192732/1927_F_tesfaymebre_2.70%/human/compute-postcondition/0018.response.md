Output State: **`colors[curr]` is set to 1, `curr` is an integer representing the current vertex being visited, `parent` is an integer representing the previously visited vertex, `path` is a list representing the current path of vertices being explored with `curr` appended to it, `nei` is the next neighbor of `curr` in the graph that satisfies the conditions (not colored 2, not equal to `parent`, and either `res` is empty or `nei` is not in `set_res`), `colors[nei]` is not 2, `nei` is not equal to `parent`, `res` is updated to the return value from the dfs function call, `set_res` is a set containing the elements of `res`.**

Explanation: The line `set_res = set(res)` creates a set from the list `res` and assigns it to the variable `set_res`. This does not change the values of any other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the addition that `set_res` now contains the elements of `res` as a set.
