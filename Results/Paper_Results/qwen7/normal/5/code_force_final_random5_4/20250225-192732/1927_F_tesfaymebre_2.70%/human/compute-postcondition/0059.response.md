Output State: All tuples in `edges` have been processed, and the DSU (Disjoint Set Union) structure has united all connected components based on their weights. The final values of `parent_u` and `parent_v` for each tuple `(w, u, v)` in `edges` reflect the ultimate root of nodes `u` and `v` after all union operations. `_min_edge` retains its value from the last iteration since no further updates occurred during the remaining iterations. The variables `w`, `u`, and `v` hold the values from the last tuple in `edges`. The `dsu` structure contains the final disjoint sets where each node points to its ultimate root, and the `dsu.min_edge` attribute reflects the minimum edge weight within each component.
