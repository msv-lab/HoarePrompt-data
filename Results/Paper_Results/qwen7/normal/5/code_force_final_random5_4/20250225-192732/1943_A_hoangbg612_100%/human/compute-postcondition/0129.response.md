Output State: **`cnt` is a list containing all keys from the dictionary `M` where the corresponding value in `M` is 1, if the length of `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, then `cur` is equal to the second element of `cnt`. If the length of `cnt` is less than 2, `cur` remains unchanged, `S` is an input integer, `T` must be greater than 0.**

The code `S = int(input())` assigns the value of the input integer to `S`. It does not affect the values of `cnt`, `cur`, or `T`. Therefore, the conditions and values related to these variables remain the same as the initial state.
