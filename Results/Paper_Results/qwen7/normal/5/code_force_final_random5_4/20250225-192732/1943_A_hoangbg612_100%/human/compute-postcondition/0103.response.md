Output State: **All values of `M[cur]` are 1, unless `cur` was incremented and then the loop broke, in which case the corresponding `M[cur]` would be 1 and `cur` would be set to the next value in `N` that is greater than `cur + 1`. The variable `cur` will be the last value that satisfied `num > cur` and `num <= cur + 1` for all `num` in `N`.**

Explanation:
- After all iterations of the loop, the dictionary `M` will contain entries where the key is each value of `cur` that was updated within the loop, and the value is always 1, except when the loop breaks after updating `cur` and incrementing `cur` by 1.
- The variable `cur` will be the largest value in `N` that satisfies the condition `num > cur` and `num <= cur + 1` for all `num` in `N`.
- All other variables (`T`, `S`, `N`, `cnt`) will retain their state from the initial execution, as they are not modified within the loop.
