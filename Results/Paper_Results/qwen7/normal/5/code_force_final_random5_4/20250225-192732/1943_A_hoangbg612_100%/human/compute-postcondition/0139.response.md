Output State: **`num` is the first element of `N`, `N` must contain at least one element, and the current value of `cur` is greater than the current value of `num` plus 1. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block without changing the values of `num`, `N`, or `cur`. The conditions and values of these variables remain as they were before the `break` statement was executed.
