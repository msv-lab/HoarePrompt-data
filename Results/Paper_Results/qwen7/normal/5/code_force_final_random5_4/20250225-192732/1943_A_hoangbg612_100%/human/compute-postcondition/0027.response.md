Postcondition: `cur` is the next element in the list `N` if it was not -1, `T` is an input integer, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a list of sorted integers that must have at least one element, `M` is a dictionary with key `cur` and value 2 if `num > cur`, otherwise `M` is a dictionary with key `-1` and value 1. If `num` is greater than `cur`, then `cur` is set to `num` and `M[cur]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `cur` remains the next element in the list `N` if it was not -1, and `M[cur]` is set to 2 if `num > cur`, otherwise `M` remains unchanged.
