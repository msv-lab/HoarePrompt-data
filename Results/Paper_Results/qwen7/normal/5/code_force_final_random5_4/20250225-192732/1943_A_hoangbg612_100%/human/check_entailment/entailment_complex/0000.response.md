Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves a game between Alice and Bob played on an array `a`. Alice aims to maximize the MEX of her resulting array `c`, while Bob aims to minimize it. The solution needs to simulate the game optimally for each test case.

2. **Key Points in the Solution**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and the array `N` of length `n`.
   - It sorts the array `N` and then iterates through it to determine the second smallest unique number.
   - The logic to find the second smallest unique number is flawed:
     - The code attempts to increment `cur` only if `num > cur` and `num > cur + 1`. This condition is too restrictive and doesn't correctly handle the MEX calculation.
     - The dictionary `M` is used to count occurrences of each number, but the logic to update `cur` is incorrect.
     - The final determination of `cur` is based on the presence of exactly one occurrence of a number, which is not aligned with the MEX definition.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - To find the MEX, we need to identify the smallest non-negative integer that is missing from the sorted list of unique elements.
   - We should keep track of the smallest and second smallest unique numbers and ensure they are updated correctly during the iteration.

4. **Analysis of Provided Code**:
   - The current implementation does not correctly compute the MEX. It incorrectly updates `cur` and does not handle the unique elements and their counts properly.
   - The final value of `cur` is not guaranteed to be the correct MEX for the given constraints.

Given these points, the provided solution does not correctly implement the logic to find the optimal MEX for the given game scenario.

Correctness: **False**
