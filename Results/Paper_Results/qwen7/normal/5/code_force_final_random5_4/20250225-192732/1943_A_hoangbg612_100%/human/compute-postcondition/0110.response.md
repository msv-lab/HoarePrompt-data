Output State: **`k` is the first key in the dictionary `M`; `M[k]` is 1; `cnt` is a list containing the element `k`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `k` to the list `cnt`. Since `k` is the first key in the dictionary `M` and `M[k]` is 1, after executing the line `cnt.append(k)`, `cnt` becomes a list containing the element `k`. The values of `k` and `M[k]` remain unchanged.
