Postcondition: `cur` is the last element in the list `N` plus 1, `T` is an input integer, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a list of sorted integers, `M` is a dictionary that must have at least one key, `cnt` is a list. If the key `k` in dictionary `M` equals 1, then `cnt` contains the key `k`. Otherwise, `cnt` remains an empty list.
