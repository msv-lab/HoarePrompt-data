Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for num in N`. The key variables here are `num` and `N`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**: 
   - For each `num` in `N`, the postcondition states that if `num` is greater than `cur`, then `cur` is set to `num` and `M[cur]` is 1. Otherwise, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.

3. **Determine the state changes**:
   - `num` is the variable that changes with each iteration of the loop.
   - `cur` and `M` are modified based on the value of `num`.
   - `N` remains unchanged as it is the iterable over which the loop iterates.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `num` is the variable that changes with each iteration, it will take the next value from `N` in the next iteration.
   - `cur` and `M` will be updated based on the new value of `num`.

Given that the loop is about to execute again, the state at the start of the next iteration will depend on the next value of `num` from the iterable `N`.

Since the exact values of `cur` and `M` are not specified in the postcondition and they depend on the previous iterations, we cannot determine their exact values for the next iteration without knowing the sequence of `N`.

However, we can state that `num` will take the next value from `N` in the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`num` is the next value from `N`, `cur` and `M` remain as they were updated in the previous iteration**.
