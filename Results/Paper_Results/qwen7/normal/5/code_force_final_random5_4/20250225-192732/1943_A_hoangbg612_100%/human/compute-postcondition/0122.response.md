Output State: **`cnt` is a list containing all keys from the dictionary `M` where the corresponding value in `M` is 1.**

In Natural Language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `cnt` will contain every key from the dictionary `M` for which the value is 1. This means that `cnt` will include all keys that were processed by the loop, as each iteration appends a key to `cnt` if the value associated with that key in `M` is 1.
