Postcondition: **`cur` is incremented by 1, and all values of `M[cur]` remain 1 unless `cur` was incremented and then the loop broke, in which case the corresponding `M[cur]` would be 1 and `cur` would be set to the next value in `N` that is greater than `cur + 1`. The variable `cur` will be the last value that satisfied `num > cur` and `num <= cur + 1` for all `num` in `N`. The sum of all values in `M` is equal to `S`.**
