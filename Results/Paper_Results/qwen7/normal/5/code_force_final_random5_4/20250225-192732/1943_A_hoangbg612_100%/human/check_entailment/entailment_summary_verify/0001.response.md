### Reasoning:

The original assessment concluded that the program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for both players. Let's re-evaluate the program based on the provided problem description and the function summary.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- Alice and Bob play a game on an array \( a \) of size \( n \).
- Alice starts with an empty array \( c \).
- Alice picks one element from \( a \), appends it to \( c \), and removes it from \( a \).
- Bob picks one element from \( a \) and removes it from \( a \).
- The game ends when \( a \) is empty.
- The score is the MEX of \( c \).

#### Function Summary Recap:
- The function processes multiple test cases.
- It sorts the array \( N \).
- It iterates through the sorted array to find the second smallest unique number.
- If such a number exists, it sets `cur` to this number; otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged.
- Finally, it prints the value of `cur`.

#### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Input Reading and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( T \).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array \( S \) and the array \( N \).

2. **Sorting the Array:**
   - Sorting the array \( N \) is unnecessary for solving the problem correctly, but it doesn't affect the logic significantly.

3. **Initialization of Variables:**
   - `cur` is initialized to -1.
   - A dictionary `M` is used to keep track of the counts of elements in \( N \).

4. **Processing the Array:**
   - The program iterates through the sorted array \( N \) and updates the dictionary `M`:
     - If the current element `num` is greater than `cur`, it checks if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`. If so, it increments `cur` and breaks out of the loop.
     - Otherwise, it increments the count of `cur` in the dictionary `M`.

5. **Final Calculation:**
   - It checks if the sum of the values in `M` equals `S`. If true, it increments `cur` by 1.
   - It creates a list `cnt` of keys from `M` where the value is 1.
   - If there are at least two such keys, it sets `cur` to the second key in the list `cnt`.

6. **Output:**
   - Finally, it prints the value of `cur`.

#### Correctness Analysis:

- The program attempts to build the array \( c \) by ensuring that consecutive elements are included only once.
- However, the logic for determining the MEX is flawed. Specifically, the program does not correctly handle the distribution of elements between Alice and Bob.

#### Example Test Cases:

- **First Test Case:**
  - Input:
    ```
    3
    4
    0 0 1 1
    4
    0 1 2 3
    2
    1 1
    ```
  - Expected Output:
    ```
    2
    1
    0
    ```

  - **First Test Case:**
    - Alice can pick 1, leaving \( a = [0, 0] \) and \( c = [1] \).
    - Bob can pick 0, leaving \( a = [0] \) and \( c = [1] \).
    - Alice can pick 0, leaving \( a = [] \) and \( c = [1, 0] \).
    - The MEX of \( [1, 0] \) is 2.

  - **Second Test Case:**
    - Alice can pick 0, leaving \( a = [1, 2, 3] \) and \( c = [0] \).
    - Bob can pick 1, leaving \( a = [2, 3] \) and \( c = [0] \).
    - Alice can pick 2, leaving \( a = [3] \) and \( c = [0, 2] \).
    - Bob can pick 3, leaving \( a = [] \) and \( c = [0, 2] \).
    - The MEX of \( [0, 2] \) is 1.

  - **Third Test Case:**
    - Alice can pick 1, leaving \( a = [1] \) and \( c = [1] \).
    - Bob can pick 1, leaving \( a = [] \) and \( c = [1] \).
    - The MEX of \( [1] \) is 0.

The program does not correctly handle the optimal strategy for both players. Alice should aim to maximize the MEX, and Bob should aim to minimize it. The program's logic for finding the second smallest unique number is not aligned with the optimal strategy.

### Conclusion:

The given program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for both players. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Final: False**
