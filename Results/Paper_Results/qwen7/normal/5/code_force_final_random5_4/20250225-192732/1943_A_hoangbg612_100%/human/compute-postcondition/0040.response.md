Postcondition: **`cur` is the last element in the list `N`, `T` is an input integer, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a list of sorted integers, `M` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `N` that was greater than `cur` at some point during the loop, and the value for each such key is 1. For any `num` in `N` that was not greater than `cur`, the value in `M` is 2. The sum of values in `M` is equal to `S`**.
