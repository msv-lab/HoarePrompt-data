Output State: **`cur` is the last element in the list `N` plus 1, `T` is an input integer, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a list of sorted integers, `M` is a dictionary that must have at least one key, `cnt` is a list with an additional element `k` appended to it.**

The code `cnt.append(k)` appends the value of `k` to the list `cnt`. Since `k` is not defined in the initial state, it remains as `k`. All other variables and their states remain unchanged.
