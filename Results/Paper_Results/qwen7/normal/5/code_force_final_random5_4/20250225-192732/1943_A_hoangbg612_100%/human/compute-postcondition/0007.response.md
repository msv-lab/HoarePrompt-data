Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for num in N:`. The objects involved here are `num` and `N`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `num` is a variable that will take on each value from the list `N` during each iteration of the loop.
   - `N` is a list of sorted integers.

3. **Understand the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, the list `N` must contain at least one element. If `N` is empty, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `num` will take on each value from `N`, we don't need to specify its initial value explicitly (it will change with each iteration).
   - We need to ensure that `N` contains at least one element for the loop to execute.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is `N` to ensure it contains at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`cur` is -1, `T` is an input integer, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a list of sorted integers that must have at least one element, `M` is an empty dictionary**
