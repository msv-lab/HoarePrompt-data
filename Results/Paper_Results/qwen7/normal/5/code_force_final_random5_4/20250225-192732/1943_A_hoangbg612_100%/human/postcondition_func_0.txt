The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \) followed by a list of \( n \) integers. For each test case, it sorts the list of integers and then iterates through them to find the second smallest unique number. If such a number exists, it sets the variable `cur` to this number; otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged. Finally, it prints the value of `cur`.
