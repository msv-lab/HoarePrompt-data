Output State: **`cur` is the last element in the list `N` plus 1, `T` is an input integer minus 1, `S` is an input integer plus an input integer, `N` is updated to a list of integers from the input split, `M` is a dictionary with all keys that were greater than `cur` at some point during the loop having a value of 1, all other keys having a value of 2, and the length of `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, with `cnt` containing all the keys from `M` that had a value of 1.**

Explanation: The code `N = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from the input, converts each integer to an int, and assigns the resulting list to `N`. The other variables (`cur`, `T`, `S`, `M`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
