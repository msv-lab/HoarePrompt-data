Output State: **`cur` is num, `T` is an input integer, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a list of sorted integers, `M` is a dictionary with key `-1` and value `1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The code `cur = num` assigns the value of `num` to `cur`. The values of the other variables (`T`, `S`, `N`, `M`) remain unchanged, and we continue to break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
