Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **`cur`**: According to the initial state, `cur` is the last element in the list `N` plus 1. Since `N` is a list of sorted integers, the last element of `N` would be the maximum value in `N`. Let's denote this maximum value as `max(N)`. Therefore, `cur = max(N) + 1`.

2. **`T` and `S`**: These are input integers, but their values are not specified in the initial state. We will keep them as `T` and `S` since their specific values are not provided.

3. **`N`**: It is a list of sorted integers. This does not affect the value of `cur` directly, but it helps us understand the context.

4. **`M`**: This is a dictionary where all keys that were greater than `cur` at some point during the loop have a value of 1, and all other keys have a value of 2. Since `cur` is `max(N) + 1`, no key in `M` can be greater than `cur` because all keys in `M` must have been less than or equal to `cur` at some point, otherwise they would have been set to 1. Therefore, all values in `M` are 2.

5. **`cnt`**: This is a list containing all the keys from `M` that had a value of 1. Since all keys in `M` are set to 2, there are no keys in `M` that had a value of 1. Thus, `cnt` is an empty list.

Given the above analysis, the print statement `print(cur)` will simply print the value of `cur`, which is `max(N) + 1`.

Output: **max(N) + 1**
