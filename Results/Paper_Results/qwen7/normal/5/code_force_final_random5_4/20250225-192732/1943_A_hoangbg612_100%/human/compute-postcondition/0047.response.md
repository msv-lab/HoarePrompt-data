Output State: **`cur` is the last element in the list `N` plus 1, `T` is an input integer, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a list of sorted integers, `M` is a dictionary that must have at least one key, `cnt` is a list containing the key `k`, and the current value of `k` is such that `M[k]` equals 1.**

In this output state, the variable `cnt` has been updated by appending the key `k` to it, making `cnt` a list containing `k`. All other variables remain in their initial states as described in the precondition.
