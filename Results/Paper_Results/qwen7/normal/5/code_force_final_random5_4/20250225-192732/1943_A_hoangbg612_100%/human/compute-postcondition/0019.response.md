Let's analyze the given state and the for loop step by step:

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `cur` is either equal to `num` or -1.
- `T` is an input integer.
- `S` is an input integer.
- `N` is a list of sorted integers that must have at least one element.
- `M` is a dictionary with key `cur` and value `1` if `num > cur`, otherwise `M` is a dictionary with key `-1` and value `1`.
- If `num > cur + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

### For Loop:
```python
for num in N:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `num`:**
   - The loop iterates over each element in the list `N`.
   - Therefore, `num` will take the next value from the list `N`.

2. **Variable `cur`:**
   - The initial value of `cur` is either `num` or -1.
   - After the first iteration, `cur` will be updated to the current `num` if it was not already set to -1.
   - If `num > cur + 1`, the loop will break, but since we are considering the state before the break, we assume the loop continues.

3. **Dictionary `M`:**
   - The dictionary `M` is initialized based on the current value of `cur` and `num`.
   - If `num > cur`, `M[cur] = 1`.
   - Otherwise, `M[-1] = 1`.

### Adjusting the State:
- Since `num` is taken from the list `N`, the next value of `num` will be the next element in the list.
- `cur` will be updated to this new `num` if it was not already set to -1.
- The dictionary `M` will be updated based on the new value of `cur` and `num`.

### New State:
- `cur` will be the next element in the list `N` (if it was not -1).
- `M` will be updated accordingly.

### Final State:
- `cur` will be the next element in the list `N` if it was not -1.
- `M` will be a dictionary with key `cur` and value `1` if `num > cur`, otherwise `M` will be a dictionary with key `-1` and value `1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`cur` is the next element in the list `N` if it was not -1, `T` is an input integer, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a list of sorted integers that must have at least one element, `M` is a dictionary with key `cur` and value `1` if `num > cur`, otherwise `M` is a dictionary with key `-1` and value `1`.**
