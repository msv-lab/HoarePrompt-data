Output State: **`num` is the first element of `N`, `N` must contain at least one element, and the current value of `cur` is greater than the current value of `num` plus 1.**

Explanation: The code `cur += 1` increments the value of `cur` by 1. Since the initial condition was that `num` is the first element of `N` and `cur` is greater than `num + 1`, after executing the code, `cur` will now be greater than `num`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
