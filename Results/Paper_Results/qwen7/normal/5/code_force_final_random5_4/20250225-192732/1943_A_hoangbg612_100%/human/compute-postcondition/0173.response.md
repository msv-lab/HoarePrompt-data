Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variable `k`, which is iterating over the keys of the dictionary `M`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `k`**: Since `k` is iterating over the keys of `M`, we need to ensure that `M` has at least one key for the loop to execute.

3. **Check the initial state of `M`**: The dictionary `M` is defined such that each key is an integer from the list `N` and the value is the count of how many times that integer appears consecutively in the list `N`. For the loop to execute, `M` must have at least one key-value pair.

4. **Consider the condition involving `S`**: The problem states that if the sum of all values in the dictionary `M` equals `S`, then `cur` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged. However, this condition does not affect the loop itself but rather the value of `cur` after the loop completes. Therefore, we do not need to adjust the state based on this condition for the loop to execute.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**: We need to ensure that `M` has at least one key for the loop to start executing. The other variables (`cnt`, `cur`, and `S`) do not directly affect the loop's execution, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is that the dictionary `M` must have at least one key.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`M` must have at least one key**
