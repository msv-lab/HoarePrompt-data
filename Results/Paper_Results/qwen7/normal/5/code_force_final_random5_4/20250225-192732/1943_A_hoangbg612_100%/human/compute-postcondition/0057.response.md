Output State: `cur` is the last element in the list `N` plus 1, `T` is an input integer, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a list of sorted integers, `M` is a dictionary with all keys that were greater than `cur` at some point during the loop having a value of 1, and `cnt` is a list containing all the keys from `M` that had a value of 1.

In this final state, `cur` remains unchanged as it is only updated at the start of each iteration but not modified within the loop. The dictionary `M` retains its structure from the last iteration, meaning it includes all keys that were ever greater than `cur` during the loop's execution, with those keys that met the condition `M[k] == 1` being processed and added to the list `cnt`. All other variables (`T`, `S`, `N`) remain in their initial or post-first-iteration states since they are not altered by the loop.
