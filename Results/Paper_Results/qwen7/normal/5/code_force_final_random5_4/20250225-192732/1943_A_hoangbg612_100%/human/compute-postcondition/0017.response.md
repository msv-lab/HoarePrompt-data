Output State: **`cur` is -1, `M` is a dictionary with key `-1` and value `1`, `T` is an input integer, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a list of sorted integers, `M` is an empty dictionary except for the key `-1` which has a value of `1`, and the number `num` is less than or equal to -1.**

Explanation: The code `M[cur] += 1` increments the value associated with the key `cur` in the dictionary `M`. Given that `cur` is initially `-1` and `M` is initially an empty dictionary, after executing the code, `M` will have a key `-1` with a value of `1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
