Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the first part of the split input, `m` is an integer input from the second part of the split input**.

This means that the values of `n` and `m` are now set to integers obtained from the user input, split by a space. The initial conditions that `n` and `m` are integers remain true, and the specific values they hold are determined by the input provided by the user.
