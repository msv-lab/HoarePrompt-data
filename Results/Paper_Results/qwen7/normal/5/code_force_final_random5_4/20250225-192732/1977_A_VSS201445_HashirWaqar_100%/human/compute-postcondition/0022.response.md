Output State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `n` and `m` retain their original values throughout all iterations. The loop processes each pair of `n` and `m` independently based on the given conditions and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly but does not modify the values of `n` and `m` between iterations. Therefore, regardless of the number of iterations, `n` and `m` will always reflect the values they had at the start of the loop.
