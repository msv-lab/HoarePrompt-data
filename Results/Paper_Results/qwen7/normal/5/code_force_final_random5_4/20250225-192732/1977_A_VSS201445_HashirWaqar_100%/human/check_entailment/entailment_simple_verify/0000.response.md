### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step using the provided annotations and the problem description.

1. **Problem Description and Constraints**:
   - Each test case involves two integers \( n \) and \( m \) where \( 1 \leq n, m \leq 100 \).
   - Nikita can either add or remove exactly one cube per move.
   - We need to determine if it's possible to end up with exactly \( m \) cubes after \( n \) moves.

2. **Program Logic**:
   - The program iterates over each test case specified by the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( m \).
   - It then checks if \( n \geq m \) and if \( (n - m) \) is even.
   - If both conditions are met, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".

3. **Annotation Analysis**:
   - The annotation states that \( n \) and \( m \) retain their original values throughout all iterations.
   - The loop processes each pair of \( n \) and \( m \) independently and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions.

4. **Key Points to Verify**:
   - The condition \( n \geq m \) ensures that there are enough moves to potentially reach \( m \) cubes.
   - The condition \( (n - m) \% 2 == 0 \) ensures that the difference between \( n \) and \( m \) is even, which means the number of additions and removals can balance out to result in exactly \( m \) cubes.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - If \( n < m \), it's impossible to have \( m \) cubes since Nikita can only add or remove one cube per move.
   - If \( n = m \), it's trivially true because no moves are needed.
   - If \( n > m \) and \( (n - m) \% 2 == 0 \), it means the difference is even, allowing for a balanced sequence of additions and removals.

6. **Verification**:
   - The program correctly handles all edge cases and general cases within the given constraints.
   - The logic accurately reflects the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly determines whether it's possible for Nikita to end up with exactly \( m \) cubes after \( n \) moves based on the given conditions.

**Final: True**
