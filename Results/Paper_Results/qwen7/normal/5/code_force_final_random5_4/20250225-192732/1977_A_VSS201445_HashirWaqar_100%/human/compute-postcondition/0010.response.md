Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers input from the user, and the input values are converted to integers and assigned to `n` and `m`.**

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input from the user, splits it into two parts, and converts each part to an integer. These integers are then assigned to `n` and `m`. The initial state where `n` and `m` are integers input from the user is maintained, and the input values are now stored as integers in `n` and `m`.
