To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State**: The initial state at the end of the previous iteration is given as:
   - `n` and `m` are integers.
   - If `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and the difference between `n` and `m` is even, the values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged.
   - Otherwise, the values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for a number of iterations determined by `int(input())`.

3. **Loop Head**: The loop head does not specify any changes to `n` or `m`. It simply iterates based on the input value.

4. **Iteration Analysis**:
   - Since the loop does not modify `n` or `m` directly within its body (as indicated by the comment `# the loop body is omit`), the values of `n` and `m` remain the same as they were at the start of the current iteration.

5. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `int(input())` must be a positive integer, indicating another iteration.
   - However, since the loop does not modify `n` and `m`, their values remain unchanged from the previous iteration.

### Conclusion:

Since the loop does not change the values of `n` and `m`, and the only thing that affects the loop's continuation is the input value, the values of `n` and `m` remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

### Final Answer:

State: **`n` and `m` are integers** (with the same values as at the end of the previous iteration).
