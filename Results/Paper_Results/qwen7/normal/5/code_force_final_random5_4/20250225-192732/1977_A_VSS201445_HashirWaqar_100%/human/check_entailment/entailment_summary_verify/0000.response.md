### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program against the function summary and the original assessment.

#### Problem Analysis:
- The goal is to determine if it's possible for Nikita to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
- Each move can either add 1 cube or remove 1 cube.
- To end up with `m` cubes, the net effect of the moves must be such that the difference between the total number of additions and removals is `m`.

#### Function Summary:
- The function processes a series of pairs of positive integers \( n \) and \( m \).
- It checks if \( n \geq m \) and if \( (n - m) \) is even.
- If both conditions are met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

#### Program Code:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

#### Validation:
1. **Condition \( n \geq m \)**:
   - This condition ensures that there are enough moves to potentially reach `m` cubes.
   
2. **Condition \( (n - m) \% 2 == 0 \)**:
   - This condition ensures that the difference between the number of additions and removals is even. This is necessary because each addition and removal cancels out, and the difference must be even to balance out to `m` cubes.

Given these conditions, let's consider the examples provided in the problem statement:

- **Example 1**: \( n = 3 \), \( m = 3 \)
  - \( n \geq m \): True
  - \( (n - m) \% 2 == 0 \): \( (3 - 3) \% 2 == 0 \): True
  - Output: 'YES' (Correct)

- **Example 2**: \( n = 2 \), \( m = 4 \)
  - \( n \geq m \): False
  - Output: 'NO' (Correct)

- **Example 3**: \( n = 5 \), \( m = 3 \)
  - \( n \geq m \): True
  - \( (n - m) \% 2 == 0 \): \( (5 - 3) \% 2 == 0 \): True
  - Output: 'YES' (Correct)

The program correctly implements the logic described in the function summary and handles all given examples accurately.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly determines whether it's possible for Nikita to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
