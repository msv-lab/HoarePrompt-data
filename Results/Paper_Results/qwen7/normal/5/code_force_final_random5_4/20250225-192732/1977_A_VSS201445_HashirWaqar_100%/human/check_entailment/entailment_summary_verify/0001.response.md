### Reasoning:

The original assessment accurately describes the program's logic and correctly identifies that the program meets the requirements of the problem. Let's break down the key points:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.
2. **Condition Check**: The condition `n >= m` ensures that there are enough moves to potentially reach the target number of cubes. This is necessary because Nikita needs at least `m` moves to add `m` cubes.
3. **Parity Check**: The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0` ensures that the difference between `n` and `m` is even. This is crucial because each move either adds or removes one cube, and the total number of moves must be such that the parity matches the requirement.

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. The function summary also accurately reflects the behavior of the function. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct based on the problem description and the provided function summary.
