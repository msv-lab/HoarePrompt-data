Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to end up with exactly \( m \) cubes after \( n \) moves. Hereâ€™s the breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \) and then processes each test case.
2. **Conditions Check**: For each test case, the program checks two conditions:
   - \( n \geq m \): This ensures that there are enough moves to potentially reach \( m \) cubes.
   - \( (n - m) \% 2 == 0 \): This condition ensures that the difference between \( n \) and \( m \) is even, which is necessary because each move either adds or removes one cube, meaning the parity (odd/even nature) of the difference must remain consistent.

Given these conditions, the program correctly determines whether it is possible to achieve the desired number of cubes \( m \) after \( n \) moves.

Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description and the provided execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
