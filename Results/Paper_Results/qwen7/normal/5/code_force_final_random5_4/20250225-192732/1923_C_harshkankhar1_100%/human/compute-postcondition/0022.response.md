Output State: **`x` is an integer from the first input split, `y` is an integer from the second input split, `q` is decremented by 1**

Explanation: The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input, splits them based on whitespace, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `x` and `y` respectively. The value of `q` is decremented by 1, but since the initial value of `q` was not specified, we only know that `q` has been decremented by 1. The values of `x` and `y` are now specific integers from the input, while `q` has been modified.
