Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `c` is an array of length `n` where each element is a positive integer not exceeding 10^9, `a` is an array of length `n+1` where `a[0]` is 0 and the rest of the elements are the integers inputted separated by spaces, `b` is an array of length `n+1` where each element is 0.**

The code initializes an array `b` of length `n+1` with all elements set to 0. The values of `t`, `n`, `q`, `c`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
