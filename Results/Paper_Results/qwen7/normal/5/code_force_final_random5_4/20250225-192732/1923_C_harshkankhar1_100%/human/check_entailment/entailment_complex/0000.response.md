Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to verify if the logic implemented in the `func_1()` function aligns with the problem description and the conditions for a subarray to be "good."

1. **Problem Description Analysis**:
   - A subarray is considered "good" if there exists another array `b` such that:
     - The sums of elements in `a` and `b` are equal.
     - No element in `a` is equal to the corresponding element in `b`.
     - All elements in `b` are positive.

2. **Function Logic Analysis**:
   - The function constructs an auxiliary array `b` where `b[i]` is the cumulative sum of some values up to index `i`. This is done using the line `a = list(accumulate(a))`.
   - For each query, the function checks if the sum of elements in the subarray from `x` to `y` in array `a` is less than the corresponding sum in array `b`. If the condition `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1]` or `x == y` is met, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

3. **Verification of Logic**:
   - The construction of `b` using `accumulate(a)` is a key part of the solution. However, the specific values assigned to `x` in the loop are not correctly reflecting the conditions for a subarray to be "good."
   - The logic `if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y` does not directly check if the subarray can be transformed into a "good" subarray by assigning positive integers to `b` such that no element in `a` equals the corresponding element in `b`.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To correctly determine if a subarray is "good," we need to ensure that the sum of the subarray can be split into positive integers that do not match the original subarray elements.
   - The current implementation does not correctly handle the transformation of `a` into `b` to satisfy the conditions for a "good" subarray.

Given these points, the current implementation does not correctly determine if a subarray is "good" based on the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
