Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `c` is an array of length `n` where each element is a positive integer not exceeding 10^9, `a` is an array of length `n+1` where `a[0]` is 0 and the rest of the elements are the integers inputted separated by spaces, `b` is an array of length `n+1` where `b[0]` is 0 and `b[1]` is `x`, `i` is 3, `x` is 1 if `a[1]` > 1 else 2.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b[i]` to be `b[i - 1] + x`. Initially, `i` is 2, so `b[2]` is set to `b[1] + x`. Since `b[1]` is `x` (which is 1 if `a[1]` > 1 else 2), `b[2]` becomes `x + x` which is `2 * x`. Therefore, `i` is updated to 3, and the value of `b[2]` is now `2 * x`.
