Functionality: **The function processes a series of subarray queries on an array `a`. It first constructs an auxiliary array `b` where `b[i]` is the sum of certain values up to index `i`. Then, for each query defined by indices `x` and `y`, it checks if the sum of elements in the subarray from `x` to `y` in array `a` is less than the corresponding sum in array `b`. If the condition is met or if `x` equals `y`, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each query.**
