Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires distributing coins among different outcomes such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received for each winning outcome. This means we need to find a distribution of bets \(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\) such that the sum of these bets is less than the product of the multipliers \(k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_n\).

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1()` takes the number of outcomes \(N\) and the multipliers \(k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_n\).
   - It calculates the product of all multipliers (`prod`).
   - It then calculates a list `vprod` where each element is `prod // r` for each multiplier `r`.
   - It computes `den` as `prod - sum(vprod)`.
   - If `den` is less than or equal to 0, it prints `-1` and returns.
   - Otherwise, it prints the values in `vprod`.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in `func_1()` seems to follow the requirement. For each multiplier \(k_i\), the function calculates the maximum possible bet \(x_i\) as `prod // k_i`. This ensures that the total bet is less than the product of all multipliers.
   - The check `if (den <= 0)` ensures that the total bet is indeed less than the product of all multipliers, as `den` represents the remaining value after distributing the bets calculated as `prod // k_i`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the multipliers are such that their product is very large and the sum of `prod // k_i` is close to the product, `den` might be small but still positive, ensuring the condition is met.
   - The function correctly handles cases where no valid distribution exists by printing `-1`.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic required by the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
