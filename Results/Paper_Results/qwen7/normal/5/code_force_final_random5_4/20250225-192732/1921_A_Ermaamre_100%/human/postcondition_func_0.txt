The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of four pairs of integer coordinates representing the corners of a square. For each test case, it calculates the side length of the square and prints the area of the square (side length squared). The function reads the number of test cases from the input, then for each test case, it reads the coordinates, determines the side length, and outputs the area. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with no return value.
