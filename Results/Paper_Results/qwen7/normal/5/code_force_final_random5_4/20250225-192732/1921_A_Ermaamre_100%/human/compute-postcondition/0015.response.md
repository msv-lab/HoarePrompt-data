Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is 0.
   - `a` is a list of 4 lists, where each list contains integers entered by the user.
   - `x` is a list of the first elements from each of the 4 lists in `a`.
   - `dx` is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in `x`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(dx * dx)
   ```

3. **Determine the Value of `dx`:**
   - `dx` is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum values in `x`.
   - Since `x` is a list of the first elements from each of the 4 lists in `a`, `x` will contain 4 integers.
   - Let's denote these integers as `x1`, `x2`, `x3`, and `x4`, where `x1`, `x2`, `x3`, and `x4` are the first elements of the respective lists in `a`.

4. **Calculate `dx`:**
   - `dx = max(x1, x2, x3, x4) - min(x1, x2, x3, x4)`.

5. **Print Statement Execution:**
   - The print statement will output `dx * dx`, which is the square of the difference between the maximum and minimum values in `x`.

Given the above steps, the output will be the square of the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `x`.

Output: **(max(x1, x2, x3, x4) - min(x1, x2, x3, x4))** **squared**
