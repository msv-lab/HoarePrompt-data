You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: There are four lines of input for each testcase, each containing two integers x_i, y_i such that -1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000. These coordinates represent the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area. There are t test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a = [[int(x) for x in input().split()] for i in range(4)]
        
        x = [p[0] for p in a]
        
        dx = max(x) - min(x)
        
        print(dx * dx)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` must be 0; `a` is a list of 4 lists, each containing integers entered by the user for each iteration, `x` is a list of the first elements from each of the 4 lists in `a` for each iteration, and `dx` is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in `x` for each iteration. The final output will consist of the value of `dx * dx` printed for each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters. It processes t test cases, where each test case consists of four lines of input representing the coordinates (x_i, y_i) of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area. The function returns information about the squares based on the given coordinates.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
