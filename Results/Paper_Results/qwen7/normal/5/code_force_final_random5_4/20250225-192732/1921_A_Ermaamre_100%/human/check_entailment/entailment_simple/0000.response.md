Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the coordinates of the four corners of the square.
3. It extracts the x-coordinates of the corners into a list `x`.
4. It calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates (`dx`), which represents half the length of the side of the square.
5. It prints the area of the square, which is `dx * dx`.

Given the problem constraints and the provided example, the logic of the program seems to be correct. The program correctly identifies the side length of the square by finding the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates, assuming the square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes.

The program does not need to consider the y-coordinates explicitly because the problem guarantees that the square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, and thus the difference in y-coordinates would be the same as the difference in x-coordinates.

Therefore, the program should work as intended under the given conditions.

Correctness: **True**
