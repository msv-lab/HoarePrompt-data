Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Initial State:
   - `t` is 0.
   - `a` is a list of 4 lists, each containing integers entered by the user.
   - `x` is a list of the first elements from each of the 4 lists in `a`.
   - `dx` is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in `x`.

2. Determine the value of `dx`:
   - Since `x` contains the first elements from each of the 4 lists in `a`, let's denote these first elements as `x1`, `x2`, `x3`, and `x4`.
   - `dx` is calculated as `max(x1, x2, x3, x4) - min(x1, x2, x3, x4)`.

3. Calculate `dx * dx`:
   - This will be the square of the difference between the maximum and minimum values in `x`.

Given the initial state, we don't have the specific values of the integers entered by the user, but we know the formula for `dx` and how it is used in the print statement.

Output: **dx^2 (where dx is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list x, which contains the first elements from each of the 4 lists in a)**
