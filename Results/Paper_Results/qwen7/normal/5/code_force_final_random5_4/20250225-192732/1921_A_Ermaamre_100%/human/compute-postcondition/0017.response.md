Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes t test cases, where each test case consists of four lines of input representing the coordinates (x_i, y_i) of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area. The function returns information about the squares based on the given coordinates.**

Note: Since the specific output for each test case is not detailed, the functionality focuses on the process and input handling.
