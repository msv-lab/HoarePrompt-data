Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: The list `a` is a list of `n` integers each between 1 and 100. The dictionary `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a` and its value is the count of that integer in the list `a`, with each integer's count updated based on its occurrence in the list `a` after all iterations of the loop.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, the dictionary `cnt` will contain the frequency of each integer present in the list `a`.
Code of the loop:
for x in cnt.values():
    ans += x // 3


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ans` is increased by `x // 3`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ans` is increased by the next value of `x // 3` where `x` is one of the remaining keys in `cnt.values()`; `ans` is now equal to its previous value plus `x // 3`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ans` is now equal to its previous value plus the value of `x // 3`, `x` is the next value in `cnt.values()`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
