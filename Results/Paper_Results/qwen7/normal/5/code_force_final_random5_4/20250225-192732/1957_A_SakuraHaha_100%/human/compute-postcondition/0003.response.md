Output State: **`ans` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers each between 1 and 100, and `cnt` is an empty dictionary.**

The code initializes a dictionary named `cnt`. The values of `ans`, `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `cnt` is the only new variable introduced, and it is initialized as an empty dictionary.
