Postcondition: `rightZero` is 0, `leftZero` is 1, `left` is 0, `leftMove` remains 0, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is 8, `trightOne` is 0, `leftOne` is 2, `right` is `n`. If `left` is not 0, the current value of `right` remains `n`. If `left` is 0, the value of `right` also remains `n`, regardless of the comparison between `tleftZero` and `(n + 1) // 2`.
