Based on the initial state provided:

- `rightZero` is 0
- `leftZero` is 0
- `left` is 0
- `leftMove` remains 0
- `trightZero` is 0
- `tleftOne` is 8
- `trightOne` is 0
- `leftOne` is 2
- `right` is `n`
- `left` equals 0
- `rightOne` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`

The variable `left` is explicitly defined as 0 in the initial state.

Therefore, when the `print(left)` statement is executed, it will print the value of `left`.

Output: **0**
