Output State: **`left` must be greater than 0, `leftZero` must be less than `(left + 1) // 2`, `rightOne` must be less than `(n - left + 1) // 2`, `leftOne` is decreased by 1.**

The value of `leftOne` is decreased by 1, but the exact new value of `leftOne` cannot be determined without knowing its original value. The conditions on `left`, `leftZero`, and `rightOne` remain unchanged.
