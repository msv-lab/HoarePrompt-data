Output State: **`i` is `mid + 1`, `n` must be greater than `mid + 1`, `rightZero` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `rightZero` is incremented by 1. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `i` is still `mid + 1` and `n` must still be greater than `mid + 1`.
