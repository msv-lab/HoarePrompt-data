Output State: **`leftZero` is reduced to a value that is less than or equal to half of `left + 1`, `leftMove` remains 0, `i` is `n-1`, `rightZero` is the total number of zeros from index `mid` to `n-1`, `rightOne` is the total number of ones from index `mid` to `n-1`, `left` is now `0`, `mid` is 0, `rightOne` is greater than half of `n - mid + 1`, and `right` is set to `mid`, `tleftZero` must be 0, `trightOne` must be less than `(n + 1) // 2`, `tleftOne` is 1.**

Explanation: The line `tleftOne += 1` increments the value of `tleftOne` by 1. Since `tleftOne` was previously 0, after this line, `tleftOne` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state description.
