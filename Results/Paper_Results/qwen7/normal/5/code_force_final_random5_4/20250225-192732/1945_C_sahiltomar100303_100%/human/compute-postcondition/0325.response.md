Postcondition: `right` is equal to `n`, `tleftZero` is equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, and `trightOne` is equal to `(n - 1) // 2`. Regardless of the value of `left`, the postcondition remains unchanged if `right` is already equal to `n`. If `right` is not equal to `n`, then `right` becomes equal to `n` if the absolute difference between `left` and `(n + 1) // 2` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `right` and `(n + 1) // 2`. Otherwise, `right` remains unchanged.
