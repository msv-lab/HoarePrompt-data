Output State: **`right` is less than `n`, `tleftZero` is equal to `(right + 2) // 2`, and `trightOne` must be such that `trightOne < (n - (right + 1) + 1) // 2`.**

Explanation: The code increments `tleftZero` by 1. Initially, `tleftZero < (right + 2) // 2`. After incrementing `tleftZero`, it becomes `(right + 2) // 2`. The other conditions and relationships remain unchanged. Therefore, `right` is still less than `n`, `tleftZero` is now equal to `(right + 2) // 2`, and `trightOne` must still satisfy its original condition.
