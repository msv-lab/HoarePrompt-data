Output State: **`rightZero` is 4, `leftZero` is either `left - 4` or `left - 3`, `left` must be greater than 0, `leftMove` remains 0, `trightZero` remains 3, `tleftOne` remains 6, `trightOne` is either 3 or `trightOne - 13`, `leftOne` is either 5 or `leftOne - 13`, and both `leftZero` is at least `(left + 1) // 2` and `rightOne` is at least `(n - left + 1) // 2`.**

Explanation: The line `rightZero += 1` increments the value of `rightZero` by 1. Initially, `rightZero` was 3, so after executing this line, `rightZero` becomes 4. The other variables remain unchanged as they were not affected by this line of code.
