Output State: **`i` is `mid + 2`, `n` must be greater than `mid + 2`, `rightZero` is increased by 1 (now `rightZero + 1`).**

The code `trightZero += 1` increments the value of `rightZero` by 1. Since `rightZero` was previously increased by 1, it now equals its previous value plus 1. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
