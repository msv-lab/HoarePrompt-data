Output State: **`left` must be greater than 0, `leftZero` must be less than `(left + 1) // 2`, `rightOne` is increased by 1, `leftOne` is decreased by 1.**

The code `rightOne += 1` increments the value of `rightOne` by 1. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
