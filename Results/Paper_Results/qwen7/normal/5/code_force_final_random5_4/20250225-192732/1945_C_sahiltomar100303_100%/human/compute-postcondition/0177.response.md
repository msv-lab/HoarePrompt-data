Output State: **`rightOne` is 0, `rightZero` is 0, `leftZero` is 1, `left` is 0, `leftMove` remains 0, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is 0, `trightOne` is 0, `leftOne` is 0, `right` is `n`, `mid` is `n // 2`, `tleftZero` is 0, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is 0, `i` is 2, `mid` must be greater than 0, the current value of `s[i]` is '0'**

Explanation: The line `leftZero += 1` increments the value of `leftZero` by 1. Initially, `leftZero` is 0, so after executing this line, `leftZero` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged, including the condition that `mid` must be greater than 0 and the current value of `s[i]` which is '0'. The value of `i` is also updated to 2 because the original value was 1 and the increment operation would move to the next index.
