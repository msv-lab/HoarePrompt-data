Output State: **`s` is a string, `i` is an index within `s` such that `i + 1 < n`, `rightOne` is increased by 1 (i.e., `rightOne` is now `rightOne + 1`).**

This means that the variable `rightOne` has been incremented by 1, while the strings `s` and the index `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
