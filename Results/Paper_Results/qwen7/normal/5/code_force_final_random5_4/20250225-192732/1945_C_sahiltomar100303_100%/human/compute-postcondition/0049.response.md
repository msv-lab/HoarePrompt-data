Output State: **`s` is a string, `i` is an index within `s` such that `i + 1 < n`, `rightOne` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `rightOne += 1` increments the value of `rightOne` by 1. The initial conditions for `s`, `i`, and the condition regarding the character at index `i + 1` remain unchanged. Therefore, `s` is still a string, `i` is still an index within `s` such that `i + 1 < n`, and `rightOne` has been increased by 1.
