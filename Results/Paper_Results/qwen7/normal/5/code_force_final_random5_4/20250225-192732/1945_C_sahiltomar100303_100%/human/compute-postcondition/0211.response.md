Output State: **`rightOne` is either 0 or 2, `rightZero` is either 1 or 2, `leftZero` is between 0 and `n` (inclusive), `left` is 0, `leftMove` remains 0, `trightZero` is either 0 or 1, `tleftOne` is between 0 and `n` (inclusive), `trightOne` is either 0 or 1, `leftOne` is between 0 and `n` (inclusive), `right` is `n`, `mid` is `n // 2`, `tleftZero` is between 0 and `n` (inclusive), `i` is `n // 2 + 1, `trightZero` is 1**.

Explanation: The code `trightZero += 1` increments the value of `trightZero` by 1. Since `trightZero` was initially either 0 or 1, after incrementing, its value will be 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
