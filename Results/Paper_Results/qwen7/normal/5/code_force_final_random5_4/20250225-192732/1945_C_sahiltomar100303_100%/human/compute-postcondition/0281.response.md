Postcondition: `right` is less than `n`, `tleftZero` is equal to `(right + 2) // 2`, and `trightOne` is adjusted based on the value of `s[right]`. If `s[right]` is '0', then `trightOne` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `tleftZero` remains the same and `tleftOne` is increased by 1 while `trightOne` is decreased by 1.
