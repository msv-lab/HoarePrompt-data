Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and the variable `t`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is given as an input integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), the loop will definitely execute because `t` is always positive.

3. **Adjust the states accordingly**: Since the loop will always execute based on the given constraints, we don't need to adjust the value of `t` itself. However, we should ensure that `t` is correctly set according to its initial state before the loop starts.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `t` should be set to the input integer value within the specified range.

Thus, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`t` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4**.
