Output State: **`rightZero` is 0, `rightOne` is 0, `t` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4, `n` is the integer input of the user, `s` is the string input of the user, `mid` is the floor division of `n` by 2, `leftOne` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `rightOne = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `rightOne`. This does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the values of `rightZero`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `mid`, and `leftOne` remain unchanged from their initial states.
