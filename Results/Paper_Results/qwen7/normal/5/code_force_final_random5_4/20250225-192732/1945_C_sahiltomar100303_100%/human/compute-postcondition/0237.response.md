Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Loop Head Analysis
The loop condition is:
```python
while left > 0 and (leftZero < (left + 1) // 2 or rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2):
```

This means the loop continues as long as:
1. `left > 0`
2. Either `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2` or `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2`

### Current State
- `left` is greater than -1
- `rightZero` is increased by 1 if the character at index `left` in the string `s` was '0', otherwise `rightOne` is increased by 1

### Step-by-Step Adjustment
1. **Check `left > 0`:**
   - The current state already has `left > -1`, but we need to ensure `left > 0` for the loop to continue. Since `left` starts from a positive value and decreases, we need to ensure it doesn't reach 0 before the next iteration.

2. **Check `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2`:**
   - We need to ensure that `leftZero` is still less than `(left + 1) // 2` after the next iteration.
   - The loop body increases `rightZero` if `s[left]` is '0' and `rightOne` if `s[left]` is '1'.
   - Therefore, `leftZero` could increase, but we need to ensure it doesn't exceed `(left + 1) // 2`.

3. **Check `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2`:**
   - Similarly, we need to ensure that `rightOne` is still less than `(n - left + 1) // 2` after the next iteration.
   - The loop body increases `rightOne` if `s[left]` is '1'.
   - Therefore, `rightOne` could increase, but we need to ensure it doesn't exceed `(n - left + 1) // 2`.

### Adjusted States
- To ensure the loop continues, `left` must remain greater than 0.
- `leftZero` must remain less than `(left + 1) // 2`.
- `rightOne` must remain less than `(n - left + 1) // 2`.

### Final Answer
State: **`left` must be greater than 0, `leftZero` must be less than `(left + 1) // 2`, and `rightOne` must be less than `(n - left + 1) // 2`**
