Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case involves the variable `i`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `mid` to `n` (inclusive), so the loop continues as long as `i < n`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `s` is a string.
   - `i` is an index within `s`.
   - If the character at index `i` in `s` is '0', then `rightZero` is 2.
   - If the character at index `i` is not '0', then `rightOne` is increased by 2.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 at each iteration, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - The new value of `i` must still satisfy the loop condition, i.e., `i < n`.

5. **Consider the postconditions**:
   - If the character at the new index `i` is '0', then `rightZero` remains 2.
   - If the character at the new index `i` is not '0', then `rightOne` is increased by 2.

Given these points, let's construct the state for the start of the next iteration:

- The current value of `i` is `i`.
- After the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
- The loop will continue as long as `i + 1 < n`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`s` is a string, `i` is an index within `s` such that `i + 1 < n`, if the character at index `i + 1` in `s` is '0', then `rightZero` is 2, otherwise `rightOne` is increased by 2**.
