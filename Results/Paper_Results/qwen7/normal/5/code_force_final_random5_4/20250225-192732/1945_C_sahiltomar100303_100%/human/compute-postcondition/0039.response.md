Output State: **`s` is a string, `i` is an index within the string `s`, and the character at index `i` in string `s` is '0'; `rightZero` is 1.**

Explanation: The variable `rightZero` is incremented by 1. Given that initially the character at index `i` in string `s` is '0', `rightZero` starts from 0 and is incremented to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
