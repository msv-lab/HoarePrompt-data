Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `leftZero` is reduced to a value that is less than or equal to half of `left + 1`, `leftMove` remains 0, `i` is `n-1`, `rightZero` is the total number of zeros from index `mid` to `n-1`, `rightOne` is the total number of ones from index `mid` to `n-1`, `left` is now `0` (since `left` starts from `mid` and decreases by 1 each iteration until it reaches 0), `mid` is 0 (as `left` reaches 0, indicating the loop has ended), `rightOne` is less than or equal to half of `n - mid + 1`, and `right` is set to `mid`.
Code of the loop:
while right < n and (tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2 or trightOne < (n - right +
    1) // 2):
    if s[right] == '0':
        tleftZero += 1
        trightZero -= 1
    else:
        tleftOne += 1
        trightOne -= 1
    right += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `leftZero` is reduced to a value that is less than or equal to half of `left + 1` + 1, `leftMove` remains 0, `i` is `n-1`, `rightZero` is the total number of zeros from index `mid` to `n-1`, `rightOne` is the total number of ones from index `mid` to `n-1`, `left` is now `0`, `mid` is 0, `right` is now `right + 1`, `tleftZero` is either 0 or 1, `trightZero` is `rightZero - 1` if `s[right]` is '0', and `trightOne` is `trightOne - 1` if `s[right]` is '1'
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `leftZero` is reduced to a value that is less than or equal to half of `left + 1` + 1, `leftMove` remains 0, `i` is `n-2`, `rightZero` is the total number of zeros from index `mid` to `n-2`, `rightOne` is the total number of ones from index `mid` to `n-2`, `left` is now `0`, `mid` is 0, `right` is now `1`, `tleftZero` is either increased by 1 or remains less than half of `(right + 1)`, `trightZero` is `rightZero - 1` if `s[1]` is '0' or `trightOne` is decreased by 1 if `s[1]` is '1', and `trightOne` is less than half of `(n - right + 1)` if `s[1]` is '1'.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `leftZero` is reduced to a value that is less than or equal to half of `left + 1` + 1, `leftMove` remains 0, `i` is `n-2`, `rightZero` is the total number of zeros from index `mid` to `n-2`, `rightOne` is the total number of ones from index `mid` to `n-2`, `left` is now `0`, `mid` is `0`, `right` is incremented to a value less than `n`, `tleftZero` is incremented by 1 or remains less than 1, `trightZero` is `rightZero - 1` if `s[1]` is '0' or `trightOne` is decreased by 1 if `s[1]` is '1', and `trightOne` is less than `n // 2` if `s[1]` is '1', `right` is incremented by 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
