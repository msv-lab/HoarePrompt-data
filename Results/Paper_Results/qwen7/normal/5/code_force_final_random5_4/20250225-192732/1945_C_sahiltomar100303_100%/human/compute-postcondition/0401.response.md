Output State: **`leftMove` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, `rightZero` is the total number of zeros from index `mid` to `n-1`, `rightOne` is the total number of ones from index `mid` to `n-1`, `left` is `mid`, `mid` must be greater than 0, `leftZero` is less than half of `mid + 1`, and `rightOne` is less than or equal to half of `n - mid + 1`, `leftOne` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `leftOne -= 1` decreases the value of `leftOne` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state and the given code snippet.
