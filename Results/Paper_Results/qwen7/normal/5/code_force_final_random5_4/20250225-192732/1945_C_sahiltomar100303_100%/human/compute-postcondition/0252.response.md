Output State: **`left` is `left` - 1, `leftZero` is either (`leftZero` - 1) or remains less than (left + 1) // 2, `rightOne` is either unchanged or increased by 1, `rightZero` is either increased by 1 or remains unchanged, `leftOne` is either unchanged or decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The value of `left` is decremented by 1. The conditions for `leftZero`, `rightOne`, `rightZero`, and `leftOne` remain the same as they were before, just applied to the new value of `left`.
