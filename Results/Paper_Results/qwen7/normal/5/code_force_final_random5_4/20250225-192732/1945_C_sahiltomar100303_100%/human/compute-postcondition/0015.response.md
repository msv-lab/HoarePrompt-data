Output State: **`rightZero` is 0, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is 0, `trightOne` is 0, `i` is 2, `mid` must be greater than 0, and the current value of `s[i]` is '0', `leftZero` is 1**.

Explanation: The variable `leftZero` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. All other variables remain unchanged, including `rightZero`, `trightZero`, `tleftOne`, `trightOne`, `i`, `mid`, and the current value of `s[i]`.
