Output State: **`leftZero` is reduced to a value that is less than or equal to half of `left + 1` + 1, `leftMove` remains 0, `i` is `n-2`, `rightZero` is the total number of zeros from index `mid` to `n-2`, `rightOne` is the total number of ones from index `mid` to `n-2`, `left` is now `0`, `mid` is `0`, `right` must be incremented to a value less than `n`, `tleftZero` must be less than 1, `tleftOne` is `tleftOne + 1`, `trightZero` is `rightZero - 1` if `s[1]` is '0' or `trightOne` is decreased by 1 if `s[1]` is '1', and `trightOne` must be less than `n // 2` if `s[1]` is '1'.**

In this output state, the variable `tleftOne` has been incremented by 1. All other variables retain their previous conditions or values as described in the initial state.
