Postcondition: **`rightZero` is 0, `leftZero` is 0, `left` is 0, `leftMove` remains 0, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is 8, `trightOne` is 0, `leftOne` is 2, `right` is `n`. If `right` equals `n` and `rightOne` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, then `rightOne` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `rightOne` is less than `(n + 1) // 2`. If `right` equals `n`, `left` becomes 0. Otherwise, the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `left` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `right`, or the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `right` is less than the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `left`.**
