Output State: **`right` must be less than `n`, `tleftZero` must be less than `(right + 1) // 2` or `trightOne` must be less than `(n - right + 1) // 2`, `tleftOne` is increased by 1, `trightOne` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `trightOne` is decremented by 1. All other conditions and relationships remain the same as the initial state. Therefore, `right` must still be less than `n`, `tleftZero` must still be less than `(right + 1) // 2`, and `trightOne` must still be less than `(n - right + 1) // 2`. Additionally, `tleftOne` is increased by 1, and now `trightOne` is decreased by 1.
