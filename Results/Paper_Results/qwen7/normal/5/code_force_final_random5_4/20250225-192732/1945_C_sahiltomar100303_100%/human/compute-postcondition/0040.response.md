Output State: **`s` is a string, `i` is an index within the string `s`, and the character at index `i` in string `s` is '0'; `rightZero` is 2.**

The code `trightZero += 1` increments the value of `rightZero` by 1. Given that `rightZero` was initially 1, it is now 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
