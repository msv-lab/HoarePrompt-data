Output State: **`i` is `mid`, `n` must be greater than `mid`, and the character at index `i` in string `s` is not '0'; `rightOne` is increased by 1.**

This means that the value of `rightOne` has been incremented by 1, while the values of `i`, `n`, and the character at index `i` in string `s` remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
