Output State: **`leftZero` is reduced by 1, `leftMove` remains 0, `left` is now `mid - 1`, `mid` must be greater than 0, `leftZero` is less than half of `mid + 1`, `rightOne` is less than or equal to half of `n - mid + 1`, and either `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2` or `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2` must hold true for the next iteration.**

Explanation: The code `leftZero -= 1` decreases the value of `leftZero` by 1. All other variables (`leftMove`, `left`, `mid`, `rightOne`, `n`) remain unchanged. The conditions involving these variables still hold true as specified in the initial state.
