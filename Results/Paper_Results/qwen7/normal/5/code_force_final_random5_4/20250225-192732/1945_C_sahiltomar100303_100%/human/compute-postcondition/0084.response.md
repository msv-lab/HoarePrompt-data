Output State: **`rightZero` is 3, `leftZero` is either `left - 4` or `left - 3`, `left` must be greater than 0, `leftMove` remains 0, `trightZero` remains 3, `tleftOne` remains 6, `trightOne` is either 3 or `trightOne - 13`, `leftOne` is either 5 or `leftOne - 13`, and both `leftZero` is at least `(left + 1) // 2` and `rightOne` is at least `(n - left + 1) // 2`.**

Explanation: The variable `leftZero` is decremented by 1. Given that `leftZero` was either `left - 3` or `left - 2`, after decrementing by 1, it becomes either `left - 4` or `left - 3`. All other variables remain unchanged. The conditions and constraints on the variables also remain valid.
