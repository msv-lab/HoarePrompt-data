Based on the initial state provided:

- `rightZero` is 0
- `leftZero` is 1
- `left` is 0
- `leftMove` remains 0
- `trightZero` is 0
- `tleftOne` is 8
- `trightOne` is 0
- `leftOne` is 2
- `right` is not equal to `n`
- The absolute difference between \((n + 1) // 2\) and `left` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between \((n + 1) // 2\) and `right`.

The `print(left)` statement will print the value of the variable `left`.

From the initial state, we know that `left` is explicitly set to 0.

Therefore, the output of the `print(left)` statement is:

Output: **0**
