Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition:**
   The loop condition is:
   ```
   while left > 0 and (leftZero < (left + 1) // 2 or rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2):
   ```

2. **Analyze Each Part of the Condition:**
   - `left > 0`: This part ensures that `left` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
   - `(leftZero < (left + 1) // 2 or rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2)`: This part ensures that either `leftZero` is less than half of `left + 1` or `rightOne` is less than half of `n - left + 1`.

3. **Current State Before the Loop:**
   - `leftMove` is 0 (though this variable is not used in the loop condition, it is given as context).

4. **Determine Necessary Adjustments:**
   - For the loop to execute, `left` must be greater than 0.
   - We need to check the values of `leftZero` and `rightOne` relative to their respective conditions.

5. **Initial Values:**
   - Since `leftMove` is 0, we don't have direct information about `left`, `leftZero`, and `rightOne`.
   - However, we know that for the loop to execute, `left` must be greater than 0.

6. **Ensure the Loop Can Execute:**
   - If `left` is 0, the loop will not execute because the first condition `left > 0` fails.
   - Therefore, we need to set `left` to a value greater than 0.

### Conclusion:

To ensure the loop executes at least once, `left` must be greater than 0. There is no information about `leftZero` and `rightOne` directly affecting the loop execution based on the given conditions, so they do not need adjustment.

### Final Answer:

State: **`left` must be greater than 0**
