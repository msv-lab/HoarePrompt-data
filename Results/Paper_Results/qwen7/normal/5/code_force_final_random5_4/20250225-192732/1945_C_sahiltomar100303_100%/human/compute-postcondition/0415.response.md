Output State: **`leftZero` is reduced by 1, `leftMove` remains 0, `left` is now `mid - 1 - 1`, `mid` must be greater than 2, `leftZero` is less than half of `mid + 1`, `rightOne` is less than or equal to half of `n - mid + 1`, and `leftOne` is reduced by 1, and either `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2` or `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2` must hold true for the next iteration.**

Explanation:
- The code `leftOne -= 1` decrements the value of `leftOne` by 1.
- All other variables (`leftZero`, `leftMove`, `left`, `mid`, `rightOne`, and the conditions involving them) remain unchanged from their initial states.
