Postcondition: **`rightOne` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, `rightZero` is either 0, 1, or 2, `leftZero` is between 0 and `n` (inclusive), `left` is 0, `leftMove` remains 0, `trightZero` is either 0 or 1, `tleftOne` is between 0 and `n` (inclusive), `trightOne` is either 0 or 1, `leftOne` is between 0 and `n` (inclusive), `right` is `n`, `mid` is `n // 2`, `tleftZero` is between 0 and `n` (inclusive), `i` is `n // 2 + 1.** 

This means that after the if-else block executes, `rightOne` can be 0, 1, 2, or 3; `rightZero` can be 0, 1, or 2; and other variables such as `leftZero`, `left`, `leftMove`, `trightZero`, `tleftOne`, `trightOne`, `leftOne`, `right`, `mid`, `tleftZero`, and `i` maintain their respective ranges and values as specified in the precondition.
