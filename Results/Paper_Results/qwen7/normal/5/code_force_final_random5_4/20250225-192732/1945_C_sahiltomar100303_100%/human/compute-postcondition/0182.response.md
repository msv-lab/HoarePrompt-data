Output State: **`rightOne` is 0, `rightZero` is 0, `leftZero` is 0, `left` is 0, `leftMove` remains 0, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is 0, `trightOne` is 0, `leftOne` is 2, `right` is `n`, `mid` is `n // 2`, `tleftZero` is 0, `trightZero` is 0, `i` is 0, `mid` must be greater than 0, `s[i]` is not equal to '0'**

Explanation: The variable `tleftOne` was incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. However, since `tleftOne` is not used in the final state, we consider the updated value of `leftOne` which was originally 1 and is now 2 (1 + 1). All other variables remain unchanged.
