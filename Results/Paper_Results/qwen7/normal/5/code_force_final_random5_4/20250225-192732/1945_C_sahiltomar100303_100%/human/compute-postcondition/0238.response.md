Output State: **`left` must be greater than 0, `leftZero` is now `(left + 1) // 2 - 1`, and `rightOne` must be less than `(n - left + 1) // 2`**.

Explanation: The value of `leftZero` is decremented by 1. Since `leftZero` must be less than `(left + 1) // 2`, after decrementing by 1, it becomes `(left + 1) // 2 - 1`. The values of `left` and `rightOne` remain unchanged as per the initial conditions.
