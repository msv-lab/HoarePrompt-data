Output State: **`rightZero` is 0, `leftZero` is 0, `left` is 0, `leftMove` remains 0, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is 8, `trightOne` is 0, `leftOne` is 2, `right` is `n`, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is reassigned to 0.**

The code simply reassigns the value of `leftZero` to 0, which was already 0 initially. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
