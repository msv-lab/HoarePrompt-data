Output State: **`rightOne` is 0; `rightZero` is 1; `leftZero` is between 0 and n (inclusive); `left` is 0; `leftMove` remains 0; `trightZero` is 1; `tleftOne` is between 0 and n (inclusive); `trightOne` is 0; `leftOne` is between 0 and n (inclusive); `right` is `n`; `mid` is `n // 2`; `tleftZero` is between 0 and n (inclusive)**

Explanation: The variable `trightZero` is incremented by 1. Initially, `trightZero` was 0. After executing `trightZero += 1`, its value becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given code snippet.
