Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the constant `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `i` is initially set to `n-1`.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.

3. **Understand the loop behavior**:
   - The loop iterates over the range `range(n)`, which means `i` will decrement from `n-1` to `0`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop starts with `i` being `n-1`, the loop will run as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that `i` starts at `n-1` and decrements correctly within the loop.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` should start at `n-1`.
- `n` must be greater than 0.

The other variables (`match_a_b`, `template`, and `a` and `b`) are not directly involved in the loop head and their states do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 0**
