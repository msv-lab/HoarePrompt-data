Output State: **`i` is 2; `n` must be greater than 1; `match_c` is False**

The code assigns the boolean value `False` to the variable `match_c`. This does not affect the values of `i` or `n`. Therefore, `i` remains 2 and `n` must still be greater than 1. The new information is that `match_c` is now `False`.
