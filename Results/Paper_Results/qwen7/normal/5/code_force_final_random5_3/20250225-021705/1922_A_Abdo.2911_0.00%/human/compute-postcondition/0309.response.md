Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 0 and `i` is 0. If the character at position `i` in `c` is not equal to the corresponding character in `template`, then `match_c` is set to False and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. If the character at position `i` in `template` is not lowercase, then `match_c` remains unchanged and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, if the character at index `i` in `c` matches the character at the same index in `template` after converting both to lowercase, then `match_c` is set to False and the most internal loop or if statement is broken.
