Output: **YES**

Explanation: The initial state specifies that the variable `match_a_b` is either `True` or `False`, but it is explicitly stated that `match_a_b` is currently `True`. Similarly, `match_c` is explicitly stated to be `False`. The variable `i` is equal to `n`, and `n` must be greater than 0. These details are not relevant to the `print` statement, which simply outputs the string `'YES'`. Therefore, the output will be the string `'YES'`.
