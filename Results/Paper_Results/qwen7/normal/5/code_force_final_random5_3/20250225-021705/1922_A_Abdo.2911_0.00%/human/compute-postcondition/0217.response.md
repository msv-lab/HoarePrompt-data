Output State: **`match_a_b` is either True or False, `match_c` is False, and `i` is either `i + 1` or 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of `match_a_b`, `match_c`, or `i`. It only indicates that we exit the innermost loop or conditional block.
