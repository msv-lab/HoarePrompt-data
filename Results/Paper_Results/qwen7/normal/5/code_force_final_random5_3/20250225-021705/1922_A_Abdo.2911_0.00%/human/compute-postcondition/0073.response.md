Output State: **`match_c` is False, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, and the character at index `i` in `template` is a lowercase letter, and the character at index `i` in `c` is not equal to the character at the same index in `template`.**

Explanation: The line `match_c = False` simply assigns the boolean value `False` to the variable `match_c`. The values of `i`, `n`, and the characters in `template` and `c` remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
