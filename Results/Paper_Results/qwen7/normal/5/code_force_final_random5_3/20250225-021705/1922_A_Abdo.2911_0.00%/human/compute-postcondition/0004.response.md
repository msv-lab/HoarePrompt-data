Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string input by the user and stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.**

Explanation: The code `b = input().strip()` takes an input from the user, strips any leading and trailing whitespace from it, and assigns it to the variable `b`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, and `a`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
