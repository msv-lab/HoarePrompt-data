Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `i` is equal to `n`.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `match_c` is either True or False.
- The postcondition specifies that if `match_a_b` is True and `match_c` is False, then `match_a_b` remains True and `match_c` remains False. Otherwise, `(match_a_b and (not match_c))` is False.

### Loop Head
The loop head is:
```python
for _ in range(t):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
- The loop runs `t` times.
- The loop variable `_` is an underscore, indicating that it is not used within the loop body.
- The loop does not change the values of `i`, `n`, or `match_c` directly. However, the loop itself might affect the postcondition indirectly through the loop body, but since the loop body is omitted, we cannot determine any changes directly from the loop itself.

### State at the Start of the Next Iteration
Since the loop does not modify the values of `i`, `n`, or `match_c` directly, and there is no information about the loop body affecting these variables, the values remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

### Conclusion
- `i` is still equal to `n`.
- `n` must still be greater than 0.
- `match_c` remains either True or False.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, and `match_c` is either True or False**.
