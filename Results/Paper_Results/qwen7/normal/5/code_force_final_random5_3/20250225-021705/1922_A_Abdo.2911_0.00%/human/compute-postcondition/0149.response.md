Output State: **`match_a_b` is False, `i` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is executed, which means we exit the innermost loop or conditional block we are currently inside. The values of `match_a_b` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
