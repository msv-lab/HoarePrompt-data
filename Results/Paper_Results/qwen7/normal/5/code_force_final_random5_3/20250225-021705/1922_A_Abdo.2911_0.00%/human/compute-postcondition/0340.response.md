Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing multiple test cases where each test case includes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 20), and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` (each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters). For each test case, it processes these inputs and returns different outputs based on specific conditions.**

However, since the exact output conditions are not specified in the given information, the functionality can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each containing an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 20), and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` (each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters). It returns different outputs for each test case based on the values of `t`, `n`, and the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.**
