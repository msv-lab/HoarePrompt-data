Postcondition: `match_a_b` is either True or False, `match_c` remains False, `i` is incremented by 1, and if `c[i] != template[i]` is true, `i` is set to the next index where the condition is not met or breaks out of the loop. If the condition `c[i] != template[i]` is false, `i` is still incremented by 1.
