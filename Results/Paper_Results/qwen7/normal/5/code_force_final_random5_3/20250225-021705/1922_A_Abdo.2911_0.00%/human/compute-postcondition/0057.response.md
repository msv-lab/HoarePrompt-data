Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, and `match_a_b` is `False`.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns `False` to the variable `match_a_b`. This does not affect the values of `i` or `n`. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged, and `match_a_b` is explicitly set to `False`.
