Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, and `match_a_b` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `i` and `n`, nor does it affect the boolean value of `match_a_b`. It only breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such block is specified in the given code snippet, we assume it breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside.
