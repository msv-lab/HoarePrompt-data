Output State: **`match_a_b` is either True or False; `match_c` is False; `i` equals `n`; `n` must be greater than 0; the current value of `template[i]` is a lowercase letter; the current value of `c[i]` is not equal to the current value of `template[i]`.**

Explanation: The line `match_c = False` changes the value of `match_c` from `True` to `False`. All other conditions remain unchanged.
