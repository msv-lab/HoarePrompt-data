Output State: **`match_c` is False, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, and the current value of `i` is at a position in `template` where the character is lowercase. The current value of `c[i]` is not equal to the character at the same position in `template`.**

Explanation: The line `match_c = False` sets the variable `match_c` to `False`. The other conditions and variable values remain unchanged from the initial state.
