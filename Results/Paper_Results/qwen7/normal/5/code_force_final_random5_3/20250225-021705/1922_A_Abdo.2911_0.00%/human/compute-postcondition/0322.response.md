Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `match_c` is False.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `range(n)`, meaning `i` will take values from 0 to `n-1`.

3. **Loop Body:**
   - The loop body is omitted, but based on the postcondition, if `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or if `c[i].lower()` does not equal `template[i].lower()`, the condition remains unchanged and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out.

4. **Current Values:**
   - Since `i` is currently 1, the loop will check the condition for `c[1]` and `template[1]`.
   - If the condition is not met (i.e., `match_c` remains False), the loop will continue to the next iteration.

5. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will become 2.

6. **Updated States:**
   - `n` must still be greater than 0.
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `match_c` remains False unless the condition inside the loop changes it.

Given these points, the updated state for the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `match_c` is False**
