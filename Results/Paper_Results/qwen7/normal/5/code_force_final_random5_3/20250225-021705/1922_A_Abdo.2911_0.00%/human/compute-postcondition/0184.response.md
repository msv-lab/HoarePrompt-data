Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of These Variables**:
   - `i` equals `n`.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.

3. **Understand the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. Since `i` starts at `n`, the loop will run from `i = n` to `i < n` (not inclusive).

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - We need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 because this is the condition for the loop to execute.
   - The initial value of `i` (which is `n`) is already given, so no adjustment is needed for `i`.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n` to ensure the loop can execute.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`match_a_b` is either True or False, `match_c` is True, `i` equals `n`, `n` must be greater than 0**.

However, since the initial state already includes `n` being greater than 0, we don't need to explicitly mention it again. The key point is that `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

So, the final concise answer is:

**State: **`match_a_b` is either True or False, `match_c` is True, `i` equals `n`, `n` must be greater than 0**.
