Postcondition: `i` is incremented by 1, `n` remains the same, and `match_a_b` remains unchanged. If `a[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()`, then `match_a_b` becomes True and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the values of `i`, `n`, and `match_a_b` remain as they were before the if-else block executed.
