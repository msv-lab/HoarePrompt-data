You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

    #State: Output State: All iterations of the loop have been executed, with the following conditions met:
    #- The variable `t` contains the total number of iterations the loop ran.
    #- For each iteration, `n` is the length of the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.
    #- After processing all strings, `template` is a list of characters derived from string `a` such that:
    #  - Characters in `template` are either identical to those in `a` or converted to uppercase if they differ from corresponding characters in `b`.
    #  - `match_a_b` is True if the characters in `template` exactly match the characters in `a` when both are considered in lowercase, and also match the characters in `b` when both are considered in lowercase.
    #  - `match_c` is True if the characters in `template` exactly match the characters in `c` when both are considered in lowercase, and False otherwise.
    #- The final output will be 'YES' if `match_a_b` is True and `match_c` is False, and 'NO' otherwise.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations, the program will check if the processed `template` matches `a` and `b` in a specific way and does not match `c`. If these conditions are satisfied, it prints 'YES', otherwise 'NO'.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case where `a` and `b` match the template but `c` does not. Specifically, the program checks if `a` and `b` match the template by comparing them directly with the template characters. However, it fails to properly check the condition for uppercase letters in the template.

Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Template Construction**: The template is constructed by comparing characters of `a` and `b`. If they are the same, the character from `a` is added to the template; otherwise, the character from `a` is converted to uppercase and added to the template.

2. **Matching Conditions**:
   - For `a` and `b` to match the template, the program checks if both `a[i]` and `b[i]` match the template character.
   - For `c` to not match the template, the program checks if `c[i]` matches the lowercase version of the template character.

However, the program has a flaw in the way it constructs the template and checks the conditions:

- When constructing the template, the program uses `a[i]` directly, which means it might not correctly capture the requirement that `c` should not match the template.
- The program does not properly ensure that `c` does not match the template when the template character is uppercase.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:

```
4
2
aa
bb
aa
```

- Template construction: Since `a[0] == b[0]`, the template will be `"a"`.
- Matching `a` and `b`: Both `a` and `b` match the template `"a"`.
- Matching `c`: The template is `"a"`, and `c[0]` is `'a'`, so `c` matches the template.

This test case should return "NO", but the program incorrectly returns "YES" because it does not properly handle the condition for `c` not matching the template.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and should return "False".
