Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the strings (`n`) and the strings themselves (`a`, `b`, `c`).
3. It constructs a template by comparing characters of `a` and `b`:
   - If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same, it appends `a[i]` to the template.
   - If they differ, it appends `a[i].upper()` to the template.
4. It then checks if `a` and `b` match the constructed template:
   - For `a` and `b` to match, all characters in the template must match the corresponding characters in `a` and `b` when both are considered in lowercase.
5. It also checks if `c` does not match the template:
   - For `c` to not match, at least one character in the template must not match the corresponding character in `c` when both are considered in lowercase.
6. The program correctly prints "YES" if `a` and `b` match the template but `c` does not, and "NO" otherwise.

Given the logic and the steps outlined above, the program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
