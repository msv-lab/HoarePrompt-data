Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` must be less than `n`, and `template` now contains the uppercase version of `a[i]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the uppercase version of `a[i]` to the list `template`. Since `i` is less than `n`, the index `i` is valid for the list `a`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged, but `template` now includes the uppercase version of the element at index `i` in list `a`.
