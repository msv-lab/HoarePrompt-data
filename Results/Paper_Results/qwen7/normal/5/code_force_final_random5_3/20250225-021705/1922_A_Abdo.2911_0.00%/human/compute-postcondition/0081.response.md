Output State: **`match_c` is False, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, and `template[i]` is not a lowercase character, and the current value of `c[i]` is equal to the current value of `template[i]` after converting both to lowercase.**

Explanation: The code assigns `False` to the variable `match_c`. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `template[i]`, and `c[i]`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
