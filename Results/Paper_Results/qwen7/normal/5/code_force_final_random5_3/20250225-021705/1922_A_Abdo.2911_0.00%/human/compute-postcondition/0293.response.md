Postcondition: `i` is incremented by 1, `n` remains the same, and `match_a_b` is either unchanged or becomes True. If `template[i].lower()` does not match either `a[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower()`, then `match_a_b` remains unchanged and the most internal loop or if statement is continued. Otherwise, `match_a_b` becomes True and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.
