Output State: **`match_a_b` is `False`, `template[i]` is a character, and `template[i]` is not a lowercase letter. There exists at least one of `a[i]` or `b[i]` such that when converted to lowercase, it matches the lowercase version of `template[i]`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of `match_a_b`, `template[i]`, or the condition about `a[i]` and `b[i]`. It only indicates that the program exits the current loop or conditional block.
