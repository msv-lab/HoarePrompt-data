Postcondition: `i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 0, and the character at index `i` in `template` is lowercase. Additionally, either the character at index `i` in `a` is not equal to the character at index `i` in `template` or the character at index `i` in `b` is not equal to the character at index `i` in `template`.
