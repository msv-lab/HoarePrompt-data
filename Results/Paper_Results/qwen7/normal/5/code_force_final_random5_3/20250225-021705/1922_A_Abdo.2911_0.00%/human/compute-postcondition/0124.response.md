Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n):`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to `n`.
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. The variable `i` will take values from 0 to `n-1` during each iteration of the loop.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop starts with `i` equal to `n`, the loop will not execute if `n` is 0 because `range(0)` generates no values.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

5. **Consider other variables**:
   - `match_c`, `c`, and `template` are not part of the loop head and do not affect the loop's execution based on the given information.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0**
