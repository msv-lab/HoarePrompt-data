Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string input by the user and stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `c` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `template` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `template`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, or `c`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
