Output State: All iterations of the loop have been executed, with the following conditions met:
- The variable `t` contains the total number of iterations the loop ran.
- For each iteration, `n` is the length of the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.
- After processing all strings, `template` is a list of characters derived from string `a` such that:
  - Characters in `template` are either identical to those in `a` or converted to uppercase if they differ from corresponding characters in `b`.
  - `match_a_b` is True if the characters in `template` exactly match the characters in `a` when both are considered in lowercase, and also match the characters in `b` when both are considered in lowercase.
  - `match_c` is True if the characters in `template` exactly match the characters in `c` when both are considered in lowercase, and False otherwise.
- The final output will be 'YES' if `match_a_b` is True and `match_c` is False, and 'NO' otherwise.

This means that after all iterations, the program will check if the processed `template` matches `a` and `b` in a specific way and does not match `c`. If these conditions are satisfied, it prints 'YES', otherwise 'NO'.
