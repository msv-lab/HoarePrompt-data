Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, and the character at index `i` in `template` is a lowercase letter. If the character at index `i` in `c` is not equal to the character at the same index in `template`, then `match_c` is set to False and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.
