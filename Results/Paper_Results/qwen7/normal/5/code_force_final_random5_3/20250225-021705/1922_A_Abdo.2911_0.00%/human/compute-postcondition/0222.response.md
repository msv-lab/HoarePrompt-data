Output State: **match_a_b is either True or False, match_c is False, i equals n, and n must be greater than 0.**

In the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variables `match_a_b` and `match_c` retain their last values determined during the loop's execution. Since the loop breaks as soon as it finds any mismatch (`c[i] != template[i]` or `c[i].lower() != template[i].lower()`), both `match_a_b` and `match_c` will be False if any such mismatch was found during the loop's iterations. The variable `i` will be reset to 0 after the loop exits, regardless of its value during the last iteration, because the loop condition checks `i < n`, and once `i` reaches `n`, the loop terminates. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
