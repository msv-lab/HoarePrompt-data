Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t)`. The variables involved here are `t`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue if `t` is greater than 0.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `match_a_b` is either `True` or `False`.
   - `match_c` remains `False`.
   - `i` equals `n`.
   - `n` is greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues based on `t`, we need to ensure `t` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute again.
   - The values of `match_a_b`, `match_c`, `i`, and `n` do not affect the loop continuation condition directly.

5. **New state for the next iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`match_a_b` is either True or False, match_c remains False, i equals n, n is greater than 0, t must be greater than 0**
