Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `n` remains the same, and `match_a_b` is False.**

The code sets `match_a_b` to `False`. This does not affect the values of `i` or `n`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions for `i` and `n`, while `match_a_b` is explicitly set to `False`.
