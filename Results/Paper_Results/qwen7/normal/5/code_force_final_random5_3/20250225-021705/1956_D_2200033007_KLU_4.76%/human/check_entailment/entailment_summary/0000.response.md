Reasoning:
The given program does not correctly implement the problem's requirements. The problem states that we need to maximize the sum of the elements of the array by performing specific operations, but the provided code does not actually perform these operations. Instead, it prints hardcoded values based on the length of the input array, which does not reflect the logic required to solve the problem.

Given the execution summary, the program:
- Takes an integer `n` as input.
- Reads a space-separated string of integers and converts it into a list `a`.
- Calls `func_1(len(a))`, passing the length of the list `a` to the function.
- `func_1` prints either "4 1" if the length is 2 or "13 0" otherwise, regardless of the actual content of the list `a`.

This behavior does not align with the problem statement, which requires dynamic operations to maximize the sum of the array elements. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
