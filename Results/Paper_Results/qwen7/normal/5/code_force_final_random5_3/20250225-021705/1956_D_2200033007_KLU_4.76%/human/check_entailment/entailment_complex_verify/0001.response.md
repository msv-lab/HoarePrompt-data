### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies several issues with the provided program. Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the length `n` and the array `a` from the input. This part is correct.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `func_1` is defined but never actually called with the correct argument. This is indeed a critical issue because the function is supposed to handle the logic for maximizing the sum of the array elements.

3. **Function Logic:**
   - The function `func_1` checks if the length of the array `c` is 2.
     - If `c` is 2, it prints `4 1` and `1 2`, which is correct since the MEX of `{0, 1}` is `2`, and setting all elements to `2` maximizes the sum.
     - Otherwise, it prints `13 0`, which is incorrect. The correct approach would involve setting all elements to the highest possible value within the constraints.

4. **Handling Different Cases:**
   - For `n = 2`, the program suggests setting all elements to 2, which is correct.
   - For `n > 2`, the program incorrectly assumes the initial sum is optimal, which is not true. The correct approach would involve setting all elements to the highest possible value within the constraints.

5. **General Case Handling:**
   - The program does not provide a general solution for any length `n` greater than 2. Instead, it hard-codes the result for `n = 2` and incorrectly assumes the initial sum is optimal for other cases.

Given these points, the original assessment correctly identifies that the program is incorrect because it does not provide a general solution for maximizing the sum of the array elements for any length `n`. It only handles the case where `n = 2` correctly and incorrectly assumes the initial sum is optimal for other cases.

### Final Evaluation

Based on the detailed analysis and the original assessment, the program is indeed incorrect.

Final: **False**
