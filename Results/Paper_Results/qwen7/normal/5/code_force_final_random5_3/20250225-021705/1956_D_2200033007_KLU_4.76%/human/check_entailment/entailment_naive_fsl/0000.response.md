Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, it does not read the input array `a` correctly and does not perform the operations to maximize the sum of the array elements as described. Instead, it hardcodes the output based on the length of the array, which is incorrect. For example, if the input is:

```
4
1 100 2 1
```

The program will output:

```
13 0
```

which is incorrect because the maximum sum achievable is 105, as demonstrated in the provided example. Therefore, the program does not handle the problem correctly for general cases.
