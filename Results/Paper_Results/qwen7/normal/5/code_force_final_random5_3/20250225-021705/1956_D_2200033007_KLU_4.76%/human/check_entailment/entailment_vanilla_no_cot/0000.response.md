Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not actually calculate the MEX for any subarray or perform the operations needed to maximize the sum of the array elements. Instead, it hard-codes the results for specific lengths of the array without considering the actual values of the array or the operations that could be performed. This means it will not produce the correct output for arbitrary inputs as described in the problem statement.
