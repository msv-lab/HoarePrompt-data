### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and compare it with the problem description and the function summary.

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the length of the array `n` and then reads the array `a` from the input. This part is correct.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is called with the length of the array `c`.
   - The function summary states that `func_1` prints one of two messages based on the length of the list `c`:
     - If the length is 2, it prints "4 1".
     - Otherwise, it prints "13 0".

3. **Output**:
   - The function `func_1` does not actually modify the array `a` or perform any operations to maximize its sum.
   - Instead, it hardcodes the output based on the length of the array, which is incorrect according to the problem statement.

4. **Examples Analysis**:
   - **Example 1**: Input: `2\n0 1`. The program outputs `4 1`, which is incorrect because the correct output should be `2 1` after setting all elements to 2.
   - **Example 2**: Input: `3\n1 3 9`. The program outputs `13 0`, which is correct but does not demonstrate the need for any operations.
   - **Example 3**: Input: `4\n1 100 2 1`. The program outputs `13 0`, which is incorrect because the correct output should be `105 2` after performing the necessary operations.
   - **Example 4**: Input: `1\n0`. The program outputs `1 1`, which is incorrect because the correct output should be `1 1` after setting the single element to 1.

Given these observations, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It does not read the array `a` correctly and does not perform the operations to maximize the sum of the array elements as described.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not implement the logic required to solve the problem as specified. It hardcodes the output based on the length of the array, which is not a valid solution.
