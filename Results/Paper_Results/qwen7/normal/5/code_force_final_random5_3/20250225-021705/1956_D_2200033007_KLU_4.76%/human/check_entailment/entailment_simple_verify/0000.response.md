### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description and the provided annotations.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the length of the array `n` and then reads the array elements into a list `a`.
   - This part is correct and handles the input as specified.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes the length of the array `c` as an argument.
   - The function prints hardcoded values based on the length of the array `c`.
     - If `c == 2`, it prints `4 1` and `1 2`.
     - Otherwise, it prints `13 0`.

3. **Behavior Analysis:**
   - For `n = 2`, the program outputs `4 1` and `1 2`. However, this is incorrect. As per the problem statement, for `n = 2` with input `[0, 1]`, the correct output should be `4 1` and `1 2` to transform the array to `[2, 2]`, but the hardcoded value `4 1` is incorrect.
   - For `n > 2`, the program outputs `13 0`, which is also incorrect. The maximum sum achievable for any array of length greater than 2 is not necessarily 13, and the hardcoded `0` operations are incorrect.

4. **Problem-Solving Approach:**
   - The problem requires maximizing the sum of the array elements by performing operations to make all elements in a subarray equal to the MEX of that subarray.
   - The provided solution does not implement this logic at all. It simply prints hardcoded values without considering the actual elements of the array or the MEX values.

Given these observations, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The hardcoded values do not reflect the actual logic needed to maximize the sum of the array elements.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not implement the required logic to solve the problem. It simply prints hardcoded values without considering the actual elements of the array or the MEX values, leading to incorrect outputs for various inputs.
