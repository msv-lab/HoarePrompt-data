Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the length `n` of the array.
   - It then reads the array `a` as a string, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `func_1` is defined but never called with the actual length of the array `a`. This is a critical issue because the function is supposed to handle the logic for maximizing the sum of the array elements.

3. **Function Logic:**
   - The function `func_1` checks if the length of the array `c` is 2.
     - If `c` is 2, it prints `4 1` and `1 2`.
     - Otherwise, it prints `13 0`.

4. **Handling Different Cases:**
   - For `n = 2`, the program suggests setting all elements to 2, which is correct since the MEX of `{0, 1}` is `2`.
   - For `n > 2`, the program suggests that the initial sum is already optimal, which is incorrect. The correct approach would involve setting all elements to the highest possible value within the constraints.

5. **General Case Handling:**
   - The program does not provide a general solution for any length `n` greater than 2. Instead, it hard-codes the result for `n = 2` and incorrectly assumes the initial sum is optimal for other lengths.

### Conclusion

The program is incorrect because it does not provide a general solution for maximizing the sum of the array elements for any length `n`. It only handles the case where `n = 2` correctly and incorrectly assumes the initial sum is optimal for other cases.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
