Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and the second line of input is a string of n characters where each character is either '.', '@', or '*', representing an empty cell, a cell with a coin, and a cell with thorns, respectively, and the first character is always '.', indicating that the starting cell is empty.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    len = int(input())
    s = list(input())
    ret = 0
    thorn = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == '@':
            thorn = 0
            ret += 1
        elif i == '*':
            thorn += 1
            if thorn == 2:
                break
        else:
            thorn == 0
    print(ret)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `thorn` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `ret` is 0, and `i` is the last character in the list `s`.

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `thorn` can take on any value between 0 and 3 depending on how many times the conditions inside the loop were met. Specifically, `thorn` will be incremented by 1 each time it encounters an '@' symbol, and it will be incremented by 1 twice when encountering two consecutive '*' symbols, which would cause the loop to break early. The variable `ret` remains 0 as no changes are made to it within the loop. The variable `i` will be the last character processed in the list `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After all iterations of the loop, `thorn` will be 0 if it was reset to 0 inside the loop (due to encountering '@'), and it will be 1 if it was incremented to 2 and then reset to 0 due to encountering '*' twice. The variable `ret` will be equal to the number of times '@' was encountered during the loop's execution. The variables `t`, `len`, `s`, and `i` will retain their original values from the initial state.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `thorn` is 1, `ret` is 1, and `s` has been fully iterated through.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
