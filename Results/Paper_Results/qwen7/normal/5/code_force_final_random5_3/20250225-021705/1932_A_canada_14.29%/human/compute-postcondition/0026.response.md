Output State: **`thorn` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `ret` is 1, and `i` is the next character in the list `s`.**

Explanation: The code `ret += 1` increments the value of `ret` by 1. Since `ret` was initially 0, after executing this line, `ret` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
