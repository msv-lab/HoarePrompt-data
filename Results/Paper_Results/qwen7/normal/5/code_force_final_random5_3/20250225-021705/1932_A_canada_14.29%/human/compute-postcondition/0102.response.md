Output State: **`thorn` is 0 or 1, `ret` is incremented by 1, `len` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The variable `len` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means it will take an integer input from the user. The other variables (`thorn`, `ret`, `t`, `s`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
