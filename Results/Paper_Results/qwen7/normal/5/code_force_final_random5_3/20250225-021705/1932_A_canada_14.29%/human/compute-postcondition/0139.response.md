Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in s`. The variables involved here are `i` (the current character being processed) and `s` (the string being iterated over).

2. **Understand the Postcondition**: The postcondition states that `thorn` is incremented by 1 if the current character `i` is '*', and if `thorn` equals 2, we break out of the loop. Otherwise, `thorn` is reset to 0.

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `thorn` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether the condition was met in the previous iteration.
   - `i` is the current character being processed in the string `s`.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues as long as `thorn` is less than 2, we need to consider two scenarios:
     - If `thorn` is 0, then `i` will be the next character in the string `s`, and `thorn` will be reset to 0.
     - If `thorn` is 1, then `i` will be the next character in the string `s`, and `thorn` will be incremented to 1.

5. **Formulate the New State**:
   - Regardless of the value of `thorn` at the end of the previous iteration, `i` will be the next character in the string `s`.
   - `thorn` will be reset to 0 if it was 1, or remain 0 if it was 0.

Given these considerations, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`thorn` is 0, `i` is the next character in the string `s`**
