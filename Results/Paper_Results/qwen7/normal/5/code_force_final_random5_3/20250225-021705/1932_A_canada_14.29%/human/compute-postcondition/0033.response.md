Postcondition: `thorn` is either 0 or 2, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `ret` is 0, and `i` is the next character in the list `s`. In either case (whether `i == '*'` is true or false), the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.
