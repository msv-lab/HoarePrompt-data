Postcondition: `thorn` is either 1 or 0, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least one character, `ret` is 0, and `i` is the first character in the list `s`, but `i` is not '@'. If `i` equals '*', then `thorn` is set to 1. Otherwise, `thorn` remains 0.
