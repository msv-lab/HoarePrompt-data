Postcondition: `thorn` is either 1 or 0, depending on the value of `i`. If `i` is '@', then `thorn` remains 1. If `i` is not '@', then `thorn` is incremented by 1. Additionally, `t`, `len`, `s`, and `ret` retain their original values. If `thorn` equals 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, `thorn` is reset to 0.
