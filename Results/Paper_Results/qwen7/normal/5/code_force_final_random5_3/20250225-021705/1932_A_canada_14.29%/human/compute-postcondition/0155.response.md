Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a string of `n` characters ('.', '@', '*'). It counts the number of '@' characters (cells with coins) in each string, breaking early if two consecutive '*' characters (cells with thorns) are found. For each test case, it prints the count of '@' characters. The final state of the program includes the printed counts for all test cases.**
