Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given solution attempts to maximize the beauty of the array by sorting it and then pairing the smallest and largest remaining elements to calculate the difference. However, this approach does not always yield the maximum possible beauty.

To maximize the beauty, we should aim to maximize the positive differences between consecutive elements. The optimal strategy involves arranging the array such that the largest elements are placed at even indices and the smallest elements are placed at odd indices. This ensures that the differences \(a_{i} - a_{i-1}\) are maximized for all \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(ntest):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        kq = 0
        for i in range(n // 2):
            kq += a[n - i - 1] - a[i]
        if n % 2 == 1:
            kq += a[n // 2]
        print(kq)

func()
```

This corrected version sorts the array and then calculates the beauty by pairing the largest and smallest elements appropriately, ensuring the maximum possible beauty.
