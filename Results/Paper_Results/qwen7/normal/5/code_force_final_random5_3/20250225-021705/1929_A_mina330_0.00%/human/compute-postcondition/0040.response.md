Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `len(a) // 2`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `len(a) // 2`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 2.
   - `kq` is `a[len(a) - 1] - a[0] + a[len(a) - 2] - a[1]`.

4. **Calculate the New Value of `i`**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - Therefore, if `i` was 2, the new value of `i` will be 3.

5. **Check the Condition for the Next Iteration**:
   - The loop will continue if `i < len(a) // 2`.
   - We need to determine the value of `len(a) // 2` to check this condition.

6. **Determine the Value of `len(a) // 2`**:
   - Since `i` was 2 and the loop continues, `i` must be less than `len(a) // 2`.
   - This means `len(a) // 2` must be greater than 2.
   - Therefore, `len(a) // 2` must be at least 3.

7. **Adjust the State**:
   - `i` will be updated to 3.
   - `kq` remains unchanged because it is not affected by the loop head.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 3, `kq` is `a[len(a) - 1] - a[0] + a[len(a) - 2] - a[1]`**
