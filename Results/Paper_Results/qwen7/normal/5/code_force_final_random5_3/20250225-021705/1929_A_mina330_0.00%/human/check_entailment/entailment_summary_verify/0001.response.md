### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the beauty of the array \(a\) which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements: \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).
   - To maximize this sum, we should aim to have the largest possible values in positions where they can contribute positively to the sum, and the smallest possible values in positions where they can contribute negatively.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution:**
   - The solution sorts the array `a` in ascending order.
   - It then calculates the beauty by pairing the smallest half of the sorted array with the largest half and summing the differences.
   - Specifically, for each pair \((a[i], a[len(a) - i - 1])\), it computes \(a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]\).

3. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - Sorting the array ensures that the smallest elements are paired with the largest elements.
   - By subtracting the smaller element from the larger one, we ensure that the differences are maximized.
   - However, the current implementation only considers pairs from the middle of the sorted array, which may not always yield the maximum beauty.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - Consider the following example:
     - Input: 
       ```
       1
       4
       3 4 3 3
       ```
     - Expected Output: 
       ```
       1
       ```
     - The given solution would sort the array to \([3, 3, 3, 4]\) and calculate the beauty as \((4 - 3) + (3 - 3) = 1\).
     - However, the optimal arrangement could be \([3, 4, 3, 3]\) or \([4, 3, 3, 3]\), both yielding a beauty of \(1\), but the current implementation does not consider these arrangements.

5. **Verification:**
   - The provided examples in the problem statement do not cover all edge cases.
   - The solution does not guarantee the maximum beauty in all scenarios, especially when the array has repeated elements or specific patterns.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the beauty of the array in all cases. The current implementation only considers pairs from the middle of the sorted array, which may not always yield the maximum beauty.

**Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
