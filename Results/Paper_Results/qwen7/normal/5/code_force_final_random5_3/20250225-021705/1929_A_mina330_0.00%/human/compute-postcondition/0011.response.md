Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is defined by the variable `i` and the list `a`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `0` to `len(a) // 2 - 1` (inclusive), incrementing `i` by `1` each time. This means `i` starts at `0` and goes up to `len(a) // 2 - 1`.

3. **Determine the Current State**:
   - The expression `kq = kq + a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]` is evaluated inside the loop.
   - We need to determine the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration.

4. **Analyze the Previous Iteration**:
   - Let's assume the loop just finished its last iteration.
   - If the loop just finished, `i` would have reached the maximum value it can take, which is `len(a) // 2 - 1`.

5. **Adjust the State**:
   - Since `i` was at its maximum value (`len(a) // 2 - 1`), for the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by `1` and set to `len(a) // 2`.
   - Therefore, `i` will be `len(a) // 2` at the start of the next iteration.

6. **Final State**:
   - The value of `kq` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.
   - The value of `i` changes to `len(a) // 2`.
   - The list `a` remains the same.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`kq` is updated to `kq + a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]`, `i` is `len(a) // 2`, `a` is the same list**
