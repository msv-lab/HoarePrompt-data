Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `index` is increased by `n`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(array)`, `results` list now contains the `result` as its last element.**

Explanation: The line `results.append(result)` appends the value of `result` to the list `results`. Since `result` is the return value of `func_1(array)`, it adds this return value to the list. The other variables (`t`, `index`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
