### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array by rearranging its elements. The beauty is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements, i.e., \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function sorts the array and then calculates the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
   - Sorting ensures that the differences are minimized, leading to the maximum possible beauty when the smallest elements are placed next to each other.
   - The function correctly returns the sum of these differences.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It correctly handles the input parsing and ensures that the input data is processed for each test case.
   - The function prints the results for each test case and ensures that all input data is consumed.

4. **Overall Program Correctness**:
   - Both functions work together to solve the problem as described.
   - `func_1` correctly computes the maximum beauty for a given array by sorting and calculating the sum of differences.
   - `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and prints the results.

Given that both functions correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem and work together seamlessly, the overall program is correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
