Output State: **`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases; `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.**

Explanation: The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was already defined in the initial state. The `input()` function reads a line of input, and `split()` splits this line into a list of strings based on whitespace. These strings are then assigned to the variable `data`. Therefore, `data` now holds the split input as a list of strings, while `t` retains its original value as a positive integer representing the number of test cases.
