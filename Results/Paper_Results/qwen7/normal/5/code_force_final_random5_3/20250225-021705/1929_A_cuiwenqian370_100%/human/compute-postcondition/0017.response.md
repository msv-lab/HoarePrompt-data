Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `index` is increased by `2 * n + int(data[index]) + 1`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(array)`, `results` list now contains the return value of `func_1(array)` as its last element, `n` is `int(data[index])`, `array` is a list of integers created from `data[index:index + n]`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `result` to be the return value of `func_1(array)`. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial state descriptions.
