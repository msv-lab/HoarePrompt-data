Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `index` is increased by `2 * n + int(data[index]) + 1`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(array)`, `results` list now contains the return value of `func_1(array)` as its last element, `n` is `int(data[index])`, array is a list of integers created from `data[index:index + n]`, `results` list has the return value of `func_1(array)` appended as its last element, `n` is `int(data[index])`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `data[index]` converted to an integer to the variable `n`. This updates the value of `n` but does not affect the other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the conditions and values of the other variables remain unchanged.
