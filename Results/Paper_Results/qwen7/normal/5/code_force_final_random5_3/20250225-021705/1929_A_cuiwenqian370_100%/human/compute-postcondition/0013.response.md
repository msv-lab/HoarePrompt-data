Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `index` is increased by `n + int(data[index])`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(array)`, `results` list now contains the `result` as its last element, `n` is `int(data[index])`**.

This means that `n` is assigned the value of `int(data[index])`. The `index` is increased by the original value of `n` plus the new value of `n`, which is `int(data[index])`. All other variables remain in their previous states.
