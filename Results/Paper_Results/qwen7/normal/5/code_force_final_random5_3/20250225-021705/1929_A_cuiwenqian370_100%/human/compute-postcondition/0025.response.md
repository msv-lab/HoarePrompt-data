Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `index` is increased by `2 * n + int(data[index]) + 2`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(array)`, `results` list now contains the return value of `func_1(array)` as its last element, `n` is `int(data[index])`, `array` is a list of integers created from `data[index:index + n]`, `results` list has the return value of `func_1(array)` appended as its last element, `index` is increased by `n`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(array)`, `results` list now contains the return value of `func_1(array)` as its last element.**

Explanation: The code appends the current value of `result` to the `results` list. This means the `results` list now contains the return value of `func_1(array)` as its last element, which was already true before the append operation. The other variables remain unchanged as per their initial conditions.
