Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `index` is increased by 2 * n + int(data[index]) + 2, `result` is the return value of `func_1(array)`, `results` list now contains the return value of `func_1(array)` as its last element, `n` is `int(data[index])`, array is a list of integers created from `data[index:index + n]`, `results` list has the return value of `func_1(array)` appended as its last element, `n` is `int(data[index])`**.

Explanation: The code `index += 1` increments the value of `index` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The new value of `index` is calculated as `2 * n + int(data[index]) + 1 + 1`, which simplifies to `2 * n + int(data[index]) + 2`.
