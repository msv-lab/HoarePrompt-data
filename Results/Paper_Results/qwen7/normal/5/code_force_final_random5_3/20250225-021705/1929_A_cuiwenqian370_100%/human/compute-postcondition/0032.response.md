Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `index` is set such that there are enough elements in `data` to create the required arrays.
- `results` list contains at least two elements.

However, the specific values of `results` are not explicitly stated. Since `results` is described as containing at least two elements, we can only infer that it has at least two elements but cannot determine their exact values without more information.

Given this, the print statement `print(result)` will output the `results` list, which contains at least two elements.

Output: **result (where result is a list containing at least two elements)**
