Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(t)`. The only variable directly involved in this loop is `t`.

2. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is greater than 1.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 1.
   - `index` is increased by `2 * n + int(data[index]) + 1`.
   - `result` is the return value of `func_1(array)`.
   - `results` list now contains the return value of `func_1(array)` as its last element.
   - `n` is `int(data[index])`.
   - `array` is a list of integers created from `data[index:index + n]`.
   - `results` list has the return value of `func_1(array)` appended as its last element.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 1.
   - After the current iteration, `t` is decreased by 1 (since it is iterating over `range(t)`).

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `t` is decreased by 1, if `t` was 2 before the iteration, it will be 1 after the iteration.
   - Therefore, `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

**Final State**:
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `index` is increased by `2 * n + int(data[index]) + 1`.
- `result` is the return value of `func_1(array)`.
- `results` list now contains the return value of `func_1(array)` as its last element.
- `n` is `int(data[index])`.
- `array` is a list of integers created from `data[index:index + n]`.
- `results` list has the return value of `func_1(array)` appended as its last element.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `index` is increased by `2 * n + int(data[index]) + 1`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(array)`, `results` list now contains the return value of `func_1(array)` as its last element, `n` is `int(data[index])`, `array` is a list of integers created from `data[index:index + n]`, `results` list has the return value of `func_1(array)` appended as its last element**.
