Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `index` is increased by 1, `array` is a list of integers extracted from `data` starting from `index` and having length `n`.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `array` by mapping each element in the slice of `data` from `index` to `index + n` to an integer. The values of `t` and `index` are updated according to the initial state, and a new list `array` is created based on the specified slice of `data`.
