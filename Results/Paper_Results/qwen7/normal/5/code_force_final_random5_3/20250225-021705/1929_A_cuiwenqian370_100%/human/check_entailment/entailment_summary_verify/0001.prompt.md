You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(array):
    array.sort()
    beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, len(array)):
        beauty += abs(array[i] - array[i - 1])
    return beauty

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        array = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = func_1(array)
        results.append(result)
    for result in results:
        print(result)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer n and a list of n integers. It calls `func_1(array)` for each test case to determine the maximum beauty of the array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. After processing all test cases, it prints the result for each test case. The final state of the program is that all results are printed, and the `data` list is fully consumed.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to maximize the beauty of the array \( a \), defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements.
   - The beauty is calculated as \( \sum_{i=2}^{n} (a_i - a_{i-1}) \).
   - To maximize this, we should arrange the elements such that the differences are maximized.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - The beauty is maximized when the smallest element is placed at the beginning and the largest element is placed at the end of the array.
   - This ensures that the difference between the first and second elements is maximized, and so on.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function sorts the array and calculates the beauty.
   - Sorting the array ensures that the smallest and largest elements are placed at the beginning and end, respectively.
   - The loop then calculates the beauty as the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements.

4. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the input in a specific format and processing each test case separately.

### Verification

- **Sorting and Calculation**: 
  - The sorting in `func_1` ensures that the smallest and largest elements are placed at the appropriate positions.
  - The calculation of beauty using sorted elements is correct.

- **Input Handling**:
  - `func_2` correctly reads the input and processes each test case independently.
  - It uses the sorted array to calculate the beauty for each test case.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array by sorting and calculating the beauty as described.
