Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for result in results:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `result` and `results`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: For the loop to continue, there must be at least one element left in the `results` list.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `index` is set such that there are enough elements in `data` to create the required arrays.
   - `results` list contains at least one element.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues as long as there are elements in `results`, and at the end of the previous iteration, `results` contained at least one element, for the loop to continue, `results` must contain at least two elements (one for the current iteration and one for the next iteration).

5. **Update the state**:
   - `t` remains the same because it is not directly involved in the loop head.
   - `index` remains the same because it is not directly involved in the loop head.
   - `results` must now contain at least two elements.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `t` must be greater than 0, `index` is set such that there are enough elements in `data` to create the required arrays, and `results` list contains at least two elements**
