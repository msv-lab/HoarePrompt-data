Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `index` is increased by `2 * n + int(data[index]) + 2`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(array)`, `results` list now contains the return value of `func_1(array)` as its last element, `n` is `int(data[index])`, `array` is a list of integers created from `data[index:index + n]`, `results` list has the return value of `func_1(array)` appended as its last element, `n` is `int(data[index])`, `array` is a list of integers created from `data[index:index + n]`, `index` is increased by `n` and `result` is the return value of `func_1(array)`**.

This means that the function `func_1(array)` has been called with the array created from `data[index:index + n]`, and its return value has been assigned to `result`. The `index` has been updated twice: first by `2 * n + int(data[index]) + 2` and then by `n`. The `results` list now includes the return value of `func_1(array)` as its last element.
