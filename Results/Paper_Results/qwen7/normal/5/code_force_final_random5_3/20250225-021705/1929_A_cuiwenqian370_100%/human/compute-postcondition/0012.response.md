Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop is defined as `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable in the loop head is `t`.

2. **Understand the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
   - `t` must be greater than 0
   - `index` is increased by `n`
   - `result` is the return value of `func_1(array)`
   - `results` list now contains the `result` as its last element

3. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0. Since the loop is defined as `for _ in range(t)`, if `t` is greater than 0, the loop will execute.

4. **Adjust the state**: We need to ensure that `t` is still greater than 0 for the next iteration. Since `t` is used as the upper bound for the range function, it will be decremented by 1 during each iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `t` should be `t - 1`.

5. **Update the other states**: The other states (`index`, `result`, and `results`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

So, the updated state for the start of the next iteration is:
- `t` must be greater than 1 (since it was greater than 0 before and will be decremented by 1)
- `index` is increased by `n`
- `result` is the return value of `func_1(array)`
- `results` list now contains the `result` as its last element

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `index` is increased by `n`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(array)`, `results` list now contains the `result` as its last element**
