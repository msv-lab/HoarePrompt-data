Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the beauty of the array \(a\) where the beauty is defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements: \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).
   - The goal is to rearrange the elements of the array to achieve the maximum possible beauty.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - To maximize the beauty, we should place the smallest element at the start and the largest element at the end of the array. This way, the difference between the largest and smallest elements will be maximized, and the differences between other consecutive elements will be minimized.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function sorts the array and calculates the beauty.
   - Sorting the array ensures that the smallest and largest elements are placed at the beginning and end, respectively, which helps in maximizing the beauty.
   - The loop iterates through the sorted array and calculates the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements.

4. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It correctly handles reading multiple test cases and arrays, and prints the results for each test case.

### Verification:
- The logic in `func_1` is correct because sorting the array and calculating the beauty as described will indeed maximize the beauty.
- The logic in `func_2` is also correct because it correctly processes multiple test cases and uses `func_1` to compute the beauty for each array.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

**Correctness: True**
