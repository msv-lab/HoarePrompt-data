Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and the function `range(t)`. The key variable here is `t`, as it determines how many times the loop will iterate.

2. **Determine the Initial State**: We know that `t` is an input integer, and `start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`.

3. **Loop Execution Condition**: For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1. If `t` is 0, the loop will not execute at all.

4. **Adjust the States**: Since the loop head involves `t`, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute. The values of `start` and `end` do not directly affect the loop's execution but can influence the loop body if they were used inside the loop.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` to ensure the loop can execute.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
