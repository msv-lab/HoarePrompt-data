Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not match the problem description. The problem description asks for a Python program that generates `.py` files (`ac.py` and `wa.py`) for each `.html` file found in subfolders whose names fall within a specified range. However, the given program `func_1` is a function that processes input strings and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on certain conditions, which is unrelated to the task described. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.
