Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `cnt1` is the number of times '1' appears in `s`.**

Explanation: The code `s = input()` takes an input string from the user and assigns it to the variable `s`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, and `cnt1`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
