The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. The functionality of the function is to filter folder names that are digits within a specified range where the start and end values are integers such that start is less than or equal to end. However, since the function does not accept these parameters directly, it implies that the filtering logic is applied internally without explicit parameter inputs.

Functionality: **The function filters folder names that are digits within a specified range (start to end) where start and end are integers such that start <= end.**
