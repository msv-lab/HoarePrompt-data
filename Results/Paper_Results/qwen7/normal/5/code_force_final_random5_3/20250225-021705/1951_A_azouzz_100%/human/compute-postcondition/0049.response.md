Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `cnt1` is the number of times '1' appears in `s` (now `cnt1` is calculated as the count of '1' in `s`).**

Explanation: The code `cnt1 = s.count('1')` calculates the number of times the character '1' appears in the string `s` and assigns this count to the variable `cnt1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
