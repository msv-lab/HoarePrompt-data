Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0, but its exact value is not needed since it does not affect the print statement.
- `n` is an input integer, but its value is not relevant to the print statement.
- `s` is an input string, and the count of '1' in `s` is exactly 1.

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('NO')
```

This statement will print the string 'NO' directly.

Output: **NO**
