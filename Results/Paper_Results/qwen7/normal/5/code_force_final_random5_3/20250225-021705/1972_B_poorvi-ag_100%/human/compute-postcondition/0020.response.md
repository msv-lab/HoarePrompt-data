Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i` and `t`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `i < t`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is an input integer (this variable is not involved in the loop condition).
   - `arr` is a string input by the user.
   - `results` list contains either 'yes' or 'no' based on whether the count of 'U' in `arr` is odd or even.
   - `arr` is updated with the new string input by the user.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must still be less than `t`. Therefore, `t` must remain greater than 1.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` needs to be 2.
   - `t` must still be greater than 1.

6. **Consider other variables**:
   - `n`, `arr`, and `results` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the adjusted states for the next iteration of the loop are:

State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2**.
