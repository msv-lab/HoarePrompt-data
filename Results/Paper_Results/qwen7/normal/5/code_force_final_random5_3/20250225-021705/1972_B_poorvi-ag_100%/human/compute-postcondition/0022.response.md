Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a string input by the user.**

The code `arr = input()` assigns the value of the string input by the user to the variable `arr`. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged, and the value of `n` remains an input integer since the code does not modify it.
