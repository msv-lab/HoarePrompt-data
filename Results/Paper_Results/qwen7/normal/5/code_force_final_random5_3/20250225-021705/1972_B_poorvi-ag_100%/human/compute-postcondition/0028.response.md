Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in results:`. The only variable mentioned here is `i`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: According to the problem statement, after all iterations of the loop, `i` is equal to `t-1`, where `t` is the total number of inputs provided. This means that `i` will take the value of `t-1` at the end of the loop.

3. **Determine the Initial State of `results`**: The `results` list contains 'yes' or 'no' for each input based on whether the count of 'U' in `arr` is odd or even. Since we are only concerned with the initial state of the loop, we don't need to know the contents of the `results` list, but we need to ensure that it is a valid list that can be iterated over.

4. **Adjust the States**: We need to ensure that the `results` list is non-empty (since an empty list would not allow the loop to execute) and that `i` is initialized to a value that makes sense for the loop to start.

Given these points, the initial state of the loop should ensure that the `results` list is non-empty and that `i` is set to a value that allows the loop to start.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`results` is a non-empty list, `i` is 0**.

This ensures that the loop can start executing, as `i` will be within the bounds of the `results` list.
