Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variables `i` and `t`.
2. **Understand the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `t`.
3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is an input integer (not directly involved in the loop).
   - `arr` is the string input by the user (not directly involved in the loop).
   - The results list contains either 'yes' or 'no' based on whether the count of 'U' in `arr` is odd or even.

4. **Determine the New Values for the Loop Variables**:
   - Since `i` is currently 0, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `t` must remain the same and must still be greater than 0.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` changes from 0 to 1.
   - `t` remains unchanged and must still be greater than 0.
   - `n` and `arr` are not directly involved in the loop and thus do not change.

Based on this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the string input by the user, and the results list contains either 'yes' or 'no' based on whether the count of 'U' in `arr` is odd or even, respectively.**
