Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.

2. **Counting Facing-Up Coins**: The program counts the number of 'U' (facing-up) coins in the string `arr` using `arr.count('U')`. This is correct.

3. **Determining the Winner**: The program checks if the count of 'U' is odd. If it is odd, it appends 'yes' to the results list; otherwise, it appends 'no'. This logic is based on the observation that if the count of facing-up coins is odd, Alice can force a win by playing optimally. Conversely, if the count is even, Bob can force a win. This logic is correct.

4. **Output**: The program prints the results for each test case. The output format matches the requirements specified in the problem statement.

5. **Loop Iterations**: The loop iterates over the results list and prints each result. The state annotations at the end of the program are not necessary for correctness but do not affect the functionality.

Given the above points, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins.

Correctness: **True**
