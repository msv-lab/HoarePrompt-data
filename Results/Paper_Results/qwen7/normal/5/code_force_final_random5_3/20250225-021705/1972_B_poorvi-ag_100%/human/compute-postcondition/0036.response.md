Output State: `results` is a non-empty list, `i` is the third element in the `results` list, `t` is the length of `results`, `n` is the last integer in `results`, and `arr` is the last string input by the user.

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `i` will be set to the last element in the `results` list, `t` will be equal to the total number of elements in `results` (which is the length of the list), `n` will be the last integer in the `results` list, and `arr` will be the last string input by the user.
