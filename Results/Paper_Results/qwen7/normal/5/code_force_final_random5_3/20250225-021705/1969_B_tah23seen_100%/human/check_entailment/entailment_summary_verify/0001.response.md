Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case one by one. This part of the assessment is accurate.

2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1(s)` is defined to calculate the total accumulated cost `cost`. This part of the assessment is also accurate.

3. **Logic Analysis**:
   - The function initializes `cost` to 0 and `one` to 0.
   - It iterates through each character in the string `s`.
     - If the character is '1', it increments the count of '1's (`one`).
     - If the character is '0' and there have been at least one '1' before it (`one > 0`), it adds `one + 1` to the cost. This logic is based on the observation that each '0' that appears after the first '1' will require a separate cyclic shift operation to move it to its correct position.
   
   However, upon closer inspection, the logic in `func_1` does not fully capture the minimum cost to sort the binary string using cyclic shifts. The current logic assumes that each '0' after the first '1' requires a separate cyclic shift, but this is not always the case. For example, consider the string "101011". According to the current logic, the cost would be `3 + 3 + 3 = 9`, but the optimal solution involves fewer shifts.

   To achieve the minimum cost, we should identify the longest contiguous segment of '0's and '1's and then perform shifts to move these segments to their correct positions. The current logic does not account for this optimization.

4. **Output**: The function returns the calculated cost, which is printed for each test case. While the output is correctly handled, the logic to calculate the cost is flawed.

Given the problem description and the provided example, the logic in `func_1` does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string using cyclic shifts. The approach is not sound and does not align with the requirements of the problem.

Final: **False**
