Output State: **`s` is a binary string with a length between 2 and 200000, `i` is the second character of `s`, `cost` is 1 if `i` is '0' and `one` is 1, otherwise `cost` and `one` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `one += 1` increments the value of `one` by 1. Initially, `one` was 0 if `i` was not '0', and now it is incremented to 1. If `i` was '0', `cost` would already be 1, and it remains unchanged.
