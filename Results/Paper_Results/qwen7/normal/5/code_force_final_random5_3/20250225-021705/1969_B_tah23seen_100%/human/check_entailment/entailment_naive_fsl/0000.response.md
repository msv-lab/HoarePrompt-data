Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost to make the string sorted in non-descending order. Specifically, the program does not account for the fact that the minimum cost can be achieved by performing multiple cyclic shifts on different substrings, not just counting the number of zeros following the first '1'.

For example, consider the input string `101011`. The correct approach would involve identifying the positions of '1's and calculating the cost based on the distances between them. However, the current implementation simply counts the number of zeros after the first '1', which is not sufficient to find the minimum cost.

A correct solution would involve identifying the positions of '1's and calculating the cost based on the distances between them, considering all possible cyclic shifts.
