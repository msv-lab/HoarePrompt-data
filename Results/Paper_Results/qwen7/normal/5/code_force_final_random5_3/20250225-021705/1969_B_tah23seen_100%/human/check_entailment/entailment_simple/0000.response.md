Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum total cost required to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the correctness:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually. This ensures that each string is processed independently, adhering to the problem constraints.

2. **Function Implementation**:
   - The function `func_1` initializes `cost` and `one` to zero.
   - It iterates through each character in the string `s`.
   - When a '1' is encountered, it increments the counter `one`.
   - When a '0' is encountered and there has been at least one '1' (`one > 0`), it adds `one + 1` to the cost. This is because moving the '0' to the beginning of the sequence of '1's requires a cost equal to the length of the sequence of '1's plus one (to account for the '0' itself).
   - After processing all characters, it returns the accumulated cost.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the string consists entirely of '1's, no operations are needed, and the cost is 0.
   - If the string consists entirely of '0's, no operations are needed, and the cost is 0.
   - If the string alternates between '1's and '0's, the cost calculation correctly accounts for each '0' requiring a shift past all preceding '1's.

4. **Output**: The program prints the calculated cost for each test case, which matches the expected output format.

Given the logic and the steps involved, the program correctly computes the minimum cost to sort the binary string in non-descending order using the specified operations.

Correctness: **True**
