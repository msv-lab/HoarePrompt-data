Output State: **`s` is a binary string with a length between 2 and 200000, `i` is the second character of `s`, `cost` is `one + 2`, `one` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `cost += one + 1` increments the value of `cost` by `one + 1`. Since `one` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether the second character of `s` is '0' or '1', `cost` becomes `one + 2`. The other variables (`s`, `i`, `one`) remain unchanged.
