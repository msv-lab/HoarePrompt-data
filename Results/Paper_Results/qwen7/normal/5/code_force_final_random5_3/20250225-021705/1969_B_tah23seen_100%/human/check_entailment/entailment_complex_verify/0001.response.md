### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case one by one. This part of the program is correct and matches the problem description.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func_1(s)` is defined to calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string `s` in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. This is a good starting point.

3. **Logic Analysis**:
   - The function initializes `cost` to 0 and `one` to 0.
   - It iterates through each character in the string `s`.
     - If the character is '1', it increments the count of '1's (`one`).
     - If the character is '0' and there have been at least one '1' before it (`one > 0`), it adds `one + 1` to the cost. This logic is based on the observation that each '0' that appears after the first '1' will require a separate cyclic shift operation to move it to its correct position.

   Let's analyze the logic more closely:
   - The variable `one` counts the number of '1's encountered so far.
   - When a '0' is encountered, and `one` is greater than 0, it means we have seen at least one '1' before this '0'. To move this '0' to its correct position, we need to perform a cyclic shift that includes all characters from the start of the '1's to the current position of the '0'. The length of this substring is `one + 1`.

   For example, consider the string "101011":
   - The first '0' after two '1's requires a shift of length `2 + 1 = 3`.
   - The second '0' after three '1's requires a shift of length `3 + 1 = 4`.
   - The third '0' after four '1's requires a shift of length `4 + 1 = 5`.

   Summing these up gives the total cost: `3 + 4 + 5 = 12`.

   However, the provided example in the annotated code states that the cost for "101011" is 9, which is incorrect based on the logic described. The correct cost should be 12, not 9.

4. **Output**:
   - The function returns the calculated cost, which is printed for each test case.

Given the analysis, the logic in `func_1` does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string using cyclic shifts. The provided example "101011" demonstrates a discrepancy where the cost is incorrectly calculated as 9 instead of 12.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is inaccurate because the function `func_1` does not correctly compute the minimum cost to sort the binary string using cyclic shifts.

**Final: False**
