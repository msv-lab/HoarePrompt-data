Reasoning:

1. The problem requires finding the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order using cyclic shifts.
2. A cyclic shift of a substring `s[l:r]` has a cost of `r - l + 1`.
3. The provided solution uses a different approach to solve the problem. It counts the cost based on the positions of '1's and '0's in the string. Specifically:
   - It iterates through the string and maintains a count of consecutive '0's (`one`).
   - Whenever a '0' is encountered after a sequence of '1's, it adds `one + 1` to the cost.
   - The count of '1's is also maintained.
4. The logic behind this approach is that each '0' that appears after a sequence of '1's can be moved to its correct position by performing a cyclic shift starting from the end of the sequence of '1's. The cost of such a shift is `one + 1`.
5. The provided code correctly implements this logic:
   - It initializes `cost` to 0.
   - It iterates through the string, updating `one` and `cost` based on the current character.
   - After the loop, it returns the accumulated `cost`.

Given the provided example and the explanation, the function correctly calculates the minimum total cost to sort the binary string.

Correctness: **True**
