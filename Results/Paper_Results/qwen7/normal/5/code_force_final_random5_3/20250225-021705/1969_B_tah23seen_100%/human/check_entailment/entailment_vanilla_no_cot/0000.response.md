Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. The logic in `func_1` is flawed because it incorrectly calculates the cost based on the positions of '0's and '1's without considering the actual cyclic shift operations needed.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to identify the breakpoints where '0's and '1's transition and then calculate the cost based on these breakpoints. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    cost = 0
    last_one = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == '1':
            last_one = i
        elif s[i] == '0' and last_one != -1:
            # Calculate the cost for the segment between last_one and current position
            cost += i - last_one + 1
            last_one = -1  # Reset last_one after processing this segment
    return cost

# The rest of the program remains the same
t = int(input())
while t:
    s = input()
    print(func_1(s))
    t = t - 1
```

This corrected function properly identifies segments that need to be shifted and calculates the cost accordingly.
