Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in s`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `s`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop iterates over each character in the string `s`. At the end of each iteration, `i` takes the value of the current character being processed.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `s` is a binary string with a length between 2 and 200000.
   - `i` is the first character of `s`.
   - `cost` is 1 if `i` is '0', and `one` is 0 otherwise. If `i` was '1', then `cost` and `one` remained unchanged.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is the first character of `s` at the start of the next iteration, it will now be the second character of `s`.
   - `s` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `cost` and `one` will be updated based on the new value of `i` (the second character of `s`).

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `i` is now the second character of `s`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`s` is a binary string with a length between 2 and 200000, `i` is the second character of `s`, `cost` is 1 if `i` is '0' and `one` is 0, otherwise `cost` and `one` remain unchanged.**
