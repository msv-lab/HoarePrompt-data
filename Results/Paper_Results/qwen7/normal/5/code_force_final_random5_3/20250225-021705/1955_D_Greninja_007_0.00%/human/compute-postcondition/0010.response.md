Postcondition: `good_subarrays` is 1, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `k`, `m`, and `n` are integers such that 1 <= k <= m <= n, and 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `b_freq` is a Counter object that counts the frequency of each element in list `b`; `window_freq` is a Counter object that counts the frequency of elements in the sublist of `a` from index 0 to index m-1; `matches` is the updated sum of the minimum frequencies of elements present in both `window_freq` and `b_freq`, where `matches` is decreased by the minimum frequency of `a[i]` in both `window_freq` and `b_freq` if `a[i]` is in `b_freq`, and `i` is 0.
