Output State: **`good_subarrays` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `k`, `m`, and `n` are integers such that 1 <= k <= m <= n, and 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `b_freq` is a Counter object that counts the frequency of each element in list `b`; `window_freq` is a Counter object that counts the frequency of elements in the sublist of `a` from index 0 to index m-1.**

Explanation: The code creates a new Counter object named `window_freq` which counts the frequency of elements in the sublist of `a` from index 0 to index `m-1`. The values of `good_subarrays`, `a`, `b`, `k`, `n`, `b_freq`, and the relationship between `m`, `k`, and `n` remain unchanged.
