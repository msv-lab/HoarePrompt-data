Reasoning:
1. The problem requires calculating the sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to \( n \).
2. The provided code has a significant issue: it attempts to call `func_1(i)` for every number \( i \) in the range up to \( N \), but \( N \) is not necessarily equal to \( n \). This means the code will incorrectly compute the sum of digit sums for the range from 1 to \( N-1 \) instead of just for the range from 1 to \( n \).
3. Additionally, the code reads \( N \) test cases but only processes one test case, which is incorrect.
4. The function `func_1` correctly computes the sum of the digits of a given number.

Given these points, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
