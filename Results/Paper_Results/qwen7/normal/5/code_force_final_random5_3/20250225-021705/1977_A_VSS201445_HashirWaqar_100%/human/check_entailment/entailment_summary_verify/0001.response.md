### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identified the key conditions needed to determine if Nikita can achieve exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. Let's break down the reasoning again to ensure the program meets all requirements:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n` and `m`.

2. **Conditions for Validity**:
   - The program checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`.
   - It also checks if the difference `(n - m)` is even.

3. **Output**:
   - If both conditions are satisfied, it prints "YES".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Key Insights:

- **Net Effect**:
  - Each move either adds or removes one cube, so the net effect after `n` moves must be such that the total number of cubes is `m`.
  - This means that the difference between the number of additions and removals must be `m`.
  - Since each move changes the count by 1, the total number of moves `n` must be at least `m` to achieve `m` cubes.
  - Additionally, the difference `(n - m)` must be even because the parity of the difference must match the parity of the number of moves.

### Verification:

- **Case 1**: `n = 3`, `m = 3`
  - `n >= m` is true.
  - `(n - m) = 0`, which is even.
  - Output: "YES" (Correct).

- **Case 2**: `n = 2`, `m = 4`
  - `n >= m` is false.
  - Output: "NO" (Correct).

- **Case 3**: `n = 5`, `m = 3`
  - `n >= m` is true.
  - `(n - m) = 2`, which is even.
  - Output: "YES" (Correct).

The program correctly implements the logic to check if `m` cubes can be achieved after `n` moves. The conditions `n >= m` and `(n - m) % 2 == 0` are necessary and sufficient to determine the validity of the outcome.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment was accurate. The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

**Final: True**
