The function reads multiple pairs of positive integers \( n \) and \( m \) (where \( 1 \leq n, m \leq 100 \)) from standard input, checks if \( n \geq m \) and if \( (n - m) \) is even, and prints 'YES' if both conditions are met for any pair; otherwise, it prints 'NO' for that pair. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each pair of integers.
