Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the `range(int(input()))` part of the loop. This means that the loop will run for as many times as the integer input provided by the user.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the postcondition given is that `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is the integer entered by the user, and `m` is the second integer entered by the user. Additionally, if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and the difference `(n - m)` is even, then no change is made to `t`. Otherwise, no change is made to `t`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as the user provides an integer input. Therefore, the only variables that can be adjusted are those that are part of the loop head, which in this case is the integer input itself.

4. **Adjust the state**: Since the loop continues based on the user's input, the state needs to reflect that the user will provide another integer input. The variables `t`, `n`, and `m` will remain unchanged unless the loop condition changes (which it doesn't in this case).

5. **Formulate the new state**: The new state should reflect that the user will provide another integer input, and the variables `t`, `n`, and `m` will remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Given this analysis, the new state can be formulated as follows:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is the integer entered by the user, `m` is the second integer entered by the user.**

Therefore, the final answer is:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is the integer entered by the user, `m` is the second integer entered by the user.**
