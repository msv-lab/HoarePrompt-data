Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and each test case consists of two positive integers n and m such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100. The value of n and m are determined by the inputs provided during the execution of the loop. After all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable t remains unchanged from its initial value. If the condition `n >= m` and `(n - m) % 2 == 0` is met for any test case, 'YES' is printed; otherwise, 'NO' is printed for that test case.**

This means that regardless of how many times the loop runs, the value of `t` does not change. The loop simply processes each input pair `(n, m)` and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the given conditions, but it does not modify the value of `t`.
