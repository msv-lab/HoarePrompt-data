Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is the integer entered by the user, `m` is the second integer entered by the user. If `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and the difference `(n - m)` is even, the program does not change the values of `t`, `n`, and `m`. Otherwise, the values of `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.
