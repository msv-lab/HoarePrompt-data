Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided Python function correctly determines whether it's possible for Nikita to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. Here's why:

1. **Condition Check**: The condition `if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:` ensures that:
   - `n >= m`: This ensures that the number of moves is at least as many as the target number of cubes.
   - `(n - m) % 2 == 0`: This ensures that the difference between the number of moves and the target number of cubes is even. This is necessary because each move either adds or removes one cube, meaning the parity (evenness or oddness) of the difference must match the parity of the number of removals needed to reach the target.

2. **Output**: If both conditions are met, the function prints 'YES', indicating it's possible to achieve the target. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

Given these checks, the function accurately determines the possibility of achieving the desired number of cubes after the specified number of moves. Therefore, the correctness of the provided program is True.
