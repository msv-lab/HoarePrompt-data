Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is the first integer entered by the user, `m` is the second integer entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the user input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. The values of `n` and `m` depend on the user's input, which must be two integers within the specified range.
