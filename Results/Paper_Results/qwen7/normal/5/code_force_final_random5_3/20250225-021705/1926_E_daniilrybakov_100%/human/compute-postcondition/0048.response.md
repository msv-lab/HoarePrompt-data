Output State: **`n` is now `n // 2`; `x` is equal to `(n + 1) // 2`.**

Explanation: The value of `n` is updated to `n // 2`, which means `n` is now half of its original value (integer division). The value of `x` remains unchanged because the code does not modify `x`. Initially, `x` was defined as `(n + 1) // 2`, so after updating `n`, `x` is still equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, where `n` is now `n // 2`.
