Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers \( n \) and \( k \). For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific value based on the relationship between \( n \) and \( k \). Specifically, it finds the smallest integer \( m \) such that the sum of certain values \( x \) up to \( m \) meets or exceeds \( k \), and then computes and outputs a derived value involving \( k \) and \( m \). The function handles up to 50,000 test cases, where \( 1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^9 \) and \( 1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4 \).**
