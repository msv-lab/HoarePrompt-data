Output State: **`t` is 5, `m` is 32, `x` is 3, `n` is an input integer divided by 2, `k` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input separated by a space, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. The initial values of `t`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged. `n` is updated to the first input integer divided by 2, and `k` is updated to the second input integer.
