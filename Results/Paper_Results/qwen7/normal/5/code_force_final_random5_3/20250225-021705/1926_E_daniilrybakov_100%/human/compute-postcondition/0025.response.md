Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 5â‹…10^4, `n` is now `n // 2`, `k` is an input integer, `s` is `s + (n + 1) // 2 + (n + 1) // 2`, `m` is 4, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2 + (n + 1) // 2`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change any variable values but indicates that the program will exit the innermost loop or conditional block. All other variables retain their previous values.
