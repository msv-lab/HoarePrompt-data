Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input split by space, `k` is an integer equal to the second input split by space**.

This means that the code takes two integers as input separated by a space, splits them, and assigns the first integer to `n` and the second integer to `k`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
