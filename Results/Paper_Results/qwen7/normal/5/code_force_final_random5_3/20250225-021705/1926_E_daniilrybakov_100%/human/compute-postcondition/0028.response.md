Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 5â‹…10^4, `n` is now `n // 2`, `k` is an input integer, `s` is `s + (n + 1) // 2 + (n + 1) // 2 + x`, `m` is 4, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2 + (n + 1) // 2`**.

Explanation: The code `s += x` increments the value of `s` by `x`. From the initial state, `x` is defined as `(n + 1) // 2 + (n + 1) // 2`, which simplifies to `2 * ((n + 1) // 2)`. Therefore, `s` is updated to `s + 2 * ((n + 1) // 2)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
