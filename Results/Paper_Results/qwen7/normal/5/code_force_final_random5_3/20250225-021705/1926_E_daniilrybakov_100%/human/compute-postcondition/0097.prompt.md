Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer, and it is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    s = 0
    m = 1
    while n:
        x = (n + 1) // 2
        n //= 2
        if s < k and k <= s + x:
            break
        s += x
        m *= 2
    print((2 * (k - s) - 1) * m)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 5⋅10^4, `n` will eventually become 0, `k` is an input integer, `s` is the sum of all `x` values calculated during each iteration of the loop, `m` will be `2^i` where `i` is the number of iterations the loop executed, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2` at the last iteration.

Explanation: The loop continues as long as `n` is non-zero. In each iteration, `n` is halved (`n //= 2`), `x` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`, `s` is incremented by `x`, and `m` is doubled (`m *= 2`). This process repeats until `n` becomes 0. At this point, `s` will be the sum of all `x` values from each iteration, `m` will be `2^i` where `i` is the number of iterations, and `n` will be 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `n` is now `n // 8`, `k` is an integer equal to the second input split by space, `s` is the sum of `s` after 3 iterations plus the value of `x` for the fourth iteration, `m` is 16, and `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`.

To explain this in natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `n` will have been halved four times, making it `n // 8`. The variable `k` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop. The variable `s` accumulates the values of `x` from each iteration until the loop condition is met, which happens after 4 iterations in this case. Therefore, `s` will be the sum of the values of `x` from the first three iterations plus the value of `x` from the fourth iteration. The variable `m` doubles with each iteration, so after 4 iterations, it will be `2^4 = 16`. The value of `x` for the fourth iteration is `(n + 1) // 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `t` is 5, `m` is 60, `x` is 1, `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `s` is 13.

Explanation: After the loop executes, `n` will eventually become 0 because it is halved each iteration until it reaches 0. At this point, the loop condition `n` being non-zero will no longer be satisfied, and the loop will terminate. By the third iteration, `s` has accumulated a value of 8 from the loop, and in the fourth iteration, `x` becomes 1, making `s` equal to 13. The value of `m` keeps doubling with each iteration, starting from 2, so after three iterations, `m` is \(2 \times 4 = 8\), and after four iterations, `m` is \(8 \times 2 = 16\). However, based on the provided output states, it seems there might be a pattern where `m` is updated every two iterations, leading to `m` being 60 after the loop completes its iterations.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
