The only variable in the loop head is `n`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is non-zero (i.e., `n != 0`), the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `n` is an input integer divided by 2. For the loop to execute the first time, `n` must be non-zero.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `n` is non-zero.

State: **`t` is 5, `m` is 1, `x` is 3, `n` is an input integer divided by 2 and `n` must be non-zero, `k` is an input integer, `s` is 0**
