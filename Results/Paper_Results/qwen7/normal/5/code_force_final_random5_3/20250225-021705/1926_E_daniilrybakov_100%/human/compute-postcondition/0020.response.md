Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 5â‹…10^4, `n` is now `n // 2`, `k` is an input integer, `s` is `s + (n + 1) // 2 + (n + 1) // 2`, `m` is 2, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`, and we increment `s` by `x`.**

Explanation: The code `s += x` increments the value of `s` by `x`. Given that `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`, the updated value of `s` becomes `s + (n + 1) // 2 + (n + 1) // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
