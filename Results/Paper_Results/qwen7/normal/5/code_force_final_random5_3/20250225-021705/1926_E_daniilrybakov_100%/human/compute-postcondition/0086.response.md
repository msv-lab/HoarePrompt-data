The only variable in the loop head is `n`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop condition is `n`, and at the end of the previous iteration, `n` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be non-zero.

State: **`t` is 5, `m` is 10, `x` is 2, `n` must be non-zero, `k` is an input integer, `s` is 5**
