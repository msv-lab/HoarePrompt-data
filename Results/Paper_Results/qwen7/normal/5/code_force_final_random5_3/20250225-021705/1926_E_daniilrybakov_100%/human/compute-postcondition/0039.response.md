Output State: **`n` is now `n // 2`, `k` is an integer equal to the second input split by space, `s` is 0, `m` is 1, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`.**

Explanation: The code `n //= 2` divides `n` by 2 and assigns the result back to `n`. Since `n` was initially a non-zero integer equal to the first input split by space, after executing the code, `n` becomes `n // 2`. The values of `k`, `s`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.
