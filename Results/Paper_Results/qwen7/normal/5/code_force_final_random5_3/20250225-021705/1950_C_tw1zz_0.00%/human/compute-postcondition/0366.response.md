Postcondition: `h1` is either '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', '12', or '15', `m1` is equal to the string `m` from the user's input split by `:`, and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '15', then `h1` is '03'. If `h` is '16', then `h1` is '04'. If `h` is '17' to '23' or '00', then `h1` is updated to '05' to '12' accordingly.
