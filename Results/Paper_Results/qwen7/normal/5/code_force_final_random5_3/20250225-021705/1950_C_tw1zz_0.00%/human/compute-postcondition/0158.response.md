Postcondition: `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `h` is either '18', '19', '20', '21', '00', or '22', `m` is the minute part of the time input as a string, `h1` is '06' if `h` is '18', '07' if `h` is '19', '08' if `h` is '20', '09' if `h` is '21', '12' if `h` is '00', and '11' if `h` is '22', `m1` is equal to `m`, and `time` is 'PM'.
