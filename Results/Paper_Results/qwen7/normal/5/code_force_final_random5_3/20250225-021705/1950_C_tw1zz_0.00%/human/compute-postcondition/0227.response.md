Output State: **`s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `h1` is "03", `m1` is equal to the new `m`, `time` is 'PM'**.

Explanation: The code simply assigns the string `'PM'` to the variable `time`. The values of `s`, `t`, `h1`, `m1` remain unchanged from their initial states.
