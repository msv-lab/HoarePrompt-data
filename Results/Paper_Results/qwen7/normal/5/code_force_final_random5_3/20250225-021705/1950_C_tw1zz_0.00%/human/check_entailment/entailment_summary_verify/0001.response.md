Reasoning:

1. The program aims to convert a time from 24-hour format to 12-hour format.
2. The current implementation uses a series of `if-elif` statements to manually convert each possible hour from 00 to 23 to its 12-hour equivalent. This approach is indeed inefficient and error-prone, especially for large numbers like 23 and 00.
3. However, the program does correctly handle the special cases for 12, 00, and the AM/PM indicators. It correctly converts 12:00 to 12:00 PM and 00:00 to 12:00 AM.
4. Despite the inefficiency, the program does correctly handle all the test cases provided in the example, including edge cases like 00:00 and 12:00. This means that the logic, although not optimal, is correct for the given problem constraints.
5. The function summary accurately describes the behavior of the function, which is to process multiple time inputs in the format "hh:mm" and convert them to 12-hour format with AM/PM notation, printing the results.

Given that the program produces the correct output for the provided test cases, and the function summary accurately reflects the behavior of the function, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
