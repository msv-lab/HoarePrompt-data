Output State: **`s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `h1` is an empty string, `m1` is equal to the new `m`, and `time` is 'AM' if `h` is not '12' and 'PM' if `h` is '12'.**

Explanation: The code assigns an empty string to `h1` and keeps `m1` as the new `m`. The values of `s`, `t`, `h`, and `time` remain unchanged from their initial states.
