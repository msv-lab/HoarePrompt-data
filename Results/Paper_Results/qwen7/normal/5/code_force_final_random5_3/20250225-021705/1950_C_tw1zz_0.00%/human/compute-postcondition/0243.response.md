Output State: **`s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `h1` is '11', `m1` is equal to the new `m`, `time` is 'PM'**.

Explanation: The code simply assigns the string `'PM'` to the variable `time`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `s` remains a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `t` remains an integer between 1 and 1440, `h1` remains '11', and `m1` remains equal to the new `m`. The only change is that `time` is now set to `'PM'`.
