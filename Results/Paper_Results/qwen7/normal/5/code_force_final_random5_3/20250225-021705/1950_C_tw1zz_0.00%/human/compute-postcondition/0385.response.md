Postcondition: `h1` is a string representing the hour in 12-hour format, `m1` is equal to the string `m` from the user's input split by `:`, and `time` is 'AM'. Specifically, if `h` is '05', then `h1` is '05' and `time` is 'AM'. Otherwise, `h1` is set to '06', '07', '08', '09', '01', '02', '03', '04', '07', '08', '10', '11', '12', '15', or '16' depending on the value of `h`. If `h` is '10' or '11', `time` remains 'AM'. If `h` is '12', `time` becomes 'PM'. If `h` is '13', `h1` is set to '01'. If `h` is '14', `h1` remains '02'. If `h` is '15', `h1` is set to '03'. If `h` is '16', `h1` is set to '04'. If `h` is '17' to '23' or '00', `h1` is updated to '05' to '12' accordingly.
