Output State: **`h1` is '10', `m1` is equal to the string `m` from the user's input split by `:`, `time` is an empty string**

Explanation: The code assigns the string `'10'` to the variable `h1`. The values of `m1` and `time` remain unchanged from their initial states. `m1` is still equal to the string `m` from the user's input split by `:`, and `time` remains an empty string.
