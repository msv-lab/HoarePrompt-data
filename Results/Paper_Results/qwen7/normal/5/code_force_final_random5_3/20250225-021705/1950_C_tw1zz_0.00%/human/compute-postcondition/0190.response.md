Postcondition: **`s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `h` is either '02', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', '12', '13', '14', '15', '16', '17', '18', '19', '20', '21', '22', or '00', `m` is the minute part of the time input as a string, `h1` is '02' if `h` is '02', '03' if `h` is '03', '04' if `h` is '04', '05' if `h` is '05', '06' if `h` is '06', '07' if `h` is '07', '08' if `h` is '08', '09' if `h` is '09', '10' if `h` is '10', '11' if `h` is '11', '01' if `h` is '13', '02' if `h` is '14', '03' if `h` is '15', '04' if `h` is '16', '05' if `h` is '17', '06' if `h` is '18', '07' if `h` is '19', '08' if `h` is '20', '09' if `h` is '21', '12' if `h` is '00', and '11' if `h` is '22', `m1` is equal to `m`, and `time` is 'AM' if `h` is not '12' and 'PM' if `h` is '12'.**
