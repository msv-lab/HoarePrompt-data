Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by counting the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks to form a non-degenerate triangle. However, there are several issues with the logic and implementation:

1. **Incorrect Calculation for Triangle Formation**: The program does not correctly check whether three sticks can form a non-degenerate triangle. According to the triangle inequality theorem, for three lengths \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) to form a triangle, the following must hold true: \(a + b > c\), \(a + c > b\), and \(b + c > a\). The current implementation does not perform these checks.

2. **Counting Triplets**: The program counts triplets based on the frequency of each exponent value but does not ensure that the chosen sticks can actually form a triangle. It assumes that any combination of three sticks will form a triangle, which is incorrect.

3. **Output Format**: The program outputs the results in a format that matches the expected output, but the underlying logic to determine the correct number of valid triangles is flawed.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
