Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5) representing the number of sticks, followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n) representing the exponents used to determine the lengths of the sticks as 2^{a_i}. Additionally, the sum of all n values across all tuples does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5; `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(test_cases):
    n = int(input())
    num_list = list(map(int, input().split()))
    num_of_lens = {}
    for x in num_list:
        if x in num_of_lens:
            num_of_lens[x] += 1
        else:
            num_of_lens[x] = 1
    res = 0
    total_count = 0
    for cnt in num_of_lens.values():
        if cnt >= 3:
            res += cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6
        if cnt >= 2:
            res += cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count
        total_count += cnt
    results.append(res)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: All values of `cnt` from `num_of_lens.values()` have been iterated through; `total_count` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens`; `res` is the cumulative sum based on the conditions specified in the loop; `results` is a list containing the final value of `res` after each iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `results` list now contains the value of `res`, `res` contains the sum of all contributions calculated according to the conditions in the loop, `total_count` is the sum of all counts from `num_of_lens` values, and `cnt` has been incremented through all values in `num_of_lens`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `results` contains the value of `res`, `total_count` is the sum of all counts from the `num_of_lens` dictionary values, and `res` is the sum of all counts from the `num_of_lens` dictionary values adjusted according to the given conditions.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
