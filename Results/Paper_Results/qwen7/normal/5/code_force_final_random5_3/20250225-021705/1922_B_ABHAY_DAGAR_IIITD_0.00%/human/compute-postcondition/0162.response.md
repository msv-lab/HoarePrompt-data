Output State: **`results` contains the value of `res`, `total_count` is the sum of all counts from the `num_of_lens` dictionary values, and `res` is the sum of all counts from the `num_of_lens` dictionary values adjusted according to the given conditions.**

Explanation: The line `results.append(res)` appends the current value of `res` to the list `results`. The values of `total_count` and the adjusted value of `res` remain unchanged. Therefore, `total_count` and the adjusted value of `res` are still valid in the output state, while `results` now includes the current value of `res`.
