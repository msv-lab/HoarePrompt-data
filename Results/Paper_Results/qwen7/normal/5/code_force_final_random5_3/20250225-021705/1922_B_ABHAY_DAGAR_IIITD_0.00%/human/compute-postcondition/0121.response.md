Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `x` and `num_list`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element `x` in `num_list`.

3. **Determine the state changes during each iteration**:
   - `x` takes the next value from `num_list`.
   - If `x` is already in `num_of_lens`, its count is incremented by 1.
   - Otherwise, a new entry with key `x` and value 1 is added to `num_of_lens`.

4. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `results` list now contains the value of `res`.
   - `res` contains the sum of all contributions calculated according to the conditions in the loop.
   - `total_count` is the sum of all counts from `num_of_lens` values.
   - `cnt` has been incremented through all values in `num_of_lens`.
   - `num_list` is a non-empty list of integers obtained from input.
   - `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one entry where the key is `x` and the value is 1, and `x` is an element of `num_list`.

5. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `x` is taken from `num_list`, the next value of `x` will be the next element in `num_list`.
   - `num_of_lens` will be updated based on the current value of `x`.

Given these points, the state adjustments needed for the next iteration are:

- `num_list` will have one less element because `x` has been processed.
- `num_of_lens` will be updated based on the current value of `x`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `results` list now contains the value of `res`, `res` contains the sum of all contributions calculated according to the conditions in the loop, `total_count` is the sum of all counts from `num_of_lens` values, `cnt` has been incremented through all values in `num_of_lens`, `num_list` is a non-empty list of integers obtained from input (with one less element), `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one entry where the key is `x` and the value is 1, and `x` is an element of `num_list` (the next element in the list).**

However, since we are only adjusting the states of objects in the loop head, the relevant adjustments are:

**State: `x` is the next element in `num_list`, `num_list` is a non-empty list of integers obtained from input (with one less element), `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one entry where the key is `x` and the value is 1, and `x` is an element of `num_list` (the next element in the list).**

So, the final state is:

**State: `x` is the next element in `num_list`, `num_list` is a non-empty list of integers obtained from input (with one less element), `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one entry where the key is `x` and the value is 1, and `x` is an element of `num_list` (the next element in the list).**
