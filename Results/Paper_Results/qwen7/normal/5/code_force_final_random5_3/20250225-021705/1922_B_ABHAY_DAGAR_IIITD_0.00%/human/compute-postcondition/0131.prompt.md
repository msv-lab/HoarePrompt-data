Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `results` list now contains the value of `res`, `res` contains the sum of all contributions calculated according to the conditions in the loop, `total_count` is the sum of all counts from `num_of_lens` values, `cnt` has been incremented through all values in `num_of_lens`, `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from input, and `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary.
Code of the loop:
for x in num_list:
    if x in num_of_lens:
        num_of_lens[x] += 1
    else:
        num_of_lens[x] = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `results` list now contains the value of `res`, `res` contains the sum of all contributions calculated according to the conditions in the loop, `total_count` is the sum of all counts from `num_of_lens` values, `cnt` has been incremented through all values in `num_of_lens`, `num_list` is a non-empty list of integers obtained from input, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one entry where the key is `x` and the value is 1, and `x` is an element of `num_list`. If `x` is already in `num_of_lens`, its count is incremented by 1; otherwise, a new entry with key `x` and value 1 is added to `num_of_lens`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `results` list now contains the value of `res`, `res` contains the sum of all contributions calculated according to the conditions in the loop, `total_count` is the sum of all counts from `num_of_lens` values, `cnt` has been incremented through all values in `num_of_lens`, `x` is the next element from `num_list`, `num_list` is the list without the last processed element, and `num_of_lens[x]` is either incremented by 1 if `x` was already present or set to 1 if `x` was not present, and `x` is an element of `num_list`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `results` list now contains the value of `res`, which is the sum of all contributions calculated according to the conditions in the loop, `total_count` is the sum of all counts from `num_of_lens` values, `cnt` has been incremented through all values in `num_of_lens`, `x` is the next element from `num_list`, `num_list` is the list without the last processed element. If `x` is in `num_of_lens`, then `num_of_lens[x]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `num_of_lens[x]` is set to 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
