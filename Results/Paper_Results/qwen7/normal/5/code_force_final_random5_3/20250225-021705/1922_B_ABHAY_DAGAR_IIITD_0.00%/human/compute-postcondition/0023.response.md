Output State: **`total_count` is 0, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each unique element from `num_list` is a key, and the corresponding value for each key is the count of how many times that element appeared in `num_list`, `test_cases` remains a list of tuples, `results` remains an empty list, `num_list` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, and `_` must be greater than 0; res is 0.**

Explanation: The line `total_count = 0` initializes `total_count` to 0. This does not affect any other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `num_of_lens`, `test_cases`, `results`, `num_list`, `n`, `_`, and `res` remain unchanged.
