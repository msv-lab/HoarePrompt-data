Output State: The `results` list now contains the value of `res`, which is the sum of all contributions calculated according to the conditions in the loop. `res` is the total sum of all counts from the `num_of_lens` dictionary values. `total_count` is the sum of all counts from `num_of_lens` values, `cnt` has been incremented through all values in `num_of_lens`, `num_list` is an empty list since all elements have been processed, and `num_of_lens` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each unique element from the original `num_list`.

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the `results` list will contain the final value of `res`, which is the sum of all counts of each unique element in `num_list`. The `total_count` variable will also hold the same value as `res`. The `num_of_lens` dictionary will contain each unique element from `num_list` as keys, with their respective counts as values. The `num_list` will be empty because all elements have been processed, and `cnt` will have been incremented to cover all elements in `num_of_lens`.
