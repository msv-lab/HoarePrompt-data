Output State: **`total_count' is equal to the original value of `total_count` plus `cnt', res' remains unchanged**.

Explanation: The code `total_count += cnt` increments the value of `total_count` by the value of `cnt`. Since the initial state does not specify the exact values of `total_count` and `cnt`, we only know that `total_count` is updated by adding `cnt` to its current value. The value of `res` remains unchanged as per the precondition.
