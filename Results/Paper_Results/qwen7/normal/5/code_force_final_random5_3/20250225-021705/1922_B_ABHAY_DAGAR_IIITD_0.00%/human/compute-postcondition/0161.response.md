Output State: **All elements in `num_of_lens` have been processed, `total_count` is the sum of all counts from the `num_of_lens` dictionary values, and `res` is the sum of all counts from the `num_of_lens` dictionary values adjusted according to the given conditions.**

In this final state, after all iterations of the loop have completed:
- The variable `cnt` will have iterated through all values in the `num_of_lens` dictionary.
- `total_count` will be the sum of all counts from the `num_of_lens` dictionary values.
- `res` will be updated based on the formulae provided in the loop body for each count in `num_of_lens`. Specifically, for each `cnt`:
  - If `cnt >= 3`, `res` is incremented by `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`.
  - If `cnt >= 2`, `res` is incremented by `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`.
- The loop ensures that all elements in `num_of_lens` are processed, and no further changes occur outside the loop.
