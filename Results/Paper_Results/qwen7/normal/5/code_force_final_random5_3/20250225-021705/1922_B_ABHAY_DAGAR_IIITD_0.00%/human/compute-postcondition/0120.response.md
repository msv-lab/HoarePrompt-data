Postcondition: `results` list now contains the value of `res`, `res` contains the sum of all contributions calculated according to the conditions in the loop, `total_count` is the sum of all counts from `num_of_lens` values, `cnt` has been incremented through all values in `num_of_lens`, `num_list` is a non-empty list of integers obtained from input, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one entry where the key is `x` and the value is 1, and `x` is an element of `num_list`. If `x` is already in `num_of_lens`, its count is incremented by 1; otherwise, a new entry with key `x` and value 1 is added to `num_of_lens`.
