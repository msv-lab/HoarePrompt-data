Postcondition: `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where the key `x` (the second element of `num_list`) is either incremented by 1 or set to 1, depending on whether `x` is already a key in `num_of_lens`. `test_cases` remains a list of tuples, `results` remains an empty list, `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers with the first element removed, `n` is an input integer, `_` must be greater than 0, and `x` is the next element in `num_list`.
