Output State: **`res` is increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`, `total_count` is increased by the next value of `cnt`.**

Explanation: The variable `res` is updated by adding the value of `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` to its current value. Additionally, `total_count` is increased by the next value of `cnt`. The initial values of `cnt` and `total_count` are not specified beyond their roles in the calculation, so they remain as described in the initial state.
