Output State: **`test_cases` is decremented by 1 and is now greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `num_list` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces; `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty dictionary named `num_of_lens`. This does not affect the values of `test_cases`, `n`, or `num_list`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
