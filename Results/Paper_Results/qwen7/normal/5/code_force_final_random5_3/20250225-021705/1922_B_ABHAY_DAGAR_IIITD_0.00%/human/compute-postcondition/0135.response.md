Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for cnt in num_of_lens.values()`. The objects involved here are `cnt` and `num_of_lens`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will iterate over the values of `num_of_lens`. For the loop to execute, `num_of_lens` must contain at least one value.

3. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `total_count` is 0.
   - `results` list contains the value of `res`, which is the sum of all counts from the `num_of_lens` dictionary values.
   - `num_of_lens` dictionary contains each unique element from the `num_list` as keys, with their respective counts as values.
   - `num_list` is an empty list.
   - `cnt` has been incremented to cover all elements in `num_of_lens`.
   - `res` is the total sum of all counts from the `num_of_lens` dictionary values.

4. **Determine what needs to be adjusted**:
   - Since the loop iterates over `num_of_lens.values()`, the key aspect is that `num_of_lens` must have at least one value for the loop to execute.
   - The current state indicates that `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with counts from `num_list`, but since `num_list` is empty, `num_of_lens` is also empty.
   - Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `num_of_lens` must have at least one value.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `total_count` remains 0.
   - `results` list remains containing the value of `res`, which is the sum of all counts from the `num_of_lens` dictionary values (which is currently 0).
   - `num_of_lens` must have at least one value for the loop to execute.
   - `cnt` has been incremented to cover all elements in `num_of_lens`, so it should reflect the number of elements in `num_of_lens`.
   - `res` is the total sum of all counts from the `num_of_lens` dictionary values, which is currently 0.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is that `num_of_lens` must have at least one value.

**State:**
**`total_count` is 0, results list contains the value of `res`, which is 0, `num_of_lens` must have at least one value, `cnt` must be equal to the number of elements in `num_of_lens`, `res` is the total sum of all counts from the `num_of_lens` dictionary values, which is 0**
