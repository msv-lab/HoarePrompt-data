Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5) representing the number of sticks, followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n) representing the exponents used to determine the lengths of the sticks as 2^{a_i}. Additionally, the sum of all n values across all tuples does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5; `results` is an empty list, `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `n` is an input integer, `_` must be greater than 0.
Code of the loop:
for x in num_list:
    if x in num_of_lens:
        num_of_lens[x] += 1
    else:
        num_of_lens[x] = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where the key `x` (the first element of `num_list`) is present with its value incremented by 1 if `x` was already a key in `num_of_lens`. If `x` was not a key in `num_of_lens`, it is added as a new key with a value of 1. `test_cases` remains a list of tuples, `results` remains an empty list, `num_list` remains a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `n` is an input integer, `_` must be greater than 0, and `x` is the first element of `num_list`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where the key `x` (the second element of `num_list`) is present with its value incremented by 1. `test_cases` remains a list of tuples, `results` remains an empty list, `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers with the first element removed, `n` is an input integer, `_` must be greater than 0, and `x` is the second element of `num_list`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where the key `x` (the second element of `num_list`) is either incremented by 1 or set to 1, depending on whether `x` is already a key in `num_of_lens`. `test_cases` remains a list of tuples, `results` remains an empty list, `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers with the first element removed, `n` is an input integer, `_` must be greater than 0, and `x` is the next element in `num_list`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
