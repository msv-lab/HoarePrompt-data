Output State: The `results` list will contain the sum of `res` values calculated for each test case after all iterations of the loop have completed. For each test case, `res` is computed based on the conditions provided: it accumulates values when the count of a particular exponent (`cnt`) is 3 or more, and also considers pairs of the same exponent when calculating `res`. The `total_count` keeps track of the total number of sticks seen so far across all test cases. After all test cases have been processed, `results` will contain one element for each test case, representing the final value of `res` for that test case.

In natural language, the output state is as follows: The `results` list will hold the final result for each test case after processing all inputs. Each entry in `results` represents the total number of unique triplets and pairs of identical stick lengths found across all test cases, as per the specified conditions in the loop.
