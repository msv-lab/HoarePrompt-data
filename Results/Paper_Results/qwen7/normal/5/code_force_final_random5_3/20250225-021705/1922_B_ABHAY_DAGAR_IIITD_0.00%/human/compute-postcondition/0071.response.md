Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `test_cases` is decremented by 1 and is now greater than 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element (excluding the first element).
   - `x` is the second element of `num_list`.
   - If `x` is already a key in `num_of_lens`, its corresponding value is incremented by 1; otherwise, `num_of_lens` is updated with the key-value pair `{x: 1}`.

2. **Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over each element in `num_list`.

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop variable `x` will be the next element in `num_list`.
   - `test_cases` will be decremented by 1 again.
   - `num_list` will lose its first element (since `x` is the second element).

Given these points, let's determine the new state:

- `test_cases` will be decremented by 1 again and must still be greater than 0.
- `n` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
- `num_list` will now be a list of integers starting from the third element (if it exists) since `x` was the second element.
- `x` will be the third element of `num_list` (if it exists).

Considering these changes, the new state should be:

State: **`test_cases` is decremented by 1 and is now greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element (excluding the first two elements); `x` is the third element of `num_list`; if `x` is already a key in `num_of_lens`, its corresponding value is incremented by 1; otherwise, `num_of_lens` is updated with the key-value pair `{x: 1}`.**
