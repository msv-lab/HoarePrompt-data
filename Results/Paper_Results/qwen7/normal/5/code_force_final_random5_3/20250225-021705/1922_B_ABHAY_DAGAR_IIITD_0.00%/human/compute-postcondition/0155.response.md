Postcondition: `total_count` is increased by the previous `cnt` value, `num_of_lens` must have at least one key-value pair remaining, and `res` is increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3. If `cnt` is less than 3, the values of `total_count` and `num_of_lens` remain unchanged, and `res` is also unchanged.
