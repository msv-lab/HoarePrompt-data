State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5) representing the number of sticks, followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n) representing the exponents used to determine the lengths of the sticks as 2^{a_i}. Additionally, the sum of all n values across all tuples does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5; `results` is an empty list, `_` must be greater than 0**.

Explanation:
- The loop variable `_` is used in the loop header, and it is incremented with each iteration. For the loop to execute at least once, `_` must be greater than 0.
- The state of `test_cases` and `results` does not directly affect whether the loop can execute, but they are part of the overall program state. The loop will iterate over each tuple in `test_cases`, and `results` will accumulate the results of these iterations. However, since the loop itself is controlled by `_`, the only adjustment needed for the loop to execute is ensuring that `_` is greater than 0.
