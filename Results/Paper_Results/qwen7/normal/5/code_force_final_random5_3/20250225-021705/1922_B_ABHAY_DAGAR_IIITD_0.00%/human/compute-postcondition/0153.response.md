Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop is defined as `for cnt in num_of_lens.values():`. This means that `cnt` is the variable being iterated over, and `num_of_lens` is the dictionary providing the values.

2. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - We know that `total_count` is increased by the previous `cnt` value. This implies that `total_count` was updated during the previous iteration.

3. **Understand the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute again, there must be more values in `num_of_lens.values()` to iterate over. This means that `num_of_lens` must still have at least one key-value pair left to iterate over.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since `cnt` is the variable being iterated over, it will take on the next value from `num_of_lens.values()`.
   - `total_count` will be updated again based on the new `cnt` value, but we don't need to explicitly state this here because the problem only asks us to adjust the states of objects in the loop head.

5. **Formulate the New State:**
   - The only variables in the loop head are `cnt` and `num_of_lens`, so we need to ensure that `num_of_lens` still has keys to iterate over.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`total_count` is increased by the previous `cnt` value, `num_of_lens` must have at least one key-value pair remaining**
