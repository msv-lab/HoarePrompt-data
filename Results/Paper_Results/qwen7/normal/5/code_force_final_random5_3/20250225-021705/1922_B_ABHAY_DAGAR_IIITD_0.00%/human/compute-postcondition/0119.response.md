Postcondition: `results` list now contains the value of `res`, which contains the sum of all contributions calculated according to the conditions in the loop, `total_count` is the sum of all counts from `num_of_lens` values, `cnt` has been incremented through all values in `num_of_lens`, `num_list` is a non-empty list of integers obtained from input, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with one entry where the key is `x` and the value is 1 (since `x` was incremented by 1), and `x` is an element of `num_list`.
