Output State: **`test_cases` is decremented by 1 and is now greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element; `x` is the first element of `num_list`; `num_of_lens[x]` is incremented by 1 and is now equal to the value it had before plus 1; the current value of `x` is in the `num_of_lens` dictionary.**

Explanation: The code increments the count of the first element `x` in the dictionary `num_of_lens`. Since `x` was already in the dictionary, its count is increased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
