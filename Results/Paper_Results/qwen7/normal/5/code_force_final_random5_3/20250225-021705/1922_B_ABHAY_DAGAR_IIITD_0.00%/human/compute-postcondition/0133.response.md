Output State: **`results` list contains the value of `res`, which is the sum of all counts from the `num_of_lens` dictionary values; `total_count` is equal to `res`; `num_of_lens` dictionary contains each unique element from the original `num_list` as keys, with their respective counts as values; `num_list` is an empty list; `cnt` has been incremented to cover all elements in `num_of_lens`; `res` is the total sum of all counts from the `num_of_lens` dictionary values.**

In natural language, after executing the line of code `res = 0`, the value of `res` is set to 0. This does not affect the values of the other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the `results` list still contains the value of `res`, which is the sum of all counts from the `num_of_lens` dictionary values. The `total_count` variable is still equal to `res`. The `num_of_lens` dictionary still contains each unique element from the original `num_list` as keys, with their respective counts as values. The `num_list` is still an empty list because all elements have been processed. The `cnt` variable has been incremented to cover all elements in `num_of_lens`.
