Postcondition: **`results` list now contains the value of `res`, which is the sum of all contributions calculated according to the conditions in the loop, `total_count` is the sum of all counts from `num_of_lens` values, `cnt` has been incremented through all values in `num_of_lens`, `x` is the next element from `num_list`, `num_list` is the list without the last processed element. If `x` is in `num_of_lens`, then `num_of_lens[x]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `num_of_lens[x]` is set to 1.**
