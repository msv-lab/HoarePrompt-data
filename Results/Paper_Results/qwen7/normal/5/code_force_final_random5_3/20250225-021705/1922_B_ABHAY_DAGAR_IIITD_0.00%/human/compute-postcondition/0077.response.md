Output State: The loop has executed all iterations, meaning it has processed every element in the `num_list`. Postcondition: `test_cases` is decremented by 1 and is now greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `num_list` is an empty list since all elements have been processed; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is a unique element from `num_list` and its corresponding value is the count of how many times that element appeared in `num_list`.
