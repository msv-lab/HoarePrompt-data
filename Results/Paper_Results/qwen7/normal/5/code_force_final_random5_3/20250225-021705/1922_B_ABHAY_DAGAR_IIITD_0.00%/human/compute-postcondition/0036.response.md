Output State: **`total_count'` is equal to the original value of `total_count` plus the next value of `cnt`, `res` is increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `res` by adding the value of `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` to it. The value of `total_count'` remains as the original value of `total_count` plus the next value of `cnt`. The other variables are not affected.
