Reasoning:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases (`t`) and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the number of sticks (`n`) and the list of exponents (`a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`).

2. **Counting Exponents**: It uses a dictionary (`num_of_lens`) to count the occurrences of each exponent value. This helps in determining how many sticks have the same length.

3. **Triangle Formation Logic**:
   - For each count `cnt` of an exponent value:
     - If `cnt` is 3 or more, the number of ways to choose 3 sticks with the same length is given by `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`.
     - If `cnt` is 2 or more, the number of ways to choose 2 sticks with the same length and one stick with a different length is given by `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`, where `total_count` is the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens`.

4. **Result Calculation**: The results for each test case are stored in the `results` list.

5. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the results for each test case.

Given the detailed explanation and the logic implemented, the program correctly follows the problem statement and handles the constraints appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
