Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the initial state at the end of the previous iteration:**
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `i` is `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1] + 1`.
   - `a[i]` is `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`.

2. **Understand the loop condition:**
   - The loop runs from `1` to `n-1` (inclusive).

3. **Determine the current value of `i`:**
   - Since the loop starts from `1`, the current value of `i` at the start of the first iteration is `1`.

4. **Analyze the loop head:**
   - The loop variable `i` is used in the loop condition and updates within the loop.

5. **Update the state based on the loop condition:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Given that `i` is `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1] + 1`, we need to update `i` to `a[i] + x[i] + 1`.

6. **Determine the new values:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1] + 1`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` should be updated to `a[i] + x[i] + 1`.

7. **Adjust the state:**
   - `n` must still be greater than 1.
   - `i` should be updated to `a[i] + x[i] + 1`.
   - `a[i]` remains as `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`.

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`n` must be greater than 1; `i` is `a[i] + x[i] + 1`; `a[i]` is `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`**
