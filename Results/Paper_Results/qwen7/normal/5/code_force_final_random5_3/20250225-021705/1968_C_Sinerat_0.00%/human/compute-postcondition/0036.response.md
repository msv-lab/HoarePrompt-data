Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be at least 1
   - `a[i]` is equal to `a[0] + x[0]`

3. **Analyze the loop condition**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i < n`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1 and the new value of `i` must still satisfy the condition `i < n`.

4. **Update the state**:
   - Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented to 2 for the next iteration.
   - The condition `n` must be at least 1 remains unchanged because the loop itself does not modify `n`.

5. **Check the condition `a[i]`**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `a[i]` (which is `a[1]`) is equal to `a[0] + x[0]`.
   - For the next iteration, `a[i]` (which will be `a[2]` if `i` becomes 2) should be updated based on the loop body, but since the loop body is omitted, we assume no change to `a[i]` unless explicitly stated otherwise.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

- `i` is now 2
- `n` must still be at least 1
- `a[i]` (which is `a[2]`) will remain as `a[0] + x[0]` unless the loop body changes it.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 1, `a[2]` is equal to `a[0] + x[0]`**
