Output State: `i` is `n-1`, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a[1]` is `a[0] + x[0]`, `a[2]` is `a[1] + x[1]`, ..., `a[n-1]` is `a[n-2] + x[n-2]`.

In this final output state, the variable `i` will be `n-1` because the loop runs from `1` to `n-1`. The list `a` will have its first element as `500` and each subsequent element `a[i]` will be the sum of the previous element `a[i-1]` and the corresponding element `x[i-1]` from the list `x`. This process continues until the loop completes all iterations, resulting in `a[n-1]` being `a[n-2] + x[n-2]`.
