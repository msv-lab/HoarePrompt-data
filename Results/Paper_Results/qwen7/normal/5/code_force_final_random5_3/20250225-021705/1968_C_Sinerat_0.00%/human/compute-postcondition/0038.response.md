Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is defined as `for i in range(1, n)`. This means the loop variable `i` ranges from 1 to `n-1`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` must be at least 1.
   - `a[2]` is equal to `a[1] + x[1]`.

3. **Check if the loop can continue**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Currently, `i` is 2. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute one more time.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is 2, it will increment to 3 in the next iteration.
   - Therefore, `i` will be 3.
   - `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to continue.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` is now 3.
   - `n` must be greater than 2.

Given this reasoning, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 2**
