Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate an array `a` that satisfies the given conditions for all test cases. Specifically, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
3
4
2 4 1
```

Expected output:
```
3 5 4 9
```

However, the program generates:
```
500 501 502 503
```

This is incorrect because it does not satisfy the condition \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\). For example, for \(i = 2\), we have \(x_2 = 2\) and \(a_2 = 501\), but \(501 \bmod 500 = 1 \neq 2\).

Therefore, the program does not work correctly for this test case, and the correctness is **False**.
