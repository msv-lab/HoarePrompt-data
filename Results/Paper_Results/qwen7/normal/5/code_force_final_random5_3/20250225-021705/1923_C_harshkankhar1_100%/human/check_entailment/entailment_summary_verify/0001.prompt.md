You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    1 5
    
    4 4
    
    3 4
    
    1 3

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO

- Program:
from itertools import accumulate

for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, q) = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    b = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
        b[i] = b[i - 1] + x
    a = list(accumulate(a))
    for _ in range(q):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an array `a` of positive integers and a set of queries. For each query, it compares the sum of elements in a specified subarray with a cumulative count related to those elements. If the sum of the subarray is less than the cumulative count or if the query indices are the same, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function ultimately prints the result for each query and does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the number of queries `q`.
   - It then reads the array `c` of length `n`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The function `func_1()` is called for each test case.
   - Inside `func_1()`, it initializes an array `b` where `b[i]` is the prefix sum of a modified array `a`.
   - The array `a` is initialized with zeros and then populated with the values from the input array `c`.
   - A new array `b` is created, where `b[i]` is the prefix sum of a modified array `a`. Specifically, `b[i]` is calculated as follows:
     - If `a[i] > 1`, then `b[i] = b[i-1] + 1`.
     - Otherwise, `b[i] = b[i-1] + 2`.

3. **Accumulating Sums:**
   - The array `a` is then accumulated using `list(accumulate(a))` to get the prefix sums of `a`.

4. **Handling Queries:**
   - For each query, the program reads the indices `x` and `y` and checks whether the subarray `c[x]` to `c[y]` is good.
   - It checks if the sum of the subarray `c[x]` to `c[y]` is less than the corresponding prefix sum difference in `b` and if `x` is not equal to `y`.

### Issues and Corrections:

1. **Modification of Array `a`:**
   - The array `a` is modified to include zeros at the beginning, which is unnecessary. We should directly work with the input array `c`.

2. **Condition for Subarray to be Good:**
   - The condition `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1]` is incorrect. Instead, we need to check if the sum of the subarray can be split into two different arrays `b` and `a` that satisfy the conditions.

3. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - The prefix sum calculation in `b` is incorrect. We need to ensure that `b[i]` represents the sum of elements in `a` that are greater than 1.

### Corrected Program:

```python
from itertools import accumulate

def is_good_subarray(c, x, y):
    total_sum = sum(c[x-1:y])
    min_value = min(c[x-1:y])
    if min_value == 1:
        return False
    if total_sum % 2 != 0:
        return False
    half_sum = total_sum // 2
    if half_sum < len(c[x-1:y]) or half_sum * 2 != total_sum:
        return False
    return True

for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, q) = map(int, input().split())
    c = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    for _ in range(q):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        if is_good_subarray(c, x, y + 1):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

### Conclusion:

After analyzing the original program and making necessary corrections, the final version of the program is now correct. Therefore, the initial program was incorrect due to the issues mentioned above.
