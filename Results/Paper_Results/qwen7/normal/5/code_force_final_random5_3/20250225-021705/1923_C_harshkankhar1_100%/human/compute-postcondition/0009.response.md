Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(1, n + 1)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a[i]` is either greater than 1 or less than or equal to 1.
   - `x` is 1 if `a[2]` is greater than 1, otherwise `x` is 2.
   - `b[2]` is `b[1] + x`.
   - `b[3]` is `b[2] + x`.
   - `i` is 2.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 3 (assuming `n` is at least 3).

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 3.
   - The value of `x` is determined by `a[2]`. Since `a[2]` is already known from the previous state, `x` remains the same.
   - The values of `b[2]` and `b[3]` are dependent on `x` and the previous values of `b[1]` and `b[2]`. However, these values do not change based on the loop iteration itself but rather on the initial conditions and the value of `x`.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` will be 3.
   - `x` remains the same as it was in the previous iteration.
   - `b[2]` and `b[3]` remain unchanged because they depend on the initial conditions and the value of `x`, which does not change within the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`a[i]` is either greater than 1 or less than or equal to 1; `x` is 1 if `a[2]` is greater than 1, otherwise `x` is 2; `b[2]` is `b[1] + x`; `b[3]` is `b[2] + x`; `i` is 3**
