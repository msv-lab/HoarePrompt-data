Output State: **`u` is the first input integer, `v` is the second input integer, `f` is the third input integer, `a` is the cumulative sum of `f` added for each iteration from `i=0` to `i=m-1`, `i` is `m`, `k` is `m`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M` and assigns it to `c`. Since the values of `u`, `v`, `f`, `a`, `i`, `k`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `M` are not affected by this operation, they remain as their initial states. The new variable `c` is introduced with its specific value calculated based on the given formula and modulus.
