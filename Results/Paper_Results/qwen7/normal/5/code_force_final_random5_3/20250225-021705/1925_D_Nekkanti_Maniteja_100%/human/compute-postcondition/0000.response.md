Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(int(input())):`.
   - The variable `i` is used in the loop.

2. **Determine the Initial State:**
   - The initial state given is: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4\).

3. **Understand the Loop Execution Condition:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `int(input())` provides a value within the range defined by `t`.
   - Since `t` is the number of test cases, `int(input())` should provide a value between 1 and `t` inclusive for the loop to continue executing.

4. **Adjust the State:**
   - We need to ensure that the input provided to `int(input())` is within the valid range for the loop to execute.
   - Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `int(input())` returns a value between 1 and `t`.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4\) and the input to `int(input())` must be an integer between 1 and `t` inclusive.**

Thus, the final answer is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4\), and the input to `int(input())` must be an integer between 1 and `t` inclusive.**
