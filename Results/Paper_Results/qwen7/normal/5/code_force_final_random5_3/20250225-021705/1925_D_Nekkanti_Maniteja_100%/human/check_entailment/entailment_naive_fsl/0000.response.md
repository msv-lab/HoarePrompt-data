Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. Specifically, the program incorrectly calculates the contribution of each friendship value to the expected sum.

### Analysis:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Expected Value:**
   - The program calculates `c` as the modular multiplicative inverse of the total number of possible pairs `(n * (n - 1) // 2)` modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - It then incorrectly uses this value `c` in the calculation of the expected sum without properly accounting for the probability of choosing each pair and the increase in friendship values over excursions.

2. **Missing Probabilistic Considerations:**
   - For each excursion, the probability of choosing a specific pair is not correctly handled. The program assumes a uniform distribution but does not account for the fact that the friendship value of a chosen pair increases over time.
   - The program should consider the probability of choosing a pair for each excursion and how this affects the expected value of the sum of friendship values.

3. **Incorrect Summation:**
   - The program sums the initial friendship values and multiplies by the modular multiplicative inverse, which does not correctly reflect the expected value calculation.
   - The expected value should take into account the increasing friendship values over the k excursions, which the current implementation fails to do.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following input:
```
1
2 1 1
1 2 10
```
- There are 2 children, 1 pair of friends with a friendship value of 10.
- The teacher goes on 1 excursion.
- The correct expected value should be 10 because the friendship value will definitely increase by 1 during the excursion, making it 11, and the expected value is 11.

However, the program will output 0, which is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic required to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
