Output State: **`u` is the first input integer, `v` is the second input integer, `f` is the third input integer, `a` is the cumulative sum of `f` added for each iteration from `i=0` to `i=m-1`, `i` is `m`, `k` is `m`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `M` is 1000000007.**

The code sets the constant `M` to the value `10 ** 9 + 7`. This value does not affect any of the existing variables (`u`, `v`, `f`, `a`, `i`, `k`, `n`, `m`). Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged, and the new constant `M` is introduced with its specific value.
