Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Calculation of Expected Value**: The program attempts to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values, but it does not correctly account for the probability of choosing each pair during the excursions.
   
2. **Friendship Value Increase**: The program incorrectly calculates the increase in friendship values. Specifically, it should consider the probability of selecting a friend pair and how this affects the expected value over `k` excursions.

3. **Modular Arithmetic**: While the program correctly uses modular arithmetic with \(10^9 + 7\), the way it calculates the expected value is flawed.

To correctly solve the problem, you need to use the concept of linearity of expectation. For each pair of friends, the expected increase in friendship value can be calculated as follows:

- Each pair of friends has a probability of being chosen in each excursion.
- The expected value for each pair of friends over `k` excursions is the probability of being chosen times the number of excursions.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        
        # Calculate the inverse of the number of pairs (n*(n-1)/2) modulo MOD
        total_pairs = n * (n - 1) // 2
        inv_total_pairs = pow(total_pairs, -1, MOD)
        
        # Sum of friendship values
        total_friendship_value = 0
        
        # Process each friendship
        for _ in range(m):
            u, v, f = map(int, input().split())
            total_friendship_value += f
        
        # Calculate the expected value
        expected_value = 0
        for i in range(k):
            expected_value += (i + 1) * inv_total_pairs * total_friendship_value
        
        # Output the result modulo MOD
        print(expected_value % MOD)

func()
```

This version correctly calculates the expected value using the linearity of expectation and modular arithmetic.
