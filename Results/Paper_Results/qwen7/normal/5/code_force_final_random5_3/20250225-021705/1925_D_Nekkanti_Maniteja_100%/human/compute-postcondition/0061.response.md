Output State: **`i` is `k + 2`, `m` must be greater than `k + 2`, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `u`, `v`, and `f`. The values of `i` and `m` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `i` is still `k + 2`, and `m` must still be greater than `k + 2`. The values of `u`, `v`, and `f` are the integers input by the user.
