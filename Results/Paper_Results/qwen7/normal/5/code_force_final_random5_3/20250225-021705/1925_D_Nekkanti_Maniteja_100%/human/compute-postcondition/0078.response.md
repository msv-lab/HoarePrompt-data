Output State: The final value of `s` is calculated as the sum of `c * i * c * m + c * a` for all iterations from `i = 0` to `i = k-1`, plus additional terms for each subsequent iteration up to `i = k-1`. Specifically, for each iteration from `i = k` to `i = k-1`, the term `c * (i + m) * c * (i + m) * (m - (i - k + 1)) + c * a * m` is added to `s`. Here, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`, `a` is the cumulative sum of `f` for all edges, `M` is \(10^9 + 7\), and `k` is the total number of iterations of the loop.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, `s` accumulates the contributions from each edge `f` and the combinatorial terms based on the number of iterations and the modular multiplicative inverse `c`. The final value of `s` is then taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
