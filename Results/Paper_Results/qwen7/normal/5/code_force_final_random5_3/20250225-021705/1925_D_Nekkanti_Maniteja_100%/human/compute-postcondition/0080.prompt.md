You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5⋅10^4. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2⋅10^5. Each of the next m lines contains three integers a_i, b_i, and f_i such that a_i ≠ b_i, 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, and 1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^9. It is guaranteed that all pairs of friends are distinct, and the sum of n and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)
        
        s = 0
        
        a = 0
        
        for i in range(m):
            u, v, f = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        
        for i in range(k):
            s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a
        
        print(s % M)
        
    #State: Output State: The final value of `s` is calculated as the sum of `c * i * c * m + c * a` for all iterations from `i = 0` to `i = k-1`, plus additional terms for each subsequent iteration up to `i = k-1`. Specifically, for each iteration from `i = k` to `i = k-1`, the term `c * (i + m) * c * (i + m) * (m - (i - k + 1)) + c * a * m` is added to `s`. Here, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`, `a` is the cumulative sum of `f` for all edges, `M` is \(10^9 + 7\), and `k` is the total number of iterations of the loop.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, `s` accumulates the contributions from each edge `f` and the combinatorial terms based on the number of iterations and the modular multiplicative inverse `c`. The final value of `s` is then taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes inputs through a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5⋅10^4), followed by integers n, m, and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2⋅10^5). Additionally, it processes m lines of input, each containing three integers a_i, b_i, and f_i (a_i ≠ b_i, 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, and 1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^9). The function returns information based on the processed data, ensuring all pairs of friends are distinct and the sums of n, m, and k meet specified constraints.

The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
