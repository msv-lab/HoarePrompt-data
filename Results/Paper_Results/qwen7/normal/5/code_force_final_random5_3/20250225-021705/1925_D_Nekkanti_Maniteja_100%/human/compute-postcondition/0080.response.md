Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers n, m, and k, along with m pairs of integers a_i and b_i, and an integer f_i. It calculates a value s based on the given inputs and a modular multiplicative inverse c, and prints the result of s modulo \(10^9 + 7\). The final value of s is derived from a combination of combinatorial terms and the cumulative sum of f_i values, ensuring all calculations are performed under modular arithmetic.**
