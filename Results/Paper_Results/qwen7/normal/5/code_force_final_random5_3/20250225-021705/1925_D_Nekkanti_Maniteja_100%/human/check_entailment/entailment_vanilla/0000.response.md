Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` which represent the number of children, pairs of friends, and the number of excursions.
   - It initializes `M` as \(10^9 + 7\) and calculates the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs of children, denoted as `c`.

2. **Calculating the Modular Inverse:**
   - The line `c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)` computes the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs of children under modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - This is necessary because we need to use the inverse in our calculations later.

3. **Summing Friendship Values:**
   - The program initializes `s` and `a` to 0.
   - It then iterates through each of the `m` pairs of friends, reading `u`, `v`, and `f` (where `f` is the friendship value).
   - It adds the friendship value `f` to `a`.

4. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The program then enters a loop for `k` excursions.
   - Inside this loop, it updates `s` using the formula `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a`.
   - Here, `c * i * c * m` seems to be an attempt to calculate the contribution of each excursion to the expected value, but it is not correctly formulated for the problem.
   - The term `c * a` adds the current sum of friendship values to `s`.

5. **Output:**
   - Finally, it prints the result of `s % M`.

### Correctness Analysis:

- **Modular Inverse Calculation:** 
  - The calculation of the modular inverse is correct and necessary for the problem.

- **Friendship Value Sum:**
  - The sum of friendship values `a` is correctly calculated.

- **Expected Value Calculation:**
  - The formula used in the loop `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a` is incorrect. The expected value of the sum of friendship values should be calculated differently. Specifically, the expected value of the sum of friendship values after `k` excursions for a single pair of friends is `k * (k + 1) / 2`. However, the program incorrectly uses `c * i * c * m` and `c * a`.

- **Final Output:**
  - The output is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\), which is correct.

### Conclusion:

The program does not correctly implement the logic to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values. The formula used in the loop is incorrect. Therefore, the program will not produce the correct results for the given problem.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**
