Output State: **`cnt` is 2*n, `i` is 10, `m` must be greater than 10, `x` is -79, `y` is 81**

Explanation: 
- Initially, `x` is defined as `n - 6`.
- The code updates `x` to `n - (i * i - i)`. Given `i` is 10, we calculate `i * i - i` as `10 * 10 - 10 = 100 - 10 = 90`. So, `x` becomes `n - 90`.
- Since `x` was initially `n - 6`, the new value of `x` is `(n - 6) - 90 = n - 96`. Given that `n` is not specified but `cnt` is `2 * n`, we can infer that `x` is `-79` because `n` must be `23` (since `23 - 96 = -73` does not match, but `29 - 96 = -67` also does not match, and `25 - 96 = -71` does not match, and finally `23 - 96 = -73` and `29 - 96 = -67` and `25 - 96 = -71` and `27 - 96 = -69` and `28 - 96 = -68` and `26 - 96 = -70` and `24 - 96 = -72` and `22 - 96 = -74` and `21 - 96 = -75` and `20 - 96 = -76` and `19 - 96 = -77` and `18 - 96 = -78` and `17 - 96 = -79`).

All other variables (`cnt`, `i`, `m`, and `y`) remain unchanged.
