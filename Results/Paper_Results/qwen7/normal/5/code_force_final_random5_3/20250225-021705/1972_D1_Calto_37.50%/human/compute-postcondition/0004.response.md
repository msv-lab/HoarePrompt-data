Output State: **`cnt` is 0 + (n - (2 * 2 - 2)) // 4 + (2 > 1), `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^6, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 2⋅10^6, `i` is 2, `x` is `n - (2 * 2 - 2)`, `y` is 4.**

Explanation: 
- Initially, `cnt` is 0.
- The value of `x` is calculated as `n - (2 * 2 - 2)`, which simplifies to `n - 2`.
- The code updates `cnt` to `cnt + x // y + (i > 1)`. Since `y` is 4, `x // y` is `(n - 2) // 4`. Also, since `i` is 2 and `2 > 1` is True, `(i > 1)` evaluates to 1.
- Therefore, `cnt` is updated to `0 + (n - 2) // 4 + 1`, which simplifies to `cnt` being `(n - 2) // 4 + 1`.

The other variables (`n`, `m`, `i`, `x`, and `y`) remain unchanged.
