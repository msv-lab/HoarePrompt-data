Output State: **`cnt` is 2*n, `i` is 9, `m` must be greater than 3, and `x` is `n - 6`; `y` is 81.**

Explanation:
- Initially, `cnt` is `n + 1`.
- The code updates `cnt` to `cnt + x // y + (i > 1)`.
- Given `x` is `n - 6` and `y` is 81, `x // y` is `0` because `n - 6` divided by 81 results in 0 (assuming `n` is less than 6).
- Since `i` is 9, `(i > 1)` evaluates to `True`, which is `1`.
- Thus, `cnt` becomes `(n + 1) + 0 + 1 = n + 2`.
- The updated value of `cnt` is `n + 2`, which simplifies to `2*n` since `n + 1` was the original value of `cnt`.

Therefore, the final state includes `cnt` being `2*n`, while the other variables remain unchanged.
