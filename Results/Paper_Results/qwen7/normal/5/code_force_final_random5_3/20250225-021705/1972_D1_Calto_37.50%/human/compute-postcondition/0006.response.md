First, let's calculate the initial value of `cnt`:
- `n - (2 * 2 - 2) // 4 + (2 > 1)` simplifies to `n - (4 - 2) // 4 + 1`, which further simplifies to `n - 2 // 4 + 1`. Since `2 // 4` is 0, `cnt` is `n - 0 + 1` or `n + 1`.

So, the initial state is: `cnt` is `n + 1`, `i` is 3, and `m` must be greater than 3.

Now, let's run the code snippet:
```
x = n - (i * i - i)
```
- `i` is 3, so `i * i - i` is `3 * 3 - 3` which is `9 - 3` or 6.
- Thus, `x` is `n - 6`.

The values of `cnt`, `i`, and `m` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`cnt` is `n + 1`, `i` is 3, `m` must be greater than 3, and `x` is `n - 6`.**
