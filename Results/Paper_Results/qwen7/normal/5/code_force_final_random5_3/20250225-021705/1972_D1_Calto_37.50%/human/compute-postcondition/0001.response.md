State: **`cnt` is 0, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^6, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 2⋅10^6, `i` is 1, `m` must be greater than 1**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop is defined as `for i in range(1, m):`, which means `i` will start from 1 and increment until it reaches `m`.
2. For the loop to execute, the condition `1 < m` must be true because the range function in Python generates numbers starting from the first parameter (1 in this case) up to, but not including, the second parameter (`m`).
3. The initial value of `i` is set to 1 by the range function.
4. The variables `cnt` and `n` are not directly involved in the loop's execution condition and their values do not affect whether the loop runs or not. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` to 1 and `m` to be greater than 1.
