The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `n` and `m`. Both `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6. The function returns 1 in Case_1 and returns `cnt` which is 2*n - 8 in Case_2.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters n and m, and returns 1 in Case_1. In Case_2, it returns cnt which is calculated as 2*n - 8.**
