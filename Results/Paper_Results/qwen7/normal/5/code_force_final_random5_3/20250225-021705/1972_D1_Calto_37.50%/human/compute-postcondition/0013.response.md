Output State: `cnt` is 2*n - 8, `i` is 2*10^6, `m` is 2*10^6, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^6, `x` is `n - (2*10^6 * 2*10^6 - 2*10^6)`, `y` is (2*10^6)^2.

In this final state, after all iterations of the loop have executed, `cnt` has accumulated the value `2*n - 8`. The loop runs from `i=1` to `i=m-1`, so with `m` being up to 2⋅10^6, `i` will reach 2⋅10^6. Since `i > 1` conditionally increments `cnt` by 1 for each iteration starting from `i=2`, and considering the pattern in the given states, the final `x` and `y` values reflect the last iteration where `i` is 2⋅10^6, making `x` negative and `y` very large.
