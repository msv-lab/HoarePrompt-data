Output State: `cnt` is 2*n - 8, `i` is 2*10^6, `m` is 2*10^6, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^6, `x` is `n - (2*10^6 * 2*10^6 - 2*10^6)`, `y` is (2*10^6)^2.

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = m-1`. Given the output state after 3 iterations, we can infer the general formula for `cnt` as `2*n - 8`. Since `m` is a positive integer up to 2⋅10^6 and the loop continues until `i` reaches `m-1`, the final value of `i` will be 2*10^6 and `m` will also be 2*10^6. The values of `x` and `y` are calculated based on the final value of `i`, which is 2*10^6. Thus, `x` becomes `n - ((2*10^6)^2 - 2*10^6)` and `y` becomes `(2*10^6)^2`.
