### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

#### Understanding the Problem
We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Provided Functions
- `func_1(a, b)`: This function correctly calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \(a\) and \(b\) using the Euclidean algorithm.
- `func_2(n, m)`: This function attempts to count the valid pairs \((a, b)\) but seems to be implementing an incorrect logic.

#### Analysis of `func_2` Implementation
The function `func_2` has the following issues:
1. **Incorrect Logic**: The logic inside the loop does not correctly check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
2. **Incorrect Calculation**: The expressions \(x = n - (i * i - i)\) and \(y = i * i\) do not relate to the problem statement at all.
3. **Increment Operations**: The increment operations do not account for the GCD or the multiple condition.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if they satisfy the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Here is a corrected version of `func_2`:

```python
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            gcd = func_1(a, b)
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd) == 0:
                cnt += 1
    return cnt

def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a
```

This corrected version:
1. Iterates over all possible pairs \((a, b)\).
2. Calculates the GCD of \(a\) and \(b\) using `func_1`.
3. Checks if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
4. Increments the count if the condition is satisfied.

#### Final Evaluation
The original assessment concluded that the provided program is incorrect because `func_2` does not correctly implement the required logic. However, upon reviewing the problem and the corrected implementation, it is clear that the original program needs to be fixed, not overturned.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
