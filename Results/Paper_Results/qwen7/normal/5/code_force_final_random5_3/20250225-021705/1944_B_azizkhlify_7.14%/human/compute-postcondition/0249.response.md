Output State: **Postcondition: `a` is an array that includes at least the elements `a[0]`, `a[3]`, and `a[5]`, `n` must be less than or equal to 5, `i` is `n + 2`, `ur` is increased by 4, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there are no loops or conditionals directly containing the `break` statement within the given code snippet, the only changes are that the loop or conditional block is exited. All other variables retain their previous states as per the initial conditions.
