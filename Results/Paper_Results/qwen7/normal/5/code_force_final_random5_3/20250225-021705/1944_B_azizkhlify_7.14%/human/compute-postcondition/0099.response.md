Based on the initial state provided:

- `res` is an empty list.
- `i` is `n`.
- `n` must be a valid integer such that `n < 2 * n`.
- The current value of `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2.

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')`.

Since `i` is `n`, and `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, it implies that `a[n] - 1` corresponds to an index in the array `r` whose value is 2. However, the actual value of `a[i]` itself is not provided directly. Given the information, we can infer that `a[i]` (which is `a[n]`) must be such that `a[n] - 1` is an index where `r` has the value 2.

Therefore, the value of `a[i]` (or `a[n]`) could be any integer that satisfies this condition. But since the exact value of `a[n]` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact numerical value to print. We only know that `a[i]` is an integer such that when subtracted by 1, it gives an index in `r` with the value 2.

Thus, the output will be a repetition of the value of `a[i]` (or `a[n]`), followed by a space due to the `end=' '` parameter in the `print` function.

Output: **[a[n]] [a[n]]**
