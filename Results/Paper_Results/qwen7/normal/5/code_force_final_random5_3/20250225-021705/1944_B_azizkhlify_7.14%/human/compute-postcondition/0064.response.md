Output State: **Postcondition: `i` is less than `n`, `ul` holds the last incremented value before exiting the loop, `k` is `2 * k - ul`, `r`, `re`, `ul`, `ur`, and `res` remain unchanged from their post-loop conditions, and the current value of `re` is equal to `k`. We break out of the loop.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the loop immediately. Since the loop was exited, the value of `i` remains less than `n`, and the value of `ul` remains the last incremented value before exiting the loop. The value of `k` is updated to `2 * k - ul` as per the post-loop condition. The variables `r`, `re`, `ul`, `ur`, and `res` remain unchanged from their post-loop conditions, and the current value of `re` is equal to `k`.
