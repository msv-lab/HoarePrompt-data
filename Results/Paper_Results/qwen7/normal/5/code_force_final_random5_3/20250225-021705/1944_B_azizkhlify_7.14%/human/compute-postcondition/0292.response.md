Based on the initial state provided:
- `i` is set to 1
- `n` is a positive integer

The code snippet is:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

Here, `a` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its contents. However, since the code snippet only references `a[i]` and `i` is 1, we know that `a[1]` will be printed twice. 

Given that `a` is not specified further, the most precise description we can provide is that it will print the value of `a[1]` twice, separated by a space (due to the `end=' '` parameter).

Output: **a[1] a[1]**
