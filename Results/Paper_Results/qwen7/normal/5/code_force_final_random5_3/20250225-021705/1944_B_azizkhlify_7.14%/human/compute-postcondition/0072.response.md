Postcondition: **`re` is equal to `k`, `i` is `i + 1`, `ul` is `i`, `k` is `2 * k - i`, `r`, `ul`, `ur`, and `res` remain unchanged from their post-loop conditions. If the element at index `a[i] - 1` in the list `l` is equal to 1, then `res` contains the element `a[i]`; otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.**
