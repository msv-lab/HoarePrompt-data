Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `a` is an array that includes at least the elements `a[0]`, `a[3]`, and `a[5]`.
   - `n` must be less than or equal to 5.
   - `i` is set to `n + 2`.
   - `ur` is increased by 2.
   - If `ul` equals `ur`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

2. **Determine the Value of `i`:**
   - Since `n` must be less than or equal to 5, the maximum value `n` can take is 5.
   - Therefore, `i = n + 2` implies the maximum value of `i` is `5 + 2 = 7`.
   - However, since `a` only contains elements `a[0]`, `a[3]`, and `a[5]`, `i` cannot be 7 because `a[7]` does not exist.
   - The only valid value for `i` within the bounds of `a` is `3` (since `i = n + 2` and `n` can be 1, making `i = 3`).

3. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   - The print statement is `print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')`.
   - Given `i = 3`, we need to determine `a[3]`.
   - From the initial state, `a` includes at least `a[3]`, so `a[3]` is a valid element.

4. **Output Determination:**
   - Since `i = 3`, both `a[i]` will be `a[3]`.
   - The print statement will print `a[3]` twice, separated by a space.

Output: **a[3] a[3]**
