Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `res` is an empty list.
   - `i` is `n + 2`.
   - `r[a[i] - 1]` remains 2.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
   ```

From the initial state, we know:
- `i` is `n + 2`.
- `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, but this does not directly give us the value of `a[i]`.

However, the print statement is printing `a[i]` twice. Since the exact value of `a[i]` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `a[i]` from the given information. But we can describe it in terms of the relationship with `i`.

Given `i = n + 2`, the value of `a[i]` is the element at the index `n + 2` in the list `a`.

Therefore, the print statement will output the value of `a[n + 2]` twice, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

Output: **a[n + 2] a[n + 2]**
