Output State: **`res` is an empty list, `i` is `n`, and `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2.**

The `break` statement does not change any variable values or affect the conditions given in the initial state. It simply exits the loop or block it is within, but since no loop or block is specified, the only thing we can conclude is that the execution stops there, and the variables remain in their initial states as described.
