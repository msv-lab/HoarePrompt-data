Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial states at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `ul` is the original value of `ul` plus 2.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over `range(n)`, meaning `i` will increment from 0 to `n-1`.

4. **Check the loop execution logic**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - Since `i` starts from 0, the loop will continue if `i < n`.
   - `n` remains unchanged, so the loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

5. **Consider the postcondition**: If `ul == k * 2` holds true, we break out of the loop. However, this condition does not affect the loop itself but rather the loop body.

6. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will become `i = 2`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `ul` is the original value of `ul` plus 2, so it will remain as it was at the end of the previous iteration plus 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` remains unchanged, and `ul` is the original value of `ul` plus 4**.
