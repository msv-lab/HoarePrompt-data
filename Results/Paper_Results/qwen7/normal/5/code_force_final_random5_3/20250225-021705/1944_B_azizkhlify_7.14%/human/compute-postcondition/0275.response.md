Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is `n + 1`
   - `n` must be such that `i` is less than `2 * n`
   - `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `i` in the range `range(n, 2 * n)`.

3. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n + 1`.

4. **Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `2 * n`.
   - Given `i = n + 1`, the condition `n + 1 < 2 * n` must hold true.

5. **Adjusting the State:**
   - Since `i` is currently `n + 1`, the next value of `i` would be `n + 2` (as the loop increments `i` by 1).
   - To ensure the loop continues, `n` must still satisfy the condition `n + 2 < 2 * n`, which simplifies to `n > 2`.

6. **Updating the State:**
   - `i` will be updated to `n + 2`.
   - `r[a[i] - 1]` will be incremented by 1 again, but since `i` is now `n + 2`, we need to consider the new value of `a[i] - 1`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is `n + 2`
- `n` must be such that `i` is less than `2 * n`, which means `n > 2`
- `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1, where `i` is now `n + 2`

So, the final state is:

**State: **`i` is `n + 2`, `n` must be greater than 2, `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1**
