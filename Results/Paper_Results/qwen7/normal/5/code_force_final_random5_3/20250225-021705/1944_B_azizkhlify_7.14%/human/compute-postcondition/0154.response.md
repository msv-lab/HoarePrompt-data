Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 0.
- The element at index `a[i] - 1` in list `l` is equal to 2.

From this, we can deduce the following:

1. Since `i` is 0, `a[i]` is `a[0]`.
2. The element at index `a[0] - 1` in list `l` is 2. This means that `l[a[0] - 1] = 2`.

Therefore, `a[0] - 1` must be the index of 2 in list `l`. Let's denote `a[0]` as `x`. So, `l[x - 1] = 2`.

When the print statement `print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')` is executed, it will print the value of `a[i]` twice, followed by a space (due to the `end=' '` parameter).

Since `i` is 0, `a[i]` is `a[0]`, which is `x`. And we know that `l[x - 1] = 2`, so `x` must be 3 (because `x - 1` is the index of 2 in `l`).

Thus, the print statement will output `3 3`.

Output: **3 3**
