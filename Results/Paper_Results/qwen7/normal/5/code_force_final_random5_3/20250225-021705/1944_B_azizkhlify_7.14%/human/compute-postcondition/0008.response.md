Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer obtained from the first input split, `k` is an integer obtained from the second input split, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the third input split, `l` is a list of n zeros with one element incremented by 1 at index `a[i] - 1`, `r` is a list of n zeros, `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0**.

Explanation: The code increments the value at index `a[i] - 1` in the list `l` by 1. Since `i` was initially 0, after executing the line `l[a[i] - 1] += 1`, `i` is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
