Based on the initial state, `res` must contain at least one element. However, no specific value or type of `res` is provided, and the index `i` is not defined in the initial state. Since the initial state only tells us that `res` contains at least one element, we cannot determine the exact value of `i`.

Given the print statement `print(i, end=' ')`, it will print the value of `i` followed by a space. Since `i` is not defined, we can only say that it will print the value of `i`.

Output: **i (where i is an undefined index)**
