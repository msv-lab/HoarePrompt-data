Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `l[a[i] - 1]` is equal to 2, `ul` is 2**.

Explanation: The variable `ul` is incremented by 2. Since `i` is 0, `a[i]` is `a[0]`. Given that `l[a[i] - 1]` is equal to 2, and `a[i]` is `a[0]`, the value of `l[a[0] - 1]` remains unchanged at 2. The values of `i` and `n` remain the same as they were in the initial state.
