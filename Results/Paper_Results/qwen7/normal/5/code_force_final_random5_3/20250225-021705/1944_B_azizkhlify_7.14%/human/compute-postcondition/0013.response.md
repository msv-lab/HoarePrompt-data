Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` is an integer obtained from the first input split, `k` is an integer obtained from the second input split, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the third input split, `l` is a list of `n` zeros where each element at index `a[i] - 1` has been incremented by 1 for every `i` in the range of `n`, `r` is a list of `n` zeros, `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations executed.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the list `l` will contain `n` elements, each representing how many times the corresponding index (from the list `a`) appears in the list `a`. All other variables (`r`, `re`, `ul`, `ur`, `res`, `i`, `t`, `k`, and `n`) will remain as they were after the last iteration of the loop, with `i` being equal to `n` and `n` being the total number of iterations executed.
