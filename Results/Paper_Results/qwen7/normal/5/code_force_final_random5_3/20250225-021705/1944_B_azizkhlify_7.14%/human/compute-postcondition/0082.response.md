Output State: **`re` is equal to `k` + 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `ul` is `i + 1`, `k` is `2 * k - (i + 1)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it breaks out of the loop or if statement we were inside. The values of the variables `re`, `i`, `ul`, and `k` remain as they were before the `break` statement, and we simply indicate that we have exited the loop or conditional block.
