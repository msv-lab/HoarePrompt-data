Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `res` is an empty list.
   - `i` is equal to `n`.
   - `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n, 2 * n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The loop starts from `i = n` and goes up to `i < 2 * n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to `n`.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will be `n + 1` at the start of the next iteration.

5. **States to Adjust:**
   - The only variable in the loop head that changes with each iteration is `i`.
   - The other variables (`res` and `r[a[i] - 1]`) remain unchanged as long as the condition `ul == ur` is met, and there is no else part to alter them.

6. **Updated State:**
   - `res` remains an empty list.
   - `i` becomes `n + 1`.
   - `r[a[i] - 1]` remains 2.

Therefore, the updated state for the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`res` is an empty list, `i` is `n + 1`, `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2**.
