Postcondition: `i` is 5, `n` must be greater than 4, `res` contains the value of `a[0]` appended with `a[3]` and `a[5]`, `k` and `ul` are set such that the loop can proceed according to the postconditions, `re` is equal to `k + 2`, and if `re` equals `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out.
