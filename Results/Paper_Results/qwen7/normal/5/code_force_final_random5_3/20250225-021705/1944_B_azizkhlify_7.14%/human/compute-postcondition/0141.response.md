Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, the value of `i` will be `2 * n - 1`, and each element in the list `l` will be incremented by 1 for each occurrence of the corresponding index (i.e., `a[i] - 1`) in the list `a`.

This means that the list `l` will contain the count of how many times each index (from `0` to `n-1`) appears in the list `a`. The value of `i` will be `2 * n - 1` because the loop runs `n` times, and `i` starts at `2 * n - 1`.
