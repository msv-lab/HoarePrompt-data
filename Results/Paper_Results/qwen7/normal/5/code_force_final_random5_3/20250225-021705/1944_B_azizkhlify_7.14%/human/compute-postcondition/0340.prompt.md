Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The list `r` will contain counts of how many times each index from the array `a` appears within the range `[n, 2*n)`. Specifically, `r[j]` will hold the count of how many times `a[i]` equals `j+1` for `i` in the range `[n, 2*n)`. The value of `k` is updated to `2 * k - ul`. The variables `res`, `re`, `ul`, and `ur` will remain unchanged from their initial state.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if l[a[i] - 1] == 1:
        print(a[i], end=' ')
        re += 1
        res.append(a[i])
    if re == k:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, the value of `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, `re` is equal to `k`, and `res` contains the element `a[0]`, assuming that the condition `re == k` evaluates to true, otherwise, the same conditions hold as the precondition.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, the value of `l[a[1] - 1]` is unknown, `re` is equal to `k` + 1, and `res` contains the elements `a[0]` and `a[1]`. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition if the condition `re == k` is true.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 0, the value of `l[a[1] - 1]` remains unknown, `re` is equal to `k` + 2, and `res` contains the elements `a[0]`, `a[1]`, and `a[3]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
