Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is simply `_` and the expression `int(input())`. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not affect the state. The key variable here is the input value from `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `int(input())` provides a valid input. Since no specific condition is given for the input value within the loop, we assume it will continue as long as valid input is provided.

3. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `idx` is 23
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\)
   - `n` is the first integer input split from a line of input
   - `k` must be at least 16777216
   - `nums` is a list containing integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\) with `nums[23]` being `k - 2^{23}` and an additional element `k + 1 + nums[23]`, and the element \(1 << idx\) (which is \(2^{23}\)) has been removed from `nums`.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - The only variable that changes with each iteration is the input value from `int(input())`.
   - After the previous iteration, `n` is the value of the input provided.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the next input value must be provided.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `idx` remains 23
- `t` remains a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\)
- `n` becomes the new input value from `int(input())`
- `k` remains at least 16777216
- `nums` remains the same list as before, with the element \(1 << idx\) (which is \(2^{23}\)) still removed.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`idx` is 23, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the new input value from int(input()), `k` must be at least 16777216, `nums` is a list containing integers from 2^0 to 2^23 with nums[23] being k - 2^23 and an additional element k + 1 + nums[23], and the element 1 << idx (which is 2^23) has been removed from nums**
