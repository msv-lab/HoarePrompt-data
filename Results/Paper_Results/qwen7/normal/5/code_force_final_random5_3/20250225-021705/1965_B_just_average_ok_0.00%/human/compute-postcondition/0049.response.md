Output State: `idx` is 4, `k` must be at least 8.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `idx` as long as `k` is greater than or equal to `1 << idx`. After the loop has executed 3 times, `idx` is 3 and `k` must be at least 4. For the fourth iteration, `1 << idx` becomes `1 << 3`, which equals 8. Therefore, for the loop to continue, `k` must be at least 8. Once the loop increments `idx` to 4, it will exit because `k` is no longer greater than or equal to `1 << 4` (which is 16). Thus, after all iterations, `idx` will be 4 and `k` must be at least 8.
