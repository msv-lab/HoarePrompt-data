Output State: `idx` is 25, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the new input integer from `map(int, input().split())`, `k` must be at least \(2^{25}\), `nums` is a list containing integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\) with `nums[23]` being `k - 2^{23}`, and an additional element `k + 1 + nums[23]`, and the element \(1 \ll 23\) (which is \(2^{23}\)) has been removed from `nums`.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `idx` as long as `k` is greater than or equal to \(1 \ll idx\). Starting from `idx = 0`, the loop increments `idx` by 1 each time until `k` is less than \(1 \ll 25\). Since the output state after 3 iterations shows `idx` is 4 and `k` must be at least 8 (\(2^3\)), we can deduce that the loop will continue until `idx` reaches 25 because \(2^{25}\) is the next power of 2 after several increments. At this point, `k` must be at least \(2^{25}\) for the loop to continue executing, but since the loop condition fails when `k < 2^{25}`, the loop terminates with `idx` set to 25.
