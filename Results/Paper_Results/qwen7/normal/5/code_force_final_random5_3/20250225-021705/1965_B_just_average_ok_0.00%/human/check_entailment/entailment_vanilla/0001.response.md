Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it meets the requirements specified in the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - It correctly reads `n` and `k` for each test case.

2. **Generating Sequence:**
   - The program initializes a list `nums` with powers of 2 up to \(2^{23}\):
     ```python
     nums = [1 << i for i in range(24)]
     ```
     This creates a list `[1, 2, 4, 8, ..., 16777216]`.

3. **Adjusting List Based on `k`:**
   - The program finds the index `idx` such that \(2^{\text{idx}}\) is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`:
     ```python
     idx = 0
     while k >= 1 << idx:
         idx += 1
     idx -= 1
     ```
   - It then removes this power of 2 from the list:
     ```python
     nums.remove(1 << idx)
     ```

4. **Adding Elements to Ensure Conditions:**
   - The program appends `k - nums[idx]` to ensure there is no subsequence summing to `k`:
     ```python
     nums.append(k - nums[idx])
     ```
   - It also appends `k + 1` and `k + nums[idx] + 1` to ensure subsequences sum to all values from 1 to `n` except `k`:
     ```python
     nums.append(k + 1)
     nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)
     ```

5. **Output:**
   - The length of the resulting list `nums` is printed, which should be at most 25.
   - The elements of the list `nums` are printed.

### Verification Against Requirements:

1. **No Subsequence Summing to `k`:**
   - By removing \(2^{\text{idx}}\) and appending `k - nums[idx]`, the program ensures that no subsequence sums to `k`.

2. **Subsequences Summing to All Values Except `k`:**
   - The appended elements `k + 1`, `k + nums[idx] + 1`, and the modified list after removing \(2^{\text{idx}}\) ensure that all values from 1 to `n` except `k` can be formed by some subsequence.

3. **List Size Constraint:**
   - The list `nums` is constructed with at most 25 elements.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly generates a sequence that satisfies the conditions specified in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
