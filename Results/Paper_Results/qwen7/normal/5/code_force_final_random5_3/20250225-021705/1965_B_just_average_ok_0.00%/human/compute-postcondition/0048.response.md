Output State: `idx` is 4, `k` must be at least 8.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `idx` as long as `k` is greater than or equal to `1 << idx`. After 3 iterations, `idx` is 3 and `k` must be at least 4. For the next iteration, `idx` will be incremented to 4, and `k` must be at least \(1 << 4 = 16\). However, since we are only asked about the state after all iterations, and the condition `k >= 1 << idx` will no longer hold when `idx` becomes 4 (as `1 << 4 = 16`), the loop will terminate. Therefore, the final value of `idx` will be 4, and `k` must be at least 8 (since the last valid check was `k >= 4`).
