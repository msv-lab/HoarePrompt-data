Output State: The loop will continue to execute as long as there are more test cases provided via `input()`. After all iterations of the loop have finished, `idx` will be equal to the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `k` for the last test case processed. `t` will still be within the range 1 <= t <= 1000, representing the total number of test cases executed. For the last test case, `n` will be the integer input, and `k` will be the largest integer less than or equal to \(2^{idx+1} - 1\). The list `nums` will contain the integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{idx}\) inclusive, with some elements added and removed based on the value of `k`. Specifically, `nums` will include `k - 2^idx`, `k + 1`, `k + 2^idx + 1`, and possibly other elements depending on the exact value of `k`. The element \(1 \ll idx\) (which is \(2^idx\)) will always be removed from `nums`. The final state of `nums` will be printed for each test case, and the process will repeat until all test cases are processed.
