Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, n and k are positive integers satisfying 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n. Additionally, the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 10^7.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    nums = [(1 << i) for i in range(24)]
    idx = 0
    while k >= 1 << idx:
        idx += 1
    idx -= 1
    nums.append(k - nums[idx])
    nums.append(k + 1)
    nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)
    nums.remove(1 << idx)
    print(len(nums))
    print(*nums)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `idx` is 23, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the first integer input split from a line of input, `k` must be at least 16777216, `nums` is a list containing integers from 2^0 to 2^23 with `nums[23]` being `k - 2^23` and an additional element `k + 1 + nums[23]`, and the element `1 << idx` (which is `2^23`) has been removed from `nums`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `idx` is 24, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the new input integer from `map(int, input().split())`, `k` must be at least \(2^{25}\), `nums` is a list containing integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\) with `nums[23]` being `k - 2^{23}`, an additional element `k + 1 + nums[23]`, and the element \(1 \ll 23\) (which is \(2^{23}\)) has been removed from `nums`, and `nums` now contains an additional element `k - nums[24]`, and `nums` now includes the element `k + 1`, and `nums` now includes the element `k + nums[idx] + 1` which is `k + 25`, and the element \(2^{24}\) has been removed from `nums`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `idx` is 3, `k` must be at least 8, `nums` does not contain the element 1 << 3 (which is 8), and the last element of `nums` is k + 4.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
