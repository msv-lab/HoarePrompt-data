Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the first integer input split from a line of input, `k` is the second integer input split from the same line of input, `nums` is a list containing integers from 2^0 to 2^23.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `nums` using a list comprehension where each element is calculated as \(2^i\) for \(i\) ranging from 0 to 23. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state.
