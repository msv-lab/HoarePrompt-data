Output State: **`idx` is 23, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the first integer input split from a line of input, `k` must be at least 16777216, `nums` is a list containing integers from 2^0 to 2^23.**

Explanation: The variable `idx` is decremented by 1, changing its value from 24 to 23. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `nums` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the operation.
