Output State: **`idx` is 23, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the new input integer from `map(int, input().split())`, `k` is the second integer from `map(int, input().split())`, `nums` is a list containing integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\) with `nums[23]` being `k - 2^{23}`, and an additional element `k + 1 + nums[23]`, and the element \(1 \ll idx\) (which is \(2^{23}\)) has been removed from `nums`.**

Explanation: The code `nums = [(1 << i) for i in range(24)]` generates a list of integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\). However, this list overwrites the original `nums` list defined in the initial state. The original definition of `nums` included `nums[23]` being `k - 2^{23}` and an additional element `k + 1 + nums[23]`, and the element \(2^{23}\) was removed. Since the list comprehension replaces the original `nums`, the new `nums` list will contain the integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\) without the element \(2^{23}\), and the elements `nums[23]` and the additional element will be as per the original definition.
