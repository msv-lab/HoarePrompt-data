The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), and two positive integers `n` and `k` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ k ≤ n). For each test case, it calculates a list `nums` containing specific integers derived from `k` and prints the length of `nums` followed by its elements. After processing all test cases, the final state of `nums` reflects the last test case's `k` value and the corresponding `idx` (the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`).
