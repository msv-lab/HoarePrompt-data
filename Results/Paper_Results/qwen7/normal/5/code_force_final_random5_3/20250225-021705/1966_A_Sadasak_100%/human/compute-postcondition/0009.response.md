Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least one element, `num` is the next element in the list, and `frequency_table[num]` is 2.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `frequency_table[num]` to `k`. However, since the value of `k` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact new value of `frequency_table[num]`. The initial state of `arr`, `num`, and `frequency_table[num]` remains unchanged except for the update to `frequency_table[num]` which is now set to `k`.
