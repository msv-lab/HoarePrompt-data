### Reasoning

The original assessment is incorrect for several reasons:

1. **Incorrect Logic in `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` incorrectly caps the frequency of each card to `k` if it exceeds `k`. This does not align with the problem's requirement of performing exchanges to minimize the number of cards. Instead, it should simply count the occurrences of each card without capping.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Frequency Values:**
   - The main program checks if `k` is in the values of the frequency dictionary and prints `k - 1` if true. This is incorrect because the presence of `k` in the values does not mean we can achieve `k - 1` cards. The correct approach is to calculate the number of full groups of `k` cards and the remaining cards.

3. **Incorrect Final Output:**
   - The main program prints `n` if `k` is not in the values of the frequency dictionary. This is also incorrect because it does not consider the possibility of reducing the number of cards further by forming full groups of `k` cards.

### Correct Approach

To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
1. Group the cards by their numbers.
2. For each group, calculate how many full groups of `k` cards can be formed and how many cards will remain.
3. Sum up the remaining cards from all groups to get the minimum number of cards.

### Corrected Program

```python
from collections import defaultdict

t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Group the cards by their numbers
    freq = defaultdict(int)
    for num in nums:
        freq[num] += 1
    
    min_cards = 0
    for count in freq.values():
        # Calculate how many full groups of k cards can be formed
        full_groups = count // k
        # Add the remaining cards after forming full groups
        min_cards += count % k
    
    print(min_cards)
```

### Explanation

1. **Input Handling:**
   - Read the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, read `n` and `k`, and then the list of card numbers `nums`.

2. **Grouping Cards:**
   - Use a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each card number.

3. **Calculating Minimum Cards:**
   - For each group of cards, calculate the number of full groups of `k` cards (`full_groups = count // k`) and add the remaining cards (`count % k`) to `min_cards`.

4. **Output:**
   - Print the total number of remaining cards after performing all possible exchanges.

### Conclusion

The corrected program accurately implements the logic to find the minimum number of cards. Therefore, the original assessment was incorrect.

Final: **False**
