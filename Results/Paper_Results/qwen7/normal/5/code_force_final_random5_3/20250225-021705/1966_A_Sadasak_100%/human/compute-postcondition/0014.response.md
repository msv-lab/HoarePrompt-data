Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least one element, `num` is the next element in the list, and `frequency_table[num]` is k**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `frequency_table[num]` to `k`. Since `k` is not specified, we cannot determine its exact value, but we know it replaces the previous value which was 3. The other variables remain unchanged.
