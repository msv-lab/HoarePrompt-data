You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have a hand of n cards, where each card has a number written on it, and a
fixed integer k . You can perform the following operation any number of times:

  * Choose any k cards from your hand that all have the same number. 
  * Exchange these cards for k-1 cards, each of which can have any number you choose (including the number written on the cards you just exchanged). 

Here is one possible sequence of operations for the first example case, which
has k=3 :

What is the minimum number of cards you can have in your hand at the end of
this process?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le
100 , 2 \le k \le 100 ) — the number of cards you have, and the number of
cards you exchange during each operation, respectively.

The next line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \ldots c_n (1
\le c_i \le 100 ) — the numbers written on your cards.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cards you
can have left in your hand after any number of operations.

Note

The first example case corresponds to the picture above. The sequence of
operations displayed there is optimal, so the answer is 2 .

In the second example case, no operations can be performed, so the answer is 1
.

In the fourth example case, you can repeatedly select 4 cards numbered with 1
and replace them with 3 cards numbered with 1 , until there are 3 cards left.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if k > n:
        print(n)
    else:
        freq = func_1(nums, k)
        if k in freq.values():
            print(k - 1)
        else:
            print(n)

def func_1(arr, k):
    frequency_table = {}
    for num in arr:
        frequency_table[num] = frequency_table.get(num, 0) + 1
        if frequency_table[num] > k:
            frequency_table[num] = k
    return frequency_table



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and an integer `k`. It returns a dictionary `frequency_table` where each key is a unique number from `arr` and the value for each key is the minimum value between the count of that number in `arr` and `k`. If any number appears more than `k` times in `arr`, its count in `frequency_table` will be capped at `k`. All other keys in `frequency_table` will not exist if they were not present in `arr`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and then the list of card numbers `nums`.

2. **Base Case Check:**
   - If `k > n`, the program prints `n`. This is correct because if you cannot form a group of `k` cards, you cannot perform any exchanges, so the minimum number of cards remains `n`.

3. **Frequency Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` is called to calculate the frequency of each card number.
   - However, the logic inside `func_1` does not accurately represent the problem requirements. Specifically, it sets the frequency of any card number to `k` if it exceeds `k`, which is not necessary and does not help in finding the minimum number of cards.

4. **Finding Minimum Cards:**
   - After calculating the frequencies, the program checks if `k` is present in the values of the frequency dictionary.
     - If `k` is present, it prints `k - 1`. This is incorrect because the presence of `k` in the frequency values does not guarantee that we can achieve `k - 1` cards.
     - If `k` is not present, it prints `n`. This is also incorrect because it does not consider the possibility of reducing the number of cards further.

### Correct Approach

To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
1. Group the cards by their numbers.
2. For each group, calculate how many full groups of `k` cards can be formed and how many cards will remain.
3. Sum up the remaining cards from all groups to get the minimum number of cards.

### Corrected Program

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Group the cards by their numbers
    from collections import defaultdict
    freq = defaultdict(int)
    for num in nums:
        freq[num] += 1
    
    min_cards = 0
    for count in freq.values():
        # Calculate how many full groups of k cards can be formed
        full_groups = count // k
        # Add the remaining cards after forming full groups
        min_cards += count % k
    
    print(min_cards)
```

### Conclusion

The given program is incorrect because it does not properly handle the logic to find the minimum number of cards. Therefore, the final answer is:

Correctness: **False**
