### Reasoning

Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and then the list of card numbers `nums`.

2. **Base Case Check:**
   - If `k > n`, the program prints `n`. This is correct because if you cannot form a group of `k` cards, you cannot perform any exchanges, so the minimum number of cards remains `n`.

3. **Frequency Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` is called to calculate the frequency of each card number.
   - However, the logic inside `func_1` does not accurately represent the problem requirements. Specifically, it sets the frequency of any card number to `k` if it exceeds `k`, which is not necessary and does not help in finding the minimum number of cards.

4. **Finding Minimum Cards:**
   - After calculating the frequencies, the program checks if `k` is present in the values of the frequency dictionary.
     - If `k` is present, it prints `k - 1`. This is incorrect because the presence of `k` in the frequency values does not guarantee that we can achieve `k - 1` cards.
     - If `k` is not present, it prints `n`. This is also incorrect because it does not consider the possibility of reducing the number of cards further.

#### Correct Approach

To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
1. Group the cards by their numbers.
2. For each group, calculate how many full groups of `k` cards can be formed and how many cards will remain.
3. Sum up the remaining cards from all groups to get the minimum number of cards.

#### Corrected Program

```python
from collections import defaultdict

t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Group the cards by their numbers
    freq = defaultdict(int)
    for num in nums:
        freq[num] += 1
    
    min_cards = 0
    for count in freq.values():
        # Calculate how many full groups of k cards can be formed
        full_groups = count // k
        # Add the remaining cards after forming full groups
        min_cards += count % k
    
    print(min_cards)
```

### Conclusion

The given program is incorrect because it does not properly handle the logic to find the minimum number of cards. Therefore, the final answer is:

**Final: False**

The original assessment was inaccurate because the provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The corrected approach involves grouping the cards by their numbers and calculating the remaining cards after forming as many full groups of `k` cards as possible.
