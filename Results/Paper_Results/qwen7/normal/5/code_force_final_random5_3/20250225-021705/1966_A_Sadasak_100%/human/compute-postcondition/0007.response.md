Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given code are `num` and `arr`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element in the list `arr`. The variable `num` takes the value of each element in `arr` during each iteration.

3. **Determine the state changes**: 
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `arr` is a list of integers with at least one element, `num` is the first element of `arr`, and `frequency_table[num]` remains 1.
   - If `frequency_table[num]` is greater than `k`, it remains unchanged.
   - If `frequency_table[num]` is not greater than `k`, it remains 1.

4. **Next iteration analysis**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `arr` must still contain at least one element.
   - `num` will be the next element in the list `arr`.
   - `frequency_table[num]` will remain 1 if it was not greater than `k` in the previous iteration.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `arr` must still contain at least one element for the loop to continue, and `num` will be the next element in the list, `arr` will have at least one element left.
   - `num` will be the next element in the list `arr`.
   - `frequency_table[num]` will remain 1 because the condition to change it (i.e., `frequency_table[num] > k`) was not met in the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least one element, `num` is the next element in the list, and `frequency_table[num]` remains 1**.
