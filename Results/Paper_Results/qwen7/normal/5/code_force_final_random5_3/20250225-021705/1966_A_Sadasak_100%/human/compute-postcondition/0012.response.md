Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `num` and `arr`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each element in the list `arr`.

3. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `arr` is a list of integers with at least one element.
   - `num` is the next element in the list.
   - `frequency_table[num]` is 2.

4. **Loop Body Effect**: The loop body is omitted, but based on the postcondition, if `frequency_table[num]` is greater than `k`, the function does not change the list or the frequency table. This means that the loop will continue to the next element in `arr` as long as `frequency_table[num]` is not greater than `k`.

5. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `num` is the next element in the list, it means that the current element has been processed.
   - The next element in the list `arr` will be the one after `num`.
   - `frequency_table[num]` is 2, so the condition `frequency_table[num] > k` is not met (assuming `k` is less than or equal to 2), and the list and frequency table remain unchanged.

6. **Adjust the States**:
   - `arr` remains the same because no elements are removed from the list.
   - `num` becomes the next element in the list `arr`.
   - `frequency_table[num]` remains 2 because the condition was not met.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least one element, `num` is the next element in the list, and `frequency_table[num]` is 2**.
