Output State: **`T` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), `S` is an input integer, `N` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input on spaces and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of input using `input()`, splits it into a list of strings using `.split()`, and then converts each string in the list to an integer using `map(int, ...)`. This results in the list `N` containing integers. The values of `T` and `S` remain unchanged from their initial state.
