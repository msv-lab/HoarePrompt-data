Output State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `M` is an empty dictionary, `cnt` contains all keys from the original dictionary `M` where the value was 1, `cur` is -1, and `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces.**

The code initializes an empty dictionary `M`. This operation does not affect the values of `T`, `cnt`, `cur`, or `N`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
