Reasoning:
1. The provided program does not correctly simulate the game rules.
2. The program does not handle the turns of Alice and Bob appropriately.
3. The logic for determining the MEX of the array `c` is flawed.
4. The program does not account for the optimal strategies of both players.

Specifically:
- The program sorts the list `N` and then tries to count occurrences of each unique number, which is not aligned with the game rules.
- It does not alternate between Alice and Bob's turns as specified.
- It does not construct the array `c` as per the game rules.
- It does not calculate the MEX of `c` after the game ends.
- The logic for selecting the final MEX value is not based on the optimal strategies of both players.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the game logic and therefore cannot produce the correct output for the given problem.

Correctness: **False**
