Output State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `M` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `N` and the value is the count of how many times that integer appears consecutively in `N`, `cnt` is an empty list, `cur` is the last integer processed in the list `N`, and `N` is an empty list since all elements have been processed. Additionally, if the sum of all values in the dictionary `M` equals `S`, then `cur` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The line `cnt = []` initializes `cnt` as an empty list. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
