Output State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `M` is empty, `cnt` contains all keys from the original dictionary `M` where the value was 1, and `cur` is equal to the second element in the list `cnt` if the length of `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2; `N` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `N = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in the list `N`. The initial conditions for `T`, `M`, `cnt`, and `cur` remain unchanged.
