Output State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `M` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where the key is either `cur` or `num` and the value is 1, `cnt` contains all keys from the original dictionary `M` where the value was 1, `cur` is `num` if `num > cur` else `cur` is -1, `cur` is `cur` + 1.**

Explanation: The variable `cur` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state. Therefore, `cur` now holds the value of its previous value plus 1. All other conditions and values of the variables remain as per the initial state.
