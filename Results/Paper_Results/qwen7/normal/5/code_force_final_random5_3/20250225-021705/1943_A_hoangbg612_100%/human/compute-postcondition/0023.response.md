Postcondition: `cur` is an index in the list `N`. If `num > cur + 1`, then `cur` is increased by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Additionally, `M[cur-1]` is incremented by 1 if `num > cur-1` or `num <= cur`, and `N` must contain at least one element, with `num` being the next element in `N`. If the condition `num > cur + 1` is not met, no changes are made to `cur` and the postcondition remains as initially described.
