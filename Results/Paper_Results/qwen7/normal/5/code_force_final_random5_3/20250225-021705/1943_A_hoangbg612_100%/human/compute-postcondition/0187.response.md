Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t`, another positive integer `n`, and a list `a` of `n` non-negative integers. For each test case, it sorts the list `a`, counts the occurrences of each unique number, and identifies numbers that appear exactly once. If there are at least two such numbers, it selects the second smallest one; otherwise, it selects -1. Finally, it prints the selected number for each test case and sets the variable `T` to 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed.**
