Output State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `M` is an empty dictionary, `cnt` contains all keys from the original dictionary `M` where the value was 1, `cur` is 0, and `N` is a non-empty list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The value of `cur` is incremented by 1, changing its value from -1 to 0. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
