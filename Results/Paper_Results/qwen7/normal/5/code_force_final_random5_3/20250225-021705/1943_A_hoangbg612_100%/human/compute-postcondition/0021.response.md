Output State: **`cur` is increased by 1, `M[cur-1]` is incremented by 1 if `num > cur-1` or `num <= cur`, if `num > cur` then `cur` is increased by 1, `N` must contain at least one element, and `num` will be the next element in `N`.**

Explanation: The code `cur += 1` increments the value of `cur` by 1. The conditions for incrementing `M[cur]` and the behavior of `cur` based on the comparison with `num` remain unchanged, but since `cur` has been incremented, the condition now checks against `cur-1`. The other preconditions and the value of `num` as the next element in `N` also remain valid.
