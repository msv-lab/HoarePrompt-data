Postcondition: **Output State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the dictionary `M` will no longer contain any keys with a value of 1 in the `M` dictionary, and the list `cnt` will contain all the keys from the dictionary `M` that satisfied the condition `M[k] == 1` during the loop's execution. Additionally, the length of the list `cnt` is at least 2.**
