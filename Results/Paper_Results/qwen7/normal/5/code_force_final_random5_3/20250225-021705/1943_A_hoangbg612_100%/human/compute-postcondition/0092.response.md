Output State: **`N` is a list containing all elements except the one that was just processed (which is `num`), `cur` is the next element in this updated list `N`, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1, and if `num` (the next element in `N`) is greater than `cur + 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken; otherwise, `num` is less than or equal to the current maximum element in the list `N`; `cur` is increased by 1.**

This means that the value of `cur` has been incremented by 1, while the conditions and states of the other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state description.
