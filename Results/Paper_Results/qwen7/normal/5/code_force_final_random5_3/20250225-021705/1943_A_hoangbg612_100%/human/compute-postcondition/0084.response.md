Output State: **`N` is a non-empty list, `cur` is the next element in the list `N` incremented by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it breaks out of the loop or if statement that was checking whether `num` (the next element in `N`) is greater than `cur + 1`. The values of `N`, `cur`, and `M[cur]` remain unchanged from their initial states because the `break` statement does not modify them.
