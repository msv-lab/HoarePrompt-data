Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game rules and logic. Specifically, the program does not account for the fact that Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from the array `a`, and it does not properly simulate the game to determine the MEX of the array `c` after both players have played optimally.

Here is a potential case where the program does not work correctly:

Consider the input:
```
3
4
0 0 1 1
```

According to the problem description, the optimal play would result in the final array `c` having a MEX of 2. However, the program's logic does not reflect this. Instead, it sorts the array and attempts to build a dictionary `M` to track the counts of each number, which is not aligned with the game's rules. The program does not simulate the turns taken by Alice and Bob and does not correctly compute the MEX of the final array `c`.

A correct solution would involve simulating the game turns and ensuring that the MEX is calculated based on the optimal strategy for both players. The given program does not achieve this.
