Output State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the dictionary `M` will no longer contain any keys with a value of 1 in `M`. The list `cnt` will contain all the keys from the dictionary `M` that satisfied the condition `M[k] == 1` during the loop's execution.

In this final state, `M` will be an empty dictionary since all keys that had a value of 1 have been processed and removed. The list `cnt` will hold all the keys that met the condition `M[k] == 1` throughout the loop's iterations.
