Output State: **`cur` is now equal to `num`, `M[cur-1]` is incremented by 1 if `num > cur-1` or `num <= cur`, and if `num > cur + 1`, then `cur` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `cur = num` assigns the value of `num` to `cur`. The conditions for incrementing `M[cur-1]` and increasing `cur` by 1 remain unchanged and depend on the values of `num` and `cur`, which are now the same. The initial conditions about `M[cur-1]` and the behavior of `cur` based on the value of `num` are preserved.
