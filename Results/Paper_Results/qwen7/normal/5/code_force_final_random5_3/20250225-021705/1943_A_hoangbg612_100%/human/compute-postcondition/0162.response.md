Output State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `M` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `N` and the value is the count of how many times that integer appears consecutively in `N`, `cnt` contains all keys from the original dictionary `M` where the value was 1, `cur` is incremented by 1, `cur` is the last integer processed in the list `N`, and `N` is an empty list since all elements have been processed. The sum of all values in the dictionary `M` equals `S`.**

In this output state, the variable `cur` has been incremented by 1. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
