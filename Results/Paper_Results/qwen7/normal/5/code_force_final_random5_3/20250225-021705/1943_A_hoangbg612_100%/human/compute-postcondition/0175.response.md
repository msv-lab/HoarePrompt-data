Output State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `M` is a dictionary with at least one key remaining, `cnt` is a list containing the next key `k` appended, `cur` is the last integer processed in the list `N`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `cnt.append(k)` appends the key `k` to the list `cnt`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `T` must still be greater than 0, `M` is still a dictionary with at least one key remaining, `cnt` now contains the next key `k` appended, and `cur` is still the last integer processed in the list `N`, which remains empty since all elements have been processed.
