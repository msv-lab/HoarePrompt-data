Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the `range(int(input()))`. This means the loop will run for as many times as the user inputs an integer.

2. **Determine the State Adjustments**:
   - The loop will run again if the user inputs a positive integer (since `int(input())` will provide the number of iterations).
   - The variables involved in the loop head are the input itself and the loop counter, but since the loop counter is automatically managed by the `range` function, we don't need to adjust it explicitly.
   - The only variable that changes based on the loop is the postcondition related to `t`, which represents the number of test cases.

3. **Adjust the States**:
   - After each iteration, `t` decreases by 1 because each iteration processes one test case.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `t` is now one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration, and `t` must still be a positive integer.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer representing the number of remaining test cases, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers split from the input, `k` is the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, then `k` is the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`. If `b` is greater than `a`, then `k` is still the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`.**
