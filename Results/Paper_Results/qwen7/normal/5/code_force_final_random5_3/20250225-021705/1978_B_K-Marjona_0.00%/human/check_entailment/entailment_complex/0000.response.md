Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all buns under the given promotion rules.
2. The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.
   - It iterates over the number of test cases (`t`).
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.
   - It calculates `k` as the minimum of `n` and `b - a`, which is the optimal number of buns to sell at the modified price.
   - If `b <= a`, it prints `a * n` (all buns sold at the usual price).
   - Otherwise, it uses the formula `(b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a` to calculate the total profit, which accounts for the modified price for the first `k` buns and the usual price for the remaining buns.
3. The logic in the program matches the problem description and the provided examples.
4. The program handles all edge cases, including when `b <= a` and when `k` is very large (up to `10^9`).

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
