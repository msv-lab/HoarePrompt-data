Output State: **`t` is a positive integer representing the number of remaining test cases, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, and k is the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`.**

Explanation: The code `n, a, b = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `n`, `a`, and `b` respectively. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. The value of `k` is determined based on the condition that if `b` is less than or equal to `a`, then `k` is the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`. Otherwise, `k` is still the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`. However, since the exact values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are not specified, we keep `k` as the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`.
