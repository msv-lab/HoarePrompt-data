Output State: **`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers split from the input.**

Explanation: The code `n, a, b = map(int, input().split())` reads three space-separated integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. Therefore, `t` is still a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and `n`, `a`, and `b` are the integers split from the input.
