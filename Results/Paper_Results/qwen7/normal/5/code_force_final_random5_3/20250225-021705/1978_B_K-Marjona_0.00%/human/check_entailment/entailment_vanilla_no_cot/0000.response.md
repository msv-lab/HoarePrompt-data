Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all the buns under the given promotion rules. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Variable Initialization**: For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` and initializes `k` as the minimum between `n` and `b - a`. This ensures that `k` is chosen such that the modified price is less than or equal to the usual price `a`.
3. **Condition Check**: 
   - If `b <= a`, it means the modified price is not beneficial, so Bob should sell all buns at the usual price `a`. The profit is then calculated as `a * n`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the profit by summing up the revenue from the first `k` buns sold at the modified prices and the remaining `(n - k)` buns sold at the usual price `a`.

The formula used for calculating the profit when `b > a`:
- The sum of an arithmetic series for the first `k` buns: \((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k\).
- The profit from the remaining `(n - k)` buns: \((n - k) * a\).

This approach ensures that the program correctly computes the maximum possible profit for any given test case, adhering to the problem constraints and requirements.
