Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes t test cases, where each test case includes three positive integers n, a, and b. It returns different outputs based on the values of n, a, and b for each test case.**

Given the constraints and the nature of the provided code snippet, the function likely iterates over a specified number of test cases (t) and performs some operation on the integers n, a, and b within each test case. However, since the exact operations are not provided, the focus here is on the structure and input/output behavior.
