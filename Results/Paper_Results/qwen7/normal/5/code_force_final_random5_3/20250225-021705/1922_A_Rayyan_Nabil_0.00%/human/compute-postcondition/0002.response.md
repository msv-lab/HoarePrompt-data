Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the value `t` (which is used as the upper bound for the range function).

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` being 0 because `range(t)` generates values from 0 to `t-1`.

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i < t`. Therefore, `t` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

4. **Adjust the States**: We need to ensure that the initial state of `i` is 0 and that `t` is greater than 0.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer.
- `a` is a string of length `n`.
- `b` is a string of length `n`.
- `c` is a string of length `n`.
- `l` is 'YES'.

We only need to adjust the states of `i` and `t` since they are the only variables in the loop head.

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0**
