Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` and `c` are lists of integers with the same length, the first element of `a` is not equal to the first element of `c`, and the first element of `b` is not equal to the first element of `c`, and `l` is 'YES'**.

The code `l = 'YES'` does not change any variable's value except for `l`, which is explicitly set to 'YES'. All other variables retain their initial states.
