Output State: `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is the input string, `b` is the new input string, `c` is the input from the user, `l` is 'NO'.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will reach the value of `n`, as the loop increments `i` in each iteration. The loop sets `l` to 'YES' only if the condition `a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]` is met for any `i` in the range of `n`. If the condition is never met throughout all iterations, `l` remains 'NO'. Given that the loop has executed all iterations without setting `l` to 'YES', the final state of `l` is 'NO'.
