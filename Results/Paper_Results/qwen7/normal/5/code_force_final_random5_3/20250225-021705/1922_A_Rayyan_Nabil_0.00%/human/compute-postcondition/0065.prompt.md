Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer, `a` is a string of length `n`, `b` is a string of length `n`, `c` is a string of length `n`, `l` is 'YES'
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    c = input()
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
            l = 'YES'
    else:
        l = 'NO'
    print(l)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` and `c` are lists of integers with the same length, the first element of `a` is not equal to the first element of `c`, the first element of `b` is not equal to the first element of `c`, and `l` is 'YES'. If `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` for all iterations, `l` remains 'YES'. If any iteration does not meet the condition (`a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`), then `l` would be set to 'NO'. Since the loop completes all iterations without breaking, `l` remains 'YES' if the condition holds true for all elements.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is the input string, `b` is the new input string, `c` is the input from the user, `l` is 'NO'.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations (from `i=0` to `i=n-1`), the variable `i` will be equal to `n`. The loop sets `l` to 'YES' only if both `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]` are true for any index `i` within the range of `n`. If none of the conditions `a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]` are met for any `i` from `0` to `n-1`, then `l` remains 'NO'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `i` is `n`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new input string, `b` is the new input from the user, `c` is the input from the user, `l` is 'YES'.

In Natural Language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n` (since the loop runs from `0` to `n-1` and increments `i` each time), and the variable `l` will be 'YES' if for every index `i` in the range `0` to `n-1`, either `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`. If there exists any index where both conditions are false (`a[i] == c[i]` and `b[i] == c[i]`), then `l` remains 'NO'. All other variables (`n`, `a`, `b`, `c`) retain their values from the initial state.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
