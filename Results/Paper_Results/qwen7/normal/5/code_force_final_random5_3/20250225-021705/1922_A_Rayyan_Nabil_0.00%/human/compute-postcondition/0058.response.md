Output State: **`i` is 2; `n` must be greater than 0; `l` is 'YES'**

The code assigns the string `'YES'` to the variable `l`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `l` and retains the conditions on `i` and `n`.
