Postcondition: **`tests` must be greater than 0 and `i` must be 0; `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string from user, `c` is an input string; `no` is False. `counter` equals the length of string `c`, indicating that every character in `c` was checked against `a` and `b`. The string `c` is now empty, having been fully processed character by character.**
