Output State: **`counter` is incremented by 1; `c` is a non-empty string that is one character shorter than it was at the end of the previous iteration; `no` is False.**

Explanation: The code `counter += 1` increments the value of `counter` by 1. The values of `c` and `no` remain unchanged from their previous states. Therefore, `c` remains a non-empty string that is one character shorter than it was at the end of the previous iteration, and `no` remains False.
