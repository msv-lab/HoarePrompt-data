Output State: **`tests` must be greater than 0 and `i` must be 0; `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string from user, `c` is an input string**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of the user's input to the variable `c`. The values of `tests`, `i`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial state.
