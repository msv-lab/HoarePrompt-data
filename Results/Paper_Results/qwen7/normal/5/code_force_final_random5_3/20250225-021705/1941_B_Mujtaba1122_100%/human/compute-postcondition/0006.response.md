Output State: **`i` is 1; `list[0]` must be greater than 0; `list[1]` is 0; `list[2]` must be greater than 0; `list[3]` is `list[2] - 1`.**

Explanation: The code updates `list[i + 1]` (which is `list[2]`) by subtracting `1 * list[i - 1]` (which is `list[0]`). So, `list[2]` becomes `list[2] - list[0]`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
