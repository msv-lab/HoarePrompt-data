Output State: All elements in the list except `list[i+2]` are now 0, and `list[i+2]` is now 0, `list[i]` is now 0, `list[i - 1]` is now 0, `list[i + 1]` is now 0.

Explanation: After each iteration of the loop, the value of `list[i - 1]` is reduced by itself (`-1 * list[i - 1]`), making it zero after the first iteration. Then, `list[i]` is reduced by twice the original value of `list[i - 1]`, which also becomes zero after the first iteration because `list[i - 1]` is zero. Finally, `list[i + 1]` is reduced by the value of `list[i - 1]`, which again becomes zero after the first iteration. Since the conditions `list[i] > 1`, `list[i - 1] > 0`, and `list[i + 1] > 0` are no longer satisfied after the first iteration, the loop terminates. Therefore, all elements in the list except `list[i+2]` will be 0, and `list[i+2]` remains unchanged as per the initial state.
