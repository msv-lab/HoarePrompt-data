Output State: **`i` is 1; `list[0]` must be greater than 0; `list[1]` is decreased by `list[0]`; `list[2]` must be greater than 0**

Explanation: The code updates `list[i + 1]` (which is `list[1 + 1]` or `list[2]`) by subtracting `1 * list[i - 1]` (which is `1 * list[0]` or `list[0]`). So, `list[2]` is decreased by the value of `list[0]`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
