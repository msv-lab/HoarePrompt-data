### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the annotated version to validate the original assessment.

#### Function `func_1`:
- This function checks if all elements in the list are zero.
- It iterates through the list and returns `False` if any element is non-zero.
- If all elements are zero, it returns `True`.

#### Function `func_2`:
- This function attempts to reduce the array to all zeros using the specified operations.
- It iterates through the array from index 1 to n-2 (inclusive).
- For each index `i`, it checks if `list[i] > 1` and both `list[i-1] > 0` and `list[i+1] > 0`.
- If these conditions are met, it performs the specified operations:
  - `list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`
  - `list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]`
  - `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`
- If `list[i - 1]` is not zero after the operations, it prints "NO" and returns.
- After processing the array, it calls `func_1` to check if all elements are zero.
- If `func_1` returns `True`, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

#### Annotated Code Analysis:
- The annotated code correctly describes the behavior of `func_2`.
- It explains how the operations modify the array and the final state of the array.
- The key points are:
  - The operations reduce the array elements based on the specified rules.
  - The final state of the array will have all elements zero if the operations can be applied correctly.
  - If any element remains non-zero, the function prints "NO".

#### Original Assessment:
- The original assessment states that the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.
- It specifically mentions that the function `func_2` does not handle the case where the array cannot be made entirely zero.

#### Evaluation:
- The annotated code and the original assessment align well.
- The function `func_2` indeed checks if the array can be reduced to all zeros by performing the specified operations.
- If the array cannot be reduced to all zeros, it prints "NO".
- The function `func_1` is used to verify if the array is completely zero after the operations.

Given the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the array can be made entirely zero using the specified operations.

### Final:
**True**
