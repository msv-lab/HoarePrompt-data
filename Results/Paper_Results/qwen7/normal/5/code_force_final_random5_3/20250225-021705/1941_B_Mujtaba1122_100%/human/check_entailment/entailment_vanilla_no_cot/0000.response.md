Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic to determine if all elements of the array can be made zero using the specified operations. Here's why:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function checks if all elements in the array are zero, which is part of the final check but not the primary logic.
2. **Function `func_2`**: This function attempts to reduce the array elements according to the given operations. However, there are several issues with the logic:
   - The inner loop should only execute if the current element `list[i]` is greater than 1, and the adjacent elements `list[i-1]` and `list[i+1]` are also non-zero.
   - The reduction logic `list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]; list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]; list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` is incorrect because it doesn't follow the exact operation rules provided (it should be `a_{i-1} = a_{i-1} - 1`, `a_i = a_i - 2`, `a_{i+1} = a_{i+1} - 1`).
   - The function prints 'no' and returns immediately when it encounters a non-zero element during the operation, which is too early and may miss valid reductions.
   - The final check using `func_1` is redundant and unnecessary since the function already prints the result.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, we need to ensure that the total sum of the array is even (since each operation reduces the sum by 3). Additionally, we need to ensure that the smallest element in the array can be reduced to zero without violating the conditions.

Here's a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def can_make_zero(t):
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Check if the sum of the array is divisible by 3
        if sum(arr) % 3 != 0:
            print("NO")
            continue
        
        # Check if the smallest element can be reduced to zero
        min_val = min(arr)
        if min_val < 0 or (sum(arr) // 3) % min_val != 0:
            print("NO")
            continue
        
        print("YES")

# Example usage
t = int(input())
can_make_zero(t)
```

This approach ensures that the operations can be applied correctly and checks the necessary conditions to determine if the array can be made zero.
