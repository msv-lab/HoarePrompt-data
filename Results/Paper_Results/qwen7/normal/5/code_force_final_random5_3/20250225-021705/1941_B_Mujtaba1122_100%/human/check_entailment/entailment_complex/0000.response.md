### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if all elements in the list are zero.
   - It iterates through the list and returns `False` as soon as it finds a non-zero element.
   - If the loop completes without finding any non-zero elements, it returns `True`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function attempts to reduce the elements of the list using the specified operations.
   - It iterates through the list from index 1 to n-2.
   - For each index `i`, it checks if `list[i] > 1` and both `list[i-1] > 0` and `list[i+1] > 0`.
   - If these conditions are met, it performs the specified operations: subtracting `2 * list[i-1]` from `list[i]`, subtracting `list[i-1]` from `list[i+1]`, and subtracting `list[i-1]` from `list[i-1]`.
   - This process continues until the conditions are no longer met.
   - After processing, the function calls `func_1` to check if all elements are zero.
   - If `func_1` returns `True`, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

3. **Overall Program Logic**:
   - The program processes each test case by calling `func_2` and then `func_1`.
   - `func_2` attempts to reduce the list to all zeros using the specified operations.
   - `func_1` confirms if the list is indeed all zeros.

Given the problem constraints and the logic of the functions:
- `func_2` correctly applies the operations to reduce the list.
- `func_1` correctly checks if the list is all zeros.
- The overall logic of the program is consistent with the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to make all elements of the array zero using the specified operations.

**Correctness: **True**
