### Reasoning

The original assessment concluded that the program is incorrect because the logic of the operations performed in `func_2` does not always lead to the desired result of making all elements zero. Let's re-evaluate the program based on the provided function summaries and the problem description.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly checks if all elements in the list are zero.
   - It iterates through the list and returns `False` as soon as it finds an element that is not zero.
   - If all elements are zero, it returns `True`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` processes the list by repeatedly modifying its elements based on specific conditions.
   - According to the function summary, after processing, the list becomes a series of zeros, with the exception that the last non-zero element (either `list[0]` or `list[n-1]`) will be -4 * (n-1) if it was initially set to a non-zero value.
   - The function prints 'YES' if `func_1(list, n)` returns `True`, otherwise it prints 'NO'.
   - Based on the function summary, `func_2` should correctly determine if it is possible to make all elements of the array zero using the specified operations.

Given the function summary, the logic of `func_2` seems to be correct. The function summary indicates that the operations performed in `func_2` will eventually reduce the array to all zeros if it is possible, and it correctly identifies when it is not possible by checking the last non-zero element.

### Re-evaluation

- **Correctness of `func_2`**:
  - The function summary states that after processing, the list will be reduced to all zeros if it is possible, and the last non-zero element will be -4 * (n-1) if it was initially set to a non-zero value.
  - This aligns with the problem description and the operations defined.
  - The function correctly handles the edge cases where it is not possible to make all elements zero.

### Conclusion

Based on the function summary, the program correctly determines whether it is possible to make all elements of the array zero using the specified operations.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **True**

The given program is correct according to the provided function summaries and the problem description.
