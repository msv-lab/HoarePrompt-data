The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `t`, which is an integer representing the current time (step) in the game. It also accepts a parameter `player`, which is a dictionary where keys are player identifiers (format: R0, R1, ..., B0, B1, ...) and values are the current positions of the players (format: [x, y]). Additionally, it accepts a parameter `blud`, which is a list of positions where the Bludger is currently located.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the current time in the game, a dictionary `player` mapping player identifiers to their positions, and a list `blud` of Bludger positions. It does not return any value explicitly mentioned in the given information.**
