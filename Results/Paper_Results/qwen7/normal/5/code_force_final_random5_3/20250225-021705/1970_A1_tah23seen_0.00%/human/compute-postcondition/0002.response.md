Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", representing a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is an empty string; `d` is an empty dictionary.**

The code initializes an empty dictionary `d`. This does not affect the values of `s`, `n`, or `ans`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
