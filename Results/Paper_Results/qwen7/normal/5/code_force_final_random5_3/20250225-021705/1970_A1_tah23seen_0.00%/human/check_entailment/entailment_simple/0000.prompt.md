Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
A parentheses sequence is a string consisting of characters "(" and ")", for
example "(()((".

A balanced parentheses sequence is a parentheses sequence which can become a
valid mathematical expression after inserting numbers and operations into it,
for example "(()(()))".

The balance of a parentheses sequence is defined as the number of opening
parentheses "(" minus the number of closing parentheses ")". For example, the
balance of the sequence "(()((" is 3.

A balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence
with balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.

We define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and
returns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the
input sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before
that character and write those down in a table together with the positions of
the characters in the input sequence, for example:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
  
Then, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,
breaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
  
The last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case
"()(()())". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced
shuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle
of the input sequence.

You are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Print its balanced shuffle.

Input

The only line of input contains a string s consisting only of characters "("
and ")". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses
sequence with its length not exceeding 500\,000 .

Output

Print the parentheses sequence t â€” the balanced shuffle of s .

Example

Input

    (()(()))
    
Output

    ()(()())

# Annotated Program:
n = input()
print(func_1(n))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", representing a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
        
    #State: The dictionary `d` will contain keys from 1 to `n` (the length of `s`), and each key `i` will have a value equal to the balance of parentheses up to position `i-1`. The variable `i` will be equal to `n`, the last index processed in the loop. The string `s` remains unchanged, and `ans` remains an empty string.
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i]
        
    #State: Output State: The dictionary `d` is empty; `i` is `n-1`; `ans` is the original string `s`.
    #
    #Explanation: Since the loop continues as long as there are items in the dictionary `d`, and we know from the output state after 3 iterations that `d` must have at least one item initially, after all iterations, the dictionary `d` will be empty because the loop has processed all its items. The variable `i` starts at `n-1` and gets decremented with each iteration but does not go below 0 (since it's an index), so after all iterations, `i` remains `n-1`. The variable `ans` accumulates the string `s` character by character during each iteration, so by the end of all iterations, `ans` will be the entire string `s`.
    return ans
    #The program returns the original string `s`
