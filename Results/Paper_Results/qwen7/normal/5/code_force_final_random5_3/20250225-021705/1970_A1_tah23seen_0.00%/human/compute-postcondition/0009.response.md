Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(", ")", `n` is the length of `s`, `ans` is an empty string, `d` is a dictionary with one key-value pair `{1: -1}`, `i` is 1**

Explanation: The code updates the dictionary `d` by setting `d[i + 1]` to `d[i] - 1`. Given that `i` is initially 1 and `d[1]` is 0 (from the initial state), `d[2]` is set to `0 - 1`, which is `-1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
