Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", representing a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`.**

Explanation: The code `n = len(s)` calculates the length of the string `s` and assigns it to the variable `n`. The string `s` remains unchanged and still consists only of characters "(" and ")" forming a balanced parentheses sequence. The length of `s` is stored in `n`.
