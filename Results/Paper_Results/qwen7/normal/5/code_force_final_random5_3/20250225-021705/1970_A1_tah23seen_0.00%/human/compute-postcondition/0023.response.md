Output State: **The dictionary `d` no longer contains the key `n`, the variable `i` is equal to `n-1`, the string `s` remains unchanged, and `ans` remains an empty string.**

Explanation: The code `d.pop(n)` removes the key `n` from the dictionary `d`. Since `i` was equal to `n` before the pop operation, after the operation, `i` becomes `n-1`. The string `s` and the empty string `ans` remain unchanged.
