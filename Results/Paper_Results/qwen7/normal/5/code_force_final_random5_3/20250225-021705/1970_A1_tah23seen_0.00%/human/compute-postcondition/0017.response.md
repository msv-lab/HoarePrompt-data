Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(len(s)):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `len(s)`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states hold:
   - `s` is a string consisting only of characters "(", ")"
   - `n` is the length of `s`
   - `ans` is an empty string
   - `d` is a dictionary with one key-value pair {1: 2} if `s[1]` is "(", otherwise `{1: 0}`
   - `i` is 3

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < len(s)`. Since `i` is currently 3, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 4 and `len(s)` should remain the same.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so it becomes 4.
   - `len(s)` remains unchanged, so it still equals `n`.

5. **Formulate the new state**: Based on the above adjustments, the new state at the start of the next iteration should be:
   - `s` is a string consisting only of characters "(", ")"
   - `n` is the length of `s`
   - `ans` is an empty string
   - `d` is a dictionary with one key-value pair {1: 2} if `s[1]` is "(", otherwise `{1: 0}`
   - `i` is 4

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(", ")", `n` is the length of `s`, `ans` is an empty string, `d` is a dictionary with one key-value pair {1: 2} if `s[1]` is "(", otherwise `{1: 0}`, `i` is 4**
