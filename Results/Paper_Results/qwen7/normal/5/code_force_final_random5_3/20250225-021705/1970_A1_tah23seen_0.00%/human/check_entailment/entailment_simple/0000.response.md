Reasoning:
1. The provided code defines a function `func_1` that aims to perform the balanced shuffle operation on a given balanced parentheses sequence.
2. The function correctly computes the balance of the sequence at each position and stores these balances in a dictionary `d`.
3. After sorting the dictionary based on the balance values while maintaining the original positions, the function constructs the shuffled sequence by appending characters from the original sequence to the result string `ans`.
4. However, there is a logical error in the code. The dictionary `d` is sorted and then immediately cleared using `d.pop(n)` and `d.clear()`, which means the dictionary becomes empty before the loop that constructs the result string `ans` runs. This results in `ans` being an empty string.
5. The intended behavior should be to keep the dictionary intact and use it to construct the shuffled sequence.

Given the above reasoning, the provided code does not correctly implement the balanced shuffle operation as described.

Correctness: **False**
