Output State: **The dictionary `d` is sorted by its values, the variable `i` is equal to `n-1`, the string `s` remains unchanged, and `ans` remains an empty string.**

The code sorts the dictionary `d` by its values using the `sorted()` function with a lambda function as the key. This does not affect the values of `i`, `s`, or `ans`.
