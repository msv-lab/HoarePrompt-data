Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing multiple test cases where each test case includes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5). For each test case, it processes `t` and `n` and returns different outputs based on the values of `t` and `n`.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing two integers `t` and `n`. It processes these integers according to some unspecified logic and returns different outputs for each test case based on the values of `t` and `n`.
