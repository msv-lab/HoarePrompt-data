Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for x in str(i):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `x` and `i`.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `sum_value_digits` is 0.
   - `values[1]` is equal to `values[0] + 0`.
   - `sum_value_digits` is 0.

3. **Understand the loop execution**:
   - The loop iterates over each character in the string representation of `i`.
   - In the previous iteration, `i` was 1, so `str(i)` is "1".
   - The loop would have processed the first character '1'.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is 1 and the loop processes each character in `str(i)`, the next character to process is the second character, which does not exist in the string "1". Therefore, the loop will not execute again.
   - However, if we assume the loop needs to continue for demonstration purposes, the next value of `i` should be such that it generates a string with more characters.

Given the current state and the loop structure, no further adjustments are needed because the loop will not execute again with the current value of `i`.

**Final Answer**:
Since the loop will not execute again with the current value of `i`, the states remain unchanged.

State: **`i` is 1, `sum_value_digits` is 0, `values[1]` is equal to `values[0] + 0`, `sum_value_digits` is 0**
