Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for x in str(i):`. This means the loop iterates over each character in the string representation of `i`.

2. **Determine the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `i` must be a non-empty string.
   - `sum_value_digits` is the sum of digits of `i` converted to integers.

3. **Understand the Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute one more time, the string `i` must still be non-empty. If `i` becomes an empty string, the loop will terminate.

4. **Adjust the State**: Since the loop iterates over each character in `str(i)`, the variable `i` must still be a non-empty string for the loop to continue. The value of `sum_value_digits` does not change within the loop based on the current information, so it remains the same.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is:
- `i` must be a non-empty string (since if it were empty, the loop would terminate).
- `sum_value_digits` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` must be a non-empty string, `sum_value_digits` is the sum of digits of `i` converted to integers**
