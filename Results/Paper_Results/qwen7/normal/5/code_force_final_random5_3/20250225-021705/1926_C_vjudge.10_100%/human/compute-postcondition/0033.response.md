Output State: `i` is 3, `sum_value_digits` is 6, `values[1]` is equal to `values[0] + 0`.

Explanation: The loop increments `i` by 1 at the start of each iteration. After 3 iterations, `i` will be 3. The variable `sum_value_digits` accumulates the sum of digits of `i`. Starting from `i` being 1, the sums after each iteration are as follows:
- After 1st iteration: `sum_value_digits` is 0 (from 1)
- After 2nd iteration: `sum_value_digits` is 1 (from 2, 2 -> 2)
- After 3rd iteration: `sum_value_digits` is 3 (from 3, 3 -> 3)

For the 4th iteration:
- `i` becomes 4, and the sum of its digits (4) is added to `sum_value_digits`.
- Therefore, `sum_value_digits` becomes 3 + 4 = 7.

Thus, after all iterations, `i` is 3, `sum_value_digits` is 6, and `values[1]` remains `values[0] + 0` as it was not affected by the loop.
