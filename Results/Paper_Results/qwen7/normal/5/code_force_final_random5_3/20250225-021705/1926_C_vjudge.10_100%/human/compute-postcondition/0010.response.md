Output State: **`sum_value_digits` is increased by 4, `i` remains unchanged**

Explanation: The code `sum_value_digits += int(x)` increases the value of `sum_value_digits` by the integer value of `x`. Given that `sum_value_digits` was initially increased by 2, it now gets increased by the integer value of `x`. Since `i` remains unchanged, its state is still as per the initial state.
