Output State: **`i` is an empty string, `sum_value_digits` is the sum of digits of the original `i` (converted to integers), and `values[i]` is equal to `values[i - 1] + sum_value_digits`.**

Explanation: The code updates the `values` list such that the element at index `i` is the sum of the previous element at index `i-1` and the `sum_value_digits`, which is the sum of the digits of the original `i` (converted to integers). The values of `i` and `sum_value_digits` remain unchanged from their initial state, but the `values` list is updated accordingly.
