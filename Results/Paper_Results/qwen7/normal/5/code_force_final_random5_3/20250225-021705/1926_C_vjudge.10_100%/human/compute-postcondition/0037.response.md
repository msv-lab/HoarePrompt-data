Output State: The final state of the `values` list will be such that each index `i` from 1 to 200000 will hold the sum of the digit sums from 1 to `i`. In other words, `values[i]` will store the cumulative sum of the digit sums of all integers from 1 to `i`.

To explain further, for each integer `i` from 1 to 200000, the loop calculates the sum of its digits (`sum_value_digits`) and updates `values[i]` to be the previous value of `values[i-1]` plus `sum_value_digits`. This process continues until the loop has iterated through all possible values up to 200000. Thus, `values[i]` accumulates the total sum of the digit sums from 1 to `i` for every `i` in the range from 1 to 200000.
