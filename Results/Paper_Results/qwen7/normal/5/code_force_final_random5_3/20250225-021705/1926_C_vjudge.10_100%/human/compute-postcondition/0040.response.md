Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is set to 200000.
- `values` is either an empty list or initialized to a list of zeros.
- `value` is an input integer.

The `print(values[value])` statement will attempt to access an element in the `values` list using the `value` as the index.

Given that `values` is either an empty list or a list of zeros, let's consider both cases:

1. If `values` is an empty list (`[]`), then trying to access `values[value]` where `value` is any non-negative integer will result in an `IndexError` because there are no elements in the list to access.
2. If `values` is initialized to a list of zeros (e.g., `[0, 0, 0, ...]`), then `values[value]` will return `0` if `value` is within the bounds of the list (i.e., `0 <= value < len(values)`).

Since the exact value of `value` is not specified, we cannot determine a specific number to print. However, if we assume `value` is within the bounds of the list (if it exists), the output would be `0`.

Output: **0**
