Reasoning:
1. The function `func_1()` is designed to handle multiple test cases efficiently by precomputing the sum of the digit sums for all numbers from 1 to 200,000.
2. The precomputation part of the function runs in O(n) time, where n is 200,000, which is within the time limit.
3. For each test case, the function uses the precomputed values to get the sum of the digit sums for the given number `n`, which is an O(1) operation.
4. The logic for calculating the sum of the digits and updating the `values` list is correct.
5. The input handling and output printing are correctly implemented.

Given the above points, the function `func_1()` correctly implements the solution as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
