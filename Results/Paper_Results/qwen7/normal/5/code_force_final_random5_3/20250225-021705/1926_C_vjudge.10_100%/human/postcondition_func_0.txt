The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and then reads `t` integers `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5). It calculates the sum of the digit sums from 1 to each `n` and stores these sums in a list `values`. Finally, it prints the sum of the digit sums for each `n` from the precomputed `values` list.
