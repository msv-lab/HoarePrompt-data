Reasoning:
1. The program correctly initializes a large enough array `values` to store the cumulative sum of digit sums from 1 to 200,000.
2. It populates the `values` array by iterating through all integers from 1 to 200,000 and calculating the sum of their digits, updating the cumulative sum accordingly.
3. For each test case, it reads the input `n`, and uses the precomputed `values` array to directly retrieve the sum of digit sums from 1 to `n`.
4. The logic for calculating the sum of digits and updating the `values` array is correct.
5. The program handles multiple test cases efficiently by leveraging the precomputed values.

Given the above points, the program appears to be correct and should produce the expected results based on the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
