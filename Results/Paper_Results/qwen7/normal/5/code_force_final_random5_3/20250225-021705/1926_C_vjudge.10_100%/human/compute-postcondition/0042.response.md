Output State: **`t` is 199999, `values` is an empty list or initialized to a list of zeros, `value` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `value`. The initial values of `t` and `values` remain unchanged. The variable `value` now holds the integer input from the user.
