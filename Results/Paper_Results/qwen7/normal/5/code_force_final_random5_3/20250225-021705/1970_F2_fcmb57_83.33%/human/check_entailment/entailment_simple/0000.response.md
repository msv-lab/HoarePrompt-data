Reasoning:
1. **Initialization and Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly initializes the field dimensions \(N\) and \(M\).
   - It parses the field and correctly identifies players, goals, and the initial position of the Quaffle.
   - The program correctly handles the initial state of the Bludger if present.

2. **Movement and Action Handling**:
   - The program correctly updates the positions of players and the Quaffle based on the movements specified.
   - It correctly handles the elimination of players when they collide with a Bludger.
   - The program correctly updates the Quaffle's position when a player catches it or throws it.
   - The scoring logic is implemented correctly, updating the score and printing the appropriate messages.

3. **Final Score Calculation**:
   - The program correctly calculates the final score at the end of the game and prints it in the required format.

4. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly computes the new position of a player based on the direction of movement.
   - It returns a tuple representing the new coordinates, which is used correctly in the main program.

Given that the program correctly handles all aspects of the problem statement, including parsing the input, updating the state of the game, handling player movements and actions, and calculating the final score, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
