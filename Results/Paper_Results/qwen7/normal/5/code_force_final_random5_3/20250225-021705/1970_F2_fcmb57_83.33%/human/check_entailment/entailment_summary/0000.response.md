Reasoning:
- The program correctly parses the initial state of the field, including players, goals, and the Quaffle's position.
- The program handles the movements of players and the Bludger correctly using the `func_1` function, which adds the movement vector to the player's current position.
- The program correctly updates the Quaffle's position when a player catches or throws it.
- The program checks for scoring conditions and prints the appropriate messages when a team scores.
- The program correctly handles player elimination when a player is hit by a Bludger.
- The program prints the final score at the end of the game.
- The logic for handling player elimination and scoring appears to be implemented correctly according to the problem statement.

Given the execution summary, the program seems to follow the problem description accurately and handles all the necessary actions and conditions as specified.

Correctness: **True**
