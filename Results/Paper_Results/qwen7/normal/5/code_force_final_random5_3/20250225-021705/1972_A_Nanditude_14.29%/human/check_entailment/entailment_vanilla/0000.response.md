Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading and Initialization**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of problems `n`, the array `a` of existing problem difficulties, and the array `b` of expected difficulties.
   
2. **Main Logic**:
   - The program uses two pointers `i` and `j` to traverse arrays `a` and `b` respectively.
   - It iterates through the arrays, comparing elements `a[i]` and `b[j]`.
   - If `b[j] < a[i]`, it means the current problem in `a` is more difficult than expected. In this case, the program removes the last element of `a` and inserts `b[j]` at the position where `a` was sorted. This simulates the process of proposing a new problem and sorting the array again.
   - The counter `cnt` is incremented each time a new problem is proposed.
   - Both pointers `i` and `j` are incremented to move to the next elements in their respective arrays.

3. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The problem specifies that both `a` and `b` are initially sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - The program does not need to handle any additional edge cases beyond those specified in the problem statement.

4. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is defined but not used in the main logic of the program. It sorts the input array in reverse order, which is irrelevant to the problem requirements.

### Correctness Check:

- The logic for proposing new problems and updating the array `a` is correct according to the problem description.
- The use of two pointers to traverse and compare the arrays is appropriate.
- The incrementation of the counter `cnt` whenever a new problem is proposed is accurate.

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **True**
