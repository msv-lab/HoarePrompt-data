You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A contest contains n problems and the difficulty of the i -th problem is
expected to be at most b_i . There are already n problem proposals and the
difficulty of the i -th problem is a_i . Initially, both a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
and b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n are sorted in non-decreasing order.

Some of the problems may be more difficult than expected, so the writers must
propose more problems. When a new problem with difficulty w is proposed, the
most difficult problem will be deleted from the contest, and the problems will
be sorted in a way that the difficulties are non-decreasing.

In other words, in each operation, you choose an integer w , insert it into
the array a , sort array a in non-decreasing order, and remove the last
element from it.

Find the minimum number of new problems to make a_i\le b_i for all i .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of problems.

The second line of each test case contains an array a of length n (1\le a_1\le
a_2\le\cdots\le a_n\le 10^9 ).

The third line of each test case contains an array b of length n (1\le b_1\le
b_2\le\cdots\le b_n\le 10^9 ).

Output

For each test case, print an integer as your answer in a new line.

Note

In the first test case:

  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=800 and a becomes [800,1000,1400,2000,2000,2200] . 
  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=1800 and a becomes [800,1000,1400,1800,2000,2000] . 

It can be proved that it's impossible to reach the goal by proposing fewer new
problems.

In the second test case:

  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=1 and a becomes [1,4,5,6,7,8] . 
  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=2 and a becomes [1,2,4,5,6,7] . 
  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=3 and a becomes [1,2,3,4,5,6] . 

It can be proved that it's impossible to reach the goal by proposing fewer new
problems.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of two lists, where the first list contains n non-decreasing integers representing the difficulties of the initial problems (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n), and the second list contains n non-decreasing integers representing the expected maximum difficulties (b_1, b_2, ..., b_n), with 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(arr):
    return sorted(arr, reverse=True)
    #The program returns a list of two lists, where the first list contains the difficulties of the initial problems in non-increasing order, and the second list contains the expected maximum difficulties in non-increasing order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of two lists, where the first list contains non-decreasing integers representing the difficulties of the initial problems, and the second list contains non-decreasing integers representing the expected maximum difficulties. After sorting both lists in non-increasing order, it returns a new list of two lists with the same structure.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program attempts to sort the array `a` in reverse and then pop the last element, which is not relevant to the problem's requirements. Additionally, the logic for inserting elements into `a` and sorting it is flawed.

Here’s a detailed explanation of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Insertion and Sorting**: The program tries to sort `a` in reverse and then pops the last element, which does not align with the requirement to insert a new problem difficulty `w` and then sort `a` in non-decreasing order before removing the last element.

2. **Incorrect Condition Handling**: The condition `if b[j] < a[i]:` is not sufficient to ensure that `a_i \leq b_i` for all `i`. This condition only checks if the current element in `b` is less than the current element in `a`, but it does not correctly handle the insertion of new elements and subsequent sorting.

3. **Example Case Where the Program Fails**:
   - Consider the following input:
     ```
     2
     6
     1000 1400 2000 2000 2200 2700
     800 1200 1500 1800 2200 3000
     6
     4 5 6 7 8 9
     1 2 3 4 5 6
     ```
   - For the first test case, the program fails to correctly insert and sort the elements. It should propose problems with difficulties 800 and 1800, but the current logic does not handle this correctly.

To fix the program, you would need to:
- Insert a new problem difficulty `w` that is just greater than the current maximum difficulty in `a`.
- Sort the array `a` in non-decreasing order after insertion.
- Remove the last element from the sorted array.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = 0
    i = 0
    j = 0
    while i < n and j < n:
        if b[j] < a[i]:
            max_a = max(a)
            w = max_a + 1
            a.append(w)
            a.sort()
            a.pop()
            cnt += 1
            j += 1
        else:
            i += 1
            j += 1
    print(cnt)
```

This corrected version ensures that the program correctly handles the insertion and sorting of new problem difficulties.
