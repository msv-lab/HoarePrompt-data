Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `n` is the first integer from the input split by space, `k` is the second integer from the input split by space.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes a line of input, splits it into two integers separated by a space, and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged.
