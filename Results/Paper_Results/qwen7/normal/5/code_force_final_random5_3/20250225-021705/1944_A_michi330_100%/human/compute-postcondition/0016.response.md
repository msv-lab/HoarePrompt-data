Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `n` is converted to an integer from the first input, `k` is converted to an integer from the second input**.

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input separated by a space, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. The initial values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged.
