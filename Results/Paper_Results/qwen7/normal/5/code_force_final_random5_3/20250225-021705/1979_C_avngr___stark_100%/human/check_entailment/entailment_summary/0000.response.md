Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze whether the provided code meets the requirements specified in the problem statement. Let's break down the logic and verify each part of the code against the problem description.

### Problem Description Breakdown:
1. **Input Handling**: The program should handle multiple test cases, each with a number of outcomes \( n \) and multipliers \( k_i \).
2. **Bet Calculation**: For each test case, the program needs to calculate the bets \( x_i \) such that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome.
3. **Output**: If a solution exists, the program should output the bets; otherwise, it should output -1.

### Code Analysis:
1. **Reading Input**:
   ```python
   t = int(input())
   for _ in range(t):
       n = int(input())
       k = list(map(int, input().split()))
   ```
   This part correctly reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads the number of outcomes and the multipliers.

2. **Calling `func_2`**:
   ```python
   m = func_2(k)
   ```
   Here, `m` is calculated using the `func_2` function, which computes the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers \( k_i \).

3. **Calculating Bets**:
   ```python
   c = []
   for i in range(n):
       c.append(m // k[i])
   ```
   The bets \( x_i \) are calculated as \( \frac{m}{k_i} \). This ensures that the total bet is \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{m}{k_i} \).

4. **Checking and Printing Results**:
   ```python
   if sum(c) >= m:
       print(-1)
       continue
   for i in range(n):
       print(c[i], end=' ')
   print('\n', end='')
   ```
   - If the total bet is not less than \( m \), the program prints -1.
   - Otherwise, it prints the calculated bets.

### Verification Against Problem Requirements:
- **Correctness of LCM Calculation**: The `func_2` function correctly calculates the LCM of the multipliers using the `func_1` function, which computes the product of two numbers divided by their GCD.
- **Bet Calculation**: The bets are calculated as \( \frac{m}{k_i} \), ensuring that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome.
- **Handling Edge Cases**: The code handles the case where the total bet is not less than \( m \) by printing -1, which is correct according to the problem statement.

Given that the code correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem and meets all the specified conditions, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
