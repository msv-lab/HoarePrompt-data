Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires distributing coins among \(n\) outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome. Each outcome has a multiplier \(k_i\), and the goal is to find a distribution of bets \(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\) such that:
\[ \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \cdot x_i \quad \text{for all } i \]

### Given Functions
1. **func_1(a, b)**: This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers using the formula:
   \[
   \text{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{|a \cdot b|}{\text{GCD}(a, b)}
   \]
2. **func_2(numbers)**: This function calculates the LCM of a list of numbers. It iteratively applies `func_1` to compute the LCM of the entire list.

### Program Logic
The program does not directly solve the problem as described. Instead, it focuses on computing the LCM of the multipliers \(k_i\). However, the LCM calculation alone does not help in determining the distribution of bets \(x_i\).

### Correctness Check
To correctly solve the problem, we need to ensure that for each outcome \(i\), the total bet \( \sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j \) is strictly less than \( k_i \cdot x_i \). Hereâ€™s a more appropriate approach:

1. Compute the LCM of all multipliers.
2. Distribute the total bet such that the condition is satisfied for each outcome.

However, the provided functions do not address the actual distribution logic required to meet the problem constraints.

### Conclusion
Given that the provided functions only compute the LCM and do not implement the necessary logic to distribute the bets correctly, the program is not solving the problem as specified.

**Correctness: False**
