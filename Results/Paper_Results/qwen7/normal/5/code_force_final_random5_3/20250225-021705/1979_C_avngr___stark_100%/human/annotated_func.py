#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers such that 2 ≤ a, b ≤ 20.
def func_1(a, b):
    return abs(a * b) // gcd(a, b)
    #The program returns the absolute value of the product of a and b divided by their greatest common divisor (gcd), where 2 ≤ a, b ≤ 20.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters, `a` and `b`, both within the range of 2 to 20 inclusive. It calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `a` and `b`, then computes the absolute value of their product divided by this gcd. The function returns this computed value.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of integers where each integer represents the multiplier \(k_i\) for the i-th outcome, and the length of the list is \(n\) (1 ≤ n ≤ 50). Each \(k_i\) satisfies 2 ≤ \(k_i\) ≤ 20.
def func_2(numbers):
    result = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        result = func_1(result, num)
        
    #State: Output State: The final value of `result` is equal to `func_1(func_1(func_1(result, numbers[1]), numbers[2]), numbers[3])`.
    #
    #In natural language: After all the iterations of the loop have finished, the value of `result` will be the result of applying the function `func_1` successively to the initial `result` and each element of the `numbers` list starting from the second element. This means `result` will be transformed as follows: first with `numbers[1]`, then with `numbers[2]`, and finally with `numbers[3]` if the list has at least four elements.
    return result
    #The program returns the value of `result` after applying `func_1` three times successively to `result`, `numbers[1]`, `numbers[2]`, and `numbers[3]` if they exist.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `numbers` where each integer represents a multiplier \(k_i\) for the i-th outcome, and the length of the list is between 1 and 50, inclusive. Each \(k_i\) satisfies 2 ≤ \(k_i\) ≤ 20. It initializes the variable `result` with the first element of the list and then applies the function `func_1` successively to `result` and each subsequent element of the list up to the third element if they exist. Finally, it returns the updated value of `result`.
