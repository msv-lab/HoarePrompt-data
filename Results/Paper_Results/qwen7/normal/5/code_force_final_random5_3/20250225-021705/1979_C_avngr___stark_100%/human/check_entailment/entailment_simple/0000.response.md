Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires distributing coins among different outcomes such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome. The solution involves finding a common value that can be used as the bet for each outcome, which is derived through the `func_1` and `func_2` functions.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1(a, b)`**: This function calculates the absolute value of the product of `a` and `b` divided by their greatest common divisor (GCD). Given the constraints \(2 \leq a, b \leq 20\), this function will always return an integer between 2 and 20.
   - **`func_2(numbers)`**: This function applies `func_1` successively to all elements of the list `numbers`. It starts with the first element and applies `func_1` with the next element, then continues this process until all elements have been processed. The result is the cumulative effect of applying `func_1` to all pairs of consecutive elements in the list.

3. **Solution Logic**:
   - The program computes the result of `func_2(k)` for each test case, where `k` is the list of multipliers for the outcomes.
   - It then checks if the sum of the bets (each being `m // k[i]`) is less than `m`. If it is, it prints the distribution of bets; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in `func_1` ensures that the result is always within the range [2, 20] due to the constraints on `a` and `b`.
   - `func_2` correctly applies `func_1` to all elements in the list, ensuring the cumulative effect is calculated properly.
   - The main loop correctly checks if the sum of the bets is less than `m` and prints the appropriate output.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the required logic to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
