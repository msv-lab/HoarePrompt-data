Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to distribute coins among different outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount of coins received back for any winning outcome. The key is to find a distribution that meets this condition.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1(a, b)`**: This function calculates the absolute value of the product of `a` and `b` divided by their greatest common divisor (gcd). Given the constraints (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 20), this function effectively finds a common base value that can be used to scale the bets.
   - **`func_2(numbers)`**: This function iteratively applies `func_1` to all elements in the list `numbers`. It starts with the first element and successively applies `func_1` to the result and each subsequent element. This results in a single integer that represents a scaled version of the product of all multipliers in the list.

3. **Main Program Logic**:
   - For each test case, the program reads the number of outcomes `n` and the multipliers `k_i`.
   - It then calls `func_2(k)` to get a scaled value `m`.
   - It creates a list `c` where each element is `m // k[i]`.
   - It checks if the sum of `c` is less than or equal to `m`. If true, it prints `-1` because it's impossible to satisfy the condition. Otherwise, it prints the values in `c`.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in the main program correctly implements the requirement that the total bet should be less than the amount received for any winning outcome.
   - The use of `func_2` ensures that the scaled value `m` is appropriately calculated based on the multipliers.
   - The division and comparison steps ensure that the conditions are met or not met as required.

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
