Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `numbers`, which is a list of integers. Each integer in the list represents a multiplier \(k_i\) for the i-th outcome, and the length of the list is between 1 and 50, inclusive. Each \(k_i\) satisfies 2 ≤ \(k_i\) ≤ 20. After applying `func_1` three times successively to `result`, `numbers[1]`, `numbers[2]`, and `numbers[3]` if they exist, the function returns the value of `result`.**
