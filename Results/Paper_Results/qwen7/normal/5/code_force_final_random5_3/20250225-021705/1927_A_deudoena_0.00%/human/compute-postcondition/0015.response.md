Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `(i, j) in enumerate(inpstr)`. This means the loop variables are `i` and `j`.

2. **Understand the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `j` is the next character in `inpstr`.
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
   - `ind1` is now equal to `i`.
   - If `j` is 'B', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

3. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than the length of `inpstr`.
   - `j` should be the next character in `inpstr`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, `i` will be `i + 1` at the start of the next iteration.
   - `j` will be the next character in `inpstr` at the start of the next iteration.
   - `ind1` will be updated to the new value of `i` at the start of the next iteration.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `j` will be the next character in `inpstr`.
   - `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - `ind1` will be `i + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`j` is the next character in `inpstr`, `i` is `i + 1`, and `ind1` is `i + 1`**.
