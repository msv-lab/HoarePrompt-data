Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white. Specifically, it only considers the first and last occurrences of black cells, which does not guarantee the minimum segment length. For example, consider the input "BWWBW". The program would output 4, but the correct answer is 3, as painting the segment from the 2nd to the 4th cell would make all cells white.
