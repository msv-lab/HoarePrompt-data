Reasoning:
The provided function does not correctly solve the problem. The function attempts to find the first and last occurrences of 'B' in the string `inpstr` and calculates the length of the strip minus the sum of these indices. However, this approach does not always yield the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to find the longest sequence of consecutive 'W's (white cells) starting from the beginning and ending at the end of the string. The length of the strip minus the length of this longest sequence of 'W's will give us the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white.

Here's why the provided function is incorrect:
- The function only considers the first and last 'B' in the string, which may not represent the optimal segment to paint.
- For example, in the test case "WBBWBW", the function would calculate `len("WBBWBW") - ind2 - ind1` which is `6 - 1 - 2 = 3`. However, the correct answer should be 4, as painting the segment from the 2nd to the 5th cell (inclusive) makes all cells white.

Correctness: **False**
