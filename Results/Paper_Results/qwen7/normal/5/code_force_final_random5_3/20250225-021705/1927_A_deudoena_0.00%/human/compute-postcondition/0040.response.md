Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a test case defined by three variables: `t`, `n`, and `s`. `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10 inclusive, and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', with at least one 'B'. The function returns a specific value based on the conditions provided for `s`.**
