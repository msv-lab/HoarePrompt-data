Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', where at least one character in `s` is 'B'; `inpstr` is the input string from the user.**

Explanation: The code `inpstr = input()` reads a string from the user input and assigns it to the variable `inpstr`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and the condition that `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', where at least one character in `s` is 'B', is still valid.
