Output State: **`i` is 1, `ind2` is 1, and the last character of `inpstr` is 'B'**.

Explanation: The line `ind2 = i` assigns the current value of `i` (which is 1) to `ind2`. No other changes are made to the variables or the precondition. Therefore, `i` remains 1, `ind2` is set to 1, and the last character of `inpstr` remains 'B'.
