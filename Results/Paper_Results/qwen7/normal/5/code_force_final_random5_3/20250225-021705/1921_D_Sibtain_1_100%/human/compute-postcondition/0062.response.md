Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 1, `ans` is 0, `t1` is abs(`a[0]` - `c[0]`), `t2` is abs(`a[len(a) - 1]` - `c[len(c) - 1]`).**

Explanation: The code calculates `t2` as the absolute difference between the last elements of lists `a` and `c` (i.e., `a[len(a) - j]` and `c[len(c) - j]` where `j` is 1). Since `j` is 1, `t2` becomes `abs(a[len(a) - 1] - c[len(c) - 1])`. The values of `i`, `j`, `ans`, and `t1` remain unchanged from their initial states.
