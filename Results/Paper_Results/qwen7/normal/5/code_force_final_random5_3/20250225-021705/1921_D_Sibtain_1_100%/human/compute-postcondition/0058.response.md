Postcondition: **`n` is decremented by 1, `m` is an input integer, `k` is equal to the length of list `a`, `a` is sorted in reverse order, `c` is a list of integers entered by the user and sorted in reverse order, `t1` is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]`, `t2` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `c[0]`, `ans` is the sum of all `max(t1, t2)` values calculated during each iteration of the loop, `i` and `j` are both equal to the length of list `a`, the sets of `a` and `c` contain only one unique element and the first elements of `a` and `c` are equal. Since the length of list `a` is 1, the loop does not execute, and `ans` remains unchanged.**
