Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n and m are integers satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5. a_i and b_i are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9 for all i.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    c = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if len(set(a)) == 1 and len(set(c)) == 1 and a[0] == c[0]:
        print(0)
        continue
    a.sort()
    c.sort(reverse=True)
    if len(a) == 1:
        print(max(abs(a[0] - max(c)), abs(a[0] - min(c))))
        continue
    i, j, ans = 0, 1, 0
    for k in range(len(a)):
        t1 = abs(a[i] - c[i])
        t2 = abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])
        if t2 > t1:
            j += 1
        else:
            i += 1
        ans += max(t1, t2)
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `k` is equal to the length of list `a`, `len(a)` remains 1, `t1` is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]`, `t2` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `c[0]`, `ans` is the sum of all `max(t1, t2)` values calculated during each iteration of the loop, `i` and `j` are both equal to the length of list `a`.

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `k` will be equal to the length of list `a`. The length of list `a` remains 1 throughout the loop. The variable `t1` will hold the final absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]`, and `t2` will hold the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `c[0]`. The variable `ans` will contain the cumulative sum of the maximum values between `t1` and `t2` for each iteration of the loop. Both `i` and `j` will be equal to the length of list `a` since they increment until they reach this value.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `ans` is the sum of `max(t1, t2)` for each iteration from 1 to the length of list `a`.

Explanation: After analyzing the provided information, it appears that the loop terminates when either `i` or `j` reaches the length of list `a`. The loop increments `i` or `j` based on the comparison of `t1` and `t2`, and updates `ans` with the maximum of `t1` and `t2` at each step. Given that the loop has executed up to the third iteration and `i` remains 1 while `j` is 2, we can infer that the loop will continue to increment `j` until `j` equals the length of `a`. Since `i` is already 1 and cannot be incremented further without exceeding the length of `a`, `i` will remain 1 throughout the loop's execution. Therefore, the final state will have `i` as 1, `j` equal to the length of `a`, and `ans` as the cumulative sum of `max(t1, t2)` for each iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `k` is equal to the length of list `a`, `ans` is the sum of `max(t1, t2)` for each iteration from 1 to the length of list `a`, `i` is adjusted based on the comparisons within the loop, `j` is also adjusted based on the comparisons, and `t1` and `t2` reflect the absolute differences calculated in the last iteration of the loop.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations:
- The variable `k` will be equal to the length of the list `a`.
- The variable `ans` will hold the cumulative sum of the maximum of `t1` and `t2` for each iteration.
- The variable `i` will be adjusted based on the comparisons made during the loop, potentially pointing to the last element of the list `a` or a position influenced by the loop's conditions.
- The variable `j` will similarly be adjusted based on the loop's conditions, likely pointing to a position influenced by the comparisons.
- The variables `t1` and `t2` will contain the absolute differences calculated in the final iteration of the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
