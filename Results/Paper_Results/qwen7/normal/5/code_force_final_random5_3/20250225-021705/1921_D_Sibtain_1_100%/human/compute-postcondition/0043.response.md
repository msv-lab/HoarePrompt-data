Output State: `k` is equal to the length of list `a`, `len(a)` remains 1, `t1` is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]`, `t2` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `c[0]`, `ans` is the sum of `max(t1, t2)` for each iteration of the loop, `j` is equal to the length of list `c` plus 1, `i` is equal to the length of list `a`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `k` will be equal to the length of list `a`. Since the list `a` has only one element, `len(a)` remains 1. The variable `t1` will hold the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]`, which is the same as `a[0] - c[0]` because both `i` and `j` will eventually reach their maximum possible values within the constraints of the lists' lengths. The variable `t2` will always be `abs(a[0] - c[0])` since `a` and `c` are single-element lists. The variable `ans` accumulates the maximum value between `t1` and `t2` for each iteration, resulting in the total sum of these maximum values. The variable `j` will be incremented until it reaches the length of `c` plus 1 (since `c` is a descending list and `j` starts at 1), and `i` will be incremented similarly.
