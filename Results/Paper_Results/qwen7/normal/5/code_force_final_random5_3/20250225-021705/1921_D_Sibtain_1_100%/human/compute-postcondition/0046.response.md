Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variables involved in the loop head are the loop counter `_` and the input value from `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the Input Value**: Since the loop runs based on the input value, let's denote the input value as `n`. Therefore, the loop will run `n` times.

3. **Initial State Analysis**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is given as follows:
   - `k` is equal to the length of list `a`, which is 1.
   - `len(a)` remains 1.
   - `t1` is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]`.
   - `t2` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `c[0]`.
   - `ans` is the sum of all `max(t1, t2)` values calculated during each iteration of the loop.
   - `i` and `j` are both equal to the length of list `a`, which is 1.

4. **Next Iteration Analysis**: For the loop to execute one more time, the loop counter `_` must be incremented. The input value `n` will be decremented by 1 because the loop runs for `n` times initially and then decreases by 1 for each iteration.

5. **Adjusting States**:
   - The loop counter `_` will be incremented by 1.
   - The input value `n` will be decremented by 1.
   - The other variables (`k`, `len(a)`, `t1`, `t2`, `ans`, `i`, and `j`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- The loop counter `_` is incremented by 1.
- The input value `n` is decremented by 1.

Since the initial state does not provide an explicit value for `n`, we can infer that `n` is the number of iterations the loop will run. After the first iteration, `n` will be reduced by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`k` is equal to the length of list `a`, `len(a)` remains 1, `t1` is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]`, `t2` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `c[0]`, `ans` is the sum of all `max(t1, t2)` values calculated during each iteration of the loop, `i` and `j` are both equal to the length of list `a`, and `n` is decremented by 1.**

To represent it clearly:

State: **`k` is equal to the length of list `a`, `len(a)` remains 1, `t1` is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]`, `t2` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `c[0]`, `ans` is the sum of all `max(t1, t2)` values calculated during each iteration of the loop, `i` and `j` are both equal to the length of list `a`, and `n` is decremented by 1.**
