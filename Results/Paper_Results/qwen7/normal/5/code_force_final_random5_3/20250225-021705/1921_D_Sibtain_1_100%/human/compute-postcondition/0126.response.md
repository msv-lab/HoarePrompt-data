Output State: **`k` is 2, `ans` is increased by the maximum of `t1` and `t2`, `j` is increased by 1 if `t2` is greater than `t1`, `t1` is `abs(a[i] - c[i])`, `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j)]`, `i` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. All other variables (`k`, `ans`, `t1`, `t2`, `j`) remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
