Output State: **`k` is 0, `len(a)` is 1, `t1` is abs(a[0] - c[0]), `t2` is less than or equal to abs(a[0] - c[0]); variable `i` is increased by 1.**

The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Since `i` was not previously defined, it is assumed to be 0 initially (based on common programming practices). After executing the code, `i` becomes 1. All other variables (`k`, `len(a)`, `t1`, and `t2`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
