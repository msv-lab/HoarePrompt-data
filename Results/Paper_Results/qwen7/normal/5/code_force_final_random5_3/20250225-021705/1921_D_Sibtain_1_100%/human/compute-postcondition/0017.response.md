Output State: **`k` is 0, `len(a)` is 1, `t1` is abs(a[i] - c[i])**.

The code calculates the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]` and assigns it to `t1`. However, since the indices `i` and the values of `a` and `c` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `t1`. But we know that `t1` is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]`. The values of `k` and `len(a)` remain unchanged from their initial states.
