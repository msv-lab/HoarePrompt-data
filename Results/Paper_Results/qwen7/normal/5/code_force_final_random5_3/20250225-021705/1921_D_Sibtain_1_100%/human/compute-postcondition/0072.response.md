Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 1, `ans` is `ans + max(abs(a[1] - c[1]), t2)`, `t1` is `abs(a[1] - c[1])`, `t2` retains its initial value, `k` is 2**

Explanation: The code calculates `t1` as the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]`, which are `a[1]` and `c[1]` respectively. Since `i` and `j` are both 1, they remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is updated to include the maximum of `t1` (which is now `abs(a[1] - c[1])`) and `t2`. `t2` and `k` retain their initial values.
