Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 100, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `c` is a list of integers obtained from the input using `map(int, input().split())**.

Explanation: The code `c = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes user input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores the resulting list in `c`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
