Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 3, `ans` is `ans + max(abs(a[1] - c[1]), t2)`, `t1` is `abs(a[1] - c[1])`, `t2` is `abs(a[-1] - c[-1])`, `k` is 2**

Explanation: The code `j += 1` increments the value of `j` by 1. Initially, `j` is 2, so after executing the code, `j` becomes 3. The other variables (`i`, `ans`, `t1`, `t2`, and `k`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
