Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each containing integers n and m, along with two lists a and c. It first checks if the values in lists a and c are identical and constant across all elements. If so, it prints 0 and continues to the next test case. Otherwise, it sorts list a in ascending order and list c in descending order. For each test case, it calculates the cumulative sum of the maximum absolute differences between corresponding elements of the sorted lists a and c, printing the result.**
