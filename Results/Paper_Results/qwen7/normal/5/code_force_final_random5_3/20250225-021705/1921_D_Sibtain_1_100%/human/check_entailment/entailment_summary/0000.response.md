Reasoning:
1. The program correctly handles the scenario where both arrays `a` and `c` contain identical values across all elements. In such cases, it prints `0`, which aligns with the problem statement.
2. The program sorts array `a` in ascending order and array `c` in descending order. This approach aims to maximize the differences between corresponding elements of the two arrays.
3. The logic for calculating the cumulative sum of the maximum absolute differences between corresponding elements of the sorted arrays `a` and `c` appears to be correct. It iterates through the arrays, comparing elements from the start of `a` with the end of `c` and vice versa, ensuring that the differences are maximized.
4. The program handles the edge case where the length of `a` is 1, calculating the difference between the single element of `a` and the maximum and minimum elements of `c`.
5. The overall structure and logic of the program seem to align with the requirements of the problem statement.

Given these points, the program should correctly compute the maximum total difference \(D\) for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
