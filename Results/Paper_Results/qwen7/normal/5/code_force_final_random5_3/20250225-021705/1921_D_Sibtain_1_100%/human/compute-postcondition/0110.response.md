Output State: **`k` is 0, `t1` is abs(a[i] - c[i]), `t2` is abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j]), `t2` is less than or equal to `t1`, `i` is increased by 1.**

The value of `i` is incremented by 1, while the values of `k`, `t1`, `t2`, `a[i]`, `c[i]`, `a[len(a) - j]`, and `c[len(c) - j]` remain unchanged from their initial states.
