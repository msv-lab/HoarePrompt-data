Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 1, `ans` is `ans + max(t1, t2)`, `t1` retains its initial value, `t2` retains its initial value**.

Explanation: The code updates `ans` by adding the maximum of `t1` and `t2` to it. The values of `i`, `j`, `t1`, and `t2` remain unchanged from their initial values as per the precondition.
