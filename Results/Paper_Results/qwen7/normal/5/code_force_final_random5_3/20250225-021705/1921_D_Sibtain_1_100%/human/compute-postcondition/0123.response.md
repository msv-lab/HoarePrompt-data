Output State: **`k` is 2, `ans` is increased by the maximum of `t1` and `t2`, `j` is increased by 1 if `t2` is greater than `t1`, `t1` is `abs(a[i] - c[i])`**.

Explanation: The code calculates `t1` as the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]`. This value is assigned to `t1`, but since the initial values of `a[i]` and `c[i]` are not provided, `t1` is expressed as `abs(a[i] - c[i])`. The values of `k`, `ans`, and `j` remain unchanged from their initial states.
