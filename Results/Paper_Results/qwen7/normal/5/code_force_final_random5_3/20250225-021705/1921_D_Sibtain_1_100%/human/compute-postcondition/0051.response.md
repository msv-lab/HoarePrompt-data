The code `continue` is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Since no specific changes are made to any variables within the loop, the values of the variables remain unchanged. The only change is that the loop will continue to the next iteration.

Output State: **`n` is decremented by 1, `m` is an input integer, `k` is equal to the length of list `a`, `len(a)` is the number of integers entered, `t1` is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]`, `t2` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `c[0]`, `ans` is the sum of all `max(t1, t2)` values calculated during each iteration of the loop, `i` and `j` are both equal to the length of list `a`, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `c` is a list of integers entered by the user. The loop continues to the next iteration.**
