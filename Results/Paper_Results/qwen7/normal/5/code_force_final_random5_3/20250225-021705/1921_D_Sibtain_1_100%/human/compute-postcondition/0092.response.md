Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 3, `ans` is the sum of `max(t1, t2)` for each iteration from 1 to the length of list `a` plus the max value for the current iteration (which is the fourth iteration), `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers created by mapping integers from input.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from the input and converts them into a list of integers. The values of `i`, `j`, `ans`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged from their initial states. The new variable `a` is created and populated with the integers from the input.
