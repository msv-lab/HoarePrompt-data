Output State: **`k` is 1, `len(a)` is 1, `t1` is `abs(a[i] - c[i])`, `t2` is `abs(a[0] - c[0])`, `ans` is `max(abs(a[i] - c[i]), abs(a[0] - c[0]))`, `j` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `j += 1` increments the value of `j` by 1. Since `j` was not previously defined in the initial state, its exact value before the increment is not specified. However, we know that `j` is now one more than whatever its previous value was. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
