Output State: **`i` is 2, `mid` is at least 2, `leftOne` is `leftOne` + 2.**

Explanation: The variable `tleftOne` is updated by adding 1 to its current value. Initially, `leftOne` was `leftOne` + 1, so after the increment, `tleftOne` becomes `leftOne` + 2. The values of `i` and `mid` remain unchanged.
