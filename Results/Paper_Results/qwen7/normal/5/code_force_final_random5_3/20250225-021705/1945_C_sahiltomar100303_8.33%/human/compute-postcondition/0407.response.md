Output State: `left` is `0`, `leftZero` is either `0` or `n//2` (depending on the number of zeros encountered), `rightOne` is either `n//2` or `n//2 + 1` (depending on the number of ones encountered), `rightZero` is `n - leftZero`, and `leftOne` is `n - rightOne`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `left` will be reduced to `0` because the loop continues as long as `left > 0`. The values of `leftZero` and `rightZero` will adjust based on the count of zeros encountered from the right side of the string. Similarly, `leftOne` and `rightOne` will adjust based on the count of ones encountered. The exact values depend on the distribution of zeros and ones in the string `s` as the loop progresses.
