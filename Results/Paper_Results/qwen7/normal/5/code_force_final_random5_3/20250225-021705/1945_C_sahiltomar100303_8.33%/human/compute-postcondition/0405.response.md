Output State: **`left` is `left - 1`, `leftZero` is either `leftZero - 1` or remains the same, `rightOne` is either `rightOne + 1` or `rightOne + 2`, and `rightZero` is increased by 1 if `s[left] == '0'`, otherwise `leftOne` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `left -= 1` decrements the value of `left` by 1. The other variables (`leftZero`, `rightOne`, `rightZero`, `leftOne`) remain unchanged unless their conditions are met (e.g., `s[left - 1] == '0'` or `s[left] == '0'`). Therefore, the updated state reflects the decrement of `left` by 1, while the conditions for the other variables remain as described in the initial state.
