Postcondition: `left` and `rightZero` and `rightOne` are updated based on the character at index `left - 1` in the string `s`. If the character is '0', `leftZero` is `left - 1` and `rightZero` is increased by 1. If the character is not '0', `left` remains greater than 0 and equal to `left - 1`, and `rightOne` is increased by 1.
