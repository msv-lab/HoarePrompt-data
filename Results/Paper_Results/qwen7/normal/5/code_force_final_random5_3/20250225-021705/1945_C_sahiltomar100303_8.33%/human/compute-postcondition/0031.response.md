Output State: **`i` is 2, `mid` must be greater than 1, `leftZero` is 3, if `s[1]` is '0', then `leftZero` is increased by 2, otherwise `leftOne` is set to 2**

Explanation: The variable `leftZero` was initially increased by 2 based on the condition that `s[1]` is '0'. Now, `leftZero` is incremented by 1 again due to the line `leftZero += 1`. Since `s[1]` is not mentioned to change its value, we assume it remains '0' (as per the initial condition), making `leftZero` equal to 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
