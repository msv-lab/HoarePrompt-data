Output State: **`i` is `mid + 1`, `n` must be greater than `mid + 1`, `rightOne` is increased by 2.**

Explanation: The variable `trightOne` is updated by adding 1 to its current value. Since `trightOne` was previously increased by 1, it is now increased by 2 in total. The other variables (`i` and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
