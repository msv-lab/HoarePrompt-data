Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, `mid` must be greater than 1, `leftOne` is 3**

Explanation: The variable `tleftOne` is updated by adding 1 to its current value. Initially, `leftOne` is 2. After executing `tleftOne += 1`, `leftOne` becomes 3. The values of the other variables (`i`, `n`, and `mid`) remain unchanged.
