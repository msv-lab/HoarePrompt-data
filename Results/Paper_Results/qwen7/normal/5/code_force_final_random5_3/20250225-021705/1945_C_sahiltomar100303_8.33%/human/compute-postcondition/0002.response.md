Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\) and `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The value of `t` remains unchanged from its initial state, which is an input integer within the specified range.
