Output State: **`s` is a string, `i` is an index within the string `s` such that `i + 1 < n`, `rightZero` is increased by 1, and `rightOne` is increased by 2 if the character at index `i` is not '0'**

Explanation: The code `rightZero += 1` increments the value of `rightZero` by 1. The values of `s`, `i`, and `rightOne` remain unchanged from their initial state. If the character at index `i` in the string `s` is '0', `rightZero` would have been increased by 2 before this line of code, so now it is increased by 1 more. If the character is not '0', `rightOne` was increased by 2 before this line, and remains increased by 2.
