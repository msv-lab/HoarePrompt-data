Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, `mid` must be greater than 1, `leftZero` is increased by 1 (i.e., `leftZero` is now 2)**.

Explanation: The variable `tleftZero` is updated by adding 1 to its current value. Since `leftZero` was previously increased by 1, it is now increased by 1 again, making its new value 2. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
