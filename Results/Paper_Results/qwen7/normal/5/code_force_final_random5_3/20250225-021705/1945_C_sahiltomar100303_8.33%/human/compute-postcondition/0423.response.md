Output State: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is either 0 or n//2 + 1, `rightOne` is either n//2 or n//2 + 1, `rightZero` is n - leftZero, `leftOne` is n - rightOne, `right` is mid + 1, `tleftZero` is less than or equal to (mid + 1) // 2, `trightOne` is less than or equal to (n - mid - 1) // 2, and `trightZero` is `trightZero - 1`.**

The code `trightZero -= 1` decrements the value of `trightZero` by 1. Since `trightZero` was previously either less than or equal to `(n - mid - 1) // 2`, after decrementing, its value remains within the same constraints. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
