Output State: **`right` is incremented by 1 and is less than `n`, `tleftOne` is incremented by 1, and either `tleftZero` or `trightOne` must meet the condition `(tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2 or trightOne < (n - right + 1) // 2)`**.

This means that `right` has been incremented by 1 and is still less than `n`. Additionally, `tleftOne` has been incremented by 1. The condition involving `tleftZero` and `trightOne` remains unchanged.
