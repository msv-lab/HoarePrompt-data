Output State: **`s` is a string, `i` is an index within the string `s` such that `i + 1 < n`, `rightZero` is increased by 2 if the character at index `i` is '0', `rightOne` is increased by 3 if the character at index `i` is not '0', `trightOne` is increased by 1.**

The code `trightOne += 1` increments the value of `trightOne` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
