Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, `mid` must be greater than 1, `leftOne` is 2**

The code `leftOne += 1` increments the value of `leftOne` by 1. Given that `leftOne` was initially 1, after executing this line, `leftOne` becomes 2. The other variables (`i`, `n`, and `mid`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
