Output State: **`i` is initialized to `mid` and is less than `n`, and `s[i]` is not equal to '0'; `rightOne` is increased by 1.**

The code `rightOne += 1` increments the value of `rightOne` by 1. Since `i` is initialized to `mid` and is less than `n`, and `s[i]` is not equal to '0', these conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes that `rightOne` has been incremented by 1.
