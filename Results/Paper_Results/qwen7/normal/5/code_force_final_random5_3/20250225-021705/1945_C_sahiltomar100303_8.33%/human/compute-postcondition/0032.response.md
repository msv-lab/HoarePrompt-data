Output State: **`i` is 2, `mid` must be greater than 1, `leftZero` is 4, `tleftZero` is 1**.

Explanation: The code `tleftZero += 1` increments the value of `tleftZero` by 1. Since `tleftZero` was initially not specified, we assume it was 0 before this line of code. After the increment, `tleftZero` becomes 1. The other variables (`i`, `mid`, and `leftZero`) remain unchanged.
