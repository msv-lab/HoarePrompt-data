Postcondition: `left` is 0, `leftZero` is either 0 or `n//2`, `rightOne` is either `n//2` or `n//2 + 1`, `rightZero` is `n - leftZero`, `leftOne` is `n - rightOne`, `right` is `n`, `tleftZero` is less than or equal to `(n - 1) // 2`, `trightOne` is less than or equal to `(n - 1 - (n - 1) // 2) // 2`, and `trightZero` is `trightZero` (since `s[mid + 2]` was not '0' and thus did not change), and the current value of `right` is `n`.
